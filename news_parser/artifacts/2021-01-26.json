      "title": "British Asian celebrities unite for video to dispel Covid vaccine myths",
      "tags": "Comedy,Television,Coronavirus vaccines,Fake News,BAME communities,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Celebrities including comedians Romesh Ranganathan and Meera Syal and cricketer Moeen Ali have made a video urging people to get the Covid vaccine.\nThe video was co-ordinated by Citizen Khan creator Adil Ray, who said he wanted to dispel vaccination myths for those from ethnic minority communities.\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan and former Conservative Party Chairman Baroness Warsi are among the others taking part.\n\"We all just feel we needed to do something,\" Ray told the BBC.\nFake news about the vaccine, particularly in the South Asian community, has led to concerns about uptake.\nRay appears in the five-minute video alongside stars like former Coronation Street actress Shobna Gulati, who tells viewers: \"We will find our way through this. And we will be united once again with our friends and our families. All we have to do is take the vaccination.\"\nSomali-born British journalist Rageh Omaar and his ITV colleague Ranvir Singh join comedians like Sanjeev Bhaskar, Asim Chaudhry and Ranganathan to debunk common vaccine misinformation and misconceptions.\nRanganathan says: \"There's no chip or tracker in the vaccine to keep watching where you go. Your mobile phone actually does a much better job of that.\"\nAfter posting the video, Ray told BBC Radio Leicester: \"For the British Asian and black communities, at the very beginning of the pandemic we were told they were perhaps the most vulnerable, that there was a disproportionate number of cases and even deaths.\n\"Even now there are a disproportionate number of deaths. But nothing was really done about it and that was really quite confusing for a lot of the community. So we felt that we've got to try and take the lead a little bit here and dispel some of these myths.\"\nHe added: \"This was recorded entirely independently from the government - the only thing we did do was we went to the NHS website for the correct medical guidance.\"\nWith the UK aiming to offer Covid vaccinations to every adult by autumn, vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi said confidence in the vaccines was high in the UK, with 85% saying they would accept the jab.\nBut he said that those who were hesitant \"skew heavily\" towards black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.\nThe UK is recording the ethnicity and occupations of people who receive the vaccine and figures would be published soon, Mr Zahawi added.\nLast month, a poll commissioned by the Royal Society of Public Health suggested 57% of black, Asian and minority ethnic people would be happy to have the coronavirus vaccine, compared with 79% of white people.\nDr Harpreet Sood, who is leading an NHS anti-disinformation drive, recently said fake news was likely to be causing some people from the UK's South Asian communities to reject the vaccine.\nSuch warnings have led the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board to urge places of worship and community hubs to be used as vaccination centres in an attempt to inspire confidence.\nThe board's chairman, Imam Qari Asim, said: \"As an imam, my message is simple - do not trust 'fake news', verify before you amplify.\"\nMany mosques are using their Friday sermons to urge people to have the jab, while some imams are sharing photos of themselves getting the jab on social media.\nMeanwhile, the government has announced \u00a323m funding for a network of \"community champions\" to spread accurate information and provide support for people in at-risk groups including older people, disabled people and ethnic minorities.\nOn Monday, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick visited the UK's first vaccination centre to be opened in a mosque, at Al-Abbas Islamic Centre in Birmingham.\n\"It is absolutely brilliant to see faith communities like this stepping up and playing their part in the vaccine programme,\" Mr Jenrick said.\n\"We have to build trust, ensure that we counter misinformation and ensure that everyone, regardless of their faith, regardless of what community they're from, gets access to the programme.\"\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Companies,Hollywood sexual harassment scandal,Film,Harvey Weinstein trial,Harvey Weinstein",
      "text": "A US bankruptcy judge has agreed a $17m (\u00a312.4m) payout to women who accused disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct.\nWeinstein, 68, was convicted last year and jailed for 23 years for rape and sexual assault. \nThe payout for his victims will come from the liquidation of the Weinstein Co, which filed for bankruptcy in 2018. \nThe judge overruled an objection from some accusers looking to pursue appeals outside of bankruptcy court.\nJudge Mary Walrath said without the settlement, the plaintiffs would get \"minimal, if any, recovery.\"\nThe Weinstein Co was set up as an independent film studio with the disgraced Hollywood mogul one of its co-founders.  \nThe company collapsed in late 2017, following widespread claims of sexual misconduct against Weinstein, who was convicted of sexually assaulting a former production assistant and raping an actress.\nThe US judge said that 83% of sexual misconduct claimants in the bankruptcy \"have expressed very loudly that they want closure through acceptance of this plan, that they do not seek to have to go through any further litigation in order to receive some recovery, some possible recompense... although it's clear that money will never give them that\".\nThe $17m fund will be divided among more than 50 claimants, with the most serious allegations resulting in payouts of $500,000 or more. \nThe settlement was put to a vote of Weinstein's accusers, with 39 voting in favour and eight opposed.\nThey will have the option to forgo most of their payout under the plan if they want to continue pursuing their claims.\nInsurers contributed $35m under the liquidation plan, which also provides $9.7m to the former officers and directors of the Weinstein Co, allowing them to pay a portion of their legal bills over the last several years. \nThe directors and officers, who include Weinstein's brother, Bob, also received releases that absolve them of any potential liability for enabling Weinstein's conduct.\nThe Weinstein Co sold its assets to Lantern Entertainment, which later became Spyglass Media Group, for $289m.

      "tags": "International aid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK government should cancel the debt owed by developing countries struggling with the impact of Covid-19, MPs have said.\nThe International Development Committee warned that the pandemic was fuelling extreme poverty and food insecurity.\nIt was also disrupting routine healthcare, such as tuberculosis immunisations, it added.\nThe Foreign Office said it was spending \u00a31.3bn to protect livelihoods, improve health systems and distribute vaccines.\nMore than two million people around the world have died after contracting coronavirus, with almost 100 million cases reported.\nAppearing before the Commons International Development Committee, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he wanted the UK to be a \"force for good in the world\" as it fought the pandemic. \nHe defended the government's decision to cut overseas aid spending next year, saying there were \"no easy choices\" given the hit to the public finances from the pandemic.\nThe cuts mean the UK will fail to meet the UN target of spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid in 2021-2, a target that was enshrined into UK law in 2015. \nMr Raab said he hoped the UK would be able to reach 0.7% again as \"soon as possible\" but this would only happen once the long-term damage to the UK's balance sheet had been \"corrected\". \nLabour said the government was \"betraying the world's poorest.\"\nShadow international development secretary Preet Kaur Gill said: \"This move signals a retreat from the world stage, damages the UK's reputation and will only show our allies and detractors that Britain under Boris Johnson is no longer interested in fulfilling our moral or legal responsibilities.\n\"Labour are committed to spending 0.7% of Gross National Income on aid to tackle global poverty and injustice and will oppose any attempt from this government to damage this country's reputation.\"\nMr Raab said he took seriously warnings from Conservative MPs and ex-ministers that to press ahead with the cuts without passing new legislation would be unlawful.\nFormer Solicitor General Lord Garnier said earlier on Tuesday that Mr Raab's \"reputation\" and the government's domestic and international standing would be damaged if it was seen to \"flout a clear legal obligation\".\nIn tough financial times, Mr Raab said the UK needed to \"make the most\" of its \u00a310bn spending, avoiding \"salami-slicing\" budgets and focusing on a handful of priorities such as climate, biodiversity, conflict prevention and helping the \"bottom billions\" out of extreme poverty. \n\"I think we should unabashedly be proud and confident about the moral responsibility we have to make the world a better place,\" he said.\n\"At the same time, I see a range of grittier strategic interests in dealing with climate change and humanitarian suffering and indeed trade.\"\nThe Foreign Office took over responsibility for overseas aid in September after absorbing the Department for International Development.  \nOn debt cancellation, the committee said that, due to disruption caused by the pandemic, millions of people in developing countries were more at risk from diseases such as tuberculosis because of missed immunisations.\nMillions were more likely to lose their livelihoods because of the global recession and millions of women were more exposed to sexual violence.\nThe MPs want the government to provide more aid to address the problems and cancel long-term national debt that was diverting cash away from those in need.\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We'll only be safe from coronavirus when we're all safe - which is why the UK is leading global efforts to fight this pandemic, committing up to \u00a31.3bn of new UK aid to find and equitably distribute a vaccine, strengthen health systems, protect livelihoods and support the global economy.\"\nThey added that the UK would use its 2021 presidency of the G7 group of leading economies \"to help the world build back stronger and fairer after the pandemic\".\nThis would include \"promoting open societies, championing gender equality and girls' education, and setting out new international approaches to global health security and climate action\", the spokesperson said.\nThe UK has announced it will step up its efforts to help other countries, including some of the poorest in the world, to find new variants of Covid-19.\nIn a speech in London, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK would share its world-leading genomics expertise worldwide to help countries identify new mutations of the virus and protect global health security."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has warned Russian leader Vladimir Putin about election meddling in their first call as counterparts, the White House says.\nThe conversation also included a discussion about the ongoing opposition protests in Russia.\nA Kremlin statement did not refer to any points of friction, saying the call was \"businesslike and frank\".\nBoth sides reportedly agreed to extend the countries' last remaining nuclear deal during the call.\nFormer US President Donald Trump sometimes undercut his own administration's tough posture on Russia and was accused by some of being too deferential to Mr Putin.\nBut Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama - under whom Mr Biden served as vice-president - was also criticised for failing to check Russia as it annexed Crimea, supported rebel forces in eastern Ukraine and backed the government of warn-torn Syria.\n\"President Biden made clear that the United States will act firmly in defence of its national interests in response to actions by Russia that harm us or our allies,\" the White House said in a statement, referencing the main talking points of Tuesday afternoon's call but listing no further details.\nThe US said that the two presidents also discussed the massive SolarWinds cyber-attack, which has been blamed on Moscow; reports that the Kremlin placed bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan; and the poisoning of Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny.\nThe Kremlin statement about the call said their president had \"noted that the normalisation of relations between Russia and the United States would meet the interests of both countries and - taking into account their special responsibility for maintaining security and stability in the world - of the entire international community\".\nThe leaders also discussed the New Start treaty, an Obama-era accord that limits the amounts of warheads, missiles and launchers in the two countries' nuclear arsenals.\nIt had been due to expire on 5 February, but both sides reportedly agreed to extend the treaty during Tuesday's call.\nThe Trump administration, however, had refused to sign it and talks over an extension stalled.\nOn Wednesday, Russia's parliament ratified a five-year extension of the treaty. Mr Putin said the move was a \"step in the right direction\" to reducing global tensions.\nJoe Biden had indicated he would be tougher on Vladimir Putin than Donald Trump, who refused to take on the Kremlin and frequently cast doubt on Russian interference in the 2016 elections. \nOn that matter Mr Biden made his sharpest break with Mr Trump, reportedly telling Mr Putin that he knew Russia had tried to meddle in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. He also warned the Russian president that the US was ready to defend itself against cyber-espionage, and any other attacks. \nDespite Mr Trump's conciliatory approach, the Kremlin did not benefit from his presidency, because his administration heavily sanctioned Russians for issues ranging from Ukraine to attacks on dissidents. Joe Biden and his foreign policy team will take a robust position on human rights and Mr Putin's intentions in Europe. \nBut they are not looking for a confrontation. \nRather, they hope to manage relations and co-operate where possible. In that vein, the two presidents agreed to work at completing the extension of the New Start arms control treaty before it expires next month.\nThe treaty, signed in 2010, limits each side to 1,550 long-range nuclear warheads, a lower number than under the previous deal. \nEach country is allowed, in total, no more than 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear arms.\nAnother 100 are allowed if they are not operationally deployed - for example, missiles removed from a sub undergoing a long-term overhaul.\nAgain, this is a significant reduction from the original treaty."

      "text": "The total number of deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales has reached its highest weekly total of the pandemic.\nThere were 467 deaths in the week ending 15 January, which is 13 more than the week before.\nThis was nearly 40% of all registered deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nBoth Betsi Cadwaladr and Cwm Taf Morgannwg health boards saw their highest weekly numbers, more than experienced during the first wave.\nBetsi Cadwaladr had 74 deaths while Cwm Taf Morgannwg had 116.\nUnlike during the peak in the first wave in 2020, Wales is also now seeing higher numbers of deaths in north Wales and west Wales.\nIn north-east Wales, where there have been the highest case rates of Covid-19 in recent weeks, there were 30 deaths of Flintshire residents, including 25 in hospital. In Wrexham, there were 27 deaths - with 21 in hospital.\nCwm Taf Morgannwg health board saw 49 hospital deaths in Bridgend - the highest weekly number in Wales. There were also 33 patients who died in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) and six in Merthyr Tydfil.\nAll counties recorded at least three deaths involving Covid-19 and the total number of deaths in Wales, up to and registered by 15 January, was 5,884.\nWhen deaths registered over the following few days are counted, there is now a total of 6,074.\nRCT, with 752 deaths, has the largest number in Wales, followed by Cardiff with 637, up to the latest week. \nWhen looking at crude mortality rates, the highest number of deaths - when taking into account the size of populations in England and Wales - are Welsh areas: RCT, followed by Merthyr Tydfil and Blaenau Gwent.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, continue to be above the five-year average.\nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing.\nIn Wales, the number of deaths from all causes fell from 1,198 in the previous week - the highest recorded during the pandemic - to 1,170. But this was still 314 (36.7%) higher than the five-year average for that week. \nThis means deaths have been more than the peak in the first wave of the pandemic - 1,169 deaths in the week ending 17 April 2020 - for two weeks in a row.\nThe highest proportion of excess deaths was 84.1% in London."

      "tags": "Indian farmers protest 2020,Asia,Agriculture,Narendra Modi,India,New Delhi",
      "text": "A rally against agriculture reforms in India turned violent on Tuesday, after protesting farmers broke through police barricades to storm Delhi's historic Red Fort complex.\nOn foot and in tractors, the protesters were part of a huge rally planned for India's Republic Day.\nMany protesters diverted from agreed routes and clashes broke out with police.\nOne protester died and more than 80 police officers were injured.\nMobile internet services were suspended in parts of Delhi and some metro stations closed as security forces scrambled to restore order.\nThe government is yet to comment on the violence, but reports say Home Minister Amit Shah held a meeting with Delhi police to discuss the situation.\nThe government says the reforms that spurred the protests will liberalise the agriculture sector, but farmers say they will lose income.\nTens of thousands of them have been striking on the outskirts of Delhi since November, demanding the laws be repealed. Last week they rejected a government offer to put the laws on hold. \nIt is one of the longest farmers-led protests India has ever seen, pitting the community against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) government.\nPolice allowed Tuesday's rally on the condition that it would not interrupt the annual Republic Day parade in central Delhi. \nRepublic Day is a national holiday that marks the anniversary of India officially adopting its constitution on 26 January 1950.\nFarmers were given specific routes for the rally, which would largely be confined to the outskirts. But a group of them converged on the historic Red Fort. They breached security and clambered onto the walls and domes of the fortress, even hoisting flags alongside the national flag. \nBy Tuesday afternoon, police said they had removed protesters from the complex, but the situation remained tense.\n\"We came here to deliver a message to the Modi government, our job is done. We will go back now,\" one protesting farmer told NDTV.\nOther protesters broke through police barricades and marched towards central Delhi, where India's parliament is located.\nImages from the ITO metro station junction - on the route to central Delhi - showed police clashing with farmers and using tear gas and batons. Protesters driving tractors appeared to be deliberately trying to run over police personnel. Local media reported injuries on both sides.\nAt least one protester died at the junction when his tractor overturned as police fired tear gas. \nBBC correspondents said protesters outnumbered the police at the ITO junction, leaving them struggling to control the crowd.\n\"We have been appealing to farmers to go by the pre-approved route but some of them broke police barricades, attacked police personnel,\" a senior police officer told ANI news agency. \"We are appealing to farmers' unions to help maintain peace.\"\nUnion leaders issued similar appeals, condemning and distancing themselves from the violence. \nThe laws loosen rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce which have protected India's farmers from the free market for decades.\nFarmers fear that the new laws will threaten decades-old concessions - such as assured prices - and weaken their bargaining power, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by private companies. \nWhile Mr Modi has defended them, the laws have been likened to a \"death warrant\" by farmer groups.\nMost economists and experts agree that Indian agriculture desperately needs reform. But critics of the government say it failed to consult farmers before passing the laws. \nExperts also point out that the reforms fail to take into account that agriculture still remains a mainstay in the Indian economy."

      "text": "Testing for different variants of Covid-19 is \"massively more advanced\" in NI than in the Republic, the first minister has said.\nArlene Foster commented on social media after Taoiseach (Irish PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin said his \"understanding\" was NI was not testing for the new variant.\nMrs Foster said she had spoken to Mr Martin on Monday.\nShe tweeted that he had \"accepted that Northern Ireland is testing for SARS-CoV-2\".  \nSpeaking to Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 on Saturday, Mr Martin had said: \"When I discussed this with the leaders, their view was the variant doesn't appear to be as big an issue in the north... I can't understand that.\"\nOn Monday, the NI Department of Health announced 17 further deaths linked to Covid-19 and 422 more cases of the virus.\nThe Republic of Ireland reported a further seven Covid-19 related deaths and 1,372 more cases.\nThe department released a statement on Sunday saying \"in light of some misleading commentary in recent days\", it wanted to detail \"the ongoing work in Northern Ireland to identify new variants of the Covid-19\".\nIt said that \"whole genome sequencing\", which is used to identify and track new strains of Covid-19, had been in place in Northern Ireland \"from an early stage of this pandemic\". \nIt is thought that up to 50% of current Covid-19 cases could be related to the new \"English\" variant, which is thought to be about 50-70% more infectious than the original strain.\nSpeaking on BBC's Good Morning Ulster, Dr Connor Bamford, a virologist at Queen's University, said: \"I think we need to be fairly concerned about this, for a couple of these variants they're actually changing how the virus behaves.\n\"This one, in particular, seems to be more transmissible, which means more people getting infected, more people getting sick and more people dying.\"\nWhen asked on Good Morning Ulster about the new variant, Dr David Farren, a consultant microbiologist, said: \"It's not true to say we're not looking for it, but we are only looking for it, in a small number of cases.\" \nWhen asked if it is inevitable that the new variant becomes the dominant variant he said there's \"certainly a high risk of that\".\nMrs Foster also said on Twitter that she \"pressed\" the taoiseach on sharing travel locator forms and that he \"committed to movement soon on that issue\".\nThe first minister and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill have criticised Dublin for failing to share information on travellers arriving there during the pandemic in order to help control the spread of any new Covid-19 variant.\nMs O'Neill said she was \"hopeful\" the Irish government will soon share information with the executive about the movement of visitors to the Republic.\nShe added that there needed to be greater co-operation between the two governments and that it should not be \"an orange and green issue\". \nMeanwhile, numbers being immunised at NI's vaccination centres have declined as the phase focused on healthcare workers comes to an end, the Department of Health has said.\nHealth trusts are now planning to invite clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) patients to receive their vaccine.\nThe department said CEV patients would be contacted in due course.\nIt also urged healthcare workers to take up the offer of a jab quickly.\nThe department said there was no \"diminution\" of work at vaccine centres after a letter from the Southern Health Trust indicated the need for some vaccinators would be \"limited\" in the next four to six weeks.\nThe speed at which the vaccines are being delivered has slowed somewhat over the past week, according to official government data, but Northern Ireland remains one of the vaccination success stories.\nThe Department of Health said the NI vaccination data for 23 and 24 January - as reported at UK-wide level - \"is only partial information as it does not contain the GP vaccination figures\".  \nAs of Monday, 159,642 people in Northern Ireland had received a first vaccine dose.\nThat represents more than 10.5% of the NI population.\nMore than 20,000 people have received a second dose.\nThe Department of Health said that a further announcement on the timing of the start of vaccinations for those aged 70 and over, the wider clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) group and those aged 65 and over will be confirmed later this week. \nIn a separate development, the military medical personnel who will be assisting in the battle against Covid-19, will be in hospitals in Northern Ireland by the end of the week.\nThe medics who are of paramedic grade in the RAF, Army and Navy will take up nursing assistant roles.

He could be banned from ever running for office.\nDozens of people have been arrested and charged by the FBI.\nTwo members of the police board - former House sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving and ex-Senate sergeant-at arms Michael Stenger, have resigned in the wake of the chaos.\nThe images of violence in the hallowed corridors of government shocked the nation and the world.\nThey have also led to much soul searching in the US over the state of the nation at the start of a new presidency."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Netherlands,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Dutch government says it will not lift a curfew, after a third night of violent protests against increased Covid curbs across the Netherlands.\nShops in Rotterdam and other cities were looted and Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said: \"It's scum doing this\". More than 180 arrests have been made.\nThe Dutch chief of police said the riots no longer had \"anything to do with the basic right to demonstrate\".\nThe criminal violence had to stop, said Prime Minister Mark Rutte.\nShop-owners in Rotterdam, Den Bosch and other cities spent Tuesday morning cleaning up the debris from Monday night's violence. \nRotterdam Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb sent a passionate message to \"shameless thieves\" who had caused the damage: \"Does it make you feel good that you've helped ruin your city? To wake up with a bag full of stolen stuff beside you?\"\nA night-time curfew from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) to 04:30 was imposed last Saturday to halt the spread of the virus. Anyone caught violating it faces a \u20ac95 (\u00a384) fine. Mr Hoekstra said they would not \"capitulate to a few idiots\" and anyone who caused damage should be tracked down and be made to pay for it.\nThe Netherlands has had nearly a million confirmed Covid cases since the start of the outbreak, with more than 13,500 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University in the US, which is tracking the pandemic. \nRiot police clashed with protesters in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, as well as Amersfoort, Den Bosch, Alphen and Helmond.\nSome of the worst disturbances were in the south of Rotterdam where police said 10 officers were hurt. Most of the rioters were youths or young men, and Amsterdam's mayor appealed to parents to keep young people indoors. \nFires were lit on the streets of The Hague, where police on bicycles attempted to move small clusters of men who threw stones and fireworks. \nIn Den Bosch in the south, rioters set off fireworks, broke windows, looted a supermarket and overturned cars. A local woman told Dutch radio that masked youths had left a trail of destruction in the city centre. \"I saw windows smashed and fireworks going off. Really crazy, just like a war zone,\" she said. \nRoads into Den Bosch were closed to stop people joining the rioters and Mayor Jack Mikkers imposed an emergency order banning gatherings on Tuesday. \nThe region's chief prosecutor, Heleen Rutgers, urged parents to ensure teenagers stayed at home.  \"Start talking about how to respond to calls on social media to go and turn up somewhere,\" she told public broadcaster NOS. \nIn some southern cities, such as Maastricht and Breda, football fans marched through the centres promising to protect them from rioters. Ex-football international Robin van Persie appealed to people in Rotterdam to keep \"our beautiful city\" intact.\nThe ignition of discontent has rocked the core of Dutch society. \nIn the absence of any legitimate way to socialise, is this simply an outlet for young men to feel part of something, their masks concealing their identities and enabling them to violently channel their frustrations?\nThere are more sinister influences at play. Messages on social media, overt and covert, have whipped up anger. Misinformation has even been spread by some politicians.\nSome feared a curfew would be a tipping point, as Dutch restrictions tighten while some neighbouring countries relax their rules. The vast majority of people in the Netherlands are peacefully observing the curfew.\nThe unrest was initially seen as a response to the first \"stay-at-home\" order imposed since Nazi occupation during World War Two. That notion has been dismissed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who said the rioters were simply criminals and would be treated as such. \nBut there are simmering anxieties in Dutch towns and cities, and with less than two months before a general election, voters are vulnerable and the streets volatile. \nThere has been widespread shock at the violence. In Rotterdam, where police used water cannon against the rioters, the mayor signed an emergency decree, giving police broader powers of arrest. \nThe prime minister said the police had the government's full support: \"The riots have nothing to do with protesting or fighting for freedom.\" \nRotterdam shop-owner Emrah K\u00f6ker said he had no words for what he had seen. \"How can this happen in the Netherlands?\" he asked Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. The justice minister said he challenged anyone to explain what looting a shop had to do with coronavirus.\nIn Den Bosch, Maaike Neuf\u00e9glise said the damage to her shop was heartbreaking and ran into thousands of euros. \"Everything's ruined. I saw the videos, it was a complete invasion. There must have been 40 people in our store,\" she told broadcaster Omroep Brabant.\nThe city's mayor said police had struggled to respond to the violence because they were needed in other nearby towns."

      "tags": "Literature,Costa Coffee,Books",
      "text": "The Mermaid of Black Conch, a dark love story about a fisherman and a mermaid torn from the sea, has won the Costa Book of the Year award.\nTrinidadian-born British writer Monique Roffey beat four other contenders with her sixth novel to scoop the \u00a330,000 prize.\nJudges said the book was \"utterly original... and feels like a classic in the making\".\nA \"delighted\" Roffey said her win was a vote for Caribbean literature.\n\"A huge thank you to the judges for exposing my book to a wide readership. I'll be pinching myself for weeks to come,\" she added.\nBased on a Taino legend of a beautiful woman transformed into a mermaid, the story is set in the Caribbean village of St Constance.\nDavid, a fisherman, unexpectedly attracts the attention of Aycayia, a mermaid who is drawn to his singing. When she is captured from the sea during an annual fishing competition, he does all he can to save her, with dramatic consequences.\nProfessor Suzannah Lipscomb, chair of judges, said: \"The Mermaid of Black Conch is an extraordinary, beautifully written, captivating, visceral book - full of mythic energy and unforgettable characters, including some tremendously transgressive women.\"\nThe Costa Book Awards have a reputation for picking popular reads: books you would recommend to a friend. And I would definitely recommend The Mermaid of Black Conch.\nAt first, the novel might sound a bit odd. Set on a Caribbean island in the 1970s, it is a bittersweet love story between a beautiful young woman cursed to live as a mermaid and a fisherman. \nBased on a legend passed down by the indigenous people of the Caribbean, the Taino, there are touches of magic and snippets of poetry. The book was also shortlisted for the Goldsmiths Prize last year, which rewards fiction that breaks the mould or extends the possibilities of the novel.\nBut while it is unusual it is also a joy to read, brimming with memorable characters and vivid descriptions.\nWe see the mermaid's \"hair flying like a nest of cables\" while we are told \"sea moss trailed from her shoulders like slithers of beard\" and \"barnacles speckled the swell of her hips.\" \nFor me, this was a hugely entertaining and thought-provoking novel and a worthy winner. \nRoffey, a senior lecturer in creative writing at Manchester Metropolitan University, secured her publishing deal through Peepal Tree Press, an independent publisher supporting Caribbean writers.\nShe then crowd-funded her publicity campaign with the support of fellow authors.\nRoffey's entry was also named Costa's Novel of the Year earlier this month, alongside winners from four other categories:\nThe Mermaid of Black Conch is the thirteenth novel to take the overall prize. Days Without End by Sebastian Barry was the last novel to be named Costa Book of the Year in 2016.\nTuesday's virtual ceremony also saw London-based writer Tessa Sheridan receive the 2020 Costa Short Story Award.\nSheridan won the public vote and \u00a33,500 for her story, The Person Who Serves, Serves Again.   \nThe Costa Book Awards, formerly the Whitbread Book Awards, were established in 1971 to encourage, promote and celebrate the best contemporary British writing. \nIt is open to UK and Irish authors.\nSeamus Heaney, Ted Hughes and Sebastian Barry are among the authors to have won the book of the year award more than once.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Germany's health ministry and AstraZeneca have rejected German media reports on Monday that cast doubt on the effectiveness of the drug-maker's vaccine in the elderly. \nAstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish company, described the reports as \"completely incorrect\" while the health ministry said key data had been misreported. \nThe media reports quoted anonymous German government sources. \nThey come amid tension between the EU and AstraZeneca over vaccine supplies. \nThe European Union has said it may restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc in response to AstraZeneca saying it cannot supply the agreed numbers of doses due to production problems. \nThe reports emerged in Handelsblatt, a respected financial daily, and the mass-circulation Bild, quoting sources within Germany's governing coalition. \nGermany and the wider EU are relying on millions of doses of the AstraZeneca product, alongside the BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, to fight the coronavirus pandemic. \nHandelsblatt reported that the German government was working on the basis of only 8% efficacy among those over 65, compared with over 90% for the other vaccines.\nThe AstraZeneca jab is expected to be approved by the EU's medicine's regulator, the EMA, in the next few days. But Bild suggested that it may not be approved by the EMA for use in the elderly.\nThe EMA's head, Emer Cooke, has been asked by MEPs about the efficacy of the vaccine in older people. She said studies carried out so far were on a very small quantity of the elderly population. \nHer agency, she said, what trying to work out \"what the data means for the populations that were studied and what can be expected for populations that have not been studied\". \nEMA approval, she added, could be granted for \"a particular age group or for a wider age group\".\nAstraZeneca said: \"Reports that the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine efficacy is as low as 8% in adults over 65 years are completely incorrect.\"\nIn November, the firm had published data in the leading medical journal The Lancet \"demonstrating that older adults showed strong immune responses to the vaccine, with 100% of older adults generating spike-specific antibodies after the second dose\".\nAstraZeneca chief Pascal Soriot, in an interview with Italy's La Repubblica, explained that the Oxford team started vaccinating older people later so it did not have \"a huge number of older people that had been vaccinated\". \n\"But we have strong data showing very strong antibody production against the virus in the elderly, similar to what we see in younger people.\"\nHe said it was possible that some countries \"out of caution\" would use the AstraZeneca vaccine just for younger people. \nFull trial data in December showed the vaccine was 70% effective in all adults, and it was approved for use by the UK's MHRA regulator. \nReacting to Monday's German media coverage, the German health ministry said on Tuesday that it \"appears two things have been mixed up in the reports\" and that 8% actually referred to the number of volunteers of a certain age taking part in the study - not the efficacy rate. \n\"Around 8% of the volunteers in AstraZeneca's efficacy studies were between 56 and 69 years old and 3-4% are above 70 years old,\" said the ministry in a statement.\n\"However, this does not mean that it is effective only in 8% of older people.\" \nThe statement also noted that \"fewer older people were involved in AstraZeneca's first studies than in those of other manufacturers\". \nHealth Minister Jens Spahn, interviewed by German radio, refused to be drawn on what he called \"speculation\" and said he would await the EU regulator's decision.

      "tags": "Chris Whitty,Boris Johnson,NHS,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 100,000 people have died with Covid-19 in the UK, after 1,631 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded in the daily figures.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he took \"full responsibility\" for the government's actions, saying: \"We truly did everything we could.\"\n\"I'm deeply sorry for every life lost,\" he said.\nA total of 100,162 deaths have been recorded in the UK, the first European nation to pass the landmark.\nEarlier, figures from the ONS, which are based on death certificates, showed there had been nearly 104,000 deaths since the pandemic began.\nThe government's daily figures rely on positive tests and are slightly lower.\nMr Johnson told Tuesday's Downing Street news conference that it was \"hard to compute the sorrow contained in this grim statistic\".\nHe gave his \"deepest condolences\" to those who had lost loved ones, including \"fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, and the many grandparents who've been taken\".\nThe UK is the fifth country to pass 100,000 deaths, coming after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico.\nA surge in cases in recent weeks - driven in part by a new, fast-spreading variant of the virus - has left the UK with one of the highest coronavirus death rates globally.\nA further 20,089 coronavirus cases were recorded on Tuesday, continuing a downward trend in the number of UK cases seen in recent days. The number of people in hospital remains high, as do the UK's daily death figures. \nMr Johnson said the coronavirus infection rate remained \"pretty forbiddingly high\" despite lockdown restrictions which have been in place in England since 5 January.\nUnder the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons - including for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nMr Johnson said he would set out more detail in \"the next few days and weeks\" about \"when and how we want to get things open again\".\nIt's a terrible milestone - and one that represents unimaginable loss.\nMost of the deaths have come in two waves - the sharp, sudden surge in the spring followed by a slow and sustained rise throughout autumn and winter.\nMistakes have been made - the delay locking down back in March is one that is often cited even by the government's own advisers.\nThe UK, like much of Europe, was also woefully underprepared with limited testing and contact tracing systems.\nBut the ageing population, high rates of obesity, the fact the UK is a global hub and its inter-connectedness with Europe are also factors that meant we were tragically never going to escape lightly once the virus got a foothold.\nSpeaking alongside the prime minister, Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, described it as a \"very sad day\".\nHe said the number of people dying \"will come down relatively slowly over the next two weeks - and will probably remain flat for a while now\".\nProf Whitty added the new coronavirus variant had changed the UK's situation \"very substantially\" with infection rates \"just about holding\" due to lockdown restrictions. \nBut he said the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK \"has been coming down\" and the number of people in hospital with Covid has \"flattened off\" - including in London, the South East and East of England.\nHowever, there were \"some areas\" where the hospital figures were \"still not convincingly reducing\", he said.\nNHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said there had been \"continuing improvements in hospital treatment for severely sick coronavirus patients\". \nHe said he expected more treatments within the next six to 18 months, adding: \"We can see a world in which coronavirus may be more treatable, but for now, it's a combination of reducing infections and getting vaccinations done.\"\nOne day there will be a public inquiry - maybe several - seeking to understand why so many died.\nLast summer, back when the government was subsidising people to eat out at restaurants, Boris Johnson said there would be an independent inquiry into the government's handling of Covid, but gave no details or dates.\nHe still hasn't, despite a recent call from bereaved families, trade unions and charities for lessons to be learnt now.\nThe gravest public health crisis for a century would have tested any government.\nBut as the pandemic has worsened, the criticisms and questions have mounted - about the timing of lockdowns, the rollout of test and trace and the failure to protect care homes last spring. \nThere is now pressure on Boris Johnson from some Tory MPs to ease restrictions as soon as the most vulnerable are vaccinated.\nBut this evening a sombre prime minister said the government would first do everything it could to minimise further loss of life.\nDr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said it was a \"sobering moment in the pandemic\", saying: \"Each death is a person who was someone's family member and friend.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was a \"national tragedy\" to have reached 100,000 deaths.\nThe government had been \"behind the curve at every stage\" of the pandemic and had not learnt lessons over the summer, he added.\nThe epidemiologist whose modelling in part prompted the UK's first national lockdown said more action in the autumn of last year could have saved lives.\nProf Neil Ferguson told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: \"Had we acted both earlier and with greater stringency back in September when we first saw case numbers going up, and had a policy of keeping case numbers at a reasonably low levels, then I think a lot of the deaths we've seen, not all by any means, but a lot of the deaths we've seen in the last four or five months, could have been avoided.\" \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the death toll was \"heartbreaking\" and warned there was a \"tough period ahead\".\n\"The vaccine offers the way out, but we cannot let up now,\" he added.\nMore than 6.8 million people in the UK have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest figures.\nIf you would like to send us a tribute to a friend or family member who died after contracting coronavirus, please use the form below.\nPlease remember to include a photo of your loved one and their name.

The English average was 233.6. \nIt was also more than twice the rate - on an age-standardised count - in the most deprived areas when compared with the least deprived areas.\nONS analysis of death registrations points to Covid-19 being the underlying cause of death in 12.5% of all deaths - 4,532 - in Wales. It was the underlying cause in 12.9% of deaths in England.\nIn Wales, the provisional number of deaths from all causes registered in December was 3,941 - 1,075 more than the five-year average for the month.\nThe 56 Covid deaths on 18 December was the highest on a single day in Wales since 17 April when there were 58, said the ONS.\nThe mortality rate is also higher than each of the past nine years in Wales.\nLeading causes of death, following Covid-19, were dementia and Alzheimer's disease, then heart disease.\nFor 2020 deaths registered by 9 January 2021, there were 2,794 more deaths than the five-year average (8.3% higher). \nThe figures released include a breakdown of where the deaths of people with Covid-19 have happened in Wales, including at a localised level.\nTwo of the highest, when these are converted into crude mortality rates based on population size, are both in Rhondda Cynon Taf  (RCT): Tonyrefail West (53 deaths, which is 515.7 deaths per 100,000) and Penrhiwceiber, where there have been 26 deaths and a mortality rate of 436.9.\nBrynmawr in Blaenau Gwent, Port Talbot East (Neath Port Talbot) and Porth East and Ynsyhit (RCT) are also in the highest five."

During this time, the UK-EU relationship continued much as it was before - including the Erasmus scheme.\nNow that the Brexit transition period has ended, Scotland, England and Wales will no longer participate in Erasmus, but Northern Ireland's access will continue.\nMr Lochhead called the ending of the programme a \"huge blow\" for Scottish students, community groups and adult learners.\nLast week he held what the Scottish government described as \"productive talks\" with European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth Mariya Gabriel to explore Scotland continuing with the Erasmus scheme.\nThe government has now welcomed the support of 145 MEPs who urged the European Commission to explore the idea.\nMr Lochhead said:  \"I have already had a virtual meeting with Commissioner Gabriel. We agreed that withdrawing from Erasmus is highly regrettable and we will continue to explore with the EU how to maximise Scotland's continued engagement with the programme.\n\"I have also spoken with my Welsh government counterpart and agreed to keep in close contact.\"\nThe Scottish and Welsh governments have criticised the Turing Scheme as \"a lesser imitation of the real thing\".\nThey said it offers no support for our adult education or youth work, and reduces support for colleges, schools and vocational training sectors.\nIn a joint statement from Mr Lochhead and Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams, they said: \"The Scottish and Welsh governments have always been united in our view that participation in Erasmus+ is in the best interests for the whole of the UK. \n\"The UK government's decision not to associate to the programme is therefore deeply disappointing, a decision that will see support for our most deprived communities cut, and opportunities for all our learners reduced.\"\nA spokesman for the EU Commission said the decision would mean organisations and individuals from across the UK, including Scotland, \"will be deprived of opportunities for exchange and co-operation\".\nBut he added that the UK would still be able to participate in Erasmus+ in a limited way as a \"non-associated Third Country\".\nCameron McKail, from Edinburgh, worked as a labourer for two years straight after leaving school.\nAt age 18 he secured a place with Erasmus+ and travelled to Strona in Italy, where he heard about employment experiences of young people around Europe.\nThe 25-year-old has since been to college, studied community education at the University of Edinburgh and secured work with Erasmus, helping other young people who want to improve their employment opportunities.\n\"Sometimes it's young people's first time out of Scotland,\" he said. \"To open up those opportunities is invaluable, particularly down a community path. \n\"For young people who are outwith mainstream education, maybe on work or employability courses, it's really important for them to be valued and to be afforded these experiences as well. Sometimes it's those young people who need that support.\n\"Erasmus+ allows young people who might never have the experience to go away and meet other people from alternative cultures - to open their eyes and their minds as well to the world and understand it a little bit better.\"\nLast month, Boris Johnson announced the UK would replace Erasmus with the Turing Scheme, which would include countries outside Europe.\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \"The UK decided to not participate in the next Erasmus+ programme as it was not in the interest of UK taxpayers and our net contribution would have been around \u00a32bn over the programme. \n\"The new global Turing Scheme is designed to provide thousands of students across all of the UK the opportunity to study and work abroad, beyond EU countries, and will include additional support for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. \n\"We will continue to work with the sector and devolved administrations to deliver the programme, backed by over \u00a3100m, ensuring students from all backgrounds benefit from the opportunity to learn across the world.\" "

      "tags": "Unemployment,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Retailing,UK economy,Budget 2021,Young people,Coronavirus pandemic,UK High Streets",
      "text": "The number of people out of work in the UK has continued to rise, with those aged 25 to 34 facing the biggest risk of losing their jobs.\nIn the three months to November, people in that age group had a redundancy rate of 16.2 per 1,000, a fivefold increase on the same period a year earlier.\nUnemployment rose to 5% from 4.9% as Covid continued to hit the jobs market.\nSome 1.72 million were jobless, the Office for National Statistics said, the highest level in five years.\nThat was 418,000 more than in the same period the previous year, the biggest increase since late 2009.\nAbigail Ward, 27, freely admits that she was \"a bit naive\" when she began her latest job hunt after being made redundant as a store manager at J Crew in London last September.\nHaving spent the past five years since graduating in retail management, she has a passion for bricks-and-mortar retail and \"the value of face-to-face customer interactions\" - and it's an area she wants to stay in.\n\"I knew it would be hard, but I've been in this position before,\" she told the BBC.\n\"Back then, it only took me three or four weeks to find a role and maybe 10 job applications, so it all happened quite seamlessly, whereas this time around, it's definitely been a lot more difficult.\n\"I've probably sent off around 30 to 40 job applications in the last six months, the majority of which just go into the abyss. You never hear a word.\"\nHowever, Abigail has managed to get to the final interview stage for a job - \"with me and just one other candidate\" - on four separate occasions. \n\"Unfortunately, I've missed out on each of those occasions,\" she says.\n\"There are so many hundreds of applications and it's so competitive,\" she adds. \"It's definitely been a big challenge.\"\nThe hospitality industry was worst hit by the rise in joblessness, followed by manufacturing.\nIn both sectors, the number of people unemployed was up by more than 50,000 on the previous year.\nAcross all age groups, redundancies rose to a record high of 14.2 per 1,000 people.\nHowever, job vacancies also rose, with 81,000 new openings reported in the three months.\nONS deputy chief executive Sam Beckett told the BBC that the UK had not seen such rises in unemployment since the global financial crisis.\n\"Payroll numbers show the number of workers on payroll have fallen by over 828,000 since the pandemic began,\" she added.\nEmployment was still at \"relatively high levels\" compared with other countries, Ms Beckett said, but workers aged 16 to 24 were suffering some of the biggest falls in employment.\nHowever, she added: \"We've currently got over 4.5 million people on the furlough scheme, so that does complicate the picture when you're trying to interpret what's going on in the labour market.\"\nWhile the main rate of unemployment has reached 5% for the first time in nearly five years, and this morning's numbers saw the largest increase in the numbers unemployed since the financial crisis, the chancellor must now be tempted to extend the furlough scheme to co-ordinate with the rollout of the post-vaccination reopening of the economy.\nThere are some bad numbers in this release, as would be expected from the pandemic restrictions, but they were expected to be a little worse. In the quarter to November, there were 418,000 extra unemployed over the same period in 2019 - the sharpest annual rise since the 2009 financial crisis.\nThe rate of redundancies reached a record of 14 per 1,000 people. Loss of jobs was concentrated in sectors such as retail and hospitality, most affected by social restrictions, which were reintroduced at the end of the period. Young people also faced the sharpest drops in employment. The jobs numbers are yet to reflect the current return to national lockdowns.\nThough a significant rise over the past few pandemic-afflicted months, unemployment at 5% is still low by international standards and is being kept in check by the government's job retention furlough scheme. The current plan is to end the costly scheme in April, which economists expect would see a sharp jump in jobless figures to 6% or 7%. \nBut as the government continues to communicate caution about how fast restrictions on the economy will be lifted, business groups are adamant that the scheme needs to be extended into the early summer, or at least linked to the success of the vaccination programme.\n\"This crisis has gone on far longer than any of us hoped - and every job lost as a result is a tragedy,\" said Chancellor Rishi Sunak.\n\"Whilst the NHS is working hard to protect people with the vaccine, we're throwing everything we've got at supporting businesses, individuals and families. \n\"Our Plan for Jobs includes grants and loans so that firms can keep employees on, the furlough scheme to help protect jobs, and programmes like Kickstart alongside record investment in skills so that people can find their first job, their next job or a new job if needed,\" Mr Sunak added.\nWith no end in sight to the current lockdown measures, many firms fear that they may not be able to survive the pandemic, with pubs and restaurants bearing the brunt of the restrictions.\n\"The pandemic continues to rip through the labour market,\" said Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors.\n\"A return to tighter restrictions late last year will have stretched businesses' ability to retain staff. Meanwhile, the furlough scheme will have provided an invaluable cushion for many firms, preventing unemployment from edging up even further.\"\nIt is \"crucial\" for the chancellor to extend the furlough scheme and other Covid-19 economic support beyond the spring, he said.\n\"The forthcoming Budget is a vital moment to help firms retain, retrain and rehire workers as the vaccine rolls out. In particular, the government should provide a relief for employers' National Insurance contributions and support reskilling opportunities to shore up the recovery.\""

      "tags": "Schools,Coronavirus vaccines,Gavin Williamson,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government will tell teachers and parents when schools in England can reopen \"as soon as we can\", the prime minister has said.\nMPs have called on the government to set out a \"route map\" for reopening amid concerns for children's education.\nBoris Johnson said he understood why people wanted a timetable but he did not want to lift restrictions while the infection rate was \"still very high\".\nHe would not guarantee schools would reopen before April's Easter break.\nMr Johnson said: \"We've now got the R [reproduction rate] down below 1 across the whole of the country, that's a great achievement, we don't want to see a huge surge of infection just when we've got the vaccination programme going so well and people working so hard.\n\"I understand why people want to get a timetable from me today, what I can tell you is we'll tell you, tell parents, tell teachers as much as we can as soon as we can.\"\nHe said the government would be \"looking at the potential of relaxing some measures\" before mid-February, with Downing Street clarifying that this meant looking at the data to decide \"what we may or may not be able to ease from 15 February onwards\".\nA further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 22,195 cases have been recorded, according to Monday's government figures.\nAt Monday's Downing Street press briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said almost four in five of the UK's over-80s have had the vaccine, with nearly 6.6m people in total having had their first dose.\nBut he said the NHS continues to be under \"intense pressure\", with Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, saying there are \"twice the number of people in hospital than we had in the first wave\" of the pandemic.\nRobert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, told BBC Breakfast there was \"enormous uncertainty\" and called for the government to set out what the conditions needed to be for pupils to return to schools.\nThe Conservative MP for Harlow suggested the government could consider tighter restrictions in other parts of society and the economy, in order to enable schools to open.\nTory MPs were enraged by reports over the weekend that schools might not re-open fully until after the Easter holidays. \nMinisters say it's the progress of the pandemic that will determine their decision rather than a pre-agreed timetable. \nYet whenever the government speaks, parents hear dates. Whether it's that the situation will be reviewed at half-term. Or a pledge to give two weeks' notice when classes will come back. \nMPs are now pushing for more transparency from the government about how they'll assess the data, and for some ideas between school being mostly closed or totally open.\nThis issue is a perfect metaphor for the situation facing the entire country. Too much hope breeds disappointment, but living with uncertainty is just as hard. And you can come up with a plan but it might have to be junked if the virus has other ideas. \nChildren's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield joined the call for clarity and told the BBC: \"Children are more withdrawn, they are really suffering in terms of isolation, their confidence levels are falling, and for some there are serious issues.\" \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government wanted to \"see all children back at the very earliest moment\".\nSchools in England have been closed to most pupils since the national lockdown began on 5 January due to high levels of Covid transmission in the community.\nThere have been calls for teachers to be vaccinated sooner, although it is not clear if that would allow schools to reopen earlier.\nCovid death rates among educational professionals are not \"statistically significantly different\" to those in the general population, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, but secondary school teachers appeared to have an elevated risk compared particularly with people working in office-type jobs.\nAmong secondary school teachers Covid death rates were 39.2 deaths per 100,000 males, compared with 31.4 for all males aged 20 to 64, and 21.2 per 100,000 females, compared with 16.8, but the ONS said these were \"not statistically significantly different than those of the same age and sex in the wider population\".\nSchools will remain closed in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales until at least the February half-term - with the Welsh first minister saying it is \"unlikely\" all pupils will return after the break.\nGemma Cocker from Brighton is one of the many parents struggling to balance childcare, home learning and work. \nShe says she's having to share her work laptop with her son, who has already missed learning time after the family moved home and did not have internet access. \"We didn't have any internet. The school said they had reached their limit so couldn't take him,\" she says.  \nAnd because her children are young, she says: \"They're never just going to watch a classroom by themselves, you have to be with them the whole time.\"\nKitty Jones, 11, is in her last year of primary school and she says home learning is \"tricky\" because she is not used to using different remote platforms like Google Classroom and she wants to return \"as soon as possible\".\n\"I still think that I'm learning a bit, but I don't think I'm learning as much as I would be in person,\" she tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme.\nHolly Agbukor, 18, is studying for her A-levels, says it is \"quite stressful\" learning at home, as it is a \"different environment, so it is not as easy to be fully present in the lessons\".\nBut, she says, while is it \"difficult\" working at home, \"I don't think it is worth the cost of reintroducing the virus into society and making things worse overall\".\nIn other developments:\nHow has home-schooling been going for your family?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,United States,Coronavirus pandemic,Joe Biden",
      "text": "After criticism that his original goal was not bold enough, US President Joe Biden has said he expects the US will soon be able to vaccinate 1.5 million people a day.\nHe had announced last week that 1m vaccines would be administered daily in the first 100 days of his presidency.\nBut some media noted the US had already nearly reached that target under the Trump administration.\nMr Biden also renewed Trump-era Covid bans on Monday, adding South Africa.\nIn the first time formally taking reporters' questions during his presidency, Mr Biden said on Monday that he hoped they would be able to get to 1.5 million vaccinations administered daily.\n\"I think with the grace of God... we'll be able to get that to 1.5 million a day,\" the Democrat said.\nHe added: \"I hope we'll be able to increase as we go along so we'll get to 1.5 million. That's my hope.\"\nSome media had questioned whether the new president's target of one million shots per day was ambitious enough. \nLast week, at the tail-end of the Trump administration, the US had already reached an average of around 980,000 vaccine doses administered daily.\nWhen an Associated Press news agency reporter asked last Thursday why Mr Biden had not aimed higher, he shot back: \"You all said it's not possible. Come on, give me a break man.\" \nBut CNN rated the president's claim about the media as false.\nDuring Monday's press conference, a reporter suggested to Mr Biden that he had changed his tone on defeating the public health crisis, pointing out that as a candidate he had vowed to \"shut down\" Covid-19, only to say last week: \"There's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months.\"\nMr Biden replied: \"What I meant was it took a long time to get here and it's going to take a long time to beat it.\"\n\"I'm confident we will beat this virus,\" he added, \"but we're still going to be talking about it in the summer and dealing with it in the fall.\"\nThe Biden administration on Monday renewed Trump-era Covid-19 travel bans on non-US visitors from Brazil and most of Europe, including the UK and Ireland.\nThe White House also imposed a new ban on South Africa over its virus variant.\nFormer President Donald Trump had ordered the bans to end on 26 January as one of his final acts in office.\nThe new travel restrictions came as Minnesota recorded the first US case of the Brazil variant from a resident who had recently travelled to that country.\n\"This case marks the first documented instance of the Brazil P.1 variant in the United States,\" said the Minnesota Department of Health on Monday.\nThe unnamed patient lives in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area, said the department.\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the decision to continue the restrictions on foreign travellers on Monday. \nShe told reporters: \"With the pandemic worsening and more contagious variants spreading, this isn't the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel.\"\nAll international travellers must also present a negative test within three days of air travel to the US.\nTravel restrictions have been in place since mid-March. \nWhen Mr Trump ordered a ban on flights from China in February, citing the \"Chinese virus\", Mr Biden railed against Mr Trump's \"hysterical xenophobia\". At the time, the Biden campaign denied the remark was about Mr Trump's travel ban.\nMs Psaki was asked on Monday about Mr Biden's stance in light of the \"xenophobic\" remark. She said: \"He was critical of the former president for having a policy that was not more comprehensive than travel restrictions and he conveyed at the time - and more recently - the importance of having a multi-faceted approach.\"\nThe US has had more than double the cases of the next highest country, India. There have been over 420,000 deaths - nearly twice as many as Brazil, the second highest - and above 25 million cases.\nNew York City - the most populous urban area in the country - has postponed plans for three mass vaccination sites due to a low supply of vaccine doses.\nCity authorities were co-ordinating plans to turn two baseball stadiums as well as an outlet mall into inoculation hubs, but vaccine supply has not kept up with demand.\nAlso on Monday, California lifted a stay-at-home order imposed in December as officials said projections for hospital intensive care capacity had improved. The Golden State has been hard hit by a post-holiday surge that stretched hospitals to their limits.\nGovernor Gavin Newsom is facing intense criticism over his refusal to share the data used by his administration to drive Covid policy decisions. State health officials said the metric is complicated, and would only confuse the public if released.\nThe stay-at-home order had been in place for Southern California, the San Joaquin Valley and the Bay Area, which are home to over 90% of the state's residents.\nThe region is still under restrictions, however - non-essential businesses are still to remain closed and restaurants must serve outdoors only.\nThe Biden administration is proposing another economic rescue package, this one worth $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn).\nHowever, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday he was against \"an imprecise deluge of borrowed money that would direct huge sums toward those who don't need it\"."

      "text": "More than 180 people were arrested in 10 Dutch cities as protesters defying a curfew clashed with riot police for a third night running.\nShops in Rotterdam were looted and police used water cannon, as rioters resisted latest Covid restrictions.\nPrime Minister Mark Rutte condemned \"criminal violence\" and the justice minister said the curfew would remain.\nThe Dutch chief of police said the riots no longer had \"anything to do with the basic right to demonstrate\".\nThe Netherlands has had nearly one million confirmed Covid cases since the start of the outbreak, with more than 13,500 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University in the US, which is tracking the pandemic. \nThe government recently introduced a night-time curfew which runs from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) to 04:30. Anyone caught violating it faces a \u20ac95 (\u00a384) fine.\nThere were further violent scenes in many towns and cities. Riot police clashed with protesters in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, as well as Amersfoort, Den Bosch, Alphen and Helmond.\nSome of the worst disturbances were in the south of Rotterdam where police said 10 officers were hurt. Across the country 184 people were arrested. Amsterdam's mayor appealed to parents to keep young people indoors.\nFires were lit on the streets of The Hague, where police on bicycles attempted to move small clusters of men who threw stones and fireworks. There was violence in the southern city of Den Bosch, where rioters set off fireworks, broke windows, looted a supermarket and overturned cars. \nA woman living near Den Bosch train station told Dutch radio that masked youths had left a trail of destruction in the city centre. \"I saw windows smashed and fireworks going off. Really crazy, just like a war zone,\" the woman said. Roads into the city were closed to stop people joining the rioters and Mayor Jack Mikkers imposed an emergency order banning gatherings on Tuesday.\nThe ignition of discontent has rocked the core of Dutch society. \nIn the absence of any legitimate way to socialise, is this simply an outlet for young men to feel part of something, their masks concealing their identities and enabling them to violently channel their frustrations?\nThere are more sinister influences at play. Messages on social media, overt and covert, have whipped up anger. Misinformation has even been spread by some politicians.\nSome feared a curfew would be a tipping point, as Dutch restrictions tighten while some neighbouring countries relax their rules. The vast majority of people in the Netherlands are peacefully observing the curfew.\nThe unrest was initially seen as a response to the first \"stay-at-home\" order imposed since Nazi occupation during World War Two. That notion has been dismissed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who said the rioters were simply criminals and would be treated as such. \nBut there are simmering anxieties in Dutch towns and cities, and with less than two months before a general election, voters are vulnerable and the streets volatile. \nThere has been widespread shock at the violence. In Rotterdam, where police used water cannon during clashes with rioters, Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb signed an emergency decree, giving police broader powers of arrest. He reacted furiously to shops being looted in the south of the city, condemning \"shameless thieves, I can't call it anything else\".\nThe prime minister said the police had the government's full support: \"The riots have nothing to do with protesting or fighting for freedom.\" \nRotterdam shop-owner Emrah K\u00f6ker said he had no words for what he had seen. \"How can this happen in the Netherlands?\" he asked Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhuis challenged anyone to explain what looting a shop had to do with coronavirus.\nThe mayor of Den Bosch said police had struggled to respond to the violence because they were needed in other nearby towns.\nFootball fans of the Willem II club took to the streets of Tilburg to \"protect their city\" against rioters, news site Brabants Dagblad reports.\nMayors in several cities have vowed to introduce emergency measures in an effort to prevent more disturbances."

She argued that plans to raise taxes must be seen in the context of financing bigger investments necessary to make the US economy competitive.\n\"The focus now is not on tax increases. It is on programmes to help us get through the pandemic,\" she stressed.\nJanet Yellen was previously chair of the US Federal Reserve. She was known for focusing more attention on the impact of the central bank's policies on workers and the costs of America's rising inequality.\nBefore then-President Barack Obama named her to lead the Fed in 2014, she had served as one of its board members for a decade, including four years as vice-chair.\nDonald Trump bucked Washington tradition when he opted not to appoint Ms Yellen to a second four-year term at the Fed. \nHowever, her climb to the top of the economics profession had made her a feminist icon in the economics world.\nWhen she left the Fed in 2018, many paid tribute to her leadership by imitating her signature look of a blazer with a popped collar.\nMs Yellen is seen as someone able to satisfy both progressive and centrist members of Mr Biden's Democratic party. Her nomination to lead the Fed in 2014 won support from some Republicans.\nHer focus on employment, rather than inflation, gave her a reputation of favouring low interest rates, which spur economic activity by making it less expensive to borrow money.\nBut under her leadership, the Fed raised interest rates for the first time since 2008 - albeit less aggressively than some more conservative commentators supported.\nHer stewardship of that process has won praise on Wall Street, even as it remains hotly debated."

During this time, the UK-EU relationship continued much as it was before - including the Erasmus scheme.\nNow that the Brexit transition period has ended, Scotland, England and Wales will no longer participate in Erasmus, but Northern Ireland's access will continue.\nMr Lochhead called the ending of the programme a \"huge blow\" for Scottish students, community groups and adult learners.\nLast week he held what the Scottish government described as \"productive talks\" with European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth Mariya Gabriel to explore Scotland continuing with the Erasmus scheme.\nThe government has now welcomed the support of 145 MEPs who urged the European Commission to explore the idea.\nMr Lochhead said:  \"I have already had a virtual meeting with Commissioner Gabriel. We agreed that withdrawing from Erasmus is highly regrettable and we will continue to explore with the EU how to maximise Scotland's continued engagement with the programme.\n\"I have also spoken with my Welsh government counterpart and agreed to keep in close contact.\"\nThe Scottish and Welsh governments have criticised the Turing Scheme as \"a lesser imitation of the real thing\".\nThey said it offers no support for our adult education or youth work, and reduces support for colleges, schools and vocational training sectors.\nIn a joint statement from Mr Lochhead and Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams, they said: \"The Scottish and Welsh governments have always been united in our view that participation in Erasmus+ is in the best interests for the whole of the UK. \n\"The UK government's decision not to associate to the programme is therefore deeply disappointing, a decision that will see support for our most deprived communities cut, and opportunities for all our learners reduced.\"\nA spokesman for the EU Commission said the decision would mean organisations and individuals from across the UK, including Scotland, \"will be deprived of opportunities for exchange and co-operation\".\nBut he added that the UK would still be able to participate in Erasmus+ in a limited way as a \"non-associated Third Country\".\nCameron McKail, from Edinburgh, worked as a labourer for two years straight after leaving school.\nAt age 18 he secured a place with Erasmus+ and travelled to Strona in Italy, where he heard about employment experiences of young people around Europe.\nThe 25-year-old has since been to college, studied community education at the University of Edinburgh and secured work with Erasmus, helping other young people who want to improve their employment opportunities.\n\"Sometimes it's young people's first time out of Scotland,\" he said. \"To open up those opportunities is invaluable, particularly down a community path. \n\"For young people who are outwith mainstream education, maybe on work or employability courses, it's really important for them to be valued and to be afforded these experiences as well. Sometimes it's those young people who need that support.\n\"Erasmus+ allows young people who might never have the experience to go away and meet other people from alternative cultures - to open their eyes and their minds as well to the world and understand it a little bit better.\"\nLast month, Boris Johnson announced the UK would replace Erasmus with the Turing Scheme, which would include countries outside Europe.\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \"The UK decided to not participate in the next Erasmus+ programme as it was not in the interest of UK taxpayers and our net contribution would have been around \u00a32bn over the programme. \n\"The new global Turing Scheme is designed to provide thousands of students across all of the UK the opportunity to study and work abroad, beyond EU countries, and will include additional support for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. \n\"We will continue to work with the sector and devolved administrations to deliver the programme, backed by over \u00a3100m, ensuring students from all backgrounds benefit from the opportunity to learn across the world.\" "

      "text": "The number of people out of work in the UK has continued to rise, with those aged 25 to 34 facing the biggest risk of losing their jobs.\nIn the three months to November, people in that age group had a redundancy rate of 16.2 per 1,000, a fivefold increase on the same period a year earlier.\nUnemployment rose to 5% from 4.9% as Covid continued to hit the jobs market.\nSome 1.72 million were jobless, the Office for National Statistics said, the highest level in five years.\nThat was 418,000 more than in the same period the previous year, the biggest increase since late 2009.\nAbigail Ward, 27, freely admits that she was \"a bit naive\" when she began her latest job hunt after being made redundant as a store manager at J Crew in London last September.\nHaving spent the past five years since graduating in retail management, she has a passion for bricks-and-mortar retail and \"the value of face-to-face customer interactions\" - and it's an area she wants to stay in.\n\"I knew it would be hard, but I've been in this position before,\" she told the BBC.\n\"Back then, it only took me three or four weeks to find a role and maybe 10 job applications, so it all happened quite seamlessly, whereas this time around, it's definitely been a lot more difficult.\n\"I've probably sent off around 30 to 40 job applications in the last six months, the majority of which just go into the abyss. You never hear a word.\"\nHowever, Abigail has managed to get to the final interview stage for a job - \"with me and just one other candidate\" - on four separate occasions. \n\"Unfortunately, I've missed out on each of those occasions,\" she says.\n\"There are so many hundreds of applications and it's so competitive,\" she adds. \"It's definitely been a big challenge.\"\nThe hospitality industry was worst hit by the rise in joblessness, followed by manufacturing.\nIn both sectors, the number of people unemployed was up by more than 50,000 on the previous year.\nAcross all age groups, redundancies rose to a record high of 14.2 per 1,000 people.\nHowever, job vacancies also rose, with 81,000 new openings reported in the three months.\nONS deputy chief executive Sam Beckett told the BBC that the UK had not seen such rises in unemployment since the global financial crisis.\n\"Payroll numbers show the number of workers on payroll have fallen by over 828,000 since the pandemic began,\" she added.\nEmployment was still at \"relatively high levels\" compared with other countries, Ms Beckett said, but workers aged 16 to 24 were suffering some of the biggest falls in employment.\nHowever, she added: \"We've currently got over 4.5 million people on the furlough scheme, so that does complicate the picture when you're trying to interpret what's going on in the labour market.\"\nWhile the main rate of unemployment has reached 5% for the first time in nearly five years, and this morning's numbers saw the largest increase in the numbers unemployed since the financial crisis, the chancellor must now be tempted to extend the furlough scheme to co-ordinate with the rollout of the post-vaccination reopening of the economy.\nThere are some bad numbers in this release, as would be expected from the pandemic restrictions, but they were expected to be a little worse. In the quarter to November, there were 418,000 extra unemployed over the same period in 2019 - the sharpest annual rise since the 2009 financial crisis.\nThe rate of redundancies reached a record of 14 per 1,000 people. Loss of jobs was concentrated in sectors such as retail and hospitality, most affected by social restrictions, which were reintroduced at the end of the period. Young people also faced the sharpest drops in employment. The jobs numbers are yet to reflect the current return to national lockdowns.\nThough a significant rise over the past few pandemic-afflicted months, unemployment at 5% is still low by international standards and is being kept in check by the government's job retention furlough scheme. The current plan is to end the costly scheme in April, which economists expect would see a sharp jump in jobless figures to 6% or 7%. \nBut as the government continues to communicate caution about how fast restrictions on the economy will be lifted, business groups are adamant that the scheme needs to be extended into the early summer, or at least linked to the success of the vaccination programme.\n\"This crisis has gone on far longer than any of us hoped - and every job lost as a result is a tragedy,\" said Chancellor Rishi Sunak.\n\"Whilst the NHS is working hard to protect people with the vaccine, we're throwing everything we've got at supporting businesses, individuals and families. \n\"Our Plan for Jobs includes grants and loans so that firms can keep employees on, the furlough scheme to help protect jobs, and programmes like Kickstart alongside record investment in skills so that people can find their first job, their next job or a new job if needed,\" Mr Sunak added.\nWith no end in sight to the current lockdown measures, many firms fear that they may not be able to survive the pandemic, with pubs and restaurants bearing the brunt of the restrictions.\n\"The pandemic continues to rip through the labour market,\" said Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors.\n\"A return to tighter restrictions late last year will have stretched businesses' ability to retain staff. Meanwhile, the furlough scheme will have provided an invaluable cushion for many firms, preventing unemployment from edging up even further.\"\nIt is \"crucial\" for the chancellor to extend the furlough scheme and other Covid-19 economic support beyond the spring, he said.\n\"The forthcoming Budget is a vital moment to help firms retain, retrain and rehire workers as the vaccine rolls out. In particular, the government should provide a relief for employers' National Insurance contributions and support reskilling opportunities to shore up the recovery.\""

      "tags": "Nadhim Zahawi,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Supplies of vaccines are \"tight\" but the UK believes it will receive enough doses to meet its targets, the vaccine minister has said.\nNadhim Zahawi told BBC Breakfast manufacturers were \"confident\" they would deliver for the UK amid warnings of production delays.\nIt comes as the EU said it might tighten vaccine export controls.\nCountries should avoid \"vaccine nationalism\" and ensure a fair global supply, Mr Zahawi said.\nMeanwhile, more than 100,000 people have died with Covid-19 in the UK, after 1,631 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded in the daily figures.\nMr Zahawi said the vaccination programme was still on track to deliver a first dose to 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February and to offer all adults their first dose by autumn.\nHe said the UK had supplies of the Oxford vaccine manufactured domestically by AstraZeneca as well as the Pfizer one, which is made in Belgium.\nThe government is also planning to publish figures on the take-up of the vaccine by ethnicity from Thursday, following concerns that some black, Asian and ethnic minority communities were more hesitant to get the jab.\n\"I'm confident we will meet our mid-February target and continue beyond that,\" Mr Zahawi told the BBC.\n\"Supplies are tight, they continue to be, these are new manufacturing processes,\" he added. \"It's lumpy and bumpy, it gets better and stabilises and improves going forward.\"\nBut he declined to say that he had received guarantees about the number of doses the UK would receive from Pfizer or other manufacturers and refused to confirm how many doses had already arrived.\nThe prime minister's spokesman said AstraZeneca had committed to delivering two million doses a week to the UK, and the government was not expecting any changes to that supply.\nDowning Street also rejected German media reports claiming a very low efficacy rate for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine among older people, saying they had been denied by Oxford University, AstraZeneca and the German health ministry.\nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the cabinet the trials showed similar immune responses in younger and older adults.\nAnd England's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has defended the UK's strategy of extending the time between first and second doses of coronavirus vaccines from three to 12 weeks in order to immunise more people. \nHe told the Downing Street coronavirus briefing on Tuesday that the \"great majority\" of protection came from the first dose.\nHe also said there was \"no evidence\" that immunity waned between three and 12 weeks after the first dose was administered.\nProf Whitty said: \"We thought very carefully about what the balance of this is, but the balance of risk in terms of reducing the number of deaths in the community - and I really want to stress that, that is the aim of this - is to maximise the number of people who get that first dose, where the great majority of protection comes from.\"\nThe latest tension over supply of the Covid vaccine is another illustration of just how fragile this issue is.\nThere are huge global demands for Covid vaccine, limited raw materials and constraints on manufacturing.\nThe UK already has enough vaccine to jab all the highest-risk groups by mid-February, although not all of it has been packaged up or been through the final safety checks.\nThis explains why ministers are confident about the immediate target for the over-70s, health and care workers and the extremely clinically vulnerable.\nBut what is in doubt is how quickly the UK can vaccinate in the medium term.\nWith the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in the UK those supply routes are more guaranteed.\nBut the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is made in Belgium. The UK, like the rest of Europe, is affected by the problems with manufacturing that are being experienced with that vaccine.\nWith Europe experiencing major problems rolling out its vaccination programme - per head of population five times fewer vaccines have been delivered - this is a story that is going to rumble on for months.\nThe UK has placed orders for 367 million doses of vaccines from seven manufacturers, Mr Zahawi said. \"As vaccines come along we will get more volume, millions more in the weeks and months to come,\" he added.\nThe tension over vaccine supplies increased after UK-based AstraZeneca warned the EU it would have to reduce planned deliveries because of production problems. Pfizer-BioNTech has also said supplies will be temporarily lower as it works to increase capacity at its Belgian factory.\nIt has prompted the EU to accuse AstraZeneca of failing to meet its commitments and to warn that it might require all companies producing Covid vaccines to provide \"early notification\" whenever they planned to export supplies out of the EU.\n\"The thing to do now is not to go down the dead end of vaccine nationalism. It's to work together to protect our people,\" Mr Zahawi said.\n\"No-one is safe until the whole world is safe.\"\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock subsequently said the UK government \"oppose protectionism in all its forms\" and urged all international partners to \"be collaborative\" and \"work closely together\" on vaccine distribution.\nHe added that the EU's warning that it could restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc was \"unfortunate and especially so in the midst of a pandemic\".\nMeanwhile, the head of NHS England earlier told MPs coronavirus could become a \"much more treatable disease\" over the next six to 18 months, with the hope of a return to a \"much more normal future\".\nSir Simon Stevens told the Health and Social Care Committee: \"The first half of the year, vaccination is going to be crucial.\n\"I think a lot of us in the health service are increasingly hopeful that in the second half of the year and beyond we will also see more therapeutics and more treatments for coronavirus.\"\nHe also said it \"would be great\" if the Covid vaccine and flu vaccine were combined into a single jab, if not for next winter then future ones.\nAnd he said vaccines were being used as fast as they arrived in the NHS, with more than half of those aged 75-79 having now had their first dose.\nThe UK aims to offer Covid vaccination to every adult by autumn. \nMr Zahawi said confidence in the vaccines was high, with 85% of people saying they would accept the jab.\nBut he said those who were hesitant \"skew heavily\" towards black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. \nThe government is providing \u00a323m of funding to 60 local councils and voluntary groups to boost vaccine take-up among groups such as older people, disabled people, and people from ethnic minority backgrounds.\nIt comes as celebrities such as comedians Romesh Ranganathan and Meera Syal and cricketer Moeen Ali appeared in a video urging people in their communities to get vaccinated.\nMr Zahawi told ITV's Good Morning Britain his uncle had died from Covid-19 last week. He had been eligible for vaccination but caught the virus before he could receive it, the minister said.\nThis \"grim and horrible\" experience made him determined to ensure that the most vulnerable were protected as quickly as possible, Mr Zahawi said.\nSir Simon said there was concern about vaccine hesitancy in some groups, where there were access problems as well as \"systematic attempts to misinform and lie about the vaccine programme targeted particularly at minority populations, and - in some cases - long-standing mistrust of public services\".\nHe said disruption to vaccine deliveries from EU export restrictions was not thought to be likely.\nIn other developments, the UK has offered to carry out genomic sequencing for other countries around the world to help identify further new variants.\nPublic Health England said it would give \"crucial early warning\" of any mutations that might cause the virus to spread faster, make people more ill or possibly reduce the effectiveness of vaccines."

      "text": "The total number of deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales has reached its highest weekly total of the pandemic.\nThere were 467 deaths in the week ending 15 January, which is 13 more than the week before.\nThis was nearly 40% of all registered deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nBoth Betsi Cadwaladr and Cwm Taf Morgannwg health boards saw their highest weekly numbers, more than experienced during the first wave.\nBetsi Cadwaladr had 74 deaths while Cwm Taf Morgannwg had 116.\nUnlike during the peak in the first wave in 2020, Wales is also now seeing higher numbers of deaths in north Wales and west Wales.\nIn north-east Wales, where there have been the highest case rates of Covid-19 in recent weeks, there were 30 deaths of Flintshire residents, including 25 in hospital. In Wrexham, there were 27 deaths - with 21 in hospital.\nCwm Taf Morgannwg health board saw 49 hospital deaths in Bridgend - the highest weekly number in Wales. There were also 33 patients who died in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) and six in Merthyr Tydfil.\nAll counties recorded at least three deaths involving Covid-19 and the total number of deaths in Wales, up to and registered by 15 January, was 5,884.\nWhen deaths registered over the following few days are counted, there is now a total of 6,074.\nRCT, with 752 deaths, has the largest number in Wales, followed by Cardiff with 637, up to the latest week. \nWhen looking at crude mortality rates, the highest number of deaths - when taking into account the size of populations in England and Wales - are Welsh areas: RCT, followed by Merthyr Tydfil and Blaenau Gwent.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, continue to be above the five-year average.\nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing.\nIn Wales, the number of deaths from all causes fell from 1,198 in the previous week - the highest recorded during the pandemic - to 1,170. But this was still 314 (36.7%) higher than the five-year average for that week. \nThis means deaths have been more than the peak in the first wave of the pandemic - 1,169 deaths in the week ending 17 April 2020 - for two weeks in a row.\nThe highest proportion of excess deaths was 84.1% in London."

It didn't come as a surprise I have to say, because the situation is just so bad I think there is no other way out of it at the moment. I just wish we had known earlier on and it would have been easier to plan.\"\nThe pressures of juggling home-schooling with her career mean she is working at night when the children have gone to bed.\n\"I don't even try to work during the day with the children around because I've just realised it's just not possible.\n\"My husband is working full-time but I'm only working part-time, I'm teaching at university so I still have quite flexible hours - apart from obviously teaching hours - it just means that I have to work in the evening or over the weekend, just organise yourself differently.\"\nShe said it was \"best not to have too high expectations\" when it came to guessing when lockdown would end and schools would reopen. \n\"Like we saw in the first lockdown in spring, in the end it was quite a bit longer than we had all thought,\" she said.\n\"I would hope they could go back in March, that's my hope for now but I think we'll just have to wait and see what will happen with the numbers over the next few weeks, months and just take it from there really.\"\nA father called Ron, from Bridgend, told the phone-in with Dot Davies he was predominantly worried about the effects on children, particularly in the south Wales valleys.\n\"I just see children deteriorating on a regular basis. I can only speak about my own - I have a teenage daughter and her mental health, her lack of access to her school, her teachers, to her peers, will cause more harm than the virus will cause children.\n\"It feels like we are asking our children to donate their kidneys to the vulnerable. We are throwing them under the bus as far as I'm concerned.\"\nAnna, 16, who is studying for her GCSEs at Ysgol Gyfun Gwyr, Swansea, said the decision to keep schools and colleges closed was \"a big disappointment\". \n\"The idea of staying in the house until February fills me with dread because we've been in the house for months,\" she told Newyddion.\nAfter a case of Covid-19 in her school, she said she had to self-isolate, adding: \"It's been an age since I last saw my friends, went to school, and really learned.\n\"It's really hard. We've been back in school since Wednesday and doing everything online but it's nigh-on impossible. It's not the same.\n\"It's really hard to learn. There's this feeling of 'why am I even bothering?' - I really want to go back but I appreciate that might not be possible because people are dying. It's not an easy situation.\" \nHer mock assessments before her final assessments - which were brought in to replace exams - have been cancelled until the return to school, which she said has taken away some of the pressure.\n\"Without practising, there's a lot of uncertainty. What's going to be in the assessment? So, it is nice to hear they've cancelled them. It's a difficult situation so cancelling them takes a bit of the pressure off children and young people my age.\" \nMother-of-three Amanda Williams from Bridgend told the Local Democracy Reporting Service she was glad schools would remain closed and hoped it would minimise the spread of the virus.\n\"I don't believe schools are safe to open at the moment,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"Until they can classify exactly what the main symptoms are in children I think it's a risk to send children back to school and it's a risk with these new variants.\"\nMrs Williams lives in Bridgend county borough, where infection rates are the highest among all Welsh local authority areas. One of her relatives is currently on a ventilator at Bridgend's Princess of Wales Hospital with Covid-19.\n\"In the last week I've heard of a lot of people passing away such as friends of friends. It's starting to get closer to home.\"\u00a0\nSarah Curley, a maths teacher and mother of twins, also from Bridgend, said she would \"rather be in school\" but agreed schools remaining shut was the \"safest option\".\nShe said: \"In school each day I come into contact with 100-odd pupils and we don't wear PPE.\"\u00a0\nMs Curley said she was glad her school, Coleg Cymunedol Y Dderwen in Bridgend, would not be welcoming students back on Monday, as originally planned, because of the area's high infection rates.\n\"My anxiety was through the roof around Christmas. I could see the numbers going up and I was thinking, 'I've got to go back into school next week'.\""

There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination",
      "text": "A decision to allow NI back office health workers to be vaccinated at an early stage goes against the guidance of the government's advisory body, its deputy chair has said.\nThese staff are part of phase one of NI's Covid-19 vaccine rollout. \nProf Anthony Harnden said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) had made front-line health workers the \"clear\" priority. \nHe said giving a dose to backroom staff took it away from those at higher risk.\nAs of Monday, 159,642 people in Northern Ireland had received a first coronavirus vaccine dose.\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Health daily figures reported an additional 16 Covid-19 related deaths and 550 new cases, bringing the total number of positive tests to 101,291. \nSince Monday, there has been a reduction in the number of inpatients, patients receiving intensive care treatment, and the number of patients ventilated. \nLast week, the Department of Health (DoH) confirmed staff in non-patient facing roles, including those in IT and accounts, were eligible for the vaccine in the first stage. \nIt also said that the decision \"does not go against JCVI guidance\".\nBBC News NI has contacted the department for a response to Prof Harnden's comments.\nSpeaking on BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, Prof Harnden said vaccinating back office health staff did not follow the JCVI's guidance.\nIt advises the first priorities for any Covid-19 vaccination programme \"should be the prevention of Covid-19 mortality and the protection of health and social care staff and systems\".\nHe said that people have to \"remember that for every dose you give to somebody else who isn't hugely at risk, you're denying somebody at risk that first dose\". \nProf Harnden added the JCVI \"really feel quite strongly that it should be just front-line healthcare and social care workers\". \n\"We purposefully put the front-line worker into our advice and into our strategy.\n\"The reason we said that was threefold. One, because of their exposure risk; two, because of the possibility that they would transmit to vulnerable elderly people that they were looking after who we know are hugely at risk; and, third, to keep the NHS running at a time of crisis.\"\nLast week, a DoH spokesperson said the department took the decision to vaccinate staff in its Business Services Organisation (BSO) because they help ensure that health trusts and organisations \"can effectively deliver vital services\".\n\"Protecting BSO staff via vaccination to continue to deliver this support is essential for the smooth and continued functioning of the HSC (Health and Social Care system) during the pandemic and particularly at this time of extreme pressure on our health service. \n\"If the back office is down, the front line can't operate effectively.\"\nProf Harnden said this reason, of keeping the health system running smoothly by vaccinating back office staff, was a \"stretch of the argument\". \n\"One could argue that actually lots of systems in the UK need to work very smoothly and there are lots of different groups clamouring to receive the vaccine as soon as possible and I fully understand that.\n\"The JCVI took a really strong stance on this that what we wanted to do was protect [from] hospitalisations and deaths.\""

      "tags": "Public health,Coronavirus vaccines,Healthcare,Netherlands,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Dutch army is cleared to help hospitals, intensive care units borrow beds from other wards, patients are sent to Germany for treatment, routine operations are postponed, a nationwide lockdown is in place - and still no vaccinations.\nIn a proudly well-organised country, with a well-funded health service, the first Dutch nationals will receive their coronavirus jabs on Wednesday - ten days after their European neighbours and nearly a month after the UK. \nThe Dutch government has come in for stinging criticism. One former public health director, Roel Coutinho, warned the country's \"shameful\" vaccination strategy was \"going to cost lives\".  \nDuring an emergency debate in parliament, opposition politicians called the approach \"chaotic and confusing\". \n\"Striking mismanagement by government,\" was the assessment of Tim, a doctor in general practice here. \"We've almost had a year to plan ahead, arrange logistics and update software. But it's all coming down to the last moment.\"\n\"Embarrassing,\" lamented Arjen Joosse, a Dutch oncologist. \"Too slow in preparation and wrong choices.\" \nOne of the main delays was caused by an IT system which needed to be upgraded to allow local health authorities to track appointments and check which vaccine each patient has received. \nThe systemic delays since the start of the pandemic are symptomatic of the Netherlands' bureaucratic health service, set up for efficiency but with many disparate elements making it inflexible.\nCovid-19 has exposed it as sluggish when required to respond to rapidly shifting realities. \nTim, the Dutch GP (he declined to give his full name), told me: \"We're lacking a crisis commander in what is essentially a war-like situation\".\nAlan Wouda, a 23-year old student, said the Dutch were \"blinded by our nuchterheid (sobriety) - too stubborn to acknowledge we made mistakes\".\nAnother student, Joelle Hibbel, asked \"is it possible to be baffled and raging with anger at the same time?\" \n\"That's how I feel about how the Dutch government is handling the pandemic in general and the vaccination process in particular.\"\nThe embattled health minister, Hugo de Jonge, said the Dutch were \"prioritising safety\", and suggested some countries like the UK had cut corners to start vaccinating sooner. \nThe UK gave emergency approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, but the EU's European Medicines Agency took longer to issue a conditional marketing authorisation. \nMr De Jonge initially defended the late start and dismissed criticism by saying \"it's not a competition\".\nMass vaccinations will be available in all 25 Dutch local health authority locations by 18 January.\nThe Netherlands assumed the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine would be ready for use first. Unlike the Pfizer one, it does not need to be stored at extremely low temperatures and so can be administered more easily by local medics.\nBut that meant the logistics were not in place to distribute the Pfizer/BioNTech drug when it arrived in the Netherlands on 27 December. \nMr De Jonge eventually conceded this week that he could have acted faster. \n\"We have proven insufficiently agile to be able to accommodate the changes,\" he said. \"I could have asked the health boards earlier to prepare... because of their knowledge and expertise with large-scale vaccination campaigns.\"  \nWith parliamentary elections on 17 March, some parties are keen to appeal to voters anxious about the rapid development of these vaccines. \nRival hashtags like #ikwildieprikniet (I don't want the jab) and #ikwildieprik (I want the jab) have been routinely trending on Twitter.  \nNeighbours in The Hague have received calling cards stamped with QR codes through their letterboxes, with a link to anti-vaccination propaganda.\nActivist groups like \"Virus Truth\" have staged regular protests outside parliament. \nThe leader of the populist Forum for Democracy Party, Thierry Baudet, is among the most staunch and influential sceptics. \nHe continues to claim in tweets that Covid is hardly worse than the flu. But Covid is five to 25 times more deadly than a seasonal flu infection, despite the ongoing myths.\nA recent Ipsos survey of 1,000 people in the Netherlands found initial reluctance to receive the vaccine subsiding, with approximately 75% now willing to be immunised. \nRead more on the Dutch coronavirus crisis:\nThe Netherlands brought in a relatively relaxed, so-called \"intelligent\" lockdown during the first Covid wave. \nBut it is now facing record high infection rates and has been forced to introduce stricter measures, some of which it had initially ruled out. Face masks only became mandatory inside public places last month.\n\"Judge us in six months time\" was among the responses to my report last April that the Dutch were gambling with a high-risk strategy. \nAs the vaccines roll out, once again the request is: don't judge us yet.\nThe first Dutch person to be inoculated will be Sanna Elkadiri, a 39-year-old care home nurse. \nSeventeen of the 124 residents in her institution reportedly died within a month. \nMs Elkadiri will receive the jab in Veghel, one of three locations where vaccination will start on Wednesday.\nThe Dutch health ministry has made an initial 30,000 vaccines available for a select group of healthcare workers. \nWhen asked about the delay, the ministry told the BBC it had been busy upgrading IT systems and training call-centre staff on the scripts to use with people booking their vaccinations.

The vast majority of children want to be in school as home-learning is not as good as being in front of teachers.\n\"But we have to understand the seriousness of the situation we face and have the confidence of staff that when they are in school, they are safe.\"\nShe said there was no evidence the new variant was more transmissible in children than adults.\nSchools will only stay closed after 18 January \"if that's the only thing we can do to suppress the virus\", she added.\n\"Clearly any decision to close schools for face-to-face contact for the majority of children is a really really difficult decision and it's a decision which has grave consequences for children.\n\"Education has a role to play in helping suppress the virus and helping our NHS to cope and helping those doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals who are on the front line and struggling so hard to look after us all.\" \nSome schools had been due to open on Wednesday and others by 11 January with decisions made by local authorities - nurseries and other childcare settings remain open.\nTeaching unions had called for a delayed start to term amid concerns about the coronavirus variant.\nPlaid Cymru called for urgent help for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nJane Jenkins, head teacher at Moorland Primary School in Splott, Cardiff, said: \"We started planning for this before Christmas. It's not really any surprise.\n\"We learnt a lot of lessons in the first lockdown about the difficulties some children and families had with online learning, so we've been able to tailor our support much better this time around.\"\nMother-of-two Clare Ferguson-Walker from Tavernspite, Pembrokeshire, said parents were suffering from \"exhaustion\", but it was the right decision to close schools.\n\"In terms of how it's going to impact on families, I just think we're all tearing our hair out.\n\"Trying to get our kids to actually engage with online learning is a massive task... my kids just don't want to do it, I'm the last person they want to listen to.\"\nChanelle Taylor, a painter and decorator from Caerphilly, said she was worried about balancing schooling with running her business. \nShe said: \"The most worrying concern I have is that with my daughter goes to a Welsh school and we're not Welsh speakers. \n\"It's made a big impact at home trying to home-school her as well as me trying to find childcare to keep my business afloat. \n\"At the moment I'm managing with my mum doing childcare, but it's difficult for my mum because my brother has Asperger's so she also cares for him. At the moment I'm limiting my quotations and working as much as I can without bringing more stress home for my mother.\"\nSara Powell-Davies, who is also from Caerphilly, said she had struggled to get childcare for her four-year-old daughter and other parents she had spoken to had been frustrated by the timing of the announcement. \nShe said: \"You can't do things like this last minute, it's not fair on parents and it's not fair on teachers and schools. \n\"We've been scrambling around now trying to sort out childcare.\"\nStephen Reicher, a professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews and a member of the Independent Sage advisory group, said the focus needed to shift away from keeping schools open to keeping them safe.\n\"A lot of the talk has been about whether schools should be open or closed. Everyone wants schools to be open. We should also be thinking about the best way of making schools safe so we can reopen them as soon as possible,\" he said.\nHe suggested reducing class sizes, hiring more teachers and more spaces and dividing classes.\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said support needed to be made urgently available to children from disadvantaged backgrounds who \"will now fall further behind with their education\".\nShe added: \"Hubs for vulnerable children and the children of key workers are also a necessity alongside an immunisation programme for all school staff so that schools can become a safer environment upon re-opening.\"\nNAHT Cymru, which represents head teachers, welcomed the announcement, saying it had been \"inevitable for some time\".\nDirector Laura Doel added: \"It is uncertain whether the next two weeks will be enough time to ensure a fully risk-assessed plan is put in place.\"\nThe Association of Schools and College Leaders Cymru questioned why it had taken so long for the minister to reach a decision.\nBut Ms Williams said: \"We need to reassess the evidence, which comes through on a daily basis, which makes decision-making really hard. Sometimes, when the data arrives, you simply have to act\". \nThe decision in Wales came as the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre increased the Covid threat level to five - its highest level.\nLevel five warns of a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\", according to the UK government's website.\nWales has been under \"stay-at-home\" lockdown restrictions since 20 December after a rise in Covid-19 cases, with more than 31,000 cases in the two weeks over Christmas.\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas, and nine of the UK's ten most infected counties.\nHowever, the latest available data shows both England's and Northern Ireland's Covid case rate has risen above Wales.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced a set of new national restrictions for England, with schools and colleges closed until the end of February half term and pupils being taught online.\nScotland has announced a legal requirement to stay at home, with schools to be closed.\nMost pupils in Northern Ireland were not expected to return to school this week as had been planned.\nOn Monday, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said closing schools in Wales would be a \"last resort\"."

It was to prohibit disclosure or publication of the very existence of the proceedings\".\nHe said: \"It is in effect what is equivalent to what in England has been described as a super injunction. That is what in effect it amounts to because it prohibits even the disclosure of the proceedings. \n\"The importance of this case lies with the way the Restriction Order impinged on the open justice principle. If there was a need for an order restricting the disclosure of any material, that is an order to be sought from the employment judge.\"\nThe Court of Session heard the employment tribunal claim for \u00a32.6m damages was brought in July, 2019, by the inquiry's former lead junior counsel, John Halley.\nA news release, issued by SCAI in October 2019, confirmed existence of the claim and a denial that Lady Smith had discriminated against Mr Halley. An initial hearing took place that month and Mr Halley abandoned the tribunal two months later.\nBut Mr McBrearty QC said the SCAI press release did not include the full outline of the claim\nHe said: \"All that the media was to be entitled to publish was that which the respondent had considered able to include in a press release in circumstances to which the respondent was herself party in the proceedings.\"\nThe BBC is seeking declarators from the Court of Session stating that Lady Smith's restriction orders were unlawful. \nRoddy Dunlop QC said the BBC had the option to present to Lady Smith what it wanted to report on in the case, as per the detail of the media restriction order, and then get her permission to publish but failed to do so.\nHe said: \"That simple request is all that needed to be done and it wasn't resorted to. That's why the alternative remedy aspect of this is a problem to the BBC. \n\"There needs to be a practical effect, the entitlement to publish could have been obtained at any point by asking.\"\nMr Dunlop pointed out that the original restriction orders objected to by the BBC have now been replaced by a new order issued in March last year.\nHe said: \"What is the point of challenging orders which cease to have any potency.\n\"Why is it we continue to expend grey matter, and more importantly public funds on both sides, in fighting on something which is in any view within the terms of the reference [of the SCAI inquiry] and within article ten [of Human Rights legislation].\"\nOn Wednesday Mr Dunlop will continue his submissions before Lord Boyd."

      "text": "Keeping schools shut during the Covid pandemic is \"almost like systematic neglect\" to disadvantaged pupils, a head teacher has said.\nCardiff head Armando Di-Finizio said there was a \"fair degree of trauma\" among pupils because of the lockdowns.\nOne expert said children from disadvantaged backgrounds were falling furthest behind academically.\nThe Welsh Government said it ensured vulnerable children could continue to attend school.\nBefore the pandemic the proportion of pupils receiving free school meals who achieved five or more GCSEs was 32% lower than the figure for other pupils in Wales. \nAt Eastern High School, where 47% of children receive free school meals, Mr Di-Finizio said the challenges of lockdown were greater for pupils who may not have support or structure at home for learning. \nMr Di-Finizio told Wales Live he did not think the balance was right \"between those who are genuinely vulnerable\" with the virus and young people who are vulnerable in terms of their welfare and wellbeing and their academic progress.\n\"I think there would have been other ways to handle this because we are seeing students struggling because of it and the attainment gap is widening for this generation,\" he said.\n\"It's almost like systematic neglect of young people that is going on day after day, week after week, month after month.\n\"We have to somehow pull this back because I do wonder one day, how the children will look back and judge us in terms of our responses.\" \nAnother concern since the pandemic began, he said, was the fact the number of child protection cases at his school has doubled.\n\"I don't want to sound alarmist, but I do believe it will take a number of years for us to unpick the traumas that young people go through because we don't know yet just what this lasting impact will be,\" he added.\nWelsh Chief Inspector of Schools Meilyr Rowlands, has previously said there was evidence of widening inequality in performance as a result of the pandemic. \nSocial Sciences Prof Chris Taylor, from Cardiff University, said this gap was continuing to widen.\n\"Closing schools exposes and accentuates the deep disadvantage that many families have across Wales in the different circumstances that they're in,\" Prof Taylor said.\nHome learning reduces the ability of schools \"to provide that level playing field\" for educational opportunities.\n\"Instead, we're relying on what families and households can produce and provide to support that learning,\" he said.\nProf Taylor added some children would \"feel like they've left school at the age of 14 or 15, instead of 18\" in terms of their learning, and the focus for them should be preparing for the next step in their education rather than exams that are not going to happen this summer.\nHe said some pupils who may have been planning to leave school at 16 should remain in education until they are 18 to \"remedy some of the missed opportunities\", and that summer school and activities should be put on to help address isolation.\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian MS, Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman, has called on the Welsh Government to publish a plan on how pupils will be helped to catch up with \"lost education\".\n\"Those children in more deprived areas have been doubly disadvantaged - coronavirus has been more prevalent in these areas, meaning they will have lost more school prior to the lockdown, and these children are less likely to have the means to access online learning,\" she said.\nA Welsh Government spokesman said it had provided \"more than 130,000 [electronic] devices\" since the start of the pandemic for pupils' home learning.\n\"We've also recruited more than 1,000 teaching and support staff to provide additional support for learners who may have missed out on teaching time due to the pandemic,\" he said. \nThe government has ensured vulnerable children, as well as children of critical workers, could continue to attend school throughout the pandemic, he added."

A previously unimaginable communication has become a regular part of the country's conversation.\nBut today that number has reached a terrible height. Every one of those 100,000 lives lost leaves its own story, and sorrow, behind.\nThis miserable landmark is a moment to remember, maybe, that what has happened in the last year, to our politics, to us all is not normal at all.

      "tags": "Ministry of Justice,David Lammy,Criminal justice system,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Labour is calling for juries to be cut from 12 members to seven, to stem the \"gravest crisis\" in the justice system since World War Two.\nShadow justice secretary David Lammy said action was needed to clear the backlog of thousands of cases.\nHe argued that smaller juries and the use of more temporary courts would allow socially distanced trials. \nThe government has not ruled out such a move but insists measures it is taking to clear the backlog are working.\nLast week four criminal justice watchdogs warned that courts in England and Wales were straining under pressure from the coronavirus pandemic.\nJury trials ground to a halt at the start of the first lockdown, when people were advised to stay at home except in limited circumstances. \nWhen they resumed, there were severe delays and numerous cancellations due to social-distancing requirements. \nRecent figures revealed that the number of unheard cases in crown courts had reached a record 54,000.\nThe backlog means some from last year may not go before a jury until 2022, and it could be years before the courts get back on track. \nLabour wants the temporary return of so-called \"wartime juries\" of seven rather than 12 members to speed up the process. \n\"Victims of rape, murder, domestic abuse, robbery and assault are facing delays of up to four years because of the government's failure to act,\" Mr Lammy said.\nHe also urged the government to speed up the rollout of temporary \"Nightingale courts\" to hear civil, family and tribunals work, as well as non-custodial crime cases.\nTen of these were announced in July 2020 to help deal with the backlog in court proceedings, and 20 are now in operation across England and Wales.\nLeading lawyers are sceptical about Labour's proposal to reach back into wartime history. \nThe Criminal Bar Association - representing barristers who prosecute and defend trials - says a panel of seven may allow more courtrooms to be used, but it wouldn't solve what it says is chronic underfunding - and potentially undermines one of the most important safeguards in our society. \nThe Law Society, for solicitors, wants to see evidence that smaller panels would ease backlogs without risking injustices. \nThe Ministry of Justice's internal modelling calculated last year that reduced juries would lead to a 10% increase in cases - but that was before courtrooms received new Covid-proof screens that have allowed more trials to run. \nScotland's courts are using cinemas to host juries - and while that is not being actively discussed in England, it's not been ruled out either. \nEven if juries were slimmed, courts would still need to tightly control the number of defendants who can use their cells and courtroom docks to meet Public Health England's guidelines. \nIn April last year, the head of judiciary in England and Wales, Lord Burnett, backed the idea of reducing the number of jurors if social distancing continued.\nIn June, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told the BBC he was \"very attracted\" by the idea of smaller juries, as had happened in wartime, and judge-only trials in less serious cases.\nThe Ministry of Justice says it has now installed plastic screens in more than 450 courtrooms and jury deliberation rooms to reduce Covid risks.\nIt says the safety measures are designed for 12-person juries and that the impact of lowering the number of jurors would be negligible.\nHowever, a spokesman said nothing was being ruled out and ministers were continuing to consider every option available to ensure courts recover quickly. \n\"This approach is already delivering results, with magistrates' backlogs falling significantly and the number of cases being dealt with in the crown courts reaching pre-Covid levels last month,\" he added.\nThe spokesman also said: \"We know more must be done and are investing \u00a3110m into a range of measures to drive this recovery further, including opening more Nightingale courts.\""

      "text": "Supplies of vaccines are \"tight\" but the UK believes it will receive enough doses to meet its targets, the vaccine minister has said.\nNadhim Zahawi told BBC Breakfast manufacturers were \"confident\" they would deliver for the UK amid warnings of production delays.\nIt comes as the EU said it might tighten vaccine export controls.\nCountries should avoid \"vaccine nationalism\" and ensure a fair global supply, Mr Zahawi said.\nMeanwhile, more than 100,000 people have died with Covid-19 in the UK, after 1,631 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded in the daily figures.\nMr Zahawi said the vaccination programme was still on track to deliver a first dose to 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February and to offer all adults their first dose by autumn.\nHe said the UK had supplies of the Oxford vaccine manufactured domestically by AstraZeneca as well as the Pfizer one, which is made in Belgium.\nThe government is also planning to publish figures on the take-up of the vaccine by ethnicity from Thursday, following concerns that some black, Asian and ethnic minority communities were more hesitant to get the jab.\n\"I'm confident we will meet our mid-February target and continue beyond that,\" Mr Zahawi told the BBC.\n\"Supplies are tight, they continue to be, these are new manufacturing processes,\" he added. \"It's lumpy and bumpy, it gets better and stabilises and improves going forward.\"\nBut he declined to say that he had received guarantees about the number of doses the UK would receive from Pfizer or other manufacturers and refused to confirm how many doses had already arrived.\nThe prime minister's spokesman said AstraZeneca had committed to delivering two million doses a week to the UK, and the government was not expecting any changes to that supply.\nDowning Street also rejected German media reports claiming a very low efficacy rate for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine among older people, saying they had been denied by Oxford University, AstraZeneca and the German health ministry.\nChief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the cabinet the trials showed similar immune responses in younger and older adults.\nAnd England's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has defended the UK's strategy of extending the time between first and second doses of coronavirus vaccines from three to 12 weeks in order to immunise more people. \nHe told the Downing Street coronavirus briefing on Tuesday that the \"great majority\" of protection came from the first dose.\nHe also said there was \"no evidence\" that immunity waned between three and 12 weeks after the first dose was administered.\nProf Whitty said: \"We thought very carefully about what the balance of this is, but the balance of risk in terms of reducing the number of deaths in the community - and I really want to stress that, that is the aim of this - is to maximise the number of people who get that first dose, where the great majority of protection comes from.\"\nThe latest tension over supply of the Covid vaccine is another illustration of just how fragile this issue is.\nThere are huge global demands for Covid vaccine, limited raw materials and constraints on manufacturing.\nThe UK already has enough vaccine to jab all the highest-risk groups by mid-February, although not all of it has been packaged up or been through the final safety checks.\nThis explains why ministers are confident about the immediate target for the over-70s, health and care workers and the extremely clinically vulnerable.\nBut what is in doubt is how quickly the UK can vaccinate in the medium term.\nWith the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in the UK those supply routes are more guaranteed.\nBut the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is made in Belgium. The UK, like the rest of Europe, is affected by the problems with manufacturing that are being experienced with that vaccine.\nWith Europe experiencing major problems rolling out its vaccination programme - per head of population five times fewer vaccines have been delivered - this is a story that is going to rumble on for months.\nThe UK has placed orders for 367 million doses of vaccines from seven manufacturers, Mr Zahawi said. \"As vaccines come along we will get more volume, millions more in the weeks and months to come,\" he added.\nThe tension over vaccine supplies increased after UK-based AstraZeneca warned the EU it would have to reduce planned deliveries because of production problems. Pfizer-BioNTech has also said supplies will be temporarily lower as it works to increase capacity at its Belgian factory.\nIt has prompted the EU to accuse AstraZeneca of failing to meet its commitments and to warn that it might require all companies producing Covid vaccines to provide \"early notification\" whenever they planned to export supplies out of the EU.\n\"The thing to do now is not to go down the dead end of vaccine nationalism. It's to work together to protect our people,\" Mr Zahawi said.\n\"No-one is safe until the whole world is safe.\"\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock subsequently said the UK government \"oppose protectionism in all its forms\" and urged all international partners to \"be collaborative\" and \"work closely together\" on vaccine distribution.\nHe added that the EU's warning that it could restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc was \"unfortunate and especially so in the midst of a pandemic\".\nMeanwhile, the head of NHS England earlier told MPs coronavirus could become a \"much more treatable disease\" over the next six to 18 months, with the hope of a return to a \"much more normal future\".\nSir Simon Stevens told the Health and Social Care Committee: \"The first half of the year, vaccination is going to be crucial.\n\"I think a lot of us in the health service are increasingly hopeful that in the second half of the year and beyond we will also see more therapeutics and more treatments for coronavirus.\"\nHe also said it \"would be great\" if the Covid vaccine and flu vaccine were combined into a single jab, if not for next winter then future ones.\nAnd he said vaccines were being used as fast as they arrived in the NHS, with more than half of those aged 75-79 having now had their first dose.\nThe UK aims to offer Covid vaccination to every adult by autumn. \nMr Zahawi said confidence in the vaccines was high, with 85% of people saying they would accept the jab.\nBut he said those who were hesitant \"skew heavily\" towards black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. \nThe government is providing \u00a323m of funding to 60 local councils and voluntary groups to boost vaccine take-up among groups such as older people, disabled people, and people from ethnic minority backgrounds.\nIt comes as celebrities such as comedians Romesh Ranganathan and Meera Syal and cricketer Moeen Ali appeared in a video urging people in their communities to get vaccinated.\nMr Zahawi told ITV's Good Morning Britain his uncle had died from Covid-19 last week. He had been eligible for vaccination but caught the virus before he could receive it, the minister said.\nThis \"grim and horrible\" experience made him determined to ensure that the most vulnerable were protected as quickly as possible, Mr Zahawi said.\nSir Simon said there was concern about vaccine hesitancy in some groups, where there were access problems as well as \"systematic attempts to misinform and lie about the vaccine programme targeted particularly at minority populations, and - in some cases - long-standing mistrust of public services\".\nHe said disruption to vaccine deliveries from EU export restrictions was not thought to be likely.\nIn other developments, the UK has offered to carry out genomic sequencing for other countries around the world to help identify further new variants.\nPublic Health England said it would give \"crucial early warning\" of any mutations that might cause the virus to spread faster, make people more ill or possibly reduce the effectiveness of vaccines."

Pfizer has announced a slowdown in manufacturing for the next couple of weeks so it can upgrade its facilities and ramp up production in the spring.\nThe UK is less reliant on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine than other countries, as we manufacture the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine here.\nThere are millions of doses already made but not all of it has been through the final packaging process or safety checks.\nEnsuring this happens will be crucial to allowing the NHS to keep its foot on the accelerator, especially as the vaccination clinics will have to start factoring in giving second doses from late February onwards.\nThose close to the programme say it will be \"touch and go\" especially if extra supplies of the Pfizer vaccine do not come back on stream as quick as the company is saying they will.\nEven if the supply is good, there will still be lots of vulnerable people.\nNearly 90% of Covid deaths have been in the groups due to get the jab by mid-February.\nBut no vaccine is 100% effective and uptake will not be 100%.\nWhat is more there will still be many vulnerable people in the over-60s age group.\nAs we get further into spring, everyone over the age of 50, as well as younger adults with health conditions, will be offered a vaccine. \nBut even that may not be enough, according to some.\nModelling by the University of Warwick suggests that, even with 85% uptake, a complete lifting of restrictions in April could lead to very high levels of deaths.\n\"Vaccines are not a panacea,\" says Prof Matt Keeling, who led the research.\nAnd for younger age groups, who are at little risk of dying from the virus, there is still the risk of long-Covid, he says. \nAlthough he acknowledges there is still little hard data to quantify this, some studies have suggested one in 10 suffers long-lasting symptoms from infection.\nThe factor that could have a significant impact on spread is whether vaccination stops transmission. \nThe trials showed the vaccines were good at stopping symptoms developing.\nBut it is not yet known whether those who have been vaccinated will still be able to pass the virus on.\nMost people expect there will be some disruption to transmission but how much is not clear - and will not be for months.\nBut on the other side of all this is the huge impact lockdown has. \nThe first priority will, of course, be the re-opening of schools. \nRussell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, says everything must be done to make this happen.\nHe says while schools contributed to spread of the virus, they were not a \"significant driver\", adding schools were closed for the \"benefit of the population\" but at great expense to children.\nOnce schools are open some tough calls will have to be made - and this is where the debate is going to rage.\nBackbench Tory MPs are putting the pressure on the prime minister with the Covid Recovery Group calling for a \"gradually unwrapping\" of society from early March.\nIn the end, it is going to come down to what society is willing to tolerate.\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has spoken about \"de-risking\" Covid.\nHis point is that we will reach a situation at which the level of death and illness caused by Covid is at a level society can \"tolerate\" - just as we tolerate 7,000 to 20,000 people dying from flu every year.\nSociologist Prof Robert Dingwall, who advises the government on the science of human behaviour, believes that point will be reached sooner rather than later.\n\"I think we will see a pretty rapid lifting of restrictions in the spring and summer. \n\"There are some sections of the science community that want to pursue an elimination strategy - but once you start seeing fatality levels down at the level of flu I think the public will accept that.\""

      "text": "A group of MPs is calling for hedgehog nesting sites to get the same protections as those for bats and badgers, in an effort to boost numbers.\nFormer Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has tabled an amendment to the Environment Bill, which he said would help \"Britain's favourite animal\".\nThe spiky mammals should be on developers' \"radar\" when they are planning a project, he added.\nA report in 2018 suggested UK hedgehog numbers had halved since 2000.\nRough estimates put the population at one million, compared with 30 million during the 1950s.\nMr Grayling's amendment would add hedgehogs the list of protected animals under the Wildlife and Countryside Act.\nThis would place a legal obligation on developers to search for the animals and take action to reduce the risk to them from building.\nIt is illegal to kill or capture hedgehogs using certain methods but Mr Grayling said: \"It seems wrong to me, for example, that whenever a developer has to carry out a wildlife survey before starting work on a project that the hedgehog is not on anyone's radar.\n\"It is Britain's favourite animal, its numbers are declining and it should be as well protected as any other popular but threatened British animal.\"\nFormer cabinet ministers Liam Fox, Andrew Mitchell and Dame Cheryl Gillan are among 13 fellow Conservative MPs supporting Mr Grayling's amendment.\nLabour's Hilary Benn and Debbie Abrahams have also signed it.\nThe Environment Bill - which seeks to write environmental principles into UK law for the first time - will be debated in the House of Commons on Tuesday.\nIt includes setting legally binding targets to improve air quality, water, biodiversity and waste reduction by 2037.\nBut some Conservative backbenchers say this is much too slow. They want the targets brought forward to 2030 at the latest.  \nAn amendment from the Conservative MP, Chris Loder, calls for unmissable targets to reduce plastics waste.\nIt comes as a report from Greenpeace and the Environmental Investigation Agency claims that the UK's 10 largest supermarket chains put plastic equivalent to the weight of 90 Eiffel Towers on to the market in 2019. \nThe study found that while the number of single-use carrier bags fell by more than a third, more than one and a half billion plastic \"bags for life\" were issued by the top brands, and that 2.5 billion plastic water bottles were sold or given away.\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the bill would help \"improve the environment for future generations\".\nIt added that ministers were \"ambitious\" to \"drive a world-leading programme of environmental reform\".\nFor Labour, shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said the bill should be prioritised to complete its passage in this session of Parliament.\nHe added that the UK needed legislation that \"recognises the urgency of the crisis and doesn't go backwards\"."

      "tags": "Chris Whitty,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of daily coronavirus deaths in the UK is likely to come down \"relatively slowly\", England's chief medical officer has warned. \nProf Chris Whitty said the UK was going to see \"a lot more deaths\" over the next few weeks before the effects of the vaccination programme were felt. \nCurrent restrictions were \"just about holding\" in lowering infection rates, he told a Downing Street briefing. \nIt comes as the UK surpassed 100,000 coronavirus deaths on Tuesday. \nA further 1,631 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded in the daily figures.\nAnd 20,089 coronavirus cases were reported on Tuesday, continuing a downward trend in the number of UK cases seen in recent days. \nProf Whitty told a Downing Street news conference the rolling seven-day average for deaths was 1,242 - \"an incredibly high number\" - and unlikely to come down quickly. \n\"I think we have to be realistic that the rate of mortality, the number of people dying a day, will come down relatively slowly over the next two weeks - and will probably be flat for a while now.\" \nProf Whitty said the number of people testing positive for coronavirus was \"still at a very high number, but it has been coming down\".\nBut he cautioned against relaxing restrictions \"too early\", as Office for National Statistics data showed a \"rather slower\" decrease.\nThe number of people in hospital with Covid-19 in the UK had \"flattened off\", he said, but was still an \"incredibly high number\" and \"substantially above the peak in April\".\nProf Whitty said the new, more transmissible variant discovered in the south east of England at the end of last year had altered the UK's situation \"very substantially\" and had made it \"much harder\" to bring infection levels down.\n\"We were worried two weeks ago that the measures we have at the moment were not enough to hold this new variant,\" he told the news conference. \n\"I think what the data I showed you at the beginning of the slide sessions shows is that the rates are just about holding with the new variant, with what everybody's doing.\n\"It's going to be much harder because of this new variant and I think we have to be realistic about that.\" \nSir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said that more than a quarter of a million severely ill coronavirus patients have been looked after in hospital since the pandemic started last year.\n\"This is not a year that anybody is going to want to remember nor is it a year that across the health service any of us will ever forget,\" he said.\nThe daily Covid figures have seen the number of deaths top 100,000. But they also contain some signs of hope.\nJust over 20,000 new infections have been reported - down from 22,000 yesterday.\nThis compares to an average of 60,000 at the start of the year.\nIt is a sharp fall, although Prof Whitty cautions it may actually be a little slower than that. \nNot everyone who is infected comes forward for testing and the government surveillance programme which involves random testing of the population suggests the fall has not been quite so great.\nNonetheless, it is clear the infection rate is coming down - and that offers hope.\nHospital cases have plateaued and should soon start falling. That will eventually lead to a reduction in the number of deaths.\nThen, in February, the vaccination programme should start having an impact, leading, hopefully, to a rapid drop in deaths.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson told the briefing the coronavirus infection rate remained \"pretty forbiddingly high\" to ease lockdown restrictions, which have been in place in England since 5 January.\nBut he said \"at a certain stage we will want to be getting things open\".\nHe added: \"What I will be doing in the course of the next few days and weeks is setting out in more detail, as soon as we can, when and how we want to get things open again.\"\nUnder the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons - including for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nMeanwhile, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the UK government to impose the first lockdown has told BBC Radio 4's PM he believes more action in autumn last year could have \"drastically reduced\" the number of lives lost in the second wave - some 60,000.\nProf Neil Ferguson said: \"They couldn't have been eliminated, but they could have been drastically reduced by earlier action, unfortunately.\n\"How much is difficult to judge, the new variant was unpredictable and did change our understanding of how much was needed to control spread, but we did just let the autumn wave get to far, far too high infection levels.\"\nReacting to the UK's death toll, Mr Johnson said he took \"full responsibility\" for the government's actions, but added: \"We truly did everything we could.\""

      "tags": "Mers virus,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 100,000 people in the UK have died from a virus, that, this time last year, felt like a far-off foreign threat. How did we come to be one of the countries with the worst death tolls?\nThere is no quick answer to that question, and there is sure to be a long and detailed public inquiry once the pandemic is over. But there are plenty of clues that, when pieced together, help build a picture of why the UK has reached this devastating number.\nSome will point a finger at the government - its decision to lock-down later than much of western Europe, the stuttering start to its test-and-trace network and the lack of protection afforded to care home residents.\nOthers will spotlight deeper rooted problems with British society - its poor state of public health, with high levels of obesity, for example.\nOthers, still, will note that some of the UK's great strengths - its position as a vibrant hub for international air travel, its ethnically diverse and densely-packed urban populations - exposed its vulnerability to a virus that spreads effortlessly between people.\nIn some people's eyes, the UK's island status might have helped it.  New Zealand, Australia and Taiwan managed to stop the virus getting a foothold and deaths have been kept to a minimum - Australia has seen fewer deaths throughout the pandemic than the UK is recording every day on average.\nAll introduced strict border restrictions immediately and lockdowns to contain the virus before it had spread. The UK did not. It was not until June that quarantine rules were introduced for all arrivals and even then travel corridors were soon set up, relaxing the rules for travellers from certain countries. Only this month were these scrapped.\nProf Devi Sridhar, an expert in public health from Edinburgh University, is one of those who has been critical of the approach the UK has taken from the start.\nShe says the UK, like much of Europe, was \"complacent\" about the threat of infectious disease -  choosing to treat the new coronavirus \"like flu\" and allowing it to spread, while talking about the desire to achieve herd immunity.\nThis all changed in late March, when a full lockdown eventually came. But there was a crucial delay of a week which is estimated to have cost more than 20,000 lives, according to government modeller Prof Neil Ferguson, because of how quickly infection rates were doubling at that point. \nThis, of course, is said with the benefit of hindsight. Government modellers themselves acknowledge the data was \"really quite poor\" making it difficult to make a decision that would have significant repercussions. It is a point acknowledged by Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser. Speaking in the summer he said there had been \"very limited information\" in early March.\nBy then, the virus was ripping through care homes. Around 30% of deaths in the first wave happened in care homes; 40% if you include care home residents who died in hospital.\nThose at the heart of government acknowledge mistakes were made. UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said recently: \"The lesson is go earlier than you think you want to, go harder than you think you want to, and go a bit broader than you think you want to in terms of applying the restrictions.\"\nBy May, restrictions were beginning to be eased. But was this too soon?\nThe government seized on the relative lull to focus on building what the prime minister promised would be a \"world-beating\" test-and-trace system. The idea was that new outbreaks could be nipped in the bud, with comprehensive tracking by a centralised team of tracers.\nThe mere fact this had to be done some months after the virus had struck, illustrates another factor behind the high number of deaths - the UK was simply not prepared for a pandemic of this nature in the way some Asian nations had been. Countries such as South Korea and Taiwan had established test-and-trace systems in place that were ready to be activated.\nThe UK had a chance to bed in its system in the summer but it was riven with teething problems, with tracers struggling to reach many contacts and the testing capacity slowing down as demand rose.\nLow levels of infection over the summer had created a false sense of security.\nDesperate to boost the economy, the government launched the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, offering people discounted meals out during August. To what extent it contributed to the rise in the autumn is much argued about but certainly some doctors blame it in part for an increase in patients seen.\nThe truth is the virus never went away. Testing in the summer showed even at the lowest levels there were still around 500 cases a day being diagnosed - and random testing in the population subsequently showed the true level may have been twice that.\nIn late August around 1,000 people a day were testing positive. By mid-September that had trebled and from there it rose five-fold to 15,000 by mid October. The numbers testing positive have never returned below 10,000 a day on average since.\nAnother decision that has been heavily criticised was the refusal of ministers to introduce a short two-week lockdown, or \"circuit breaker\", in September - despite their advisers on Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) recommending such a step. The argument was it would have set the spread of the virus back by at least a month, giving test and trace time to regroup.\nWales, however, did introduce its own \"fire-breaker\" - a 17-day lockdown in October. It got infection rates down, but as soon as it was lifted they rebounded. This is, of course, why lockdowns have been criticised.\nEdinburgh University infectious diseases expert Prof Mark Woolhouse, one of the modellers who feeds data into Sage, is on the record in the autumn questioning the logic of them for this very reason. It remains up for debate how effective a circuit-breaker would actually have been.\nThis after all is the time of year when respiratory illnesses start to increase. Schools had returned as had university students, creating new environments for the novel coronavirus to spread.\nWhen a lockdown was eventually introduced in England in November it was to last four weeks, with Sage members lamenting the delay. \"The absence of a decision is a decision in itself,\" says Wellcome Trust director Sir Jeremy Farrar.\nBut even before that lockdown was lifted cases had started going up in the south-east of England. Within weeks it became clear what was happening. The virus had mutated and a new faster-spreading variant was on the rise. \nBy mid-December the clamour for lockdown was growing again, but the plan for a Christmas relaxation of restrictions had already been announced. In every nation of the UK, ministers waited.\nAt the start of 2021, with hospital admissions rising rapidly, the UK's four chief medical officers intervened, issuing a joint statement warning the NHS was at \"material risk\" of being overwhelmed. Within hours the UK was back in lockdown.\nWhat has struck some is just how similar the mistakes have been in terms of locking down late. \n\"It will take years to unpick why Covid has gone so badly in the UK,\" says University College London infectious diseases expert Dr Neil Stone. \"But the failure to learn from wave one stands out.\"\nBut it must also be recognised that there are factors outside the control of the government - certainly in terms of its pandemic response - that have contributed to the high number of deaths.\nOne of the reasons the virus was able to take a hold and spread so quickly was because of geography and the fact the UK - and London in particular - is a global hub. Genetic analysis has shown the virus was brought into the UK on at least 1,300 separate occasions, mainly from France, Spain and Italy, by the end of March. \nIt was here before we knew it. That's not something Australia or New Zealand had to deal with on such a scale. \nDensity of population is also a factor. The UK is among the 10 most densely populated big nations - those with populations of more than 20 million. What is more, our cities are more inter-connected than they are in many places.\nIt meant the virus was able to seed everywhere quite quickly. Contrast this with Italy which saw the vast majority of cases in the north of the country in the first wave.\nThe ageing population also needs to be taken into account. Once you do this, and adjust for the size of the population - known as age-standardised mortality - deaths have risen, but not by as much as some of the headline figures suggest.\nThe health of the nation has also been a factor. The UK has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world. And obesity increases the risk of hospitalisation and death, according to Public Health England. One study found the risk of death was almost double for those who are severely obese.\nConditions such as diabetes, kidney disease and respiratory problems also increase the risk - a fifth of Covid deaths have listed diabetes on the death certificate.\nAgain the UK has relatively high rates of these illnesses.\nBut many have argued that these high levels of ill-health have been compounded by the levels of inequality in the UK.\nLevels of ill health and life expectancy have always been worst in the poorest areas, but the pandemic certainly seems to have exacerbated this.\nOffice for National Statistics data shows mortality rates have been twice as high in deprived areas as they have been in wealthy areas. The Health Foundation is carrying out its own inquiry into the issue, arguing the Covid death toll needs to be seen through the \"lens\" of inequality to fully understand it.\nIt is something that has also been raised by Prof Michael Marmot, one of the country's leading experts on health inequalities. \"The UK's dismal record is telling us something important about our society.\"\nAll photographs subject to copyright\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by bereavement, here is a list of organisations that may be able to help."

      "text": "Budweiser has said it will not advertise its beer during the Super Bowl this year, joining a growing number of big brands sitting out the annual American football championship. \nThe event remains one of the most-watched in the US each year, drawing more than 100 million viewers in 2020.\nThe advertisements are often as much a conversation-starter as the game itself, sometimes sparking controversy. \nFirms say the virus has made finding the right message especially difficult.\nOthers are grappling with financial hits caused by the pandemic, which has dampened spending on many items, while also casting more than 10 million Americans out of work, resurfacing racial and economic inequalities and sharpening political divisions.\nBudweiser's parent company, Anheuser-Busch, said it planned to reallocate the money it would have spent on a 30-second Budweiser spot during the game to support an Ad Council campaign promoting coronavirus vaccination. \nIt is the first time the flagship brand will not make a game-time appearance in 37 years. \n\"This commitment is an investment in a future where we can all get back together safely over a beer\", it said, adding that it would still promote some of its other brands, such as Bud Light, during the game.\nOn Monday, Budweiser released a full 90-second Super Bowl ad on YouTube entitled \"Bigger Picture\", which showed US citizens overcoming pandemic challenges together and aimed to raise awareness about Covid-19 vaccines. \nCoke, Pepsi and Hyundai are among the other major names also planning to forego airtime during the broadcast.\nCoca-Cola said it had made the \"difficult choice\" to \"ensure we are investing in the right resources during these unprecedented times\". The firm did not advertise during the 2019 game either.\nHyundai cited \"marketing priorities\" and the timing of upcoming vehicle launches.\nPepsi has also said it would not promote its flagship soda during the game. Instead, it is spending money on an advert airing to promote the Super Bowl halftime show it has sponsored for almost a decade.\nGiven all the economic, political and health questions of 2020, companies may have felt it was prudent to pull back - especially several months ago, when they would have had to start planning for such a high-profile night, said Kimberly Whitler, professor at the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business \n\"It's the biggest night of TV watching and so they have to plan it months in advance,\" she said. \"There was so much uncertainty that to go and invest in a Super Bowl ad might have actually felt or seemed frivolous at the time.\"\nThe decision goes \"beyond finances\", she added. \"It's also, 'How do we identify the right tone that will match the moment'.\" \nThis year's Super Bowl will see star quarterback Tom Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers face off against reigning champions the Kansas City Chiefs on 7 February.\nLast year, firms spent an average of $5.25m (\u00a33.8m) for a 30-second spot during the championship, driving Super Bowl ad spending to a record $450m, according to Kantar consultancy. \nThe firm has said its research suggests Super Bowl ads are \"typically 20 times more effective\" in changing a brand's perception than a normal advert.\nAnheuser-Busch, an official sponsor of the National Football League, is typically one of the night's top spenders, so the absence of its flagship brand may create its own buzz, said Satya Menon, a Chicago-based managing partner of of ROI practice at Kantar.\n\"Budweiser in particular is a very established brand ... so for them, it's all about generating love and goodwill and maybe this is another way,\" she says. \n\"They do have a lot of pre-game advertising out there. When people have the expectation that they wil be there and then they don't see the brand, they'll start thinking why are they not.\"\nMeanwhile, the sports showdown still seems to be finding plenty of firms ready to fill spots left by the stalwarts. Names of newcomers include Chipotle and Fiverr, a freelance platform that has seen business soar during the pandemic. \n\"It doesn't get any bigger than the Super Bowl from a branding and marketing perspective,\" said Fiverr's chief marketing officer Gali Arnon. \"We believe this is a major opportunity for us to introduce the world to Fiverr in a unique and creative way.\" \nMany of this year's advertisers are firms coming from the e-commerce sector, which have benefited from the pandemic, Ms Menon said.  \nAnd though audience numbers for NFL games have slipped this year, for those firms making their game-night debuts, Ms Menon says she still expects ads to have a big impact - even if the pandemic puts a damper on the traditional Super Bowl parties and other festivities, which can make championship feel like an unofficial national holiday.\n\"There isn't very much going on in life, so it will always have that great reach,\" she says. \"Some of that excitement may not be there, but watching will definitely be there.\""

      "title": "Covid: Quarantine hotel plans set to be announced",
      "tags": "Tourism,Travel,Travel & leisure industry,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Some travellers coming to England will have to quarantine in hotels amid concerns about new Covid variants, the government is expected to announce. \nBoris Johnson will discuss proposals with ministers later, but a decision may not be announced until Wednesday. \nMost foreign nationals from high-risk countries are already denied UK entry, so the new rules will mainly affect returning UK citizens and residents. \nQuarantine rules are set by each of the UK nations but tend to be similar.\nThe requirement to isolate in a hotel for 10 days will apply to arrivals from most of southern Africa and South America, as well as Portugal, because many flights from Brazil come via Lisbon, according to BBC Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Watt. \nHe said there had been \"no definitive decision yet\" on arrivals from other parts of the world and this was \"still a live issue\". \nWhitehall sources said those quarantining in hotels would have to pay for the costs of their own accommodation.\nThe prime minister will later chair a meeting of the Covid operations committee, attended by senior ministers, to discuss the options. \nMeanwhile, more than 100,000 people have died with Covid-19 in the UK, after 1,631 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded in the daily figures.\nAt the moment, almost all arrivals to the UK need to have tested negative for Covid-19 within the 72 hours before they set off to be allowed entry. Then they still have to quarantine for up to 10 days, although this can be done at home. \nIn England, this self-isolation period can be cut short with a second negative test after five days. \nQuarantine rules are set separately in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but have only tended to differ slightly, and there has been a \"four nations\" approach to discussions around hotel quarantine, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. \nBut deputy first minister John Swinney said his government would \"go at least as far\" as any Westminster policy, adding: \"If these UK restrictions are at a minimal level, we will look at other controls we can announce - including additional supervised quarantine measures - that can further protect us from importation of the virus.\"\nHotel quarantine is already in use in countries including New Zealand and Australia. \nJessica Gold, from London, has been trying to get home from South Africa with her mother, 77, and son, 13, since 1 January - but their flights have been cancelled three times.\nShe says the idea of having to quarantine in a hotel when she eventually manages to get home is \"absolutely absurd\".\n\"Now we are booked to return on 16 Feb, and there is no way we can or will stay in a hotel to quarantine when I have my own place and we can quarantine there, as we have done in the past,\" says Jessica, who flew out to her safari lodge in Greater Kruger National Park, on business, at the end of November. \nJessica, 42, wants the government to get tougher on enforcing travellers' home quarantines, rather than bringing in the hotel rule which she says is \"ridiculous and an extra unnecessary expense during these very tough times\".\nJessica adds that she's looking into other ways of getting home earlier, before any potential new rules kick in.\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told MPs on Tuesday that bringing in hotel quarantine plans for arrivals from a small number of countries would leave \"gaping holes\" in the UK's defences against any new, unknown variants of coronavirus coming from across the globe.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said all current travel measures were being kept under review and the government \"will not hesitate to take further action\" to combat variants, especially as they could effect the efficacy of Covid vaccines.\nTravel writer Simon Calder told BBC Breakfast it was \"going to be tricky\" to identify people arriving from the high-risk countries, as travellers could go to a third country before coming to the UK. \nHe said British citizens in Portugal, for example, could travel to Madrid in order to fly back to the UK. \nIn Australia, travellers are allocated a hotel room on arrival and taken there by bus. Often, entire flights are accommodated in the same hotel. \nThe New South Wales government promises to make \"every attempt\" to find suitable accommodation for travellers and families. But availability of rooms means there are severe limits on the number of people who can arrive in the country on any given day.\nThe hotel quarantine lasts a minimum of 14 days up to 24 days, providing a person tests negative twice.\nThe passenger must cover the cost of quarantine - at about \u00a32,800 for a family of two adults and two children. \nFees are waived for those who can prove they are unable to pay, and there are certain exemptions.\nBut not following the rules is a criminal offence, and in New South Wales carries fines of around \u00a36,000 for individuals, six months in prison, or both - with an extra fine for each day the offence continues.\nHotel quarantine is among the measures credited with limiting cases of coronavirus in Australia -  which has a population of around 25 million - to just 28,777 positive cases during the entire pandemic, a smaller number of cases than is currently being recorded in the UK every day.\nBut international arrivals to Australia have fallen dramatically since its hotel quarantine policy was introduced in March 2020.\nBetween July and October 2020, just 72,111 people arrived in Australia to live, work or visit - compared with 7.5 million people in the same period in 2019, according to Australian government figures.\nRob Paterson, chief executive of Best Western Hotels, said his hotels would be well-prepared for the expected new policy.\nSome already have Covid infection controls in place, he said, as they have been used to host \"step-down\" patients who complete their recovery in hotels to free up hospital beds.\nMr Paterson told BBC Breakfast quarantining customers would like to see reduced prices, a contact arrival process, CCTV and security to stop people leaving and meals delivered three times a day outside the door - along with clean linen and towels.\nJoss Croft, chief executive of UKinbound, which represents the tourism sector, said he hoped hotel quarantine rules would cover as few countries as possible and told the BBC's Newsnight the industry had been \"decimated\".  \nIn a joint statement, the Airport Operators Association and Airlines UK said the country already had \"some of the highest levels of restrictions in the world\" and tougher rules would be \"catastrophic\"."

      "text": "Keeping schools shut during the Covid pandemic is \"almost like systematic neglect\" to disadvantaged pupils, a head teacher has said.\nCardiff head Armando Di-Finizio said there was a \"fair degree of trauma\" among pupils because of the lockdowns.\nOne expert said children from disadvantaged backgrounds were falling furthest behind academically.\nThe Welsh Government said it ensured vulnerable children could continue to attend school.\nBefore the pandemic the proportion of pupils receiving free school meals who achieved five or more GCSEs was 32% lower than the figure for other pupils in Wales. \nAt Eastern High School, where 47% of children receive free school meals, Mr Di-Finizio said the challenges of lockdown were greater for pupils who may not have support or structure at home for learning. \nMr Di-Finizio told Wales Live he did not think the balance was right \"between those who are genuinely vulnerable\" with the virus and young people who are vulnerable in terms of their welfare and wellbeing and their academic progress.\n\"I think there would have been other ways to handle this because we are seeing students struggling because of it and the attainment gap is widening for this generation,\" he said.\n\"It's almost like systematic neglect of young people that is going on day after day, week after week, month after month.\n\"We have to somehow pull this back because I do wonder one day, how the children will look back and judge us in terms of our responses.\" \nAnother concern since the pandemic began, he said, was the fact the number of child protection cases at his school has doubled.\n\"I don't want to sound alarmist, but I do believe it will take a number of years for us to unpick the traumas that young people go through because we don't know yet just what this lasting impact will be,\" he added.\nWelsh Chief Inspector of Schools Meilyr Rowlands, has previously said there was evidence of widening inequality in performance as a result of the pandemic. \nSocial Sciences Prof Chris Taylor, from Cardiff University, said this gap was continuing to widen.\n\"Closing schools exposes and accentuates the deep disadvantage that many families have across Wales in the different circumstances that they're in,\" Prof Taylor said.\nHome learning reduces the ability of schools \"to provide that level playing field\" for educational opportunities.\n\"Instead, we're relying on what families and households can produce and provide to support that learning,\" he said.\nProf Taylor added some children would \"feel like they've left school at the age of 14 or 15, instead of 18\" in terms of their learning, and the focus for them should be preparing for the next step in their education rather than exams that are not going to happen this summer.\nHe said some pupils who may have been planning to leave school at 16 should remain in education until they are 18 to \"remedy some of the missed opportunities\", and that summer school and activities should be put on to help address isolation.\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian MS, Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman, has called on the Welsh Government to publish a plan on how pupils will be helped to catch up with \"lost education\".\n\"Those children in more deprived areas have been doubly disadvantaged - coronavirus has been more prevalent in these areas, meaning they will have lost more school prior to the lockdown, and these children are less likely to have the means to access online learning,\" she said.\nA Welsh Government spokesman said it had provided \"more than 130,000 [electronic] devices\" since the start of the pandemic for pupils' home learning.\n\"We've also recruited more than 1,000 teaching and support staff to provide additional support for learners who may have missed out on teaching time due to the pandemic,\" he said. \nThe government has ensured vulnerable children, as well as children of critical workers, could continue to attend school throughout the pandemic, he added."

      "text": "Testing for different variants of Covid-19 is \"massively more advanced\" in NI than in the Republic, the first minister has said.\nArlene Foster commented on social media after Taoiseach (Irish PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin said his \"understanding\" was NI was not testing for the new variant.\nMrs Foster said she had spoken to Mr Martin on Monday.\nShe tweeted that he had \"accepted that Northern Ireland is testing for SARS-CoV-2\".  \nSpeaking to Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 on Saturday, Mr Martin had said: \"When I discussed this with the leaders, their view was the variant doesn't appear to be as big an issue in the north... I can't understand that.\"\nOn Monday, the NI Department of Health announced 17 further deaths linked to Covid-19 and 422 more cases of the virus.\nThe Republic of Ireland reported a further seven Covid-19 related deaths and 1,372 more cases.\nThe department released a statement on Sunday saying \"in light of some misleading commentary in recent days\", it wanted to detail \"the ongoing work in Northern Ireland to identify new variants of the Covid-19\".\nIt said that \"whole genome sequencing\", which is used to identify and track new strains of Covid-19, had been in place in Northern Ireland \"from an early stage of this pandemic\". \nIt is thought that up to 50% of current Covid-19 cases could be related to the new \"English\" variant, which is thought to be about 50-70% more infectious than the original strain.\nSpeaking on BBC's Good Morning Ulster, Dr Connor Bamford, a virologist at Queen's University, said: \"I think we need to be fairly concerned about this, for a couple of these variants they're actually changing how the virus behaves.\n\"This one, in particular, seems to be more transmissible, which means more people getting infected, more people getting sick and more people dying.\"\nWhen asked on Good Morning Ulster about the new variant, Dr David Farren, a consultant microbiologist, said: \"It's not true to say we're not looking for it, but we are only looking for it, in a small number of cases.\" \nWhen asked if it is inevitable that the new variant becomes the dominant variant he said there's \"certainly a high risk of that\".\nMrs Foster also said on Twitter that she \"pressed\" the taoiseach on sharing travel locator forms and that he \"committed to movement soon on that issue\".\nThe first minister and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill have criticised Dublin for failing to share information on travellers arriving there during the pandemic in order to help control the spread of any new Covid-19 variant.\nMs O'Neill said she was \"hopeful\" the Irish government will soon share information with the executive about the movement of visitors to the Republic.\nShe added that there needed to be greater co-operation between the two governments and that it should not be \"an orange and green issue\". \nMeanwhile, numbers being immunised at NI's vaccination centres have declined as the phase focused on healthcare workers comes to an end, the Department of Health has said.\nHealth trusts are now planning to invite clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) patients to receive their vaccine.\nThe department said CEV patients would be contacted in due course.\nIt also urged healthcare workers to take up the offer of a jab quickly.\nThe department said there was no \"diminution\" of work at vaccine centres after a letter from the Southern Health Trust indicated the need for some vaccinators would be \"limited\" in the next four to six weeks.\nThe speed at which the vaccines are being delivered has slowed somewhat over the past week, according to official government data, but Northern Ireland remains one of the vaccination success stories.\nThe Department of Health said the NI vaccination data for 23 and 24 January - as reported at UK-wide level - \"is only partial information as it does not contain the GP vaccination figures\".  \nAs of Monday, 159,642 people in Northern Ireland had received a first vaccine dose.\nThat represents more than 10.5% of the NI population.\nMore than 20,000 people have received a second dose.\nThe Department of Health said that a further announcement on the timing of the start of vaccinations for those aged 70 and over, the wider clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) group and those aged 65 and over will be confirmed later this week. \nIn a separate development, the military medical personnel who will be assisting in the battle against Covid-19, will be in hospitals in Northern Ireland by the end of the week.\nThe medics who are of paramedic grade in the RAF, Army and Navy will take up nursing assistant roles.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination",
      "text": "A decision to allow NI back office health workers to be vaccinated at an early stage goes against the guidance of the government's advisory body, its deputy chair has said.\nThese staff are part of phase one of NI's Covid-19 vaccine rollout. \nProf Anthony Harnden said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) had made front-line health workers the \"clear\" priority. \nHe said giving a dose to backroom staff took it away from those at higher risk.\nAs of Monday, 159,642 people in Northern Ireland had received a first coronavirus vaccine dose.\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Health daily figures reported an additional 16 Covid-19 related deaths and 550 new cases, bringing the total number of positive tests to 101,291. \nSince Monday, there has been a reduction in the number of inpatients, patients receiving intensive care treatment, and the number of patients ventilated. \nLast week, the Department of Health (DoH) confirmed staff in non-patient facing roles, including those in IT and accounts, were eligible for the vaccine in the first stage. \nIt also said that the decision \"does not go against JCVI guidance\".\nBBC News NI has contacted the department for a response to Prof Harnden's comments.\nSpeaking on BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, Prof Harnden said vaccinating back office health staff did not follow the JCVI's guidance.\nIt advises the first priorities for any Covid-19 vaccination programme \"should be the prevention of Covid-19 mortality and the protection of health and social care staff and systems\".\nHe said that people have to \"remember that for every dose you give to somebody else who isn't hugely at risk, you're denying somebody at risk that first dose\". \nProf Harnden added the JCVI \"really feel quite strongly that it should be just front-line healthcare and social care workers\". \n\"We purposefully put the front-line worker into our advice and into our strategy.\n\"The reason we said that was threefold. One, because of their exposure risk; two, because of the possibility that they would transmit to vulnerable elderly people that they were looking after who we know are hugely at risk; and, third, to keep the NHS running at a time of crisis.\"\nLast week, a DoH spokesperson said the department took the decision to vaccinate staff in its Business Services Organisation (BSO) because they help ensure that health trusts and organisations \"can effectively deliver vital services\".\n\"Protecting BSO staff via vaccination to continue to deliver this support is essential for the smooth and continued functioning of the HSC (Health and Social Care system) during the pandemic and particularly at this time of extreme pressure on our health service. \n\"If the back office is down, the front line can't operate effectively.\"\nProf Harnden said this reason, of keeping the health system running smoothly by vaccinating back office staff, was a \"stretch of the argument\". \n\"One could argue that actually lots of systems in the UK need to work very smoothly and there are lots of different groups clamouring to receive the vaccine as soon as possible and I fully understand that.\n\"The JCVI took a really strong stance on this that what we wanted to do was protect [from] hospitalisations and deaths.\""

      "text": "People campaigning against the HS2 rail project have dug a tunnel near Euston station, in a bid to prevent their eviction from a protest camp. \nIn September, members of HS2 Rebellion set up a Tree Protection Camp in Euston Square Gardens in central London to protest against the \u00a3106bn scheme.\nThey claim the tunnel is 100ft (30m) long and has taken two months to dig.\nActivists say the tunnel - codenamed \"Kelvin\" - is their \"best defence\" against being evicted.\nOne protester, identified only as Blue, told the BBC: \"It is all very dangerous and life-threatening but it is all worth it. This is the only way I can effect change, I would sacrifice everything for the climate ecological emergency to not be happening.\"\nThe 18-year-old added: \"We want to be as safe as possible. It is not about us martyring ourselves, it is about delaying and stopping HS2.\"\nA spokeswoman for HS2 said tunnel protests were \"costly to the taxpayer\".\nShe added: \"These are a danger to the safety of the protesters, HS2 staff, High Court enforcement officers and the general public, as well as putting unnecessary strain on the emergency services during the pandemic. \n\"Safety is our first priority when taking possession of land and removing illegal encampments.\"\nBritish Transport Police said it was aware of the tunnel but it was a matter for the Met Police, which said no complaint yet had been made.\nHS2 is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. It is hoped the 20-year project will reduce rail passenger overcrowding and help to rebalance the UK's economy.\nThe campaign group alleges HS2 is the \"most expensive, wasteful and destructive project in UK history\" and that it is \"set to destroy or irreparably damage 108 ancient woodlands and 693 wildlife sites\".\nHowever, HS2 bosses have said seven million trees will be planted during phase one of the project and that much ancient woodland will \"remain intact\".\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs in September that the first phase of the high-speed rail link between London and Birmingham would not open until 2028 at the earliest.\nThe second phase, to Manchester and Leeds, was due to open in 2032-33 but that has been pushed back to 2035-40.\nNetwork Rail, which owns the land, has been approached for a comment about the tunnel.\nBy BBC London's transport correspondent Tom Edwards\nTunnelling as a form of environmental protest has a long history in the UK. \nIn the 1990s it was one of the ways that pushed environmental concerns into the headlines and changed perceptions.\nIn one of the environmental protesters' tunnelling guides, written by \"Disco Dave\", it says: \n\"In the world of NVDA (non-violent direct action) there are few defence tactics that can compare with the protest tunnel. Dangerous, laborious and time consuming, tunnelling is the ultimate and desperate tactic of desperate people in desperate times.\"\nThe first protest tunnel goes back to the M11 and 1993 but they only really developed during the Newbury Bypass protests in 1996. \nProtest tunnels against the A30 in Devon and Manchester Airport's second runway then followed.\nNot only did they make household names of environmental campaigners like \"Swampy\" but they arguably changed transport policy - road-building reduced massively. \nWe have seen tunnels more recently in 2017 in Coldharbour in Surrey in a protest against fracking so it's not a massive surprise we are seeing tunnels again.\nTunnelling in particular as a direct action slows down developers and it is expensive to dig out protesters safely.\nDisco Dave wrote: \"That ultimately is the purpose of tunnels and tree houses. To act as a deterrent warning the authorities that should they decide to evict, then it will hurt them where for them it hurts most - in the pocket.\"\nWhat will be interesting is if these tunnels have the same impact on HS2 as they did on the road-building programme of the late 1990s.\nWill it reframe HS2 so it will be seen in the same way as fracking or road building? Or can the argument still be made that it is a low-carbon form of travel even though it does cause some destruction of habitat?"

      "text": "The number of people to have died with coronavirus in the UK has exceeded 100,000.\nThere have been nearly 104,000 deaths since the pandemic began, data from the UK's national statisticians shows.\nThe figures, which go up to 15 January, are based on death certificates. The government's daily figures, which rely on positive tests, are slightly lower.\nIt follows a surge of cases last month, leaving the UK with one of the highest coronavirus death rates globally.\nThe Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland registered 7,776 deaths with coronavirus on the death certificate in the most recent week.\nThat total is the third highest of the epidemic. \nLast April, there were two weeks with more than 9,000 coronavirus deaths registered across the UK - but there have been no other weeks with more than 7,000 deaths registered. \nAbout nine in 10 death certificates citing coronavirus registered Covid as the cause of death.\nMost of the deaths have been in older age groups - nearly three-quarters of those who have died with the virus were over 75. One in three deaths were care home residents.\nChris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents health service managers, described the milestone as a \"tragedy\".\n\"Behind each death will be a story of sorrow and grief,\" he said.\n\"We pay tribute, once again, to NHS and care staff who have done everything they can throughout the long months of this pandemic to avoid each one of these deaths and reduce patient harm.  \n\"We won't know the true impact of Covid-19 for a long time to come because of its long-term effects.\n\"But, as well as the high death rate, it's particularly concerning that this virus has widened health inequalities and affected black, Asian and minority-ethnic communities disproportionately.\" \nSarah Scobie, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said it was a \"harrowing figure\".\nShe added: \"While the vaccine rollout for the most vulnerable is continuing at impressive speed, it will be a while until the benefits feed through to the figures.\" \nWe were one of the worst hit countries, if not the worst, in the spring - certainly in Europe and the G7.\nTwo big drivers of that were the timing of the first lockdown and the terrible numbers of deaths in care homes.\nAs a result, the UK could always rank among the hardest hit nations overall.\nBut comparing experiences in second waves is harder. \nSome countries have very clearly done better than the UK. \nAustralia, for example, has seen very few coronavirus deaths overall, and deaths quite close to usual levels throughout 2020. \nBut the US, which had a milder first wave than the UK, has seen steady numbers of coronavirus deaths throughout summer and autumn.\nIts death toll has been catching up with that of the UK in the most recent data, covering up until Christmas. \nAnd some countries that missed the first wave entirely - such as Poland (shown above) or Germany - have seen significant spikes in deaths in recent months. \nWith deaths rising since then in many countries and vaccination programmes only getting up and running, there is still a long way to go before we will know who has had the toughest second wave.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has resigned - and it is not clear if he will be able to form and lead a new coalition government.\nParties are divided over spending in the coronavirus crisis, in which more than 85,000 Italians have died. \nMr Conte met President Sergio Mattarella, who may ask him to form a stronger government. Last week he lost his Senate majority. \nBut someone else could become Italy's PM, or a snap election could be called. \nThe law professor, who has headed coalition governments since 2018, tendered his resignation to the president. And now Mr Conte is discussing the political crisis with Senate president Elisabetta Casellati. \nPresident Mattarella is expected to spend two days in talks with party leaders, as it is up to the president to decide the next move.\nThe centrist coalition government was plunged into crisis two weeks ago when former PM Matteo Renzi pulled his small, liberal Italia Viva party out of it. He said he would only return if Mr Conte accepted a list of demands. \nMr Conte survived a vote of confidence in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, last week. He then won a Senate vote, but without an absolute majority.\nThe lack of a majority would restrict government business - hence the political shake-up.\nMr Renzi's main objection was to Mr Conte's plans for spending \u20ac209bn (\u00a3186bn; $254bn) of EU recovery funds - part of a \u20ac750bn EU rescue for the Covid crisis.\nMr Renzi says EU funds should be invested in promising sectors like digital and green technologies, and wants MPs, rather than technocrats, to decide on the allocations. But he also wants more investment in the embattled health service. \nItaly, now mired in recession, was at the epicentre of the pandemic in Europe last year.\nMr Renzi governed Italy in 2014-2016, but currently his Italia Viva party is polling below 3%.\nAnd so Italy's 66th government since World War Two comes to a close. A country of seemingly perennial political crises has chosen the worst possible time to face another - in the grip of a pandemic that has killed more than 85,000 Italians and unleashed the worst economic collapse in decades. \nThat's why Giuseppe Conte may manage to come back with a new revamped government, arguing the need to avoid the turmoil of fresh elections at such a difficult time. Added to that, polls suggest an early vote would be won by the far right. So Mr Conte is hoping that the threat of losing their seats might tempt enough centrist politicians to jump the opposition ship and join a reformed coalition. \nItaly's 29th prime minister since the war is hoping to return as\u2026 Italy's 29th prime minister since the war. But his opponents are circling. And he won't have much time to convince parliament that he can become the new, stronger comeback kid. \nThere are several options: \nMr Conte, an independent technocrat, has led two very different, successive governments.\nFor 15 months he headed a coalition between M5S and the far-right League, whose leader Matteo Salvini pulled out in a failed bid to force elections.\nSince then he has led a four-party, centre-left coalition dominated by M5S and the PD."

      "text": "The UK government has given its support to a project to use oral contraceptives to control grey squirrel populations. \nEnvironment minister Lord Goldsmith says the damage they and other invasive species do to the UK's woodlands costs the UK economy \u00a31.8 billion a year.\nThe bizarre-sounding plan is to lure grey squirrels into feeding boxes only they can access with little pots containing hazelnut spread.\nThese would be spiked with an oral contraceptive.\nLord Goldsmith says the damage from squirrels also threatens the effectiveness of government efforts to tackle climate change by planting tens of thousands of acres of new woodlands.  \nOn Tuesday, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told BBC News: \"We hope advances in science can safely help our nature to thrive, including through the humane control of invasive species.\"\nA partnership of conservation and forestry organisations called the UK Squirrel Accord (UKSA) is behind the proposal. \nIt says grey squirrels, which were first introduced from North America in the late 19th century, cause huge damage to woodlands by stripping bark from trees aged between 10-50 years, the younger trees in a forest.\nThey particularly target broad-leafed varieties including oak, which are particularly ecologically important because they support so many other species.\nIt is estimated the UK is home to some three million of these invasive rodents.\nThey have displaced the native red squirrel across most of the UK.  \nLord Goldsmith says the government supports the plan as well as a longer-term effort to breed infertility into female grey squirrels to reduce their numbers. \nInvasive non-native species such as grey squirrels threaten our native biodiversity, he argues. \nWhen regulating grey squirrels with oral contraceptive was first proposed in 2017, the government's Animal and Plant Health Agency said it thought it could reduce their numbers by as much as 90%.\nThe project also has royal approval.\nPrince Charles was instrumental in founding the UK Squirrel Accord with the objective of \"managing the negative impacts of invasive grey squirrels in the UK\".\nHe has written of the importance of protecting Britain's remaining red squirrels.\n\"These charming and intelligent creatures never fail to delight\", he wrote last week in his capacity as patron of the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, describing red squirrels as the \"symbol and benchmark\" of healthy woods.\nJason Gilchrist, an ecologist from Edinburgh Napier University, has written in defence of the grey squirrel but he says he supports the oral contraceptive plan.\nHe acknowledges there is a need to manage grey squirrel populations. \n\"It is better than the alternative: a shotgun\", he told BBC News.\nIt is the same argument the UKSA makes: dosing the animals with contraceptives provides a humane alternative to culling them.\nLast week, the Royal Forestry Society, a member of the Squirrel Accord, called for just such a cull. \nSimon Lloyd, its chief executive, says efforts to tackle global warming and improve biodiversity will be undermined unless grey squirrel numbers can be reduced.\nNew trees will not survive to \"deliver the carbon capture or biodiversity objectives if grey squirrels cannot be controlled\", he told the Daily Telegraph.\nThe UKSA has been experimenting with ways to deliver oral contraceptives to squirrels for more than three years now.\nLast year, it tested special feeding stations designed so only grey squirrels can gain access in woodland in East Yorkshire.\nInstead of contraceptives, the hazelnut paste bait was dosed with a dye that, when ingested, causes squirrel hair to fluoresce under UV light.\nThe researchers found that more than 90% of the grey squirrel population being studied visited the traps.\nThey concluded that it was possible to deliver repeat doses of a contraceptive to the majority of grey squirrels in a wood.\nFollow Justin on Twitter."

We apologise to shoppers for any inconvenience caused.\"\nThe issue comes as contactless payments have taken off in the UK during the pandemic, with fewer consumers using cash to pay for groceries. \nCustomers complained about the issue on social media.\nA Co-op spokesman told the BBC: \"All card transactions are being processed as usual and our payment process partner is investigating after we experienced an intermittent issue.  \n\"We would like to apologise to customers for any inconvenience caused during that time.\"\nThe BBC witnessed the card processing issue affecting some of The Co-op's stores meant that self-service checkouts had to be closed, requiring customers to queue to be served at tills manned by staff. \nAt some stores, customers queuing outside were warned on Monday evening that transactions had to be \"cash-only\" due to the ongoing issue. \nSome customers said they had to use the convenience store's cash machine to withdraw money to pay for purchases.\nHowever in other stores, the problem was intermittent, impacting some payment card brands, but not others. \nShadow economic secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said: \"This shows the dangers of letting the cash network just wither away as use declines. \n\"The government promised legislation to secure nationwide access to cash a year ago.

      "tags": "Merthyr Tydfil,Cardiff,Newport,NHS Wales,Mountain Ash,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?\nHere we update some of the key areas of data for measuring the pandemic and we also try to explain some of the different measures being used. \nThe emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 led to record case numbers and fears that a surge in cases could put pressure on hospitals already struggling - as a result, tighter rules were imposed on 26 December.\nBy the second week of January, case numbers began to fall quickly. One week later, the Welsh government was confident the peak had passed and Wales moved to the lowest level of restrictions - alert level zero - on Friday. \nWe saw record numbers of Covid cases in the community in the days after Christmas but this did not translate into a significant rise in hospital cases, with the number of Covid patients now falling for more than a week.\nThere was a rolling average of 560 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on 27 January, a 22% drop on a week ago, although the daily figure has now risen for two successive days to 566.\nThere were two and a half times as many people in hospital with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2021. \nWhen we include patients with suspected Covid and recovering from Covid, there are an average of 1,028 patients. They make up 12% of all hospital patients.  \nThere are now 470 patients who are recovering, so they no longer test positive for Covid but are either still rehabilitating or waiting for a discharge or care support or place to become available. This is the highest number of these patients since last March.\nThe number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stood at 20 on 27 January. This is a figure we last saw in early August.\nThe average daily number has fallen from 28 to 21 in a week.\nAbout 90% of these patients are primarily being treated for Covid.\nThere are seven times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. \nAt the same point in 2021, there were 134 critically ill Covid patients.\nThe mortality rate of a critical care Covid patient, in the most recent study of 623 Welsh patients since May 2021, is about 35%, including those who died later in a general ward.\nAbout half had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic.\nThe average age is 55, nearly two-thirds are men and they are more likely to be overweight. Nearly half are from more deprived parts of Wales. Just under a third are aged under 50.\nThe study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December.\nCovid admissions are at an average of 25 a day - lower than the average of 40 last week - and make up 2.3% of all hospital admissions.\nWe can also see how they are running lower than modelled scenarios, based on various estimates based on vaccine effectiveness.\nWe can see from a comparison with December-January 2020-21, that despite much higher numbers of cases in the community, the hospital admissions rate is much lower.\nAccounting for a 10-day lag between cases being confirmed and hospital admissions, on 24 January, Covid hospital admissions were just less than 1% of positive Covid tests, compared to 9.4% at the same point in 2021.\nAdmissions have been considerably lower compared to the second wave.\nNearly six in 10 cases of patients in hospital with confirmed Covid in the last week were patients being treated for other conditions.\nOnly 41.5% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or \"actively\" treated for the virus.\nBut that proportion rises to 90% of those in critical are.\nThe figures on these \"incidental\" Covid cases are only just being published and reflect the fact there has been a lot of people being infected out in the community, while in the latest week there were 220 patients who caught Covid \"probably\" or \"definitely\" while in hospital for other reasons.\nNearly 10,000 patients have hospital-acquired Covid since the start of the pandemic.\nIt doesn't mean that these patients can't have complications because of having Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.\nSeparate analysis of Covid admissions to Welsh hospitals between the start of the pandemic and August 2021 in Wales estimated that 71.2% were directly due to Covid.\nIn cases where Covid wasn't the primary cause, trauma injuries made up nearly one in five cases, with Welsh Government scientists saying acute illnesses were known to increase the propensity to fall, which on top of reduced physical activity and consequent muscle loss due to shielding and self-isolation issues, \"would increase the likelihood of hip fractures\".\nOne indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which has been 90.7% on average for the week, at its highest level over the last two weeks.\nThe other measure is NHS staff absence.\nLatest figures show NHS staff sickness related to Covid-19 in Wales has improved slightly over the last two weeks after being at its highest level since the start of the first wave.  \nOverall staff absence was slightly higher last winter.\nA total of 1.5% of staff were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 24 January. Another 1% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the weekly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. \nThe total absence proportion has dropped to 7.1%.\nAbout 84% of those eligible for a booster in Wales have now received one.\nThere have been an average of 3,494 boosters given out a day in the past week, which has seen a drop off, as the programme works through people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Before Christmas, the daily average was 42,500.\nAt the peak of the vaccine programme in March, between 38,000 and 40,000 daily vaccines were given out. \nAbout 61% of all vaccines being given out are boosters, with nearly two thirds of 12 to 15-year-olds now having a second dose.\nThe chart above shows the number of people admitted to hospital who have had two doses of vaccine, and those who have had none, for every 100,000 people.\nIt shows the rate of admissions for over-60s who have not had a jab is nearly triple that of those who have been double jabbed and is also far higher for the 18-59 age group.\nThe latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests - based on swab samples of 9,430 people - that one in 30 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 22 January.\nThat is 99,500 people, or 3.27% of the population.\nThat's estimated to be highest in youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nThis shows another decrease, compared to the estimate of 112,100 the previous week.\nWhen it comes to age groups, the highest proportion of people infected are youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nCase rates are becoming more problematic to interpret, because three-quarters of people who test positive for lateral flow tests are no longer asked to take follow-up PCR tests.\nThe infection survey is a useful indicator, as it picks up asymptomatic people.\nONS says it shows Covid infections fell in Wales, as in England and Scotland, with an uncertain trend in Northern Ireland. Similar surveys showed infections were one in 30 in Scotland too and one in 20 in England and Northern Ireland. \nIt's now more than two weeks since results from the new testing criteria started coming in, which meant most asymptomatic people no longer needed to take follow-up PCR tests if they tested positive with a lateral flow device. \nAround 80% of those testing positive for lateral flows did not take a follow-up test in the latest week.\nWe know that there were 17,000 people with positive LFTs in the week to 22 January, who did not have follow-up PCR tests and so were not included in the case rate figures - set against 16,000 positive PCR results in the same period. LFT results are published weekly and so we have to be careful with comparisons and interpretation.\nBut if we look at the trend from those figures taken roughly together, in the latest week they would have pushed up the case rate more noticeably than it has risen in recent days. But this is still well down on the numbers we saw in early January.\nThe positivity rate has levelled out - at 34.4% - roughly the same as the week before.\nThe nature of this wave so far has been defined by the age profile.\nThis can also be seen in the big change in January 2022, compared to the week in 2021.\nAround 10% of Covid cases in Wales were in the over-60s, compared to 22% in the very early days of the vaccine roll out in January 2021. \nThere has been a big rise in the proportion of cases in the under 19 age group, now making up a third of all cases.\nThis is back to a share not seen since September and early October and can probably be linked to schools going back.\nAbsence for Covid-related reasons in primary schools has been an average of 4.7% and 2.7% in secondary schools in the last week.\nMost age groups are showing a decline, although there has been a recent rise in the under 16 age group.\nThis week, the proportion of cases among the under 19 age group reached 37% of all positive tests for the first time since September.\nThe 30 to 39 age group remained the largest group. \nCouncil areas in Cardiff and Vale and the Aneurin Bevan health board area all showed rises, as 13 of Wales' 22 local authority areas showed falls in under 25s in the week ending 20 January.\nNewport (1122.9 cases per 100,000) had the highest rate in the under 25s, as it did for case rates as a whole, showing how younger people have generally driven rises in case rates.\nNewport also had above average case numbers in the over 60s.\nMeanwhile, the R-number - reproduction number - for Wales has been estimated at the slightly lower range, between 1.1 and 1.5, up to 13 January. This is a calculation which looks at various factors to work out a transmission rate for Covid. It suggests that for every 10 people with Covid, another 11 to 13 people would be infected.\nRecent modelling, published on 7 January, indicated a rise over the following two weeks, with the situation unlikely to ease. \nBut a fall in cases led First Minister Mark Drakeford, a week later, to say there were \"positive signs that the peak may have passed\" although he added caution over a \"fast-moving and volatile variant\".\nBy 21 January, after a sharp drop, he could say \"confidently\" that Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron wave and the \"incredibly high levels of infections we have seen across Wales\".\nThe latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests that 97.4% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.\nAlthough slightly less than the other UK nations, it is an increasing proportion and the highest yet recorded, since estimates began more than a year ago.\nThe estimate is 97.2% of 16 to 24-year-olds would have tested positive for antibodies, although it falls to 96.4% for those aged over 80. It is as high as 98.2% for people in their 70s. \nONS also estimates that 88% of 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales have antibodies.\nIn the most recent week, up to 14 January, 69 people in Wales had a death which involved Covid-19 - and saw it included as a contributory factor on a death certificate.\nThis compared to 61 deaths registered in the previous week, according to the ONS.\nIn 77.4% of cases (across England and Wales) in the latest week, Covid was the underlying cause of death - so deaths were due to Covid. This is a lower proportion than seen in earlier months, when it averaged 87%.\nThere were no deaths from Covid in only three counties in the latest week: Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Powys.\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr health board area had 18 deaths.\nDuring 2021, there were 4,007 deaths involving Covid, of those registered up to now.\nThat includes 204 deaths in December. Back in December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.\nThe second wave in the winter brought 83 deaths alone on 11 January 2021 - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.\nA total of 9,384 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales - with 65 actually occurring, rather than just being registered, over the most recent week.\nThe ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.\nBecause Public Health Wales' \"snapshot\" measure only includes deaths within 28 days and after a positive Covid lab test, mostly in hospitals, it excludes deaths involving Covid elsewhere, including many deaths in the first wave of the pandemic, hundreds of deaths in people's own homes and where doctors suspect Covid has been a contributory factor.\nONS also records so-called \"excess deaths\". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared to the five-year, non-pandemic average.\nSo since March 2020, there have been 6,520 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.\nDeaths ran above average for the last half of 2021 and in the latest week were the same as the five-year norm. \nNearly a fifth of all Covid deaths (19%) registered have occurred in care homes.\nThere were 10 deaths involving a care home resident in the latest week.\nCare Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,019 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid- 16.1% of all reported deaths.\nDeaths in people's own homes have also been running at more than a third higher than average.\nWe can also see how deaths in the third wave have been at much lower levels than in the second wave.\nCovid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in Wales in December. \nMortality analysis by the ONS showed it accounted for 5.4% of all registered deaths. This compares with 5.2% of all deaths in England.\nCovid was the third leading cause of death in the previous three months and had been ranked as the leading cause of death in six months since the pandemic began.\nDementia, heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases were the three leading causes of death in Wales in December. Flu and pneumonia ranked seventh, with the mortality rate significantly lower than normal levels.\nCovid was the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease throughout 2021.\nThe ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in December was 59.3 deaths per 100,000 - significantly lower than the previous month. This was lower than five of the nine English regions: the north west, north east, east and west Midlands and the highest in London (70 deaths per 100,000).\nFour health board areas in Wales had mortality rates in December higher than the Welsh average - the highest was 107 deaths per 100,000 in Cardiff and Vale due to Covid.\nAcross the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is the same in Wales and England - 147.4 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (126.9) and Northern Ireland (132.5) both lower in the 22 months to the end of December.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England, than in Wales.\nWhen a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales again.\nONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found since the pandemic began, Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 79.6% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales. \nThis is a fall from 83.9% in November. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic it has been 87%.\nIn around 3% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was \"suspected\".\nA doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. \nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.\nBy the second week of January, RCT and Cardiff each had a total 1,024 deaths.\nRCT also has the seventh highest mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales.\nSix of its communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates are broken down further.\nThe area with the highest number of deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic was Tonyrefail, with a total of 57 deaths due to Covid, followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot (52) and Porth East in Rhondda Cynon Taf (48 deaths), by the end of April 2021.\nWhen translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Llanelli Bigyn is the highest, followed by Port Talbot East.\nAnd there is one community remaining which has had no Covid deaths at all through the pandemic - Llandudno Junction South & Llansanffraid Glan Conwy.\nIn the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.\nThe ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing:\nPublic Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus:\nThe graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW. There is also a similar count used by the UK government, which takes the PHW statistics and involves people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.\nThere is a difference of about 2,620 deaths.\nAccording to the PHW measure, on 28 January, there had been a total of 6,804 deaths with Covid, with the daily average running at four a day in the last week.\nMore than eight million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic so far.\nNHS Wales labs have capacity to handle 15,000 a day but private labs process most of the test results.\nAlthough PHW figures show more than 765,000 positive tests, this is not the total number of people who have had Covid as mass testing was not available until the tail end of the first wave of the pandemic.\nSince the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, more lateral flow tests (LFTs) of asymptomatic people have been undertaken, which saw more positive tests eventually feeding into the system - adding about 10% to numbers.\nThe most recent week has seen more than 383,000 LFTs, with a record 21,127 positive. This positive proportion of 11% in the week ending 23 January, was another record. \nThe highest incidence is still among the under 20s - 8,873 positive tests, an 87% rise - and the positivity rate of 24.9% is also the highest  -which is likely to be associated with schools going back.\nIt is the only age group showing a rise, although figures will not show up in overall case numbers.\nFrom 6 January 2022, most people who take LFTs are not being asked to take a follow-up PCR test if positive. This will affect the number of cases which appear - only counting those who come forward with symptoms. This will have to be taken into account when interpreting case data.\nAbout 19,000 tests are routinely taken in hospitals each week and 25,000 in care homes. \nThe number of tests processed in the last two weeks have showed a big drop - half what they were a fortnight ago.\nAbout 96% of tests requiring a rapid turnaround were completed within one calendar day.\nThere have been 1,068 positive tests in care homes among residents and staff in the latest week, following routine testing. This is down on two weeks before, which set a record high since the programme returned in October 2020.\nCare Inspectorate Wales figures also show 235 (22.3%) care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.\nThis is also fall on the previous week.\nIn the last two weeks, there have also been 39 reported deaths of residents with confirmed or suspected Covid.\nThe dominant variant in Wales is now Omicron, with more than 12,344 new cases sequenced.\nNumbers are now only being reported weekly, as the variant has taken hold.\nPHW increased lab capacity in readiness for sequencing more cases. About 20-30% of positive cases in Wales, which are flagged as being more likely to be variants, have swabs sent for sequencing, with results coming back a few days after people get their normal test results.\nWe can also see more people reporting symptoms of \"long Covid\" - 58,000 estimated in Wales to be experiencing the long-term effect of having the virus. \nThis includes 21,000 people estimated to still be reporting symptoms a year or more after their infection."

The firm acknowledged the new system would have to be \"resistant to manipulation attempts\".\nCompanies like Twitter are looking at how they can better moderate their platforms. \nTwitter said on Monday: \"We know this might be messy and have problems at times, but we believe this is a model worth trying.\"\nTwitter, along with other large social media companies, has struggled to deal with disinformation on its platform. \nThe pilot will allow users to flag tweets they believe to be \"misleading or false\", provide evidence to the contrary and discuss them with other - on a separate 'Birdwatch' site.\nAdditional notes and flags would then be placed on to content. \nTwitter says this new approach could help it respond more quickly when misleading information spreads.\n\"Eventually we aim to make notes visible directly on Tweets for the global Twitter audience, when there is consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors,\" Twitter said. \nTwitter already adds labels to some misleading news. For example, many of Donald Trump's false claims of voter fraud were labelled by the company. \nTwitter also reserves the right to remove tweets - and in extreme circumstances ban users - which it did with the US president after the riots in Washington earlier this month.\nTwitter, though, wants to go further: \"We don't want to limit efforts to circumstances where something breaks our rules or receives widespread public attention,\" said Twitter's Vice-President Keith Coleman. \nParticipants will have to provide a verified phone number and email to take part, in a bid to keep bots and bad actors away, as well as having no recent rule violations against their Twitter account.\nPresident Biden said in his inauguration speech that: \"We must reject a culture where facts are manipulated, or even manufactured.\"\nJames Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco.

      "text": "The voices of survivors of mother-and-baby homes in NI will be heard \"loudly and clearly\" with a new independent investigation, Arlene Foster has said.\nThe first minister's comments follow the publication of a long-awaited report into mother-and-baby homes and Magdalene Laundries in NI.\nThe Stormont-commissioned research was carried out by Queen's University and Ulster University.\nIt examined whether a public inquiry should be held into the homes.\nSpeaking in the Stormont Assembly on Tuesday, Mrs Foster said a \"co-designed and victims-centred\" investigative process would take place first.\nThat work will begin immediately with the aim of being completed within the next six months, she said.\n\"A statutory public inquiry may well be the outcome of that process but victims and survivors will be given the opportunity to influence that,\" added the first minister.\nThe leader of the Irish Catholic Church, Archbishop Eamon Martin, said: \"As a Catholic Church leader in Ireland it is I who now feel embarrassed and guilty over the way in which we in the Church contributed to, and bolstered, that culture of concealment, condemnation, and self-righteousness.\n\"For that I am truly sorry and ask the forgiveness of survivors,\" he added.\u00a0 \nTo read more reaction to the report click here.\nThe report, which runs to almost 550 pages, was commissioned by the Department of Health in 2018 and assessed the period from 1922 to 1990.\nIt examined eight mother and baby homes, a number of former workhouses, four Magdalene Laundries and sought personal testimony from women and children with \"lived experience\" of the institutions.\nMother-and-baby institutions housed women and girls who became pregnant outside marriage.\nThe laundries were Catholic-run workhouses that operated across the island of Ireland. \nRead more on the report's contents here.\nMrs Foster said it was with \"huge regret\" that society acknowledged the pain of those experiences and the hurt caused to women and girls resident in the institutions.\n\"We want to offer our personal thanks to those women and now their adult children who came forward to contribute to the research - your voices were silenced for so many years,\" said the first minister.\n\"That was a significant wrong, and as a society we must acknowledge this and do all we can to bring the truth of your experience into the open.\"\nThe first and deputy first ministers met with victims and survivors on Tuesday to brief them on the report, and said they would be given opportunity to take part in work to define the aims of the investigation and how it should operate.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said survivors of the institutions had been \"failed on every level\".\n\"We recognise how sensitive this issue is and how raw the pain still felt by all who suffered,\" she added.\n\"We must move forward carefully and respectfully and ensure that at all times the voices of those survivors and their now adult children are at the centre of this process.\"\nJudith Gillespie, who chaired the executive's independent inter-departmental working group on the issue, said she hoped the report would \"shine a light on a shameful chapter of our past\".\nShe said a public inquiry was \"not off the table\" and insisted survivors would have \"agency in the process\".\n\"This is a group that have had power and choice taken away from them for so long and now we're giving them the choice back, as to what they really want.\"\nMs Gillespie said she understood that setting up the investigation within six months might seem like an unnecessary delay, but added that it was \"better to get it right than rush and get it wrong\".\nThe publication of the report in Northern Ireland comes after a similar investigation into mother-and-baby homes and laundries in the Republic of Ireland, which prompted an apology from Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) M\u00edche\u00e1l Martin.\nThis report found an \"appalling level of infant mortality\".\nAbout 9,000 children died in the 18 institutions which were investigated.\nMr Martin said there had been \"profound and generational wrong\", adding it was a \"dark, difficult and shameful chapter\" of Irish history.\nFollowing the report's publication, Mrs Foster and Ms O'Neill met the Irish Children's Minister Roderic O'Gorman.\nThey said there was a need for the executive and the Irish government to work together in sharing information and to support survivors."

      "tags": "Skewen,Storm Christoph,Mining,Coal mining",
      "text": "The coalmining heritage of Wales has been implicated in flooding of homes - but what has happened in Skewen?\nAbout 80 people were evacuated from the Neath Port Talbot village, with at least eight streets left under water.\nCouncil leader Rob Jones says the flood appears to be related to mine works - but the volume of water involved has hampered a full assessment so far.\nThe Coal Authority is investigating how \"historic underground mining features\" in the area exacerbated the problem.\nA geologist says there are tens of thousands of old mine shafts across the former south Wales coalfield and it is \"incredibly difficult\" to monitor them all.\nSkewen lies within an old coal mining hotspot, with several former colliery sites near the village that operated in the 19th and early 20th Century. \nThere were colliery sites near what is now Drummau Road, in the north of the village and another close to Old Road, near Neath Abbey. \nSkewen was part of a collection of collieries that stretched between Neath and Llanelli on the western side of south Wales' coalfield.\nGraham Levins, secretary of the Welsh Mines Preservation Trust, said old mines often contain groundwater which can flood in heavy rain. \nHe said: \"A lot of them go very, very deep down, much below the local water level and that's why they had all the big wheels to pump the water out. \n\"It fills up with water and will find a way out. Normally rainfall you get it doesn't cause a lot of problems but when you get really heavy rain, the water drains down through the ground and builds up.\"\nGeologist Tom Backhouse said water was coming out of an area near the junction of Goshen Park and Drummau Road, where there is a record of a mine shaft dating from the turn of the 20th Century.\nIt then started \"rushing down\" Drummau Road, causing the flooding that forced evacuations.\n\"What we can expect to have happened is that the water level in the mines rose to a point where it's burst out of that entry point from the mine workings below. \n\"Also, there are images of very ochre like orange-coloured water and again, that may well be issuing from the mine workings on the highlands to the east of the property on the hill behind. \n\"That may be where the shallow workings have flooded.\"\nHe said old mine working across the former coalfield area hold water at a certain depth, but when an event such as Storm Christoph drops \"a huge amount in a small area\", the levels rise quickly.\n\"As it gets closer and closer to the surface, it basically looks for an escape, the pressure builds up,\" he continued.\n\"What it looks like has happened on the junction of Goshen Park and Drummau Road, where the mine shaft is recorded, is that pressure has built up at that point and then burst out through the shaft which is very likely to have been capped with wood or something like that.\n\"Where you've got those mine shafts, which ultimately are vertical tunnels down into the mine workings below, the water has literally forced itself up through that shaft, and the pressure is obviously so great it's caused this devastating flash flood.\"\nThere are about 13 shafts recorded within about 820ft (250m) of the one in Goshen Park, so Mr Backhouse said it is possible more than one may have burst.\nThere are tens of thousands in south Wales and he said it was \"incredibly difficult\" to check them all, but there were \"tell tale signs\" as to why they may collapse such as age or what type of developments are around them. \n\"Not to try and fear-monger or anything but of course this sort of thing can happen again,\" he said.\n\"If another event like Storm Christoph happens, the water levels in the mine rises as quickly as it did, there's absolutely nothing to say that it wouldn't happen again in the future. \n\"And obviously as climate changes and we have many more events like Storm Christoph, they are going to increase in frequency, they are going to be much more severe.\n\"The Coal Authority will have to consider the risk in places like Skewen, and they'll have to understand how it will affect residents and proactively manage that and look at how to reduce the risks for residents.\""

      "text": "As kitchen tables are turned back into classrooms across Wales, parents admit they are struggling with the return to home-schooling.\nFor Clare Ferguson-Walker from Tavernspite, Pembrokeshire, the experience has been a \"nightmare\".\nShe said trying to educate her two children alongside work has resulted in her relying on universal credit.\nGetting to grips with home-schooling in the first lockdown was \"a shock to the system\".\n\"My heart goes out to teachers, I can't imagine what it was like for them putting together all these packages,\" she said.\n\"My son is 12 and loves gaming so he's quite tech-savvy. When I have managed to pin him down he's been 'go away, dinosaur mother, I know how to do it!'\n\"I'm not au fait with these subjects I haven't done for years. It's different to how I learned at school.\"\nAs a single parent, Clare said she had found it difficult to juggle home-schooling with her work.\n\"At first, in the summer, we were doing Joe Wicks exercises every day then some work. Then it fell into chaos. I tried really hard at the beginning to be organised. \n\"I'm an artist and sculptor - that work ended and my income has dried up so I'm on universal credit. \n\"It's incredibly tough financially. Life has revolved around looking after the kids,\" she said.\nBy the end of the year, she said the pressure had all become too much.\n\"The thought of going through that again in the winter months - without sunny days in the garden - the stress really got to me.\n\"I was finding myself going repeatedly from the kettle to the fridge and back again in this weird loop, thinking what do I do now? \n\"It was like being a caged animal, like one of those bears that starts to pace in a cage. The kids had gone feral by then.\n\"I think it's been horrendous for young people and families - we can't even rely on grandparents. Mental health struggles are at an all-time high,\" she said.\n\"The one positive is I've got to know my kids a hell of a lot more and there have been times that have been lovely.\n\"I think they've learned more sat around the kitchen table when we've been talking about what's going on, they've learned about rational thinking, the importance of science and not jumping to conclusions.\nJayne Palmer from Cardiff, who home-educated both her sons, said there was too much pressure on parents to replicate traditional classroom learning.\n\"This is not an ideal circumstance for home-education families either because they are not used to being locked indoors. \n\"I think there's far too much emphasis in continuing the set curriculum. Right now it's a complete waste of time. There's pressure to compete in a system parents weren't even involved in. \nIt is far more important to \"create and interest in learning,\" she said.\n\"There's been a tendency of families to rush to buy desks and chairs and pens. What we find is the best way forward is not to sit down and teach your children - watch documentaries with them, play online games with historical content, practise reading to them, do some cooking, Lego or gardening.\""

      "tags": "Schools,Coronavirus vaccines,Gavin Williamson,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government will tell teachers and parents when schools in England can reopen \"as soon as we can\", the prime minister has said.\nMPs have called on the government to set out a \"route map\" for reopening amid concerns for children's education.\nBoris Johnson said he understood why people wanted a timetable but he did not want to lift restrictions while the infection rate was \"still very high\".\nHe would not guarantee schools would reopen before April's Easter break.\nMr Johnson said: \"We've now got the R [reproduction rate] down below 1 across the whole of the country, that's a great achievement, we don't want to see a huge surge of infection just when we've got the vaccination programme going so well and people working so hard.\n\"I understand why people want to get a timetable from me today, what I can tell you is we'll tell you, tell parents, tell teachers as much as we can as soon as we can.\"\nHe said the government would be \"looking at the potential of relaxing some measures\" before mid-February, with Downing Street clarifying that this meant looking at the data to decide \"what we may or may not be able to ease from 15 February onwards\".\nA further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 22,195 cases have been recorded, according to Monday's government figures.\nAt Monday's Downing Street press briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said almost four in five of the UK's over-80s have had the vaccine, with nearly 6.6m people in total having had their first dose.\nBut he said the NHS continues to be under \"intense pressure\", with Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, saying there are \"twice the number of people in hospital than we had in the first wave\" of the pandemic.\nRobert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, told BBC Breakfast there was \"enormous uncertainty\" and called for the government to set out what the conditions needed to be for pupils to return to schools.\nThe Conservative MP for Harlow suggested the government could consider tighter restrictions in other parts of society and the economy, in order to enable schools to open.\nTory MPs were enraged by reports over the weekend that schools might not re-open fully until after the Easter holidays. \nMinisters say it's the progress of the pandemic that will determine their decision rather than a pre-agreed timetable. \nYet whenever the government speaks, parents hear dates. Whether it's that the situation will be reviewed at half-term. Or a pledge to give two weeks' notice when classes will come back. \nMPs are now pushing for more transparency from the government about how they'll assess the data, and for some ideas between school being mostly closed or totally open.\nThis issue is a perfect metaphor for the situation facing the entire country. Too much hope breeds disappointment, but living with uncertainty is just as hard. And you can come up with a plan but it might have to be junked if the virus has other ideas. \nChildren's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield joined the call for clarity and told the BBC: \"Children are more withdrawn, they are really suffering in terms of isolation, their confidence levels are falling, and for some there are serious issues.\" \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government wanted to \"see all children back at the very earliest moment\".\nSchools in England have been closed to most pupils since the national lockdown began on 5 January due to high levels of Covid transmission in the community.\nThere have been calls for teachers to be vaccinated sooner, although it is not clear if that would allow schools to reopen earlier.\nCovid death rates among educational professionals are not \"statistically significantly different\" to those in the general population, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, but secondary school teachers appeared to have an elevated risk compared particularly with people working in office-type jobs.\nAmong secondary school teachers Covid death rates were 39.2 deaths per 100,000 males, compared with 31.4 for all males aged 20 to 64, and 21.2 per 100,000 females, compared with 16.8, but the ONS said these were \"not statistically significantly different than those of the same age and sex in the wider population\".\nSchools will remain closed in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales until at least the February half-term - with the Welsh first minister saying it is \"unlikely\" all pupils will return after the break.\nGemma Cocker from Brighton is one of the many parents struggling to balance childcare, home learning and work. \nShe says she's having to share her work laptop with her son, who has already missed learning time after the family moved home and did not have internet access. \"We didn't have any internet. The school said they had reached their limit so couldn't take him,\" she says.  \nAnd because her children are young, she says: \"They're never just going to watch a classroom by themselves, you have to be with them the whole time.\"\nKitty Jones, 11, is in her last year of primary school and she says home learning is \"tricky\" because she is not used to using different remote platforms like Google Classroom and she wants to return \"as soon as possible\".\n\"I still think that I'm learning a bit, but I don't think I'm learning as much as I would be in person,\" she tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme.\nHolly Agbukor, 18, is studying for her A-levels, says it is \"quite stressful\" learning at home, as it is a \"different environment, so it is not as easy to be fully present in the lessons\".\nBut, she says, while is it \"difficult\" working at home, \"I don't think it is worth the cost of reintroducing the virus into society and making things worse overall\".\nIn other developments:\nHow has home-schooling been going for your family?

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nMore than 100,000 people have died with Covid-19 in the UK, after 1,631 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded in the daily figures. It means a total of 100,162 deaths have been recorded in the UK, the first European nation to pass the landmark. Boris Johnson has said he is \"deeply sorry for every life that has been lost\". Behind every statistic, there was a loved one. Read your tributes to those who have died here.\nBoris Johnson has said he has \"total confidence\" in the UK's supply of Covid vaccines following warnings of production delays. It comes as the EU said it might tighten vaccine export controls. Speaking at the Downing Street briefing today, the prime minister said the UK expected and hoped that the EU will \"honour all contracts\" and it will continue to work with countries from across the world on vaccine deliveries. Earlier Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi said supplies are \"tight\" but the UK believes it will receive enough doses to meet its targets,\nFake news about the Covid vaccine, particularly in the South Asian community, has led to concerns about uptake. It's prompted to celebrities including comedians Romesh Ranganathan and Meera Syal and cricketer Moeen Ali to make a video urging people to get the jab. The video was co-ordinated by Citizen Khan creator Adil Ray, who said he wanted to dispel vaccination myths for those from ethnic minority communities. \"We all just feel we needed to do something,\" he told the BBC. \nA school has threatened to withdraw places for pupils who have told teachers they are visiting people outside their households. Yew Tree Community School in Oldham said several children had admitted visiting friends, neighbours and family contrary to Covid-19 lockdown rules. Head teacher Martine Buckley said she would take the action when \"parents were putting staff in danger\". During the current lockdown schools are open only to pupils listed as vulnerable and the children of key workers.\nThe UK government is expected to announce plans for a form of hotel quarantine for international arrivals into the country. Similar schemes are already in place across the world, including in Australia and New Zealand. Some travellers have been telling us about their experiences including 38-year-old Keri McMenamin who ordered a vacuum cleaner for her stay in an Australian hotel after seeing photos of filthy rooms from people who had gone through the country's quarantine system. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page as well as expert analysis including this explainer from the BBC's health team on why the UK's death toll is so bad.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The rollout of Covid vaccines in European Union (EU) countries is picking up speed, with more than 300 million jabs  administered.\nAs of 20 June, nearly half of the EU's adult population have had at least one one dose, while 28% have been fully vaccinated.\nEarlier this year, the rollout was hit by delays in production and distribution and vaccine hesitancy in some countries.\nIn the week to 20 June 2021, Germany administered an average of 1 dose per 100 people a day, with Italy and France close behind on  0.9 dose per 100 people - all higher than the UK's 0.6 per 100.\nHungary - which is using Russian and Chinese vaccines as well as the EU-approved ones - has fully vaccinated 46% of its population, the same proportion as the UK. \nIn France, children who are 12 and over can be vaccinated, with parental consent. The government is hoping to avoid class closures when schools reopen after the summer holidays. \nThe EU authorised the use of the Pfizer vaccine in children aged 12-15 at the end of May. \nGermany said it would give it to those aged 12-17 with pre-existing conditions while a number of other EU countries said they would vaccinate children before the start of the next academic year.\nIn June 2020, all 27 member states joined a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines.\nHowever, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca and there were supply problems.\nIts deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also saw early problems with production and distribution.\nIn February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine difficulties, saying: \"We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.\" \nIn January 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initially refused to recommend its use for people over 65.\nFrance and Germany eventually revised their stance and approved the vaccine for 65-74 year olds at the beginning of March.\nThey were again among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again later in March, following reports that a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. \nOn 7 April, the EMA said there was a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and the clots, although it is still recommended the jab for all age groups. \nSeveral EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands now say only people over 55 or 60 should get the jab, while others like Denmark have suspended its use altogether. \nThe headlines surrounding AstraZeneca led to a drop in confidence in the jab. In March, the polling company YouGov suggested that only a third of Germans and 23% of French respondents considered it safe.\nThe EU took AstraZeneca to court to force it to deliver more doses of vaccine. The company blamed production problems but said it had \"fully complied\" with its contract.\nThe EU lost its legal battle. It had wanted AstraZeneca to deliver 120 million doses by the end of June but a court ruled that the company must instead provide 80 million doses by the end of September. \nThe EU said the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom have plants in the EU.\nEU leaders considered a ban on exports of vaccines to the UK but decided not to introduce one.\nInstead, they called for more transparency from the UK and other countries on the number of doses they export.\nThe EU says that by 1 June 2021, it had exported 245 million doses to 46 different countries. \nUnder the terms of the EU scheme, member states are not supposed to strike deals with any vaccine manufacturer with whom the EU already has an agreement, but they can make separate deals with vaccine makers which have not signed agreements with the EU.\nHungary has been using Russia's Sputnik vaccine for months and and Slovakia has also bought doses of it.\nGermany said in April it would begin talks to secure supplies of the Russian vaccine and Austria said it would buy one million doses, but only once the EU's medicines agency approves the jab for use in the EU. \nThe Czech Republic and Poland have entered talks with both Russia and China.\nThe UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November 2020, nearly three weeks before EU regulators. \nThe government claimed that being outside the EU allowed it to be more nimble in this area. \nHowever, the UK's approval of the vaccine would have been permitted anyway under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator.\nThe UK could have joined the EU vaccine scheme last year while it was still in a transition phase with the EU, but it chose not to. \nIf it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies."

      "text": "The EU has warned Covid vaccine producers they must deliver agreed supplies, amid fears reductions could seriously hamper its inoculation drive.\nAstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech have both said production problems mean they cannot supply the expected numbers.\nThe EU warned it could restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc, with Germany's health minister demanding \"fair distribution\".\nThe UK's vaccine minister warned of \"the dead end of vaccine nationalism\".\nAstraZeneca is mainly produced in the UK, while the UK's supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine come from the company's Belgian plant.\nVaccine supply has become a critical issue as nations seek to stem high infection rates.\nSeparately, the German health ministry joined AstraZeneca in strongly denying some reports in German media of a lower efficacy rate for its vaccine among older people.\nLast week, AstraZeneca told the EU it was falling behind on its supply target because of production problems and Pfizer-BioNTech has also said supplies of its vaccine will be lower.\nIn response, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has now said companies making Covid vaccines in the bloc will have to \"provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries\".\nShe said the 27-member EU bloc would \"take any action required to protect its citizens\".\nGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn backed her call, saying: \"This is not about EU first, this is about Europe's fair share.\"\nChancellor Angela Merkel told the virtual version of the annual World Economic Forum, usually held in Davos, there should be a \"fair distribution\" across the world.\nEuropean Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen earlier told forum: \"Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines. And now, the companies must deliver. They must honour their obligations.\"\nThe row could affect supplies to the UK of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nResponding to the EU's comments, the UK's Minister for Covid Vaccine Deployment Nadhim Zahawi said on Tuesday that supplies were \"tight\" and warned against what he called \"the dead end of vaccine nationalism\", adding: \"No-one is safe until the whole world is safe.\"\nHe said he was confident the UK would receive enough doses to meet its targets - a first dose to 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February and to offer all adults their first dose by autumn.\nThe EU has already faced criticism for the slow rollout of vaccines, which it buys on behalf of all member states.\nMs Kyriakides tweeted that Monday's talks with AstraZeneca \"resulted in dissatisfaction with the lack of clarity and insufficient explanations\".\nShe said the EU had requested \"a detailed planning of vaccine deliveries\" and the next meeting with the company would be held on Wednesday.\nAstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish multinational headquartered in England, said it was \"doing everything it can to bring its vaccine to millions of Europeans as soon as possible\".\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine is being used already in the UK but has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to green light it at the end of this month. \nThe bloc signed a deal in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March.\nLast week, AstraZeneca said \"reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain\" meant the number of initial doses for EU member states would be lower.\nOfficials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year.\nAn AstraZeneca partner plant in Belgium involved in the \"viral vector\" process - the delivery of genetic material into cells - is thought to be the problem.\nBut one German member of the European Parliament, Peter Liese, told Reuters news agency that the statement that there were difficulties in the EU supply chain but not elsewhere was \"flimsy\" and there should be \"no problem to get the vaccine from the UK to the continent\".\nEuropean officials familiar with Monday's EU-AstraZeneca meeting said the company had offered to bring forward deliveries by a week to 7 February, but this did not mean an increase in supplies for the quarter.\nThe Serum Institute of India also produces a large amount of AstraZeneca jabs, but has no immediate plans to divert to the EU.\nOther nations, including Australia and Thailand, have said they have also been told of a drop in AstraZeneca supply.\nThe AstraZeneca reduction is a serious blow in the wake of Pfizer-BioNTech's statement.\nPfizer-BioNTech said last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian plant.\nThe EU has ordered 600 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, which is already being used on patients around the bloc.\nUrsula von der Leyen has pledged to inoculate 70% of adults in the EU by the end of August.\nBy Stephanie Hegarty, BBC Population correspondent\nAs the diplomatic tussle goes on between vaccine-producing countries in Europe there could be a rare bit of good news for the rest of the world, including the lower-income countries already struggling to secure a supply. \nCovax, an initiative spearheaded by the World Health Organization that aims to distribute vaccines around the world more fairly, says it doesn't expect its supply of vaccines to be affected. \nMost of that supply is coming from a producer in India with some also manufactured in South Korea. \nCovax says it's on schedule to deliver its first vaccines in lower-income countries in February, helped by the fact that the US under President Joe Biden recently committed $4bn (\u00a33.5bn) to the scheme.\nGermany's health ministry on Tuesday firmly denied reports in German media of a lower efficacy rate for AstraZeneca among the elderly.\nThe reports, including in the Handelsblatt economic daily, cited sources saying the efficacy was as low as 8% in the over 65s.\nBut the ministry said its review of the data in the reports \"did not allow this assumption\" and that it \"appears that two things have been mixed up in the reports\".\nAstraZeneca issued a statement saying the reports were \"completely incorrect\", adding: \"In November, we published data in The Lancet demonstrating that older adults showed strong immune responses to the vaccine, with 100% of older adults generating spike-specific antibodies after the second dose.\"\nUK Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said the reports had created \"confusion and concern\" and risked \"adding to the spread of disinformation\"."

      "text": "The fate of more than 200,000 seafarers who play a crucial role in keeping global trade flowing is being labelled a \"humanitarian crisis at sea\".  \nMore than 300 firms and organisations are urging for them to be treated as \"key workers\", so they can return home without risking public health.\nMore than 90% of global trade - from household goods to medical supplies - is moved by sea.\nBut governments have banned crew from coming ashore amid Covid-19 fears. \nLarge firms including shipping titan AP Moller-Maersk, oil firms BP and Shell, consumer giant Unilever and mining groups Rio Tinto and Vale, as well as maritime transporters, unions, the World Economic Forum (WEF) and other supply chain partners have signed the Neptune Declaration on Seafarer Wellbeing and Crew Change.\nThey are calling for all countries to designate seafarers as key workers and implement crew change protocols.\nThe signees of the Neptune Declaration are warning global leaders that ignoring the risk to crews' mental and physical wellbeing threatens global supply chains, which are crucial to vaccinating the world from coronavirus. \nThe firms and organisations hope that world leaders, gathering at this year's virtual Davos Forum, will heed their call.\n\"Unified, prompt action from governments and other key stakeholders is needed to protect the lives and livelihoods of the 1.6 million seafaring men and women who serve us all across the seas, and who continue to face extreme risk to their safety and earnings,\" said WEF's head of supply chain and transport Margi Van Gogh.\n\"By granting stranded seafarers key worker status, and by prioritising vaccine allocation for transport crew, we can prevent a deepening humanitarian and economic crisis.\"\nAccording to latest data from the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and international ship owners body Bimco, there are 1.6 million seafarers serving on internationally trading merchant ships worldwide.\nTypically, ICS estimates around 100,000 seafarers are rotated every month, with 50,000 staff disembarking and 50,000 crew embarking ships to comply with international maritime regulations, governing safe working hours and crew welfare.\nSeafarers usually work 10-12 hours shifts, seven days a week to man ships, on four or six-month-long contracts, followed by a period of leave. \nBut due to the coronavirus crisis and travel bans brought in by many governments to combat new variants of Covid-19, hundreds of thousands of crew are spending extended periods at sea, far beyond the expiry of their contracts.\nFor those who have been at sea for months longer than their contract stipulates, there is a growing risk to their mental and physical wellbeing.\n\"Seafarers are the unacceptable collateral damage on the war on Covid-19 and this must stop,\" said ICS secretary general Guy Platten.\n\"If we want to maintain global trade seafarers must not be put to the back of the vaccine queue. You can't inject a global population without the shipping industry and most importantly our seafarers. We are calling on the supply chain to take action to support seafarers now.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A pledge that 70% of the over-80s would get the Covid-19 vaccine by last weekend was missed, the Welsh Government has admitted.\nWeather has been blamed for the problem with figures showing 96,830, or 52.8%, had their first dose.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said many over-80s felt unsafe attending appointments amid the snow and ice.\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies accused the government of constantly missing targets.\nThe pledge had been made by Health Minister Vaughan Gething in the Senedd, last week.\nBut earlier, Mr Gething said that as well as missed appointments, five mass vaccination centres were affected by the conditions and \"a range of additional GP clinics didn't go ahead\".\nLatest data shows almost 97,000 of the most vulnerable have had a dose - but there is a lag and it can take up to five days for doses injected to be included in the figures. At least 289,566 people have had a first dose - 9.2% of the population.\nThat compares to 10.6% in England, 8.6% in Northern Ireland and 8% in Scotland.\nMr Drakeford told First Minister's Questions earlier: \"We will not reach the 70% for over-80s because of the interruption to the programme of vaccination that happened on Sunday and on Monday morning.\n\"I won't have people over-80 feeling pressurised to come out to be vaccinated when they themselves decide that it is not safe for them to do so.\"\nHe said all of those people would have been offered a further opportunity to be vaccinated by the end of Wednesday.\nHowever, Mr Drakeford said Wales was on track to meet plans to offer everybody in the top four priority groups (those aged 70 or over) a vaccination by mid-February.\nAround 23,700 first doses a day would need to be given for the first four priority groups to be have a vaccine offered by 14 February. \nOn the latest seven day rolling average, it would take 25 days.\nBut Mr Davies said: \"Welsh Conservatives would have been the first to congratulate the Welsh Government and its health minister had the target been reached on Friday, but that target has been missed.\n\"It's the same old Labour story of taking credit when things go well but look to blame anyone and everything else when it goes wrong.\"\nIn the Senedd, he accused the government of running a \"postcode lottery\" for vaccinations, which Mr Drakeford denied.\nThe first minister said figures had gone from 162,000 people being vaccinated last week to 230,000 this Tuesday.\nHe said that was \"the fastest rate of increase in any part of the United Kingdom\", and accused Mr Davies of wanting to \"run it down\".\n\"He leads a Conservative party in Wales, which has reverted to its 19th Century type - for Wales, see England.\"\nPlaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said he did not think \"blaming snow over the weekend holds water\".  \n\"Snow did cause problems in certain areas but the problem was that you were still on 24% of over-80s in the middle of last week. There was too high a mountain to climb,\" he added.\nBut Mr Gething said the weather was an \"obvious factor\" on both Sunday and Monday.\nIn a statement, he said more than 11,000 care home residents - 67% of the priority group - had received their first vaccine dose.\nOver 65% of Welsh Ambulance Service staff had also taken up the offer of a vaccine.\n\"We have seen a significant escalation in the pace of vaccine deployment here in Wales over the last couple of weeks,\" he told Members of the Senedd (MSs)."

      "title": "Covid deaths: Why is the UK's death toll so bad?",
      "tags": "Mers virus,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 100,000 people in the UK have died from a virus, that, this time last year, felt like a far-off foreign threat. How did we come to be one of the countries with the worst death tolls?\nThere is no quick answer to that question, and there is sure to be a long and detailed public inquiry once the pandemic is over. But there are plenty of clues that, when pieced together, help build a picture of why the UK has reached this devastating number.\nSome will point a finger at the government - its decision to lock-down later than much of western Europe, the stuttering start to its test-and-trace network and the lack of protection afforded to care home residents.\nOthers will spotlight deeper rooted problems with British society - its poor state of public health, with high levels of obesity, for example.\nOthers, still, will note that some of the UK's great strengths - its position as a vibrant hub for international air travel, its ethnically diverse and densely-packed urban populations - exposed its vulnerability to a virus that spreads effortlessly between people.\nIn some people's eyes, the UK's island status might have helped it.  New Zealand, Australia and Taiwan managed to stop the virus getting a foothold and deaths have been kept to a minimum - Australia has seen fewer deaths throughout the pandemic than the UK is recording every day on average.\nAll introduced strict border restrictions immediately and lockdowns to contain the virus before it had spread. The UK did not. It was not until June that quarantine rules were introduced for all arrivals and even then travel corridors were soon set up, relaxing the rules for travellers from certain countries. Only this month were these scrapped.\nProf Devi Sridhar, an expert in public health from Edinburgh University, is one of those who has been critical of the approach the UK has taken from the start.\nShe says the UK, like much of Europe, was \"complacent\" about the threat of infectious disease -  choosing to treat the new coronavirus \"like flu\" and allowing it to spread, while talking about the desire to achieve herd immunity.\nThis all changed in late March, when a full lockdown eventually came. But there was a crucial delay of a week which is estimated to have cost more than 20,000 lives, according to government modeller Prof Neil Ferguson, because of how quickly infection rates were doubling at that point. \nThis, of course, is said with the benefit of hindsight. Government modellers themselves acknowledge the data was \"really quite poor\" making it difficult to make a decision that would have significant repercussions. It is a point acknowledged by Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser. Speaking in the summer he said there had been \"very limited information\" in early March.\nBy then, the virus was ripping through care homes. Around 30% of deaths in the first wave happened in care homes; 40% if you include care home residents who died in hospital.\nThose at the heart of government acknowledge mistakes were made. UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said recently: \"The lesson is go earlier than you think you want to, go harder than you think you want to, and go a bit broader than you think you want to in terms of applying the restrictions.\"\nBy May, restrictions were beginning to be eased. But was this too soon?\nThe government seized on the relative lull to focus on building what the prime minister promised would be a \"world-beating\" test-and-trace system. The idea was that new outbreaks could be nipped in the bud, with comprehensive tracking by a centralised team of tracers.\nThe mere fact this had to be done some months after the virus had struck, illustrates another factor behind the high number of deaths - the UK was simply not prepared for a pandemic of this nature in the way some Asian nations had been. Countries such as South Korea and Taiwan had established test-and-trace systems in place that were ready to be activated.\nThe UK had a chance to bed in its system in the summer but it was riven with teething problems, with tracers struggling to reach many contacts and the testing capacity slowing down as demand rose.\nLow levels of infection over the summer had created a false sense of security.\nDesperate to boost the economy, the government launched the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, offering people discounted meals out during August. To what extent it contributed to the rise in the autumn is much argued about but certainly some doctors blame it in part for an increase in patients seen.\nThe truth is the virus never went away. Testing in the summer showed even at the lowest levels there were still around 500 cases a day being diagnosed - and random testing in the population subsequently showed the true level may have been twice that.\nIn late August around 1,000 people a day were testing positive. By mid-September that had trebled and from there it rose five-fold to 15,000 by mid October. The numbers testing positive have never returned below 10,000 a day on average since.\nAnother decision that has been heavily criticised was the refusal of ministers to introduce a short two-week lockdown, or \"circuit breaker\", in September - despite their advisers on Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) recommending such a step. The argument was it would have set the spread of the virus back by at least a month, giving test and trace time to regroup.\nWales, however, did introduce its own \"fire-breaker\" - a 17-day lockdown in October. It got infection rates down, but as soon as it was lifted they rebounded. This is, of course, why lockdowns have been criticised.\nEdinburgh University infectious diseases expert Prof Mark Woolhouse, one of the modellers who feeds data into Sage, is on the record in the autumn questioning the logic of them for this very reason. It remains up for debate how effective a circuit-breaker would actually have been.\nThis after all is the time of year when respiratory illnesses start to increase. Schools had returned as had university students, creating new environments for the novel coronavirus to spread.\nWhen a lockdown was eventually introduced in England in November it was to last four weeks, with Sage members lamenting the delay. \"The absence of a decision is a decision in itself,\" says Wellcome Trust director Sir Jeremy Farrar.\nBut even before that lockdown was lifted cases had started going up in the south-east of England. Within weeks it became clear what was happening. The virus had mutated and a new faster-spreading variant was on the rise. \nBy mid-December the clamour for lockdown was growing again, but the plan for a Christmas relaxation of restrictions had already been announced. In every nation of the UK, ministers waited.\nAt the start of 2021, with hospital admissions rising rapidly, the UK's four chief medical officers intervened, issuing a joint statement warning the NHS was at \"material risk\" of being overwhelmed. Within hours the UK was back in lockdown.\nWhat has struck some is just how similar the mistakes have been in terms of locking down late. \n\"It will take years to unpick why Covid has gone so badly in the UK,\" says University College London infectious diseases expert Dr Neil Stone. \"But the failure to learn from wave one stands out.\"\nBut it must also be recognised that there are factors outside the control of the government - certainly in terms of its pandemic response - that have contributed to the high number of deaths.\nOne of the reasons the virus was able to take a hold and spread so quickly was because of geography and the fact the UK - and London in particular - is a global hub. Genetic analysis has shown the virus was brought into the UK on at least 1,300 separate occasions, mainly from France, Spain and Italy, by the end of March. \nIt was here before we knew it. That's not something Australia or New Zealand had to deal with on such a scale. \nDensity of population is also a factor. The UK is among the 10 most densely populated big nations - those with populations of more than 20 million. What is more, our cities are more inter-connected than they are in many places.\nIt meant the virus was able to seed everywhere quite quickly. Contrast this with Italy which saw the vast majority of cases in the north of the country in the first wave.\nThe ageing population also needs to be taken into account. Once you do this, and adjust for the size of the population - known as age-standardised mortality - deaths have risen, but not by as much as some of the headline figures suggest.\nThe health of the nation has also been a factor. The UK has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world. And obesity increases the risk of hospitalisation and death, according to Public Health England. One study found the risk of death was almost double for those who are severely obese.\nConditions such as diabetes, kidney disease and respiratory problems also increase the risk - a fifth of Covid deaths have listed diabetes on the death certificate.\nAgain the UK has relatively high rates of these illnesses.\nBut many have argued that these high levels of ill-health have been compounded by the levels of inequality in the UK.\nLevels of ill health and life expectancy have always been worst in the poorest areas, but the pandemic certainly seems to have exacerbated this.\nOffice for National Statistics data shows mortality rates have been twice as high in deprived areas as they have been in wealthy areas. The Health Foundation is carrying out its own inquiry into the issue, arguing the Covid death toll needs to be seen through the \"lens\" of inequality to fully understand it.\nIt is something that has also been raised by Prof Michael Marmot, one of the country's leading experts on health inequalities. \"The UK's dismal record is telling us something important about our society.\"\nAll photographs subject to copyright\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by bereavement, here is a list of organisations that may be able to help."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nRules for people entering the UK could get tighter later - with the government expected to enforce hotel quarantine in England for some arrivals. Currently, people arriving in the UK must test negative before setting off, and then self-isolate for 10 days on arrival. This can be reduced to five days in England after a second negative test. But it's feared that not everyone follows the rules - so people could now be told to stay in hotels, where the isolation will be enforced. It's thought the rules will definitely apply to UK citizens and residents arriving from southern African, South America, and Portugal (foreign nationals are already banned from arriving from those \"high risk\" areas). The rules could also apply to other countries. And it's expected that people will have to pay their own way. Although each part of the UK sets its own travel rules, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said a \"four nations\" approach is being discussed. Here's a glimpse from last year of hotel quarantine in Australia.\nThe UK's unemployment rate rose to 5% in the three months to November, up from 4.9%, as the pandemic continued to hit the jobs market. In November, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said unemployment could peak at 2.6 million by the middle of this year - that's 7.5% of the working population.\nThe EU has been criticised for a slow vaccine rollout - which is partly down to delays from manufacturers Pfizer and AstraZeneca (although the latter's jab hasn't actually been approved in the EU yet). Now the EU says vaccine makers must provide \"early notification\" when they want to export vaccines outside the bloc. This could mean more doses stay inside the EU. The UK minister responsible for vaccine deployment, Nadhim Zahawi, has said he is confident Pfizer - which manufactures its vaccine in Belgium - will deliver for both the UK and the EU. This tweet is from the EU's health commissioner.\nRiot police in the Netherlands have again clashed with people defying a curfew, following a weekend of unrest. More than 150 were arrested. In Rotterdam, police fired warning shots and tear gas, after an emergency order failed to move demonstrators.\nDespite Covid and the strains on the system, there is still kindness - and new life - in NHS hospitals. The BBC's Hugh Pym went to Kings Mill Hospital, part of Sherwood Forest Hospitals Trust, to meet the patients and staff.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "Social media,Google,Facebook",
      "text": "Facebook News, the social network's dedicated section for news content, is launching in the UK. \nThe UK is the second market to get Facebook News, which launched in the United States last year. \nSeveral major news publishers, including Channel 4, Sky News, and The Guardian have signed deals with Facebook to provide content.  \nIt comes as the tech industry's relationship with the media comes under increased scrutiny. \nGoogle last week threatened to pull out of Australia if forced by law to enter commercial agreements with news publishers - something about which Facebook has also expressed concern.\nAnd French publishers recently agreed a deal with Google on how a new EU copyright law about news excerpts should be applied. \nFacebook News is the social network's own attempt to address the long-running friction between it and news publishers, as advertising spend has increasingly moved to the large tech firms instead of individual news outlets. \nThe new feature is set to go live on Tuesday afternoon, Facebook said. \nThe new feature is a dedicated tab within the Facebook mobile app, accessible by tapping the three-line icon for more options. \nThe tab features a mix of major daily news stories and \"personalised\" news selected for each reader based on their interests, as decided by Facebook's algorithm. \nFacebook says it pays publishers \"for content that is not already on the platform\", and says the feature will also provide publishers with new advertising and subscription \"opportunities\". \nThat may be partly based on data from the United States, which Facebook says shows more than 95% of traffic on Facebook News is from people who have not read those publications before. \nThe social network says the new product is a \"a multi-year investment that puts original journalism in front of new audiences\". \nAnd news organisations, for which new readers are often in short supply, are signing up. \nIn November, when it first announced the product was heading to the UK, major names such as The Economist, The Independent, and Cosmopolitan were already on board.  \nAhead of Tuesday's launch, The Daily Mail, Financial Times and Telegraph were also announced, among others. \n BBC News has not signed a commercial deal with Facebook News, but may still appear on the tab through public posts it makes on the Facebook platform. \nFacebook also says that this new product is a direct result of discussions with the news industry, with which it has often been at loggerheads. \nThe tech giant is responsible for driving a lot of traffic around the internet, and a story which performs well on Facebook will often attract more readers than one which does not. \nBut Facebook has also repeatedly made changes to its algorithms over the years which have affected news organisations, sometimes with little notice. It has also encouraged organisations to use its features such as instant articles, or to make video content for Facebook.\nHowever, it envisions Facebook News as a better solution than earlier attempts, and one it plans to roll out to other countries - including France and Germany - in the near future. \n\"Our goal has always been to work out the best ways we can support the industry in building sustainable business models,\" Facebook said in its blog post about the UK launch. \n\"As we invest more in news, and pay publishers for more content in more countries, we will work with them to support the long-term viability of newsrooms.\" "

      "tags": "United States",
      "text": "The Biden administration has said it will seek to push forward a plan to make anti-slavery activist Harriet Tubman the face of a new $20 bill.\nA note featuring Ms Tubman, who was born a slave in about 1822, was originally due to be unveiled in 2020.\nThe US Treasury said she would replace former President Andrew Jackson, a slave owner.\nBut the effort was delayed under former President Donald Trump, who branded it \"pure political correctness\".\nNow President Joe Biden has revived the project, with White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki telling reporters the Treasury was \"exploring ways to speed up\" the process.\nThe move would make Ms Tubman the first African American to appear on a US banknote, and the first woman for more than 100 years.\n\"It's important that our notes, our money - if people don't know what a note is - reflect the history and diversity of our country, and Harriet Tubman's image gracing the new $20 note would certainly reflect that,\" Ms Psaki said on Monday.\nThe women last depicted on US notes were former First Lady Martha Washington, on the $1 silver certificate from 1891 to 1896, and Native American Pocahontas, in a group image on the $20 bill from 1865 to 1869.\nHowever, given the complexities of redesigning and producing US banknotes, the bill is not expected to be released any time soon.\nIn 2019, Mr Trump's Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the redesign would be delayed until at least 2026. At the time, he said he was focused on redesigning bills to address counterfeiting issues, not making changes to their imagery.\nMr Trump, an admirer of his populist predecessor Andrew Jackson - whose portrait hung in his office - expressed opposition to the redesign.\nWhile campaigning in 2016, Mr Trump suggested that Ms Tubman be put on the $2 bill instead.\nBorn into slavery in about 1822, Ms Tubman grew up working in the cotton fields in Dorchester County, Maryland. She was the fourth of nine children born to two enslaved parents, Benjamin Ross and Harriet Rit. \nAs a teenager, she was hit in the head by an iron weight thrown by an overseer, leaving her severely injured.\nShe escaped from a slave plantation in 1849, fleeing north to the neighbouring state of Pennsylvania.\nIn the years that followed, Ms Tubman returned multiple times to Maryland to rescue others, conducting them along the so-called \"underground railroad\", a network of safe houses used to spirit slaves from the south to the free states in the north.\nShe is estimated to have made some 13 missions to rescue more than 70 enslaved people, including family and friends, using the network.\nLater, she became a spy for the Union Army during the Civil War, a prominent supporter of the women's suffrage movement, and a famous veteran of the struggle for the abolition of slavery.\nAfter the war, Ms Tubman toured eastern cities giving speeches in support of women's suffrage, drawing on her experiences in the fight against slavery. \nShe died in 1913, aged 91, surrounded by her family."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,NHS,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It is \"difficult to put a timeline\" on when England's lockdown could be lifted, Matt Hancock has said.\nThe health secretary said there were \"early signs\" the measures were working but it was \"not a moment to ease up\".\nHe said there were 37,000 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK and \"more people on ventilators than at any time in this whole pandemic\".\n\"The pressure on the NHS remains huge and we've got to get that case rate down,\" he said.\nThe number of coronavirus cases in the UK has been falling, but the number of people in hospital remains high, as does the UK's daily death numbers.\nA further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 22,195 cases have been recorded, according to Monday's government figures.\nThe are 4,076 people in hospital on ventilators.\nUnder the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons.\nThis includes for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAt Monday's Downing Street press briefing, Mr Hancock said: \"I understand the yearning people have to get out of this.\n\"The thing is that we have to look at the facts on the ground and we have to monitor those facts.\n\"And of course, everybody wants to have a timeline for that, but I think most people understand why it is difficult to put a timeline on it because it's a matter of monitoring the data.\"\nHe set out the factors the government would take into account when reaching decisions over lifting the restrictions, including: the death rate, the number of people in hospital, whether there were new coronavirus variants and the success of the vaccine rollout.\nAlmost four in five of the UK's over-80s have had the vaccine, Mr Hancock said, with nearly 6.6m people in total having had their first dose.\nThe falling numbers of infections being reported and the rising rate of vaccination are incredibly promising - even if the drop in infections reported on Monday may have been partly an artefact of fewer people coming forward for a test because of the snow.\nBut that does not offer any guarantees of a rapid lifting of lockdown.\nWhat is concerning ministers are the high numbers in hospital.\nThe number of new admissions seems to have plateaued - but at a very high rate.\nClose to 4,000 patients a day are being admitted to hospital.\nTo put that in context, that is four times the total number of all types of respiratory admissions the NHS would normally see in winter.\nIt means the numbers in hospital are at nearly twice the level they were at the peak in the spring during the first wave.\nWith better treatments available, patients are spending longer in hospital.\nSo come mid-February the pressures in hospital are likely to be very high, leaving ministers little wriggle-room to relax restrictions.\nThe big unknown, however, is what impact and how quickly vaccination will have an effect on admissions.\nThere is encouraging early news from Israel that hospitalisation really starts to drop three weeks after the first dose.\nIf that is repeated here, the picture could quickly change.\nBut until that happens the government - in the words of Health Secretary Matt Hancock - is urging the country to hold its nerve.\nSpeaking at the Downing Street press conference, Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, warned: \"We are not out of this by a very long way.\"\nShe said current coronavirus rates were still causing concern, patience was needed about the vaccination programme and the NHS still faced its usual winter pressures.\nSusan Hopkins, from Public Health England, said the UK need to see the death rate \"fall much lower\" before any decision to ease measures.\nShe said teams were currently studying the impact on the UK's vaccine programme of the variant first identified in South Africa.\nBut she added the \"consensus view\" from four UK laboratories suggested that \"the current vaccine works against the variant that was first discovered in the UK\".\nIn other developments:"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The US has pledged to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to poorer nations from next year - bringing its total commitment to more than one billion.\n\"To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere,\" US President Joe Biden told a virtual Covid-19 summit.\nThe donation will be routed through Covax - the international scheme designed to ensure low-income countries aren't left behind in the fight against Covid.\nIt came amid growing warnings over the pace of global vaccinations, and inequity of access.\nCovax was created last year to ensure that Covid vaccines are made available around the world, with richer countries subsidising costs for poorer nations.\nThe scheme hopes to distribute enough vaccines to protect at least 20% of the population in 92 low- or medium-income countries - starting with healthcare workers and the most vulnerable groups.\nIts initial goal was to provide two billion doses of vaccines worldwide in 2021, and 1.8 billion doses to 92 poorer countries by early 2022. \nCovax is run by a number of international organisations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN children's charity, Unicef. \nGhana was the first country to receive Covax vaccines in February. \nSince then, more than 303 million doses have been shipped through Covax to 142 countries around the world, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia and Fiji. \nMost doses are going to poorer countries, but some have been sent to wealthier countries such as Canada, which defended its request.\nCovax works with with governments and vaccine manufacturers around the world. Supporters include the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the UAE, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Portugal.  \nCountries have pledged to donate both money and surplus doses from their own vaccine supplies.\nThe UK, Japan, Canada and the European Union are among those to have committed to supplying tens of millions of doses.\nWHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus previously criticised wealthier nations for \"gobbling up\" the global vaccine supply. \nG7 countries have purchased over a third of the world's vaccine supply, despite making up only 13% of the global population.\nSix vaccines have been given \"emergency use authorisation\" by the WHO, meaning they can be shared via Covax: AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and Sinovac.\nHowever, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses have been delivered so far. \nModerna has agreed to supply 500 million doses at its \"lowest-tiered price\", but most won't be available until 2022. \nCovax has been criticised for being slow. Some initial targets were missed, partly as a result of the poor health infrastructure in many of the recipient countries, and partly because of vaccine hesitancy. \nDeliveries were also delayed because of the deteriorating situation in India. Officials there restricted exports to protect their own population amid soaring infection rates. These are set to resume from October. \nCovax has told the BBC that too many donations have come in small quantities, at the last minute and with little time left before they expire. This makes it very hard to get them to where they are needed. \nRepresentatives of the scheme also note that only a small percentage of the pledges made earlier this year have turned into actual doses. \nUnicef executive director Henrietta Fore said countries needed to \"accelerate their donation plans\", with low-income nations unable to wait any longer. \nWhile many high-income countries have now given at least one shot to more than half their populations, only 2% of people in low-income countries have had their first dose, according to data from the University of Oxford.\nCovax says it is now expecting to hit its \"key milestone\" of releasing two billion doses for delivery some time early next year. \nIn total, some six billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 195 countries worldwide.\nHowever, while some countries have fully vaccinated a large amount of their population, many others have only just begun, or in some cases are still waiting for their first doses to arrive.\nCovax aims to close that gap. \"With a fast-moving pandemic, no one is safe, unless everyone is safe,\" the WHO says on its website. \nBut even if Covax meets its goal to vaccinate 20% of the population in its 92 target countries, that's well short of the level of immunity that experts say is needed to end the pandemic.\nThe WHO has suggested that figure is at least 70%. People may also need booster doses to remain protected. "

It's cheaper to come to South Tyneside and take it away,\" he said.  \n\"But what we are doing is urging people not to come here and take it away, it's there for a reason.\"\nThe Pampas grass helps to bond poor soils found at the coast, while Marram grass helps to prevent erosion in the dunes.\nSigns are to be erected warning people not to pick the grass because it is already in need of replenishment, the council said. \n\"Through Covid, we have a massive amount of people coming to the coastal town, it's Benidorm without the sunshine,\" he added.\n\"It's great to see people at the seaside enjoying it [the grass] and that's what it's part of.

The government's daily figures, which rely on positive tests, are slightly lower.\nIt follows a surge of cases last month, leaving the UK with one of the highest coronavirus death rates globally.\nThe Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland registered 7,776 deaths with coronavirus on the death certificate in the most recent week.\nThat total is the third highest of the epidemic. \nLast April, there were two weeks with more than 9,000 coronavirus deaths registered across the UK - but there have been no other weeks with more than 7,000 deaths registered. \nAbout nine in 10 death certificates citing coronavirus registered Covid as the cause of death.\nMost of the deaths have been in older age groups - nearly three-quarters of those who have died with the virus were over 75. One in three deaths were care home residents.\nChris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents health service managers, described the milestone as a \"tragedy\".\n\"Behind each death will be a story of sorrow and grief,\" he said.\n\"We pay tribute, once again, to NHS and care staff who have done everything they can throughout the long months of this pandemic to avoid each one of these deaths and reduce patient harm.  \n\"We won't know the true impact of Covid-19 for a long time to come because of its long-term effects.\n\"But, as well as the high death rate, it's particularly concerning that this virus has widened health inequalities and affected black, Asian and minority-ethnic communities disproportionately.\" \nSarah Scobie, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said it was a \"harrowing figure\".\nShe added: \"While the vaccine rollout for the most vulnerable is continuing at impressive speed, it will be a while until the benefits feed through to the figures.\" \nWe were one of the worst hit countries, if not the worst, in the spring - certainly in Europe and the G7.\nTwo big drivers of that were the timing of the first lockdown and the terrible numbers of deaths in care homes.\nAs a result, the UK could always rank among the hardest hit nations overall.\nBut comparing experiences in second waves is harder. \nSome countries have very clearly done better than the UK. \nAustralia, for example, has seen very few coronavirus deaths overall, and deaths quite close to usual levels throughout 2020. \nBut the US, which had a milder first wave than the UK, has seen steady numbers of coronavirus deaths throughout summer and autumn.\nIts death toll has been catching up with that of the UK in the most recent data, covering up until Christmas. \nAnd some countries that missed the first wave entirely - such as Poland (shown above) or Germany - have seen significant spikes in deaths in recent months. \nWith deaths rising since then in many countries and vaccination programmes only getting up and running, there is still a long way to go before we will know who has had the toughest second wave.

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Retailing,Delivery services,Economic effects of Brexit,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "A couple of weeks ago Lili Piraki, a London-based journalist, was surprised by a text out of the blue from delivery firm DHL.\nShe was delighted to hear a friend had sent her a present: a pair of gold earrings from Greece. She was less impressed that she would have to pay nearly \u00a330 in taxes to receive the gift. \nThe extra charges are a result of new post-Brexit rules that came into force on 1 January. \nDespite the free trade deal agreed before Christmas, which promised to smooth the UK's exit from the EU,  new taxes and charges now apply to almost everything that goes back and forth between the two, including gifts, second hand items, products bought on Amazon or eBay and from private sellers.\nAfter we reported recently on Londoner Ellie Huddleston's shock at being asked to pay \u00a382 to receive a \u00a3200 coat, dozens of you got in touch asking why they were being charged extra.\nSo we asked some experts to run through five readers' experiences to explain the new charges.\nLondoner Sascha Grillo was trying to add to his model collection by ordering a new car from a seller in Germany, but when he typed into the website that he wanted delivery to the UK, the price leapt up from \u00a350 to \u00a362.\n\"I was shocked, because I thought that with the Brexit deal, this wouldn't happen,\" he said.\n\"I thought day-to-day commercial transactions would remain the same, but this is not the case.\"\nHe decided not to buy.\nWhy was he charged more?\nThe free trade deal means there are no quotas or tariffs on the goods traded between the EU and UK, but that doesn't mean there are no extra taxes or costs.\nSince 1 January the UK is no longer part of the EU VAT regime, so the UK government is applying VAT (sales tax) at 20% on goods from the EU, explains Gary Rycroft, a partner at Joseph A Jones & Co Solicitors.\nIn Sascha's case the new tax was applied at the \"point of sale\", in other words when he clicked to order. That is how the system is supposed to work on all goods worth under \u00a3135, says Martyn James from the free complaints website Resolver. \nUK VAT accounts for \u00a310 of the extra \u00a312 that Sascha was asked to pay. Sellers may also be charging higher delivery fees to cover any extra paperwork or border delays they may face.\nKarishma Neog, an IT professional based in Bristol, has a weakness for designer handbags. In the first week of January she ordered two, one for her and one as a present, from a retailer in Paris, spending \u00a3600 plus \u00a325 for delivery.\nWhen they arrived she was charged an extra \u00a3123.\n\"I had no inkling it was going to be the case,\" she says. There was no mention of it on the seller's site.\nWhy was she charged?\nAs with Sascha's cars, the charge was probably for UK VAT. But because Karishma's handbags were worth more than \u00a3135 she wasn't charged when she clicked to buy. \nInstead, when you buy more expensive items the VAT is applied when the items reach you.\nMichelle Dale from accountants UHY Hacker Young says the other possibility is that Karishma was charged customs duties. \nIf you're buying something that comes from the EU, the free trade deal means you won't pay any customs duties. But, while Karishma's bags came from a seller in Paris, they may not be made from French materials, they might not even be made in France. \nThe devil is in the detail when it comes to these \"rules of origin\" says Gary Rycroft. But they only apply to items over \u00a3135 that come from outside the UK and EU.\nSo if you're buying a pricier item, it is always worth asking if any additional customs charges will apply. \nLili Piraki isn't the only one who was charged to receive a present. Even if the gift was wrapped and posted by a friend or relative it can still incur extra fees. \nSome readers thought they'd avoided extra charges by posting before Christmas, but many deliveries ran late, and so - because they arrived after 1 January - came with an extra bill to pay.\nThe first thing Lili knew about the earrings from her friend was a series of texts from DHL asking for \u00a328.85. \n\"I received a message from DHL saying in order to receive my gift I had to pay the taxes. I didn't even know anyone had sent me anything.\"\nShe checked all the details to be sure it wasn't a scam, and then paid the charges.\nWhy was she charged?\nGifts worth less than \u00a339 don't attract any extra charges, explains Michelle Dale. But gifts over that, like gold earrings, are eligible for VAT and (if it's over \u00a3135) customs duties. And it's always the recipient who receives the bill.\nWhen former soldier Hamish Clarke was stationed in Germany in the 1970s he developed an interest in modern European pottery. He still adds to his collection, buying on marketplaces or direct from sellers in Germany and Belgium.\nHe spied four pieces of pottery he liked on eBay and agreed a price of \u20ac160 [\u00a3142] with the seller.\n\"When I tried to pay for it, it was asking for \u20ac191 euros,\" he says.\nHe wondered whether the charges might have been avoided if he had bought directly from the seller. \nWhy was he charged?\nThere's no way around the import VAT, says Michelle Dale, and it applies to second hand items as well as gifts, even if you've bought them from a private individual. \nEBay already has its system set up to charge the extra VAT upfront. Amazon says VAT will always be charged at point of sale on its site too. But the system won't be running smoothly yet everywhere, warns Martyn James. \nJemima Brown ordered a \u00a3150 pair of boots from a UK company to be delivered to her home in Auvergne, France.\n\"A week later I received an email from La Poste telling me that when the parcel was delivered it would only be handed over if I paid the \u20ac88 [\u00a378] import duty,\" she says.\nThe documentation said it was \u20ac43 for VAT, \u20ac30 for customs tariffs, and \u20ac15 handling fees.\nShe rang the company which said she could reject the delivery and receive a full refund. \nWhy was she charged?\nShoppers on the continent buying from UK firms face the same rules as UK shoppers do in reverse so Jemima would have had to pay VAT and customs charges, because the boots or the materials they were made from, originated from outside the EU. \nMichelle Dale thinks Jemima was lucky to be able to reject the delivery so easily. Some firms are changing their terms and conditions so that customers have to cover the extra charges, even when goods are returned.\nGary Rycroft says if a retailer doesn't make it clear that you might face extra fees, you could argue that these were \"hidden costs\" that you shouldn't have to pay. But don't expect that to be an easy battle to win."

      "title": "Covid-19: Five days that shaped the outbreak",
      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),China,Wuhan,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A year ago, the Chinese government locked down the city of Wuhan. For weeks beforehand officials had maintained that the outbreak was under control - just a few dozen cases linked to a live animal market. But in fact the virus had been spreading throughout the city and around China. \nThis is the story of five critical days early in the outbreak. \nBy 30 December, several people had been admitted to hospitals in the central city of Wuhan, having fallen ill with high fever and pneumonia. The first known case was a man in his 70s who had fallen ill on 1 December. Many of those were connected to a sprawling live animal market, Huanan Seafood Market, and doctors had begun to suspect this wasn't regular pneumonia. \nSamples from infected lungs had been sent to genetic sequencing companies to identify the cause of the disease, and preliminary results had indicated a novel coronavirus similar to Sars. The local health authorities and the country's Center for Disease Control (CDC) had already been notified, but nothing had been said to the public.\nAlthough no-one knew it at the time, between 2,300 and 4,000 people were by now likely infected, according to a recent model by MOBS Lab at Northeastern University in Boston. The outbreak was also thought to be doubling in size every few days. Epidemiologists say that at this early part of an outbreak, each day and even each hour is critical. \nAt around 16:00 on 30 December, the head of the Emergency Department at Wuhan Central Hospital was handed the results of a test carried out by sequencing lab Capital Bio Medicals in Beijing. \nShe went into a cold sweat as she read the report, according to an interview given later to Chinese state media. \nAt the top were the alarming words: \"SARS CORONAVIRUS\". She circled them in bright red, and passed it on to colleagues over the Chinese messaging site WeChat. \nWithin an hour and a half, the grainy image with its large red circle reached a doctor in the hospital's ophthalmology department, Li Wenliang. He shared it with his hundreds-strong university class group, adding the warning, \"Don't circulate the message outside this group. Get your family and loved ones to take precautions.\"\nWhen Sars spread through southern China in late 2002 and 2003, Beijing covered up the outbreak, insisting that everything was under control. This allowed the virus to spread around the world. Beijing's response invoked international criticism and - worryingly for a regime deeply concerned about stability - anger and protests within China. Between 2002 and 2004, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) went on to infect more than 8,000 people and kill almost 800 worldwide. \nOver the coming hours, screen shots of Li's message spread widely online. Across China, millions of people began talking about Sars online.\nIt would turn out that the sequencers made a mistake - this was not Sars, but a new coronavirus very similar to it. But this was a critical moment. News of a possible outbreak had escaped.\nThe Wuhan Health Commission was already aware that there was something going on in the city's hospitals. That day, officials from the National Health Commission in Beijing arrived, and lung samples were sent to at least five state labs in Wuhan and Beijing to sequence the virus in parallel.\nNow, as messages suggesting the possible return of Sars began flying over Chinese social media, the Wuhan Health Commission sent two orders out to hospitals. It instructed them to report all cases direct to the Health Commission, and told them not to make anything public without authorisation.\nWithin 12 minutes, these orders were leaked online.\nIt might have taken a couple more days for the online chatter to make the leap from Chinese-speaking social media to the wider world if it wasn't for the efforts of veteran epidemiologist Marjorie Pollack. \nThe deputy editor of ProMed-mail, an organisation which sends out alerts on disease outbreaks worldwide, received an email from a contact in Taiwan, asking if she knew anything about the chatter online.\nBack in February 2003, ProMed had been the first to break the news of Sars. Now, Pollack had deja vu. \"My reaction was: 'We're in trouble,'\" she told the BBC.\nThree hours later, she had finished writing an emergency post, requesting more information on the new outbreak. It was sent out to ProMed's approximately 80,000 subscribers at one minute to midnight.\nAs word began to spread, Professor George F Gao, director general of China's Center for Disease Control [CDC], was receiving offers of help from contacts around the world.\nChina revamped its infectious disease infrastructure after Sars - and in 2019, Gao had promised that China's vast online surveillance system would be able to prevent another outbreak like it.\nBut two scientists who contacted Gao say the CDC head did not seem alarmed.\n\"I sent a really long text to George Gao, offering to send a team out and do anything to support them,\" Dr Peter Daszak, the president of New York-based infectious diseases research group EcoHealth Alliance, told the BBC. But he says that all he received in reply was a short message wishing him Happy New Year. \nEpidemiologist Ian Lipkin of Columbia University in New York was also trying to reach Gao. Just as he was having dinner to ring in the New Year, Gao returned his call. The details Lipkin reveals about their conversation offer new insights into what leading Chinese officials were prepared to say at this critical point.\n\"He had identified the virus. It was a new coronavirus. And it was not highly transmissible. This didn't really resonate with me because I'd heard that many, many people had been infected,\" Lipkin told the BBC. \"I don't think he was duplicitous, I think he was just wrong.\"\nLipkin says he thinks Gao should have released the sequences they had already obtained. My view is that you get it out. This is too important to hesitate.\"\nGao, who refused the BBC's requests for an interview, has told state media that the sequences were released as soon as possible, and that he never said publicly that there was no human-to-human transmission.\nThat day, the Wuhan Health Commission issued a press release stating that 27 cases of viral pneumonia had been identified, but that there was no clear evidence of human to human transmission.\nIt would be a further 12 days before China shared the genetic sequences with the international community.\nThe Chinese government refused multiple interview requests by the BBC. Instead, it gave us detailed statements on China's response, which state that in the fight against Covid-19 China \"has always acted with openness, transparency and responsibility, and \u2026 in a timely manner.\"\nBBC This World's 54 Days: China and the pandemic can be seen on BBC Two at 21:00 GMT on Tuesday 26 January, or 23:30 on Monday 1 February (except BBC Two Northern Ireland). Or watch on BBC iPlayer. \nPart two - 54 Days: America and the Pandemic - will be on BBC Two on Tuesday 2 February at 21:00.\nA BBC/PBS Frontline co-production. \nInternational law stipulates that new infectious disease outbreaks of global concern be reported to the World Health Organization within 24 hours. But on 1 January the WHO still had not had official notification of the outbreak. The previous day, officials there had spotted the ProMed post and reports online, so they contacted China's National Health Commission. \n\"It was reportable,\" says Professor Lawrence Gostin, Director of the WHO Collaborating Center on national and global health law at Georgetown University in Washington DC, and a member of the International Health Regulations roster of experts. \"The failure to report clearly was a violation of the International Health Regulations.\"\nDr Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist who would become the agency's Covid-19 technical lead, joined the first of many emergency conference calls in the middle of the night on 1 January.\n\"We had the assumptions initially that it may be a new coronavirus. For us it wasn't a matter of if human to human transmission was happening, it was what is the extent of it and where is that happening.\"\nIt was two days before China responded to the WHO. But what they revealed was vague - that there were now 44 cases of viral pneumonia of unknown cause.\nChina says that it communicated regularly and fully with the WHO from 3 January. But recordings of internal WHO meetings obtained by the Associated Press (AP) news agency some of which were shared with PBS Frontline and the BBC, paint a different picture, revealing the frustration that senior WHO officials felt by the following week.\n\"'There's been no evidence of human to human transmission' is not good enough. We need to see the data,\" Mike Ryan WHO's health emergencies programme director is heard saying.\nThe WHO was legally required to state the information it had been provided by China. Although they suspected human to human transmission, the WHO were not able to confirm this for a further three weeks.\n\"Those concerns are not something they ever aired publicly.  Instead, they basically deferred to China,\" says AP's Dake Kang. \"Ultimately, the impression that the rest of the world got was just what the Chinese authorities wanted.  Which is that everything was under control. Which of course it wasn't.\"\nThe number of people infected by the virus was doubling in size every few days, and more and more people were turning up at Wuhan's hospitals.\nBut now - instead of allowing doctors to share their concerns publicly - state media began a campaign that effectively silenced them.\nOn 2 January, China Central Television ran a story about the doctors who spread the news about an outbreak four days earlier. The doctors, referred to only as \"rumour mongers\" and \"internet users\", were brought in for questioning by the Wuhan Public Security Bureau and 'dealt with' 'in accordance with the law'.\nOne of the doctors was Li Wenliang, the eye doctor whose warning had gone viral. He signed a confession. In February, the doctor died of Covid-19. \nThe Chinese government says that this is not evidence that it was trying to suppress news of the outbreak, and that doctors like Li were being urged not to spread unconfirmed information.\nBut the impact of this public dressing down was critical. For though it was becoming apparent to doctors that there was, in fact, human-to-human transmission, they were prevented from going public.\nA health worker from Li's hospital, Wuhan Central, told us that over the next few days \"there were so many people who had a fever. It was out of control. We started to panic. [But] The hospital told us that we were not allowed to speak to anyone.\"\nThe Chinese government told us that \"it takes a rigorous scientific process to determine if a new virus can be transmitted from person to person\".\nThe authorities would continue to maintain for a further 18 days that there was no human-to-human transmission.\nLabs across the country were racing to map the complete genetic sequence of the virus. Among them was a renowned virologist in Shanghai, Professor Zhang Yongzhen who began sequencing on 3 January. \nAfter having worked for two days straight, he obtained a complete sequence. His results revealed a virus that was similar to Sars, and therefore likely transmissible.\nOn 5 January, Zhang's office wrote to the National Health Commission advising taking precautionary measures in public places.\n\"On that very day, he was working to try and get information released as soon as possible, so the rest of the world could see what it was and so we could get diagnostics going\", says Zhang's research partner, Professor Edward Holmes an evolutionary virologist at the University of Sydney.\nBut Zhang could not make his findings public. On January 3, the National Health Commission had sent a secret memorandum to labs banning unauthorised scientists from working on the virus and disclosing the information to the public.\n\"What the notice effectively did,\" says AP's Dake Kang, \"is it silenced individual scientists and laboratories from revealing information about this virus and potentially allowing word of it to leak out to the outside world and alarm people.\"\nNone of the labs went public with the genetic sequence of the virus. China continued to maintain it was viral pneumonia with no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.\nIt would be six days before it announced that the new virus was a coronavirus, and even then, it did not share any genetic sequences to allow other countries to develop tests and begin tracing the spread of the virus.\nThree days later, on 11 January, Zhang decided it was time to put his neck on the line. As he boarded a plane between Beijing and Shanghai, he authorised Holmes to release the sequence. \nThe decision came at a personal cost - his lab was closed the next day for \"rectification\" - but his action broke the deadlock. The next day state scientists released the sequences they had obtained. The international scientific community swung into action, and a toolkit for a diagnostic test was publicly available by 13 January.\n Despite the evidence from scientists and doctors, China would not confirm there was human-to-human transmission until 20 January.\nAt the beginning of any emerging disease outbreak, says health law expert Lawrence Gostin, it's always chaotic. \"It was always going to be very difficult to control this virus, from day one. But by the time we knew [the international community] it was transmissible human to human, I think the cat was already out the bag, it already spread. \n\"That was the shot we had, and we lost it.\"  \nAs Wang Linfa, a bat virologist at Duke-Nus Medical School in Singapore, says: \"January 20th is the dividing line, before that the Chinese could have done much better. After that, the rest of the world should be really on high alert and do much better.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The EU has warned Covid vaccine producers they must deliver agreed supplies, amid fears reductions could seriously hamper its inoculation drive.\nAstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech have both said production problems mean they cannot supply the expected numbers.\nThe EU warned it could restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc, with Germany's health minister demanding \"fair distribution\".\nThe UK's vaccine minister warned of \"the dead end of vaccine nationalism\".\nAstraZeneca is mainly produced in the UK, while the UK's supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine come from the company's Belgian plant.\nVaccine supply has become a critical issue as nations seek to stem high infection rates.\nSeparately, the German health ministry joined AstraZeneca in strongly denying some reports in German media of a lower efficacy rate for its vaccine among older people.\nLast week, AstraZeneca told the EU it was falling behind on its supply target because of production problems and Pfizer-BioNTech has also said supplies of its vaccine will be lower.\nIn response, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has now said companies making Covid vaccines in the bloc will have to \"provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries\".\nShe said the 27-member EU bloc would \"take any action required to protect its citizens\".\nGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn backed her call, saying: \"This is not about EU first, this is about Europe's fair share.\"\nChancellor Angela Merkel told the virtual version of the annual World Economic Forum, usually held in Davos, there should be a \"fair distribution\" across the world.\nEuropean Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen earlier told forum: \"Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines. And now, the companies must deliver. They must honour their obligations.\"\nThe row could affect supplies to the UK of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nResponding to the EU's comments, the UK's Minister for Covid Vaccine Deployment Nadhim Zahawi said on Tuesday that supplies were \"tight\" and warned against what he called \"the dead end of vaccine nationalism\", adding: \"No-one is safe until the whole world is safe.\"\nHe said he was confident the UK would receive enough doses to meet its targets - a first dose to 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February and to offer all adults their first dose by autumn.\nThe EU has already faced criticism for the slow rollout of vaccines, which it buys on behalf of all member states.\nMs Kyriakides tweeted that Monday's talks with AstraZeneca \"resulted in dissatisfaction with the lack of clarity and insufficient explanations\".\nShe said the EU had requested \"a detailed planning of vaccine deliveries\" and the next meeting with the company would be held on Wednesday.\nAstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish multinational headquartered in England, said it was \"doing everything it can to bring its vaccine to millions of Europeans as soon as possible\".\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine is being used already in the UK but has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to green light it at the end of this month. \nThe bloc signed a deal in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March.\nLast week, AstraZeneca said \"reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain\" meant the number of initial doses for EU member states would be lower.\nOfficials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year.\nAn AstraZeneca partner plant in Belgium involved in the \"viral vector\" process - the delivery of genetic material into cells - is thought to be the problem.\nBut one German member of the European Parliament, Peter Liese, told Reuters news agency that the statement that there were difficulties in the EU supply chain but not elsewhere was \"flimsy\" and there should be \"no problem to get the vaccine from the UK to the continent\".\nEuropean officials familiar with Monday's EU-AstraZeneca meeting said the company had offered to bring forward deliveries by a week to 7 February, but this did not mean an increase in supplies for the quarter.\nThe Serum Institute of India also produces a large amount of AstraZeneca jabs, but has no immediate plans to divert to the EU.\nOther nations, including Australia and Thailand, have said they have also been told of a drop in AstraZeneca supply.\nThe AstraZeneca reduction is a serious blow in the wake of Pfizer-BioNTech's statement.\nPfizer-BioNTech said last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian plant.\nThe EU has ordered 600 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, which is already being used on patients around the bloc.\nUrsula von der Leyen has pledged to inoculate 70% of adults in the EU by the end of August.\nBy Stephanie Hegarty, BBC Population correspondent\nAs the diplomatic tussle goes on between vaccine-producing countries in Europe there could be a rare bit of good news for the rest of the world, including the lower-income countries already struggling to secure a supply. \nCovax, an initiative spearheaded by the World Health Organization that aims to distribute vaccines around the world more fairly, says it doesn't expect its supply of vaccines to be affected. \nMost of that supply is coming from a producer in India with some also manufactured in South Korea. \nCovax says it's on schedule to deliver its first vaccines in lower-income countries in February, helped by the fact that the US under President Joe Biden recently committed $4bn (\u00a33.5bn) to the scheme.\nGermany's health ministry on Tuesday firmly denied reports in German media of a lower efficacy rate for AstraZeneca among the elderly.\nThe reports, including in the Handelsblatt economic daily, cited sources saying the efficacy was as low as 8% in the over 65s.\nBut the ministry said its review of the data in the reports \"did not allow this assumption\" and that it \"appears that two things have been mixed up in the reports\".\nAstraZeneca issued a statement saying the reports were \"completely incorrect\", adding: \"In November, we published data in The Lancet demonstrating that older adults showed strong immune responses to the vaccine, with 100% of older adults generating spike-specific antibodies after the second dose.\"\nUK Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said the reports had created \"confusion and concern\" and risked \"adding to the spread of disinformation\"."

      "text": "Mandatory Covid passports have been scrapped in England, and their use has been scaled down in Northern Ireland. \nHowever, venues can choose to keep using the scheme on a voluntary basis if they wish, and Scotland and Wales retain their own systems.\nCovid passes are no longer mandatory in any venue, as part of the government's decision to lift Plan B coronavirus measures.\nAnnouncing the change, the prime minister said venues could continue to ask customers to provide evidence of their vaccination status or a recent negative test if they wished.\nEngland's scheme previously applied to:\nYou could only enter these venues if could show:\nProof of natural immunity - for instance, a positive PCR test taken in the past six months - was not accepted as an alternative to proof of vaccination or a recent test.\nSome large events weren't included in the rules, including communal worship, wedding ceremonies, funerals, protests and mass-participation sporting events (such as a marathon).\nIts Covid passport scheme is no longer mandatory for pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres - although venues are being encouraged to carry on using it. \nHowever, Covid passes are still required for entry to:\nPeople can either show proof of vaccination, proof of a negative lateral flow test taken in the previous 48 hours, or proof of a positive PCR test taken in the previous 30 to 180 days.\nThe COVIDCert NI app can be used to show proof of vaccination, or a paper version can be requested.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that its Covid pass scheme is not being extended to cinemas and theatres for the time being. \nHowever, they are still required for entry to:\nEvent organisers  are being asked to review 50% or 1,000 vaccine passports of attendees, whichever figure is higher, and a booster will be required to count as fully vaccinated if your second dose was more than four months ago.\nUnder Scotland's scheme, proof of vaccination or a negative test within 24 hours can be shown with the NHS Scotland Covid Status App, the NHS App (if from England or Wales) or Covidcert NI app (if from Northern Ireland) - a printed paper version is also acceptable.\nUnder-18s are exempt, as are vaccine trial participants, and those who couldn't be vaccinated for medical reasons.\nPeople need to show their NHS Covid Pass to gain entry to cinemas, theatres and concert halls.\nPrior to the current restrictions - which are due to be lifted in the coming weeks - the scheme also applied to nightclubs and comparable venues, unseated indoor live events for more than 500 people, unseated outdoor live events for more than 4,000 people and any event for more than 10,000 people.\nOver-16s who have been fully vaccinated in Wales or England can use the pass to prove their status, but it's only compulsory for over-18s.\nPeople can show a negative LFT result instead of proof of vaccination, but this must now have been done within the previous 24 hours and not 48 hours.\nIn England, the government says venues which didn't comply with the rules could face prosecution or a fixed penalty notice ranging from \u00a31,000 to \u00a310,000.\nIn Wales, fixed penalty notices can be issued up to a maximum of \u00a310,000. That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "text": "Poor white teenagers in England's former industrial towns and those living on the coast are among the least likely to go to university, warns the watchdog for fair access.\n\"These are the people and places that have been left behind,\" says Chris Millward of the Office for Students.\nThe watchdog has used a new measure to see which groups are likely or not to go to university.\nMPs are investigating low attainment among white working class pupils.\nThe Office for Students looked at overlapping factors - such as poverty, race, gender and where people live - which are indicators of whether someone is likely to go to university.\nThis combined measure found white youngsters on free meals or from disadvantaged areas were 92% of those in the bottom fifth, in terms of the likelihood of going to to university.\nThese were particularly concentrated in some areas - such as parts of Nottingham, Great Yarmouth, Barnsley, Sheffield, Stoke and Hull.\nMr Millward, director of fair access, warns that these communities, \"over successive generations\", have missed out on the rise in access to universities.\n\"The expansion of educational opportunities, and the belief that equality of opportunity would flow from this, have not delivered for them. So they are less likely to see education as the way to improve their lives,\" writes Mr Millward.\nThe research emphasises the importance of place, identifying particularly low entry rates in \"former industrial towns and cities across the north and midlands, or coastal towns\".\nBut white students on free meals in London seemed to have bucked the trend, with an the entry rate that \"has pulled away from that in other parts of the country\" - and the capital overall has higher rates of going to university.\nFigures from the Department for Education last year reported that \"male white British free school meal pupils are the least likely of all the main ethnic groups to progress to higher education\".\nThe Education Select Committee is investigating why \"left behind white pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds\" seem to be underachieving in education."

      "text": "Some residents flooded out of their homes after a mine blow-out will not be able to return for at least six months, the Coal Authority has said.\nEighty people were evacuated from Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, on Thursday and residents were urged to stay away due to safety fears.\nSome have returned but others will be out for months, and the Coal Authority (CA) could buy a small number of homes.\nWater flowing out of Drummau Mountain has found a \"new path\", it said.\nThe CA said the \"blow out\" was caused by a blockage underground which led to the water breaking out to find the easiest path.\nChief executive Lisa Pinney said work to cap the mine shaft would take three months but a new water management system will have to be built deep underground to divert the water, which will take at least six months.\nShe said the authority was looking at \"every option\" to get as many people back in their homes as quickly and safely as possible, including buying some homes from residents.\nWater is now coming out of the ground at the junction of Drummau Road and Goshen Park in the village.\nAccording to the authority, there is a mineshaft at the junction of Goshen Park. Water had been flowing through an underground channel there.\nHowever a blockage has formed in it, and water has built up in the channel over time, causing the blow out.\nMs Pinney said: \"There's a lot of water coming off the mountain, off the extensive, very ancient mine-workings on the hills above.\n\"Water, when it's found a path, that tends to be its new path. What we need to do is put in this new permanent solution, so that it is properly managed and it will have a new permanent pipeline which will take it safely through the village and out to a discharge point.\"\nA temporary water diversion will remain in place in the meantime.\nShe said the authority was focusing on alternative access to get as many people back in their homes \"on a permanent basis\" as soon as possible.\nHowever she cautioned: \"There will be at least a small number [for] who that will be a longer period of time.\n\"I hope it will be a very, very small number [who will have to leave for six months]. There are different options and we need to have that discussion with anybody that it might affect.\"\nThe authority does not think any houses are structurally unsafe and does not use compulsory purchase orders on properties.\nMs Pinney said: \"We do sometimes buy houses if the residents are happy to sell them and we have a reason for needing to do that so for example if there was a case of real subsidence for example.\"\nA dedicated residents' phone line on 0800 2884268 will go live from Wednesday at 09:00 GMT and Neath Port Talbot council is putting updates on its website.\nThe number will be staffed every day from 9am to 5pm until Friday, 5 February including the weekend, and then from Monday to Friday for as long as needed.\nAppointments to discuss remedial work, what financial support is available and arranging liaison with insurers if relevant would be available over the phone or video call.\nCovid secure face-to-face appointments will also be available at Neath Port Talbot council's incident support centre at Abbey Primary School on Thursday, Friday and some days next week.\nMs Pinney said they were working to get residents in as soon as possible so that insurance assessors could come in and people could start work on their homes."

      "text": "Scientists have proposed 10 golden rules for tree-planting, which they say must be a top priority for all nations this decade.\nTree planting is a brilliant solution to tackle climate change and protect biodiversity, but the wrong tree in the wrong place can do more harm than good, say experts at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.\nThe rules include protecting existing forests first and involving locals.\nForests are essential to life on Earth. \nThey provide a home to three-quarters of the world's plants and animals, soak up carbon dioxide, and provide food, fuels and medicines.\nBut they're fast disappearing; an area about the size of Denmark of pristine tropical forest is lost every year. \n\"Planting the right trees in the right place must be a top priority for all nations as we face a crucial decade for ensuring the future of our planet,\" said Dr Paul Smith, a researcher on the study and secretary general of conservation charity, Botanic Gardens Conservation International, in Kew.\nA raft of ambitious tree-planting projects are underway around the world to replace the forests being lost.\nBoris Johnson has said he is aiming to plant 30,000 hectares (300 sq km) of new forest a year across the UK by the end of this parliament.\nAn African-led movement to plant a 5,000-mile (8,048km) forest wall to fight the climate crisis is set to become the largest living structure on Earth, three times the size of the Great Barrier Reef.\nHowever, planting trees is highly complex, with no universal easy solution.\n\"If you plant the wrong trees in the wrong place you could be doing more harm than good,\" said lead researcher Dr Kate Hardwick of RBG Kew.\nAll too often natural forests teeming with plants, animals and fungi are replaced by commercial plantations with row upon row of timber trees, which will be harvested after a few decades, she told BBC News. \n\"What we're trying to do is to encourage people, wherever possible, to try and recreate forests which are similar to the natural forests and which provide multiple benefits to people, the environment and to nature as well as capturing carbon.\"\nThe review of research, published in the journal Global Change Biology, found that in some cases, planned tree planting does not increase carbon capture and can have negative effects. \nThe 10 golden rules are:\nProtect existing forests first\nKeeping forests in their original state is always preferable; undamaged old forests soak up carbon better and are more resilient to fire, storm and droughts. \"Whenever there's a choice, we stress that halting deforestation and protecting remaining forests must be a priority,\" said Prof Alexandre Antonelli, director of science at RGB Kew.\nPut local people at the heart of tree-planting projects\nStudies show that getting local communities on board is key to the success of tree-planting projects. It is often local people who have most to gain from looking after the forest in the future. \nMaximise biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals\nReforestation should be about several goals, including guarding against climate change, improving conservation and providing economic and cultural benefits.\nSelect the right area for reforestation\nPlant trees in areas that were historically forested but have become degraded, rather than using other natural habitats such as grasslands or wetlands.\n Use natural forest regrowth wherever possible\nLetting trees grow back naturally can be cheaper and more efficient than planting trees.\nSelect the right tree species that can maximise biodiversity\nWhere tree planting is needed, picking the right trees is crucial. Scientists advise a mixture of tree species naturally found in the local area, including some rare species and trees of economic importance, but avoiding trees that might become invasive.\n Make sure the trees are resilient to adapt to a changing climate\nUse tree seeds that are suitable for the local climate and how that might change in the future.\n Plan ahead\nPlan how to source seeds or trees, working with local people.\nLearn by doing\nCombine scientific knowledge with local knowledge. Ideally, small-scale trials should take place before planting large numbers of trees.\nMake it pay\nThe sustainability of tree re-planting rests on a source of income for all stakeholders, including the poorest.\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

The council said it would be investigating the cause of the flooding, which forced road closures and evacuations.\nNatural Resources Wales (NRW) said the River Dee, which runs through Bangor-on-Dee, was at its highest recorded level since the water gauge became operational in 1996 - 16.45m (54ft).\nIt urged people across Wales to remain vigilant, with river levels not set to have peaked until late Thursday evening, adding they would remain high until Friday morning.\nThe Met Office said over the past two days Wales had the highest rainfall of the four UK nations. \nBetween 19 and 21 January, Aberllefenni in Gwynedd saw 188mm (7.5in) of rain, more than average rainfall for Wales for the whole of January, which is 156.89mm (63in).\nThat was followed by 180mm (7in) in Crai reservoir, Powys, 169.8mm (6.6in) in Treherbert, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and 166mm (6.5in) in both Maerdy, RCT, and Capel Curig, Conwy.\nThe flooding threatened the supply of the coronavirus Oxford vaccine, which is produced at Wrexham Industrial Estate.\nWrexham council leader Mr Pritchard said it had to work to \"make sure we didn't lose the vaccinations in the floods\".\n\"I've been up all night... it's a very difficult time for us,\" he added.\nWockhardt UK, which manufactures the vaccine, said at about 16:00 GMT on Wednesday, excess water surrounded part of its buildings.\n\"The site is now secure and free from any further flood damage and operating as normal,\" it said.\nA multi-agency statement described the situation in Bangor-on-Dee as a \"major incident\".\nIt said: \"As a severe weather warning indicates that there is a risk to life...\n\"The evacuation effort continues, with all routes in and out of the village currently closed to the public due to the flooding.\"\nEarlier, some residents in Ruthin were told to leave their homes - people have been told Covid rules allow them leave their homes in an emergency.\nMeanwhile, a man's body was recovered from the River Taff near Blackweir in Cardiff.\nDozens of ducks and chickens, and 12 huskies were rescued by the RSPCA from a flooded farm in Bangor, while they also took hay to two donkeys stranded by flood water in Mold.\nDave Brown said the flooding in his home in Broughton, Flintshire, was horrific and his mother-in-law was rescued by firefighters.\n\"You don't realise the damage water does and everything that floats - the sheer volume of water. I am 6ft tall and it almost took me out,\" he said. \nWrexham council said some of the people forced to leave their homes were with relatives, while it found others accommodation after having to initially seek refuge in a church hall.\nNine properties in Berse Road in New Broughton were also evacuated. \nThe situation in Ruthin, Denbighshire, overnight was \"horrendous\", town councillor Stephen Beach said.\n\"The whole of Ruthin was on edge,\" he said.\n\"Some people were accommodated at the leisure centre, and others were offered places to stay by local residents. The community was superb.\n\"It was the sheer volume of water that came down - there was no stopping it.\"\nWeather and flood warnings\nA yellow weather warning for ice for Wales has been issued by the Met Office until 10:00 GMT on Friday, with concerns it could lead to travel disruption, slips and falls.\nNumerous flood warnings and alerts remain in place across Wales, including two severe flood warnings.\nThe agency said flood defences were being used and river levels at Holt, Wrexham, would remain high for some time.\"There is therefore a significant risk of localised flooding problems and due to that the severe flood warning will remain in place until the levels drop,\" Keith Iven of NRW said\nIn Monmouthshire roads were closed following flooding, and the council said while water levels at the River Usk were dropping, a \"second peak\" on the River Wye had been expected on Thursday night.\nThe council had warned people living in Riverside Park, Monmouth, may be impacted and council workers were prepared to offer support.\nMid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it had attended 98 flooding-related incidents\nIt said it deployed swift water rescue teams to rescue 13 people from vehicles in floodwater. It also winched vehicles from water and pumped water from properties. \nIn Cardiff, emergency services attended a crash involving a number of vehicles at about 07:40 on the A4232 between Culverhouse Cross and the M4.\nNo-one was seriously injured, but both carriageways were closed for just over an hour. The road has since reopened.\nIn Carmarthen, people were treated for the effects of fumes after using a generator to pump water from their homes. \nIn Knighton and Crickhowell in Powys, crews spent Wednesday night pumping out a number of properties.\nIn Borth, Ceredigion, floodwater hit the water treatment plant, an electrical substation and eight properties.\nOgwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team had to rescue a man from the roof of his car.\nIt said he had tried to drive through the river ford along the road from Llandygai to Bangor, in Gwynedd, but had become stuck in deep water and had climbed onto the roof. He was not injured.\nRhondda Cynon Taf council said it was aware of a minor landslip on the mountainside above Pentre. \nIt said an initial inspection determined there was no immediate threat to the area and a further detailed inspection would be carried out on Friday. It asked people to avoid the area.\nDozens of roads have been closed across Wales, and while Covid rules are in place stopping people from travelling apart from for essential reasons, people are being warned not to travel in affected areas due to widespread flooding.\nChris Lloyd from North Wales Mountain Rescue Association warned people to not visit flood-hit areas to view the damage.\nHe told BBC Radio Wales: \"People who are going out to look at the floods are not only putting themselves at risk, but putting additional people on the roads which professional emergency services don't want - we don't want any more incidents.\"\nDenbighshire council said Ysgol Bodfari in Denbigh and Ysgol Caer Drewyn, Corwen, which had been open for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers, have been closed.
