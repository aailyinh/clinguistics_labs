      "text": "Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers have led tributes at Stormont to the Conservative MP Sir David Amess who was killed last week.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan described him as a political \"giant\" at Westminster and a \"tireless\" backbencher who was a good friend of the DUP and the union.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill expressed sympathy to his family.\nShe said no politician \"should face any attack when carrying out work on behalf of their constituency\".\nMs O'Neill also highlighted the abuse she and other Northern Ireland assembly members (MLAs) have been subjected to on a daily basis.\nShe also revealed that she once had to \"physically remove an uninvited person from her home\".\nMr Givan also warned about the rise in abuse being directed at public representatives both online and also in the media.\nIn his tribute to Mr Amess, he singled out the MP's work in helping migrants working in his constituency.\nMLAs from across the chamber joined the tribute to Sir David and also called for an end to the abuse of public representatives. \nSir David was stabbed at his constituency surgery in Essex on Friday.\nPoliticians in Northern Ireland have been contacted by police about their security following the attack. \nEarlier, a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) peer who survived two murder bids described Sir David's murder as \"an attack on democracy, not just an individual\".\nLord Dodds said there was determination across the political spectrum \"to carry on\".\nThe peer is a former deputy leader of the DUP who served as MP for North Belfast from 2001 to 2019.\nIn 1996, Lord Dodds, then a Belfast councillor, and his wife, DUP assembly member Diane Dodds, both escaped injury in a gun attack.\nThe couple were visiting their ill son in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital when the IRA shot and wounded their police bodyguard.\nSeven years later, dissident republicans left a bomb outside the former DUP deputy leader's constituency office.\nLord Dodds said that following Sir David's murder, politicians from across the United Kingdom will be thinking: \"There by the grace of God, it could've been me.\"\n\"Because it appears completely random,\" he said.\n\"Why was it Jo Cox, why was it David Amess? Many hundreds of MPs hold constituency surgeries, particularly on Fridays and at weekends.\n\"This is an attack on democracy, not just an individual - people trying to silence and shut down political opinion and debate, democracy in the United Kingdom.\"\nBut he said that \"there is a determination across the political spectrum to carry on and not let these people win\".\nThe former DUP MP also called for a social media crackdown on online trolls.\nHe said that politicians, in particular females, are \"abused on a daily basis\" on social media.\n\"We've seen people attacked before on social media but it has got a lot worse and social media companies have to take responsibility and stop these anonymous trolls that whip up hate and hysteria,\" Lord Dodds told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"There needs to be a greater condemnation across the board from political spectrum, especially from those who seek to eulogise terrorism at times.\n\"Because of social media, there is a lot more known about elected representatives, about their movements, their appointments. \n\"MPs want to reach out to their constituents through social media, but it does have its drawbacks.\""

      "tags": "Greenhouse gas emissions,Climate change,Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy,Kwasi Kwarteng,Renewable energy",
      "text": "Experts have criticised plans to subsidise low-carbon heat pumps in place of gas boilers for homeowners in England and Wales from next April.\nHouseholds will be offered subsidies of \u00a35,000 from next April to help them make the switch.\nAlthough up to 25 million UK homes have gas boilers, the grants will fund just 90,000 pumps over three years.\nThe government says this will boost demand for the pumps, but critics say the plan does not go far enough.\nHomeowners will be encouraged to switch to a heat pump or other low-carbon technology when their current boiler needs replacing.\nAn air-source heat pump costs between \u00a36,000 and \u00a318,000, depending on the type installed and the size of a property.\nMinisters say the subsidies will make heat pumps a comparable price to a new gas boiler. However, the \u00a3450m being allocated for the subsidies over three years has been criticised as insufficient.\nExperts also point to the need for costly new insulation and other home improvements to help households get the best out of the switch.\n\"Gas is in the news for price increases that are on the horizon,\" said Dr David Glew, head of energy efficiency and policy at the Leeds Sustainability Institute at Leeds Beckett University.\n\"But gas is actually relatively cheap to heat your home with,\" he added.\n\"Needing to insulate your house might cost you tens of thousands of pounds and you're only going to be saving several hundreds of pounds, so the economics of that doesn't really add up.\"\nMike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said the number of heat pumps that the grants would cover \"just isn't very much\" and meant the UK would not meet its climate targets.\n\"These grants will only incentivise the best-off households,\" he said.\nGreenpeace UK's climate campaigner, Caroline Jones, said the government needed to provide more money to speed up the switch.\n\"A clearer signal would have been a phase-out of new boilers before 2035,\" she said.\nThe government says it wants no new gas boilers to be sold after 2035, but it has not banned them outright.\nWriting in the Sun, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"The Greenshirts of the Boiler Police are not going to kick in your door with their sandal-clad feet and seize, at carrot-point, your trusty old combi.\"\nDowning Street later declined to say whether the government would ban gas boilers in the future, after international trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said \"there will be a point\" when the voluntary approach would change. \nJonny Marshall, senior economist the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on poverty, said the UK would struggle to meet its goal of cutting emissions from homes in half by 2035.\nThe UK has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.\nBut a group of experts that advises the government says Boris Johnson's government has credible policies in place to deliver only about a fifth of this cut.\nHelen Selman lives with her husband and two children in Chippenham. When they moved into a 1930s semi, they knew they wanted to undertake home improvements, an upgrade to the heating system and an extension. \n\"It was not cheap,\" she said. \"But because we were doing everything else, and because this was going to be our forever home, it made sense.\" \nHelen chose an air-source heat pump but alongside it, they had a specifically designed insulation upgrade, new radiators and brand new underfloor heating. \n\"With a heat pump, the problem is that you have to make sure that your house is as well insulated as possible,\" she explained. \"We already had double or triple-glazing, we had insulated walls, we were upgrading the lofts.\"\nTo help with the project, Helen and her family used the old Renewable Heat Initiative funding: \"The RHI money will pay back quarterly over seven years and will go quite a long way to covering the costs.\"\nShe said: \"It's been definitely worth the bother.\" \nBut she admitted that without their own plans to extend and the added bonus of government cash, it might not have happened. \"Without an incentive, there are few people who have the cashflow or the passion to do this,\" she said. \nHeating buildings accounts for more than a fifth of the UK's overall greenhouse gas emissions, so there is pressure on the government's Heat and Buildings Strategy to deliver effective reductions.\nBusiness and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the grants to support the adoption of heat pumps, available from next April, would help to bring down the cost of the relatively new technology by 2030.\nHeat pumps extract warmth from the air, the ground or water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse.\nThey are powered by electricity, so if you have a low-carbon source of electricity, they provide greener heating.\nOne energy firm, Octopus Energy, said it expected homeowners to pay about \u00a32,500 to the cost of installing a heat pump, roughly equivalent to the cost of a new gas boiler. The government subsidy would cover the rest.\nBut many houses will require an upgrade to their energy efficiency, including insulation, before installing one.\nA box of about one metre by one metre needs to be outside (close to or attached to the property) to draw in air.\nIt should be at least one metre from your neighbour's property so they will not be able to hear it, although it shouldn't be much louder than your fridge.\nRead more: Should I get a heat pump and how much will it cost me?\nIn total, \u00a33.9bn funding is being provided, with most of that invested in decarbonising public buildings, insulating and installing new heating systems in social housing and for those on low incomes, and helping to provide clean heating networks for homes that are unsuitable for heat pumps.\nThe plan also includes:\nIndependent climate think tank E3G said that setting the phase-out date for new fossil fuel boilers was \"a world-leading achievement\" and the pledge to reduce heat pump costs by 2030 was to be welcomed. \nHowever, the funding was insufficient to achieve the government's goals on reducing emissions, programme leader Pedro Guertler said.\n\"On energy efficiency alone, the public investment announced today falls \u00a32bn short of what was pledged in the Conservative manifesto to 2025,\" he said.\nEd Miliband, the shadow business secretary, described the strategy as \"meagre, unambitious and wholly inadequate\", adding that Labour had pledged to spend \u00a36bn a year on insulation and low carbon heating.\nThe Liberal Democrats described the heating plan as \"a kick in the teeth for families across the country facing soaring energy bills this winter\".\nIt's another piece in the Boris Johnson climate-calming jigsaw. \nFirst, he slots in a world-leading policy halting the sale of petrol cars by 2030. \nNow he lays down another piece - no new gas boilers after 2035. It's another trend-setting initiative that other nations will surely follow.\nThere's a problem, though. Because by that date in the middle of the next decade, the PM has already pledged to cut emissions overall by 78% over 1990 levels.\nEnergy experts say that simply won't happen unless he provides much wider incentives for people to insulate their homes and to buy heat pumps to replace their gas boilers. \nOne group of researchers estimates that to meet his net zero targets he needs to invest nearly another \u00a310bn over three years. \nThey hope the chancellor will fill that piece of the jigsaw in his spending review next week.\nIndustry sources welcomed the new strategy.\nThe Confederation of British Industry said it would help members prepare for the changes ahead, but its chief policy director, Matthew Fell, called for \"a clear delivery plan for consumers, businesses and local authorities\".\nScottish Power's chief executive, Keith Anderson, said it would kick-start demand for electric heating, \"allowing the industry to accelerate the delivery of electrification and quickly bring down upfront costs\"."

      "text": "FBI agents are sweeping properties in the US linked to Russian billionaire oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \nMr Deripaska, who has close ties to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, was placed under US sanctions in 2018.\nThe oligarch's spokesman told Reuters news agency the FBI is searching two homes owned by relatives of Mr Deripaska under court warrants related to those sanctions.\nImages showed agents carrying boxes out of a Washington DC home.\nOthers stood guard outside behind yellow crime scene tape.\nThe representative said another property in New York was also being searched. \nSo far it is unclear exactly why the searches are taking place. A spokesperson for the FBI told NBC News the agency was conducting \"law enforcement activity\" at the Washington DC property, without giving any further details. \nMr Deripaska, 53, made his fortune in the 1990s as a metals broker. In 1997 he founded the industrial group Basic Element, one of Russia's largest, which he still owns. \nThe US Treasury placed Mr Deripaska under sanctions in 2018 along with six other Russian oligarchs, as well as a number of companies they own and senior Russian government officials.\nSteve Mnuchin, then Treasury secretary, said the move was a response to Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, which Moscow denies.\n\"The Russian government engages in a range of malign activity around the globe,\" a statement released at the time said. \"Russian oligarchs and elites who profit from this corrupt system will no longer be insulated from the consequences of their government's destabilizing activities.\"\nA year later US President Donald Trump lifted sanctions on three firms linked to Mr Deripaska after he ceded control, a move criticised by Democrat politicians. Sanctions remained on the magnate himself, however.\nMr Deripaska also has links with Paul Manafort, a former campaign manager for President Trump, who was convicted of fraud before his pardon by Mr Trump in December 2020.\nIn 2016 the Guardian newspaper reported that Mr Manafort had worked with Mr Deripaska on investment deals in Ukraine."

      "text": "The family of Sir David Amess have visited the church where he was killed to see some of the many tributes left in his memory.\nSir David's widow, Julia, was comforted by family members as she spent about 10 minutes reading messages at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea.\nBoris Johnson led MPs in making tributes in the House of Commons.\nHe vowed Sir David's death would not \"detract from his accomplishments as a politician or as a human being\".\nThe Queen has agreed to award Southend city status, after a long-standing campaign by Sir David, the prime minister confirmed.\nA minute's silence was held earlier and a service took place at St Margaret's Church, next to Parliament, where the Archbishop of Canterbury gave an address.\nSir David, 69, the Conservative MP for Southend West, had been meeting constituents when he was stabbed multiple times on Friday. A 25-year-old British man, Ali Harbi Ali, is being held under the Terrorism Act. \nThe father-of-five's death has sparked an outpouring of grief, not only within his local community in Essex where he had been an MP for nearly 40 years, but from across the country.\nThe church where he was killed is surrounded by large piles of flowers, heart-shaped balloons and framed pictures, and people continued to lay tributes on Monday.\nDuring their visit, the family held each other as they read some of the messages. They later bowed their heads and formed a semi-circle around the church's minister, the Reverend Clifford Newman, who spoke to them privately.\nMr Johnson said Sir David was a \"seasoned campaigner of verve and grit\" who \"never once witnessed any achievement by any resident of Southend that could not somehow be cited in his bid to secure city status for that distinguished town\".\nMPs spoke of their grief at losing a much-loved colleague and friend in Sir David.\nConservative former prime minister Theresa May said he gave an \"extraordinary\" service to his constituents.\n\"I suggest to anybody who wants to be a first-class constituency MP that you look at the example of David Amess,\" she said.\nConservative former minister Mark Francois described Sir David as his \"best and oldest friend in politics\".\nMr Francois added: \"Everything I ever learned about being a constituency MP I learnt from David Amess.\"\nLabour MP Kim Leadbeater, the sister of Jo Cox - the MP murdered by a right-wing extremist five years ago - said her thoughts were with Sir David's family.\n\"I do have a unique perspective on what those closest to David are going through and I want to send them my love, support and solidarity, from myself, my parents, our family, and the people of Batley and Spen,\" she said.\nAt the weekend, Sir David's family released a statement saying the wonderful tributes to him had given them strength, but they were still trying to understand \"why this awful thing has occurred... nobody should die in that way\". \n\"We are absolutely broken, but we will survive and carry on for the sake of a wonderful and inspiring man,\" they said.\nDetectives are continuing to hold Ali Harbi Ali, a British national of Somali heritage, at a London police station and have until Friday to question him.\nThe BBC has been told he was referred to the counter-terrorist Prevent scheme some years ago, but was never a formal subject of interest to MI5.\nIt is also understood that his father, Harbi Ali Kullane, who was previously an adviser to Somalia's prime minister, has been visited by police who have taken his phone for analysis.\nPolice officers spent the weekend searching three addresses in London.\nAhead of the formal tributes in Parliament, MPs discussed their own personal safety concerns.\nMany MPs have spoken of a toxic and increasingly polarised political culture where online trolling has become widespread, including personal insults and direct threats of violence.\nLabour's Tulip Sadiq told the BBC that all MPs, especially women, are subject to attack and that her mother feared for her doing the job. \nSir David's neighbouring MP in Southend, Conservative James Duddridge, said \"no-one that loves me, none of my friends, would want me to be a Member of Parliament\" but they support him because it is \"honourable\" and \"worthwhile\".\nDeputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said he had received \"three threats to life and limb\" over the past two years - but he does not want to \"allow those who attack our democracy\" to win. \nAnd Labour's Chris Bryant said a man had been arrested over a death threat he received at the weekend. \nAsked whether MPs' surgeries with constituents should take place online, Downing Street said the murder could not \"get in the way of democracy\".\n\"MPs may rightly be concerned about security, they've been contacted by police to discuss their activities and events so their arrangements can be reviewed,\" the No 10 spokesman said."

      "text": "The famous BBC logo has had a makeover after audiences told the corporation its services looked \"old-fashioned\" and \"out of date\".\nThe three blocks incorporating the letters BBC will be slightly wider apart and will feature the corporation's own Reith font.\nNamed after the BBC's founder, it will replace the current Gill Sans one.\nNews and Weather will also have new symbols made up of three blocks placed at different angles for each service.\nBBC Sounds, iPlayer, BBC Sport and BBC Bitesize will have similar icons in various different colours.\nAnd services like the iPlayer will become easier to use and navigate, the BBC said.\n\"As we update our digital services, it makes sense to modernise how we present them too,\" said the BBC's chief customer officer Kerris Bright. \"Updated, recognisable colours, logos and graphics will identify each service and help improve navigation between them.\"\nHere's a look at some of the new logos:\nOn TV, viewers will see BBC One, Two and Four using updated designs in the segments between programmes from Wednesday (20 October).\nOther changes will be brought in gradually over the coming months. \nThe BBC said it wanted to modernise \"all aspects of our services so the experience feels coherent wherever you access our content\" adding that it wanted to \"join the dots\" between the different BBC services \"through simplified layouts and graphics\".\nThe new BBC logo had a soft launch late last year when it began to appear on BBC Select, the corporation's streaming service for the US and Canada.\nSome critics felt the new version wasn't significantly different to the old one and questioned the cost involved.\nBut the BBC told The Sun earlier this year: \"We are using our own font - which we own the intellectual rights to - when we update content or BBC products.\n\"It would be wrong to suggest the costs of the design of the blocks was significant.\"\nIt's understood the precise design costs will not be published as they are commercially confidential.\nMany users on Twitter had fun making light of the new logos, with some pointing out an apparent similarity between the new logos and the fictional one in BBC comedy W1A, which lampoons the inner workings of the corporation.\nHugh Bonneville, who plays the BBC's Head of Values Ian Fletcher on the show, joked online that the fictional Fun Media PR company would have a job on their hands proving in court that the logo had been copied despite their similar-looking pitch in one of the episodes.\nFellow actor Jason Watkins, who portrays Director of Strategic Governance Simon Harwood replied, also in character, saying the company had noted how the BBC Sounds logo \"is of course an utterly 'opposite colour-way'\".\nThe BBC blocks logo was first introduced in 1958 and has gone through various updates over the years, the most recent in 1997."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nDowning Street says it is \"keeping a very close eye\" on rising Covid cases - but it adds that cabinet ministers have not yet discussed rolling out the government's Plan B to control coronavirus in England this winter. Plan B, announced in September, involves reintroducing some measures such as compulsory face coverings. The UK has announced more than 40,000 daily cases for seven days in a row. There were also 223 Covid deaths reported today - the highest number since 9 March - although reporting lags mean Tuesday figures can be higher. \nScientists are studying a new descendant of the Delta variant of Covid in the UK to better understand how much of a threat it may pose. Delta is the UK's dominant variant, but latest official data suggests 6% of cases that have been genetically sequenced are of a new type. Tests are under way to understand how much of a threat AY.4.2 - which some are calling \"Delta Plus\" - may pose. Experts say it is unlikely to take off in a big way or escape current vaccines.\nWearing face coverings in crowded indoor spaces will remain a legal requirement in Northern Ireland throughout autumn and winter. It forms part of the executive's winter Covid contingency plans, outlined today. Meanwhile in Scotland, secondary school pupils must continue to wear face masks in the classroom after the Scottish government decided against lifting the measure. It said the move would allow more time for 12-15 year olds to be vaccinated.\nA top US college football coach has been fired for refusing to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Washington State University sacked Nick Rolovich, its highest-paid employee, and four of his assistants, for failing to meet a vaccine mandate. The mandate means all state workers in Washington have to be fully vaccinated or lose their jobs. Mr Rolovich, 42, who earned $3.1m (\u00a32.25m) a year, had applied for a religious exemption from the mandate.\nCare worker Dan Wakeman says he felt overwhelmed by the pandemic until he started making art. He now collects driftwood and whatever he can find along the Dorset coastline and turns it into sculptures. \"I basically hit rock bottom and just needed something to bring back my joy,\" the 45-year-old said. \"I just felt overwhelmed and quite grumpy and this has helped me express myself.\" Find out more about his art here.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nIs the pace of the vaccine booster rollout too slow?

      "tags": "Scottish government,Schools,Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Secondary school pupils must continue to wear facemasks in the classroom after the Scottish government decided against lifting the measure. \nThe government said keeping the current rules in place would allow more time for 12-15 year olds to be vaccinated. \nIt said it hoped to be able to lift the restrictions at the \"earliest possible time\" - but gave no indication of a timescale. \nThe existing rules on face coverings for school staff will also remain.\nIt means that secondary school pupils and staff must cover their faces at all times when they are at school.\nBut primary school staff will only need to wear a face mask when they are moving around the school or in communal areas such as canteens and staff rooms - and there is no requirement for primary school pupils to wear face coverings. \nThere had been speculation that the rules for secondary pupils could be relaxed after draft guidance - which has not been published - recommended lifting the requirement for face coverings to be worn in the classroom. \nHowever, Scotland's chief medical officer later advised that while there were \"encouraging signs\", a more cautious approach was needed.\nThe announcement was welcomed by the EIS teaching union, which said it help to ensure schools were able to remain open while also allowing more time for \"ventilation challenges\" to be met in schools ahead of winter. \nBut Scottish Conservative education spokesman Oliver Mundell said the announcement would be a \"massive disappointment\"for pupil and parents, adding: \"Scotland's schools should have been a priority for the SNP but with facemasks in classrooms remaining, young people have once again been sent to the back of the queue.\n \"Pupils, parents and teachers need to see a plan from the SNP for a return to normal learning as soon as possible.\"\nEducation Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said the recent decline in Covid cases in Scotland was starting to level off, and it was therefore important to continue to take a cautious approach. \nShe added: \"Progress with vaccinating 12-15 year olds has been remarkable and is already over 40%. \n\"However, this was only rolled out a few weeks ago and allowing further time will mean that the encouraging figure rises even higher.\n\"We will continue to monitor case rates on a weekly basis, with a view to lifting restrictions at the earliest possible time.\"\nShe acknowledged that the announcement would be disappointing for some pupils and their parents, but said safety had to be the \"overriding priority\".\nThe rules on wearing face coverings in English schools were lifted on 17 May. \nThis is not news we were expecting to hear. It had been understood that relaxations would be made to schools guidance following the October holidays. Instead, we are staying still. \nThe government says cases aren't falling in the way it had hoped, but that has been the situation for some weeks now. It says it wants more teenagers to be vaccinated. \nWill we see further relaxation of these school rules as we head towards the Christmas holidays? Will we stay as we are, or even tighten up on classroom restrictions, as we brace for what could be a difficult winter? It looks like the next month could be crucial. "

      "text": "North Korea has fired a suspected submarine-launched ballistic missile into waters off the coast of Japan, South Korea's military has said.\nPyongyang unveiled the missile in January, describing it as \"the world's most powerful weapon\".\nIt comes weeks after South Korea unveiled a similar weapon of its own.\nNorth Korea has carried out a flurry of missile tests in recent weeks, including of what it said were hypersonic and long-range weapons.\nSome of these tests violate strict international sanctions.\nThe country is specifically prohibited by the United Nations from testing ballistic missiles as well as nuclear weapons. \nThe UN considers ballistic missiles to be more threatening than cruise missiles because they can carry more powerful payloads, have a longer range and can fly faster.\nOn Tuesday South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said one missile had been launched from the port of Sinpo, in the east of North Korea where Pyongyang usually bases its submarines. It landed in the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan.\nThey said it was suspected to have been a submarine-launched ballistic missile.\nSouth Korean media reported that this particular missile was believed to have travelled about 450km (280 miles) at a maximum height of 60km. \nJapan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said two ballistic missiles had been fired, calling the launches \"very regrettable\".\nIn October 2019, North Korea tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile, firing a Pukguksong-3 from an underwater platform.\nAt the time, state news agency KCNA said it had been fired at a high angle to minimise the \"external threat\".\nHowever, if the missile had been launched on a standard trajectory, instead of a vertical one, it could have travelled around 1,900km. That would have put all of South Korea and Japan within range.\nBeing launched from a submarine can also make missiles harder to detect and allow them to get closer to other targets. \nThe latest launch comes as South Korea develops its own weapons, in what observers say has turned into an arms race on the Korean peninsula.\nSeoul is holding what is said to be South Korea's largest ever defence exhibition this week. It will reportedly unveil a new fighter jet as well as guided weapons like missiles. It is also due to launch its own space rocket soon.\nNorth and South Korea technically remain at war as the Korean War, which split the peninsula into two countries and which saw the US backing the South, ended in 1953 with an armistice.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un said last week that he did not wish for war to break out again. He said his country needed to continue developing weapons for self-defence against enemies, namely the US which he accused of hostility.\nNorth Korea has been pushing for years to develop and test nuclear-armed missiles from submarines.\nBut can they actually fire them from a submarine? We will have to wait for images of the launch, which will give analysts a better idea of just how far Pyongyang has come. \nAnd let's be clear about the threat - the country's submarines are reportedly noisy and easy to track. The regime is thought to have only one submarine capable of launching missiles while a second one is being built at Sinpo. \nThere is, of course, also a bit of showmanship going on here. \nJust last month, South Korea launched its own submarine-launched ballistic missile and the North was not impressed. \nSo, amidst this regional arms race, is there still hope for talks? \nSeoul still thinks so. But Kim Jong-un is sending mixed messages. One minute he is launching missiles and the next he is sending missives through state media about potential peace talks.\nAs ever, Pyongyang is proving difficult to read.\nMeanwhile, South Korean, Japanese and US intelligence chiefs are meeting in Seoul to discuss North Korea.\nThe US envoy to North Korea, Sung Kim, is currently on his way to the city to discuss how to restart dialogue with Pyongyang, including on whether there should be a formal declaration of the end of the Korean War.\nIn the last 24 hours, he has reiterated the stance of US President Joe Biden's administration that it is open to meeting with North Korea without pre-conditions. \nPrevious talks between the US and North Korea broke down due to fundamental disagreements on denuclearisation. \nThe US wants North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons before sanctions can be eased, but North Korea has so far refused."

      "tags": "Welsh government",
      "text": "Welsh independence is one of the options to be considered by a commission examining Wales' future relationship with the rest of the UK.\nThe new body, set up by Welsh Labour ministers, will look at how the current system of powers resting in Cardiff and London could change.\nCo-chairwoman Prof Laura McAllister said \"everything\" was on the table.\nThe Conservatives accused ministers of wasting time and resources, but said they would take part.\nProf McAllister will lead the new Independent Constitutional Commission alongside ex-Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. \nThey do not believe Wales' current constitutional arrangements are sustainable, and plan to talk to people around the country.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said nothing is ruled out from the commission, and anyone with an opinion can make their case.\nWelsh Labour, which supports Wales remaining part of the UK, had promised to form the body in its Senedd election manifesto.\nPlaid Cymru said the commission would give the opportunity to hold the \"most wide-ranging national conversation about Wales' future\".\nCurrently many important areas of government policy such as health, education and local government are run from Cardiff, with such laws made in the Senedd Cymru - Welsh Parliament.\nEverything else, like the army and broadcasting, is governed by Westminster. It is a similar set up to Scotland and Northern Ireland, where even more is devolved.\nBut concerns over the future of the UK have led some, like First Minister Mark Drakeford, to call for a more radical restructuring of the UK.\nMr Drakeford has argued that the union of the United Kingdom would be more secure if more policies relating to Wales and elsewhere were decided locally, and if the UK's nations were part of a voluntary union.\nThat was echoed in Welsh Labour's manifesto, which expressed support for \"far-reaching federalism\" within the UK.\nBut Laura McAllister said the commission would look at a \"whole suite\" of potential solutions.\nThe announcement from the Welsh government said the commission will develop options for reform \"of the constitutional structures of the UK in which Wales remains an integral part\". \nHowever, Prof McAllister said the commission would look at independence.\n\"I think everything is supposed to be on the table, quite rightly. So it would be ludicrous to remove any options at this stage,\" she said.\n\"It's important to be clear about language.\n\"Independence means different things depending on different contexts.\"\nCardiff university academic Prof McAllister served on the Richard Commission on devolution, which reported in 2004, and an expert panel on reforming the Senedd.\nShe denied that constitutional reform was a distraction from practical issues like the pandemic recovery or climate change.\n\"We won't be taking any attention away from that because we're an independent commission,\" she argued.\nSwansea-born Dr Rowan Williams, who led the Church of England from 2002 until he retired in 2012, said the commission would be addressing \"urgent\" questions about how to \"make a democracy fit for purpose\".\n\"At the moment we have a four-nations model which is pretty imbalanced,\" Dr Williams said.\n\"Devolved government is something which has been, to some extent, tacked on to an extremely centralised system.\n\"It's time we thought through what the implications were for working better for the people of Wales and the people of the UK.\"\nHe said he wanted to see \"grassroots buy-in\" to the process from Welsh people.\nProf McAllister added: \"I don't think it's going to be an easy task but Rowan and I will put our backs into making sure we listen to every community and every individual who wants to give us their take on how Wales should be governed.\"\nThe group is expected to deliver an interim report by the end of 2022, with a full report by 2023.\nThe full membership of the commission will be announced next month.\nRhys ab Owen, Plaid Cymru constitution spokesman, said: \"A constitutional commission is an opportunity to hold the most wide-ranging national conversation about Wales' future in the history of devolution.\n\"Plaid Cymru looks forward to engaging constructively with the commission and its work, making use of every opportunity it presents to make the case for independence and that our nation's interests will be best served when decisions over Wales' future are placed in Wales' hands.\"\nBut his Welsh Conservative counterpart, Darren Millar, said: \"People in Wales overwhelmingly rejected independence at the recent Senedd elections; and why the Welsh government would want to waste its time and resources discussing the topic is beyond me.\"\nIn the Senedd, Mr Millar confirmed his party would take part in the work of the commission, but said there was a \"serious question\" over the appointment and independence of Prof Laura McAllister given she stood twice for Plaid Cymru in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nShe left the party shortly afterwards. Mr Millar said some would question whether Prof McAllister is \"entirely independent in the way that she's able to organise this particular commission's business\".\nProf McAllister declined to comment on Mr Millar's remarks.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed in the Senedd that the inquiry will be able to look at independence.\nAt question time in the Senedd, Mr Drakeford said anyone with an opinion would be able to come and \"make their case\".\n\"It would be absurd to rule out independence - but nothing else is ruled out either,\" he said.\nIf he gives evidence to the commission, he said he would argue for \"entrenched devolution within a successful United Kingdom\".\nA second referendum on Scottish independence within the next five years was \"very likely\", Mr Drakeford said. He added he agreed with people who said Northern Ireland's future had become more \"uncertain\" since Brexit.\nThe issue of Scottish independence and the new legal framework required in the wake of Brexit have brought to a head the question of how the different governments of the UK should relate to each other. \nThe push and pull of power struggles between those governments - all of different political hues - is the subtext to many of the policy and spending decisions we hear about on a daily basis. \nIf the gamut of possible recommendations runs from the status quo to full-blown Welsh independence, the likely outcome may well end up being something in the middle of that spectrum.\nBut for any meaningful constitutional change to result from this, the UK government would have to support it.\nRight now, there's no sign of that.

      "title": "Covid: Is the pace of the vaccine booster rollout too slow?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "In September, the government's scientific advisers recommended that everyone over 50 should be offered a third dose of a Covid vaccine, along with frontline medical staff and younger adults with some underlying health conditions. \nAt the time, ministers called the programme the \"last piece of the jigsaw\" as the country transitions to living with the virus. Some though are concerned that the speed of the rollout has not been fast enough to best protect the most vulnerable. \nA total of 30 million people across the UK will eventually qualify for a third booster vaccine because they are in one of the nine priority groups most at risk from Covid. Only those who received their second dose at least six months ago are being asked to come forward. \nLatest data from the NHS shows 3.7 million people in England have been given a third jab under the programme, offering them the fullest protection against the virus this winter.\nAccording to calculations from the actuary John Roberts, from the Covid-19 Actuaries Response Group, which has been tracking the vaccine rollout, there are 8.5 million people now eligible for a booster if they want it. \nThat leaves 4.8 million who have had their second dose at least six months ago, but have not yet received that top-up. \nHe says that shortfall has been growing by about 800,000 a week as more people become eligible.\nMr Roberts says his calculations show 46% of those aged 80 or older have now received a third dose, followed by 30% of those aged between 75 and 79. \nHe told the BBC's Today Programme: \"If you project that [data] forward, then it's going to probably take us well into January before we get through those first priority groups. \n\"At the start of the booster campaign, the health secretary Sajid Javid said: 'We will protect the most vulnerable through the winter months'. But at the current rate it is going to be well through winter before we get through those first groups.\"\nScotland and Wales do not currently publish public data on the number of third booster doses given. \nIn Northern Ireland, the booster rollout has focused mainly on healthcare workers so far, with 5,291 of 82,911 people aged 80 or older given their third jab. \nSome research does suggest that, over time, protection from Covid vaccines may fade - or wane. \nA study published in September by Public Health England found that vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic Covid fell from 67% in the early weeks after a second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, to 47% after 20 weeks.\nProtection against severe disease and hospitalisation appeared to hold up better, decreasing from 95% to 77% over the same timeframe. \nThe UK got off to a fast start with its vaccine programme - jabbing the most vulnerable with first doses ahead of almost every other country in the world. \nBut that means the UK has a large number of elderly people who were vaccinated earlier and may now be seeing some of that protection fade. \nMr Roberts said: \"The latest data from the UK Health Security Agency shows that, for the over-75 population, we are seeing around 500 deaths a week in people who are are fully vaccinated, because we know that the vaccine is very effective against serious illness and death, but not completely effective.\"\nSince the first injections in December 2020, vaccines have been very effective at preventing hospitalisations and deaths. England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam said last month that the programme had saved 112,000 lives and prevented 24 million cases of Covid. \nMore recently, Covid infections have been rising again across the UK, although the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. \nWorking out how much vaccine is in the country is difficult, as the data is commercially sensitive and tends to be tightly controlled. But it's thought there are now about 20 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in UK warehouses, so supply is unlikely to be the problem it was in the pandemic's early stages.\nGPs and pharmacists, who are administering the bulk of the booster jab programme, are also having to deal with a major flu vaccine rollout this autumn, and there has been an increase in demand for doctor's appointments more generally.\nGovernment adviser Prof Adam Finn, from the University of Bristol, explained: \"The [booster] programme is much more complicated now than before.\n\"Previously it was a straightforward matter of opening up big centres and getting people in across the age cohorts. Now it's much more complicated with multiple different groups being offered vaccines.\n\"The booster programme will focus on the highest risk people first - so will see the most elderly and frontline health workers immunised as a priority.\"\nA survey for the World Economic Forum in September suggested that 82% of UK adults of all ages who had already received two doses of a vaccine would take a booster shot if offered - one of the highest rates in Europe, but still below universal take-up. \nAn NHS England spokesperson said: \"The NHS has delivered more than three million boosters in less than a month and at a faster rate than in December 2020.\n\"While the NHS continues to deliver first and second doses as well as rolling out the vaccine in schools, millions of people are being invited at least six months on from their second jab, which is in line with independent guidance.\""

      "text": "Shareholders in the supermarket chain Morrisons have approved a multi-billion pound takeover offer from a US private equity group. \nClayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) can now continue to take over the UK's fourth-largest supermarket group.\nMorrisons said 99.2% of shareholders voted in favour of the \u00a37bn ($9.7bn) deal.\nThe takeover had been the subject of fierce competition from two US-based investment groups.\nThe CD&R private equity group won the auction early in October with an offer of 287p per Morrisons ordinary share, against a rival bid from Fortress, for 286p per share.\nCD&R's auction offer was slightly higher than the 285p-a-share offer that was recommended by Morrisons' board in August.\nIn July, Morrisons turned down an offer worth \u00a35.5bn from CD&R, saying it significantly undervalued the business.\nThe takeover marks a return to the UK grocery sector for Sir Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco, who is a senior adviser to CD&R.\nMorrisons chair Andrew Higginson said: \"We thank shareholders for the strong support received at today's meetings.\n\"We remain confident that CD&R will be a responsible, thoughtful and careful owner of Morrisons and we will now move forward with the remaining steps in the acquisition process.\"\nThere has been speculation that Sir Terry could be appointed as chair of Morrisons.\nOn Tuesday, Sir Terry said: \"We are very pleased to have received the approval of shareholders and are excited at the opportunity that lies ahead.\n\"The particular heritage, culture and operating model of Morrisons are key features of the company and we will be very mindful of these during our tenure as owners.\n\"We very much look forward to working with the Morrisons team, not just to preserve the company's many strengths - but to build on these, with innovation, capital and new technology - helping the business realise its full potential and delivering for all of its stakeholders.\"\nThe deal is expected to complete on 27 October.\nMorrisons has been involved in a legal dispute over equal pay since 2019.\nLast month Leeds Employment Tribunal found that Morrisons' shop floor workers, who are mostly female, could compare their pay with the supermarket's mostly male warehouse workers. \nShop floor staff are hoping to claim up to \u00a3100m in missed pay. \nLaw firms Leigh Day and Roscoe Reid have been representing about 2,300 Morrisons workers. \nEmma Satyamurti, a Leigh Day partner, said the takeover deal shows that employees are the \"backbone of the company and so it makes sense that the supermarket should invest in them\".\n\"We hope the new owners feel the same and bring an end to the equal pay dispute by paying shop floor workers what they are worth.\"\nMorrisons was founded in Bradford in 1899 - where it still has its headquarters. The group has almost 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff.\nThe son of founder William Morrison's, the late Sir Ken Morrison, ran the business for 50 years.\nPreviously, CD&R said it recognised Morrisons' \"history and culture, and considers that this strong heritage is core to Morrisons and its approach to grocery retailing\".\nThe private equity firm said it would help Morrisons to build on its strengths, including its close relationships with suppliers and its property portfolio.\nMorrisons chairman Andrew Higginson and chief operating officer Trevor Strain both previously worked with Sir Terry at Tesco."

      "text": "The top US envoy to Afghanistan is stepping down from his role less than two months after American forces withdrew from the country.\nZalmay Khalilzad led the US dialogue with the Taliban, but months of diplomatic talks failed to prevent the militant group from seizing power.\nThe Taliban took control in August after capturing the capital Kabul.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Mr Khalilzad's deputy, Thomas West, would take over.\n\"I extend my gratitude for his decades of service to the American people,\" Mr Blinken said in a statement announcing Mr Khalilzad's resignation on Monday. \nIn a letter to Mr Blinken, Mr Khalilzad acknowledged that \"the political arrangement between the Afghan government and the Taliban did not go forward as envisaged\".\n\"The reasons for this are too complex and I will share my thoughts in the coming days and weeks,\" he wrote, saying he was stepping aside as the US entered the \"new phase of our Afghanistan policy\".\nHe added that he was \"saddened\" for the Afghan people given the current outcome.\nMr Khalilzad, 70, was born in Afghanistan and grew up in Kabul. He is a veteran US diplomat, holding previous positions under former presidents Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W Bush.\nHe spearheaded talks with the Taliban that led to the signing of the so-called Doha Agreement in February last year, which set a date for the US to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.\nIn September, US defence officials said the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan could be traced back to that deal. \nUS President Joe Biden continued the plan for withdrawal, with an end date of 31 August, marking an end to a 20-year presence in the country. US forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.\nSeparately on Monday, it was announced that the US state department's inspector general would review the final days of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, including the emergency evacuation of the country's embassy in Kabul. \nA department spokesperson said the review would also look at the resettlement of refugees.\nPresident Biden, a Democrat, has been criticised by his Republican opponents over the Afghan withdrawal. \nThe Taliban's rapid advance in August - when the militants seized control of the country within about two weeks - sparked a mass evacuation effort from the US and its allies, as thousands of people tried to flee.  \nA suicide attack killed more than 180 people during the operation."

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "The government has laid out its plans to reduce emissions sharply by 2035 and take the UK towards being a zero carbon economy by 2050. These including more electric cars, planting trees and moving away from gas-powered central heating.\nBut what potential hazards are there ahead for ministers?\nSome in the prime minister's own party doubt the economic arguments in favour of moving towards what they consider an over-reliance on renewable energy sources.\nConservative MP John Redwood asked in the House of Commons what would happen when the sun stopped shining and the wind stopped blowing. Another, Steve Baker, said a lot of \"assumptions\" were involved and asked that ministers carry out a \"comprehensive audit\" of their plans. \nOthers are concerned about the cost to the general public, particularly those on lower incomes, and the impact that, in turn, may have on their chances at the next election. \nCraig Mackinlay said it could become \"electorally difficult\" once people realised the plans \"cost them money\" or mean \"a lifestyle that's not as convenient\".\nGiven that the Conservatives have an 80-seat majority, this is unlikely to stop any plans becoming law, but if some of Mr Johnson's backbenchers are not persuaded, there could be some political turbulence.\nShadow business secretary Ed Miliband was scathing in his response to the government's announcement, saying there was nothing like \"the commitment we believe is required\", in terms of investment, to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nLabour's commitment to borrow and invest \u00a328bn per year in tackling climate change is a markedly different approach to the Conservatives. The Treasury has said borrowing heavily to cut greenhouse gases goes against the \"polluter pays\" principle and passes the costs on to future taxpayers. \nIt's not certain how this will play out in Parliament or whether this could become an important dividing line between the parties - and how it would play with voters.\nThe Treasury accepts there will be an overall cost to achieving net zero emissions in the short term, but sources stress the cost of inaction would also be significant. \nNo overall figure is given but officials admit new taxes will be needed to recoup the revenue lost from the move away from petrol and diesel fuelled cars, for example.  \nThe government raised \u00a337bn from fuel duty and vehicle excise duty in the 2019-20 financial year, or about 1.7% of GDP.\nA carbon tax could plug some of this, but the takings would dwindle as emissions fall, leaving a big shortfall.\nIn an assessment to go with the government's carbon-cutting plans, the Treasury said that \"as with all economic transitions, ultimately the costs and benefits of the transition will pass through to households through the labour market, prices and asset values\".\nThere is evidence of public support for stronger measures to tackle climate change, but if households end up having to spend a lot more money to go greener, there could be increased unease among voters that the government will not want ahead of a likely general election in the next couple of years.\nIn particular, it is feared this could go down badly in some of the former industrial areas of the the Midlands and northern England where the Conservatives made large gains from Labour in 2019.\n\"Any policies we bring in will be designed to be fair across the board,\" the PM's spokesman said.\nOne thing most governments agree on is that any effort to reduce emissions must be international if it is to succeed in limiting temperature rises.\nWith the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow fast approaching, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hope his plan prompts other countries to make similar commitments and boost the chances of the UK brokering a renewed global effort to cut greenhouse gases. \nIf the world's biggest CO2 producers - including the US, China and India - reach an agreement it could ease domestic political pressures and allow him to claim more of an environmental \"legacy\".\nUS President Jo Biden and Indian PM Narendra Modi are attending COP26, but China's Xi Jinping is not thought likely to do the same."

      "tags": "Google,Artificial intelligence,Mobile phones,Android",
      "text": "Google has unveiled its latest smartphone, containing the tech giant's first self-designed computer chip. \nThe Pixel 6 contains Google's \"Tensor\" processor, which it says enables new phone features powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning.  \nIt is also the first phone in the series with a \"Pro\" model, designed to compete at the high end of the market. \n\"The whole goal when we started was to reach this point,\" said Rick Osterloh, Google's head of devices. \n\"Really, this is our original vision that we're finally able to get to after building a lot of capabilities both in technology and in product development capabilities,\" he told the BBC. \nGoogle owns and operates the Android platform, used by almost every mobile phone maker apart from Apple. But the top end of the Android market has been dominated by other smartphone brands such as Samsung, whose phones can cost more than \u00a31,000. \nGoogle's Pixel line has often been priced in the middle of the market. \nBut the new Pixel 6 will retail for \u00a3599/$599, while the Pro model will cost \u00a3849/$899.  bringing it closer to the price of competing top-end devices. \nThat is the same launch price for the base model as the Pixel 5, which had, Google said at the time, been designed for \"an economic downturn\".\n\"Obviously, there's a lot of technology and these are expensive, for sure, but we're trying to offer users good value despite the fact that these are flagships,\" Mr Osterloh said. \nBoth the Pixel 6 and Pro are standard form-factor smartphones with a striking large horizontal bar across the upper back of the phone. \nThat bar contains all the camera lenses and sensors, instead of putting them off to one side in a camera \"bump\" popular on many modern models.\nBoth versions have a 50-megapixel (MP) main camera and a 12MP ultrawide. The Pro model has an additional 48MP camera, giving it a 4x optical zoom. \nThe Pro model also has more memory, a higher-resolution screen, and a faster screen refresh rate of up to 120hz - or 120 screen refreshes a second, which can make animations and fast movements appear smoother.\nModern smartphones rely heavily on \"computational photography\" to take good, clear photos. It is what gives each phone maker their own distinctive \"look\" to photos. \n\"For a long time, Pixel has been known for awesome photography, which is truly a function of our ability to do AI-driven, machine-learning-driven improvements to the camera experience,\" Mr Osterloh said.\n\"With this new platform, with Tensor, we've literally designed the platform to to be able to support he most cutting-edge work we have in all aspects of AI.\"\nOne of those is what Google calls a \"magic eraser\" - a system where the Photos app will detect distractions in the photo such as someone walking in the background, and try to remove them. The company says it can also be used for things such as power poles or wires, and users can manually select things to remove as well as the automatic system. \nAnother new feature is \"face deblur\". \nWhen taking a photo with the rear-facing camera, it will use all available cameras and take multiple versions. So if a person is constantly moving - such as Google's example of a young child - the camera will attempt to fix a blurry face by combining all the data, and attempt to figure out what the non-blurred version should look like. \nThe new processing power in its latest chip means that technology can now be applied to videos as they are recorded, giving them the same type of style as Pixel's still cameras. \nAsked if the new features would make their way to other Android phones, Mr Osterloh said: \"Many of them will only be Pixel\".\nHe said while it is possible some might eventually be available on other devices, \"a lot of it really requires this custom architecture and therefore it's likely to be on products that run Tensor for the foreseeable future only\". \nGoogle had first teased the existence of the Pixel 6 and Pixel Pro in August - along with its Tensor processor. \nUntil now, it has used chips designed by chip firm Qualcomm. But it says the Tensor chip is up to 80% faster than the Pixel 5 from 2020, as well as being power-efficient.\nOne significant advantage to its new chip, Google says, is that it can do more on the phone itself, without being connected to the internet - particularly through Google's popular virtual assistant. \nFor example, it says that voice transcription - which now uses the Google Assistant - will be faster and more accurate. Users can say \"Hey Google, type\" instead of tapping a button, and can also use voice commands to send messages. The voice system can be used at the same time as the text keyboard. \nGoogle's recorder app also leverages the snappier processor to live-transcribe audio recordings as they're made, even when the phone is not connected to the internet. \nIt also means that Google's live translation features are snappier than before, as more of the processing is done on the machine itself. \nBut it does not mean that Google Assistant will work perfectly offline for privacy campaigners.\n\"To be really useful, you need to assume that it's going to use the cloud,\" Mr Osterloh said.\n\"The speech recognition part of that workflow will happen on the device... [and] all the dictation\".\nBut most people ask for weather, or sports scores or other kinds of information that has to be retrieved from the internet.\n\"We're moving more and more workloads from the cloud to the device, we're trying to do that... to make sure the user has the best possible performance. But certainly this indicates a direction for privacy as well.\""

      "tags": "Kim Jong-un,Japan,North Korea missile tests,South Korea,United States,North Korea",
      "text": "North Korea has confirmed it successfully tested a new submarine-launched ballistic missile on Tuesday.\nState news outlet KCNA said the missile had \"advanced control guidance technologies\", which could make it harder to track.\nNorth Korea has carried out a flurry of weapons tests in recent weeks, launching what it said were hypersonic and long-range weapons.\nThe UN prohibits it from testing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons.\nBallistic missiles are considered more threatening than cruise missiles because they can carry more powerful payloads, have a longer range and can fly faster.\nNorth Korean state media on Wednesday said its latest missile had new \"controlling and homing\" technology which allowed it to move laterally. It was also capable of \"gliding and jumping movement\". It released pictures of the missile as well.\nIt said it was fired from the same submarine that launched an older missile in a 2016 test.\nThis missile was one of many new weapons put on display at a defence exhibition in Pyongyang last week.\nReports did not mention leader Kim Jong-un, suggesting he did not attend the test.\nOn Tuesday, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said one missile had been launched from the port of Sinpo, in the east of North Korea where Pyongyang usually bases its submarines.\nIt landed in the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan, and travelled about 450km (280 miles) at a maximum height of 60km. \nIn October 2019, North Korea tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile, firing a Pukguksong-3 from an underwater platform.\nAt the time, KCNA said it had been fired at a high angle to minimise the \"external threat\".\nHowever, if the missile had been launched on a standard trajectory, instead of a vertical one, it could have travelled about 1,900km. That would have put all of South Korea and Japan within range.\nBeing launched from a submarine can also make missiles harder to detect and would allow North Korea to deploy its weapons far beyond the Korean Peninsula.\nThe latest launch comes as South Korea develops its own weapons, in what observers say has turned into an arms race on the Korean peninsula.\nSeoul is holding what is said to be South Korea's largest ever defence exhibition this week. It will reportedly unveil a new fighter jet as well as guided weapons like missiles. It is also due to launch its own space rocket soon.\nNorth and South Korea technically remain at war as the Korean War, which split the peninsula into two countries and which saw the US backing the South, ended in 1953 with an armistice.\nKim Jong-un said last week that he did not wish for war to break out again. He said his country needed to continue developing weapons for self-defence against enemies, namely the US which he accused of hostility.\nMeanwhile, South Korean, Japanese and US intelligence chiefs are meeting in Seoul to discuss North Korea.\nThe US envoy to North Korea, Sung Kim, is expected to discuss how to restart dialogue with Pyongyang, including on whether there should be a formal declaration of the end of the Korean War.\nThis week he reiterated the stance of US President Joe Biden's administration that it is open to meeting with North Korea without pre-conditions. \nPrevious talks between the US and North Korea broke down due to fundamental disagreements on denuclearisation. \nThe US wants North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons before sanctions can be eased, but North Korea has so far refused."

      "text": "Foreign investment deals in low-carbon sectors in the UK to be announced on Tuesday will create about 30,000 jobs, the government has said. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce 18 new deals worth \u00a39.7bn as he opens a global investment summit.\nThey include investments in sectors such as wind and hydrogen energy, sustainable homes and carbon capture.\nThe prime minister said investors had recognised \"the massive potential in the UK for growth and innovation\".\nInvestments from companies such as Spanish energy firm Iberdrola, logistics firm Prologis and grocery service Getir would power the UK's economic recovery and help to achieve the government's levelling up agenda, he added.\nMr Johnson will open the Global Investment Summit in London on Tuesday, bringing together more than 200 business executives.\nThe government has assembled a formidable guest list of the great and good of global business for an investment summit it hopes will alert other international investors to opportunities in the UK. \nThe bosses of the world's biggest investment firm, Blackrock, the biggest bank in the US, JP Morgan, as well as the top brass from energy giants such as EDF will gather at the Science Museum in London. \nAnnouncements of nearly \u00a310bn in investment in the UK have been timed to coincide with the event.\nBy far the biggest single investment is from Spanish firm Iberdrola, which owns Scottish Power. Its announcement of a further \u00a36bn in offshore wind investment - on top of \u00a310bn over the last five years - will cement the UK's position as a world leader in offshore wind, just two weeks before the major climate summit in Glasgow.\nThe recent spike in gas prices has brutally exposed UK and EU reliance on fossil fuels, which may also encourage French firm EDF that their plans for a new nuclear plant at Sizewell in Suffolk will get government blessing. The chairman of EDF is due to have a breakfast meeting with the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng.\nThe government will hope this summit will help reverse a declining trend in foreign investment in new projects since 2015.  \nLater, Mr Johnson will take part in a panel discussion with Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates on the role of private companies in tackling climate change.\nIberdrola, which owns Scottish Power, will confirm that it will invest a further \u00a36bn in off-shore wind farms off the coast of Suffolk.\nThe wind turbines in its East Anglia \"hub\" are set to create about 7,000 jobs - although they have yet to secure planning permission.\nPrologis will commit to invest \u00a31.5bn in the UK over the next three years to develop net zero carbon warehouses across London, the South East and the Midlands, supporting about 14,000 new jobs. \n\"We believe private sector innovation has, and will continue to play, a major role in overcoming the environmental challenges the world faces today,\" said Prologis chief executive Hamid Moghadam.\nMeanwhile, Getir plans to put more money into expanding its activities across the UK. The firm uses a fleet of electric vehicles and is aiming to create about 7,000 permanent jobs in 2022.\nUltimate Battery Company will also invest \u00a328m in setting up a UK plant for eco-friendly batteries.\nOn Tuesday, the UK government is expected to announce its overall strategy for radically reducing the greenhouse gas emissions generated in across all sectors including industry, agriculture, transport and homes.\nThe government has pledged to reduce emissions sharply by 2035 and to reach net zero by 2050 - meaning the country will absorb as much carbon dioxide (through actions such as tree planting) as it emits.\nThe announcements come just two weeks before the start of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow - one of the largest world meetings to date on how to tackle global warming."

      "text": "A forensic review of the Clydach murders has made \"significant findings\" linking convicted killer David Morris to the crime scene, police have said.\nMorris, who died in August aged 59, was convicted of killing four members of the same family in the Swansea Valley village in 1999. \nSouth Wales Police said a link between him and a sock had been identified during an independent investigation. \nPolice agreed to a forensic review of evidence in January. \nThe force added this was the first time DNA evidence had linked Morris to the murder scene in Kelvin Road.\nThe BBC has learned the family of David Morris are questioning the findings and do not accept them.\nMorris was convicted in 2002 of killing Mandy Power, her daughters Katie and Emily and her mother Doris Dawson, who were bludgeoned to death at their home. \nHe was twice tried for murder and was serving a 32-year sentence when he died.\nLast October, doubts were cast about the conviction as potential new witnesses and expert views emerged. \nBut South Wales Police said a scientific link between Morris and a sock, which it added was widely accepted as being used by the murderer during the killings, had been identified. \nThe force added that while a link to Morris - or a male relative of his paternal lineage - had been found, it cannot determine how or when Morris's profile was transferred on to the sock.\nScientists found it was \"more likely\" Morris contributed to the DNA profile found on two different areas of the blood-stained sock, than if he did not contribute DNA to them.\nPermission was granted to take a blood sample from Morris after his death on 20 August to allow forensic examinations to take place.\nThe technology used in the process would not have been available to the original investigating team, the force said. \nThe link was identified using Y-STR profiling, a technique which specifically targets male DNA, even in a sample which contains a mixture of male and female cellular material. \nAssistant Chief Constable David Thorne, of South Wales Police, said: \"The decision to carry out an investigative assessment did not constitute a reopening or reinvestigation of the murders, nor did it demonstrate any lack of confidence in the conviction of Morris and the subsequent case reviews.\"\nHe added: \"This is significant as the sock was recovered from the murder scene and it was widely accepted that it was used by the killer.\n\"The outcome of the forensic assessment and completion of further actions have not established any information that undermines the conviction of Morris. \n\"In my view, as the independent senior investigating officer, the new findings from the samples taken from the sock support the existing evidence that originally convicted him.\"\nAssistant Chief Constable Thorne said it showed the force's \"commitment to providing evidence-based answers to the issues which have been raised about this case over many years\".\nHe added: \"This commitment has now resulted in a forensic link between the convicted killer David Morris and an item of great significance which was recovered from the murder scene\n\"South Wales Police commissioned the review in the hope that we could in some way provide closure for those most affected by the murders.\""

      "tags": "Aviation safety,Crowle,Nantes,Hotham,Emiliano Sala death",
      "text": "A man acted \"recklessly and dangerously\" when he organised a flight carrying Argentine footballer Emiliano Sala, a court has heard.\nDavid Henderson, 67, of Main Street, Hotham, East Riding of Yorkshire, enlisted a pilot who was neither qualified nor competent, said prosecutor Martin Goudie.\nSala and pilot David Ibbotson died in the crash in January 2019.\nMr Henderson denies endangering the safety of an aircraft.\nThe defendant had previously admitted a charge of attempting to discharge a passenger without valid permission or authorisation.\nMr Henderson was scheduled to pilot the flights which took Sala, 28, from Cardiff to Nantes and back again, but could not, as he was on holiday in Paris with his wife, Cardiff Crown Court heard.\nInstead, he asked Mr Ibbotson, who he knew, to pilot the flights, despite him not having a commercial licence, Mr Goudie said. \nThe court was told that Mr Ibbotson was not competent to fly in the poor weather Mr Henderson knew had been forecast. \nHe added Mr Henderson \"ignored certain requirements\" and that the organised flights were \"not operated and organised out of a love for Emiliano Sala or Cardiff City Football Club\", but for his business interests. \nThe second flight in the single-engine Piper Malibu came down in the English Channel on 21 January. \nIn the summer of 2018, more than six months before the crash, Mr Henderson was told by the aircraft's owners that Mr Ibbotson \"should not pilot the Piper-Malibu again\" after he committed two airspace infringements while flying it.\nMr Goudie told the jury the defendant \"was aware that there were issues with Mr Ibbotson's flying from the start\", even before the letters from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).\nFollowing the letters, Mr Ibbotson wrote to Mr Henderson suggesting he thought Mr Henderson would not be using him again.\nFay Keely, who represented the trust which owned the aircraft, was \"not aware Mr Ibbotson was the pilot\" on either of the flights between Nantes and Cardiff, the court heard.\nResponding to Mr Ibbotson, Mr Henderson replied: \"I am just responding to emails from Fay who has forwarded me two letters from CAA.\n\"I have always said the flying we do is challenging and everyone has to be on the ball. It is a steep learning curve for someone new to the operation.\n\"The prerequisite is a willingness to listen and learn. We both have an opportunity to make money out of the business model but not if we upset clients or draw the attention of the CAA... As self-employed sole traders we both have debtors and creditors and surely you understand that to remain legal we can't take money in advance.\"\nBut Mr Henderson, who managed the day-to-day operations of the aircraft, had contacted Mr Ibbotson again about flying the aircraft by 5 August.\nMr Goudie said: \"Right from the get-go, Mr Henderson was aware he was dealing with someone who had a private licence, not a commercial one.\"\nCommunications between Mr Henderson and Mr Ibbotson from August and October 2018, showed Mr Henderson talking about flying at night and flying outside his qualifications.\nThe court heard Mr Henderson tried to rearrange the time of the return flight to Cardiff, but this was to avoid incurring costs at Cardiff Airport and not because of Mr Ibbotson's lack of qualifications to fly at night.\nMr Goudie told the court the pilot did have an American qualification, which he received in 2014, but he was not allowed to be paid as a private pilot. \nHe added Mr Ibbotson never held a commercial pilot's licence in the UK and his rating to fly the type of aircraft expired on 20 November 2018.\nOn the night the plane went missing, Mr Goudie said Mr Henderson sent a text message to an aircraft engineer saying \"don't say a word\", and asked others to keep quiet because \"questions may be asked about his flying\".\nAnother text to a different recipient said: \"Ibbo has crashed the Malibu and killed himself and VIP pax! Bloody disaster. There will be an enquiry [sic].\"\nMr Goudie said: \"It's clear on the evidence that [Mr Henderson] knew Mr Ibbotson well, frequently discussed his qualifications with him and knew he was deficient.\"\nHe said Mr Henderson responded to written questions from the CAA in June 2020, and said he \"didn't know the precise status of Mr Ibbotson's licences and ratings\". Mr Goudie said this was a \"lie\". \nHe added Mr Henderson denied being the operator of the aircraft at the time, something he now accepts. \nThe trial continues. "

      "title": "Welsh independence to be considered by commission",
      "tags": "Welsh government",
      "text": "Welsh independence is one of the options to be considered by a commission examining Wales' future relationship with the rest of the UK.\nThe new body, set up by Welsh Labour ministers, will look at how the current system of powers resting in Cardiff and London could change.\nCo-chairwoman Prof Laura McAllister said \"everything\" was on the table.\nThe Conservatives accused ministers of wasting time and resources, but said they would take part.\nProf McAllister will lead the new Independent Constitutional Commission alongside ex-Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. \nThey do not believe Wales' current constitutional arrangements are sustainable, and plan to talk to people around the country.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said nothing is ruled out from the commission, and anyone with an opinion can make their case.\nWelsh Labour, which supports Wales remaining part of the UK, had promised to form the body in its Senedd election manifesto.\nPlaid Cymru said the commission would give the opportunity to hold the \"most wide-ranging national conversation about Wales' future\".\nCurrently many important areas of government policy such as health, education and local government are run from Cardiff, with such laws made in the Senedd Cymru - Welsh Parliament.\nEverything else, like the army and broadcasting, is governed by Westminster. It is a similar set up to Scotland and Northern Ireland, where even more is devolved.\nBut concerns over the future of the UK have led some, like First Minister Mark Drakeford, to call for a more radical restructuring of the UK.\nMr Drakeford has argued that the union of the United Kingdom would be more secure if more policies relating to Wales and elsewhere were decided locally, and if the UK's nations were part of a voluntary union.\nThat was echoed in Welsh Labour's manifesto, which expressed support for \"far-reaching federalism\" within the UK.\nBut Laura McAllister said the commission would look at a \"whole suite\" of potential solutions.\nThe announcement from the Welsh government said the commission will develop options for reform \"of the constitutional structures of the UK in which Wales remains an integral part\". \nHowever, Prof McAllister said the commission would look at independence.\n\"I think everything is supposed to be on the table, quite rightly. So it would be ludicrous to remove any options at this stage,\" she said.\n\"It's important to be clear about language.\n\"Independence means different things depending on different contexts.\"\nCardiff university academic Prof McAllister served on the Richard Commission on devolution, which reported in 2004, and an expert panel on reforming the Senedd.\nShe denied that constitutional reform was a distraction from practical issues like the pandemic recovery or climate change.\n\"We won't be taking any attention away from that because we're an independent commission,\" she argued.\nSwansea-born Dr Rowan Williams, who led the Church of England from 2002 until he retired in 2012, said the commission would be addressing \"urgent\" questions about how to \"make a democracy fit for purpose\".\n\"At the moment we have a four-nations model which is pretty imbalanced,\" Dr Williams said.\n\"Devolved government is something which has been, to some extent, tacked on to an extremely centralised system.\n\"It's time we thought through what the implications were for working better for the people of Wales and the people of the UK.\"\nHe said he wanted to see \"grassroots buy-in\" to the process from Welsh people.\nProf McAllister added: \"I don't think it's going to be an easy task but Rowan and I will put our backs into making sure we listen to every community and every individual who wants to give us their take on how Wales should be governed.\"\nThe group is expected to deliver an interim report by the end of 2022, with a full report by 2023.\nThe full membership of the commission will be announced next month.\nRhys ab Owen, Plaid Cymru constitution spokesman, said: \"A constitutional commission is an opportunity to hold the most wide-ranging national conversation about Wales' future in the history of devolution.\n\"Plaid Cymru looks forward to engaging constructively with the commission and its work, making use of every opportunity it presents to make the case for independence and that our nation's interests will be best served when decisions over Wales' future are placed in Wales' hands.\"\nBut his Welsh Conservative counterpart, Darren Millar, said: \"People in Wales overwhelmingly rejected independence at the recent Senedd elections; and why the Welsh government would want to waste its time and resources discussing the topic is beyond me.\"\nIn the Senedd, Mr Millar confirmed his party would take part in the work of the commission, but said there was a \"serious question\" over the appointment and independence of Prof Laura McAllister given she stood twice for Plaid Cymru in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nShe left the party shortly afterwards. Mr Millar said some would question whether Prof McAllister is \"entirely independent in the way that she's able to organise this particular commission's business\".\nProf McAllister declined to comment on Mr Millar's remarks.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed in the Senedd that the inquiry will be able to look at independence.\nAt question time in the Senedd, Mr Drakeford said anyone with an opinion would be able to come and \"make their case\".\n\"It would be absurd to rule out independence - but nothing else is ruled out either,\" he said.\nIf he gives evidence to the commission, he said he would argue for \"entrenched devolution within a successful United Kingdom\".\nA second referendum on Scottish independence within the next five years was \"very likely\", Mr Drakeford said. He added he agreed with people who said Northern Ireland's future had become more \"uncertain\" since Brexit.\nThe issue of Scottish independence and the new legal framework required in the wake of Brexit have brought to a head the question of how the different governments of the UK should relate to each other. \nThe push and pull of power struggles between those governments - all of different political hues - is the subtext to many of the policy and spending decisions we hear about on a daily basis. \nIf the gamut of possible recommendations runs from the status quo to full-blown Welsh independence, the likely outcome may well end up being something in the middle of that spectrum.\nBut for any meaningful constitutional change to result from this, the UK government would have to support it.\nRight now, there's no sign of that.

      "tags": "Climate change",
      "text": "Imagine your future home as an energy hub storing electricity from the grid when clean wind power is plentiful, and then selling it back - at a profit - when demand surges elsewhere.\nFor Sussex grandmother Kate Giammatteo, that future is happening right now.\nShe has batteries bolted to the front of her Worthing flat that do just that, and they are forecast to cut her energy bill by \u00a3173 a year.\nAnd what's good for Kate will be good for the country, because as the UK shifts to electric heating and electric cars to meet its climate goals, the demand for electricity is expected to double by 2050.\nAlready the sector is under pressure to ramp up renewables, because Prime Minister Boris Johnson has mandated that all electricity must come from zero-carbon sources by 2035.\nMuch of the extra energy will be generated by wind power, which is clean and cheap - but - of course - dependent on the wind.\nThat leaves an intermittent hole in supplies. This can be by increasing energy storage using batteries or other technologies - but experts say part of the gap can be filled by enabling consumers to use electricity more flexibly.\nThat's where Kate fits in. The tale of her giant battery offers a glimpse of an energy future in which appliances will use power when it's plentiful, and conserve it when it's scarce.\nSo, you could allow your freezer to turn off for a short time to save power, and your washing machine to switch itself on in the afternoon to use cheap power.\nKhalid Abdulla, an engineer from Edinburgh, has a hot water tank from a firm called Mixergy that's automatically switched on by his energy supplier's computer when power is cheapest (it can be overruled manually).\nThe tank's insulation ensures the water remains hot whenever Khalid's ready for a shower. In effect, he's storing energy in hot water.\nIt will save Khalid money. And the technology has brought a bonus - the new system has allowed him to dispense with his second water tank, and free up storage for the paraphernalia that accompanies a new baby.\nBut this energy revolution stretches beyond the home, because more and more businesses are being paid by electricity suppliers to use the grid differently.\nWhen supplies are plentiful, big refrigeration plants can utilise the power to chill their freezers even harder. Then when there's a surge in demand, they can power down as the freezer temperatures slip back to normal.\nThey are paid in effect for storing energy through cold. Some hotels do the same with their air conditioning. Some asphalt plants are super-heating the asphalt when power is cheap - then allowing the temperature to drop as demand peaks. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nBig prices are charged by firms volunteering to turn off their power for a spell when it's needed elsewhere. The steel giant Corus has offered to switch off its supply from time to time for \u00a345,000 per Megawatt. One estimate suggests the value of the flex-elecs market by 2030 will be \u00a32.4bn a year.\nOne firm involved in a UK government trial, Geo, claimed it showed a DSR system could save 49% on utility bills for homes with electrical heating and electric cars. There would be CO2 savings, too.\n\"They are pretty amazing figures, but they are achievable in the majority of homes as time goes on,\" its CEO, Steve Cunningham, told me.\nWhat's more, those savings were achieved using only major contributors such as home heating and hot water. Even more cash would have been saved, he said, if appliances such as freezers and washing machines were fitted with smart plugs so they could also be controlled individually from afar.\nHe said smart thermostats costing \u00a325 could save gas heating by learning how fast a house heats up and cools down, and adjusting boiler use accordingly. \"It's tragic that people who most need tech like this can't afford to access it,\" he said.\nSo how big a role can reducing demand play in smoothing the peaks of electricity use? Sara Walker, reader in energy at Newcastle University, says it needs a big push from policy-makers. \nShe told me: \"There's great potential but there appears little attention on the subject at government level. We really need a strong policy signal - and we're not getting it.\"\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

      "tags": "Conservative Party,David Amess,David Amess death,Leigh-on-Sea",
      "text": "Sir David Amess was one of Parliament's characters: fun, friendly, unconventional and outspoken.\nHis broad grin and boyish enthusiasm were fixtures in the House of Commons chamber for nearly 40 years. \nHe never scaled the heights of government, choosing to dedicate his career to his beloved Essex and the causes he cared about most. The 69-year-old was one of those rare MPs who earned cross-party respect for the conviction he brought to his opinions and campaigns. They ranged from passionate support of Brexit to animal rights - and anything that brought Essex up in the world. \nHe always took his work seriously, but himself rarely.\nHe was stabbed to death while in his constituency surgery in the seaside town of Leigh-on-Sea, an attack that has stunned his constituents and colleagues from across the political spectrum. \nSir David burst on to the political scene as the new MP for Basildon in 1983, the embodiment of what was known then as Essex Man, the archetypal aspirational voter who helped deliver a landslide victory for Margaret Thatcher that year. \nWith an East End accent and relatively humble origins, he gained a high profile on TV and radio, and triumphed against the odds in the 1992 general election when he unexpectedly held on to his seat.\n\"My colleagues and supporters, go out and rejoice and celebrate!\", he declared.\nFrom that moment on David Amess was cheered by his Conservative colleagues every time he rose to his feet in Parliament, where he would rarely pass up the chance to mention Basildon. \nHe held the seat until 1995 when he realised the seat would be lost to Labour after boundary changes and switched his loyalty and devotion to nearby Southend West. For years he campaigned for Southend to become a city, mentioning it virtually every week in Parliament - he retweeted a BBC Essex tweet along these lines just a day before his death.  \nSir David - who was married with five children - was also a devout Catholic. \nHe was socially conservative: he supported capital punishment and opposed abortion. He was an early Eurosceptic. He was also a strong supporter of animal rights, including a fox hunting ban, and he campaigned against fuel poverty, advocated tackling obesity and raised awareness of endometriosis, a painful gynaecological condition that some women suffer.\nAlthough for many years he was a parliamentary aide to the former cabinet minister, Michael Portillo, he never held ministerial office; he was too unorthodox for that. \nDeputy prime minister Dominic Raab paid tribute to \"a great common sense politician and a formidable campaigner with a big heart, and tremendous generosity of spirit - including towards those he disagreed with\".\nThe SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said he was \"a thoroughly decent man\".\nHis loss will be felt keenly in his Southend West constituency. Trembling with emotion Father Jeff Woolnough, parish priest of St Peter's Catholic church in Eastwood Road North, Leigh-On-Sea, told the BBC Sir David was a \"great, great man, a good Catholic and a friend to all\". \nBorn in Plaistow in 1952, he went to school in London and did many things before turning to politics.\nHe taught at a school in London before embarking on a career as a recruitment consultant. He did attract unwelcome publicity in 1997, when he was the victim of satirist Chris Morris on his Channel 4 show Brass Eye, when he was shown with other well-known figures condemning Cake, a made-up drug. Sir David said Channel 4 should feel \"shame\" for the programme, as it came soon after the case of his then-constituent 18 year old Leah Betts, who died after she took ecstasy.\nHe was one of those MPs who used Parliament to sponsor bills, to sit on committees, to form alliances, so that he could shape law from the backbenches.\nAs an animal welfare specialist, he led campaigns to ban cages for game birds and end the transport of live animals for export - and was a patron of the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation. Sir David was what they call an old school parliamentarian - the epitome of a constituency MP who died serving those he was so proud to represent. "

      "text": "Downing Street says it is \"keeping a very close eye\" on rising Covid cases - but the cabinet has not yet discussed rolling out its Plan B to control coronavirus in England this winter.\nDaily cases have been above 40,000 for seven days in a row, with 43,738 new Covid cases reported on Tuesday.\nAnother 223 deaths have been recorded, the highest since March, although daily figures are often bigger on Tuesdays.\nPM Boris Johnson has told the cabinet the UK faces \"a difficult winter\".\nUnder the government's winter plan, if the measures currently in place are not enough to prevent \"unsustainable pressure\" on the NHS, then steps like making face coverings mandatory in some settings and introducing vaccine passports could be considered as part of Plan B.\nThe prime minister told ministers the government had \"a plan in place to steer the country through this period\" and that people should \"continue to follow the guidance and get their jabs when called upon\".\nDowning Street said Mr Johnson had stressed that the government's autumn and winter plan \"continues to keep the virus under control\".\nNo 10 said the government was \"not complacent\" about rising cases but that, due to the vaccination programme, \"the levels we are seeing in both patients admitted to hospital and deaths are far lower than we saw in previous peaks\".\nThe seven-day average of new Covid cases in the UK has risen from around 34,000 a day at the beginning of October to 44,145 cases per day.\nAnd the number of people in hospital across the UK who have Covid has risen by 10% in a week, from 7,039 on 11 October to 7,749 on Monday.\nThe number of deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test reported on Tuesday was the highest since 9 March, although due to reporting lags over the weekend daily figures are often higher on a Tuesday.\n\"Clearly we're keeping a very close eye on rising case rates,\" the prime minister's spokesman said. \nHe said there were \"no plans\" to use the Plan B contingency measures but stressed that the most important message for the public was \"the vital importance of the booster programme and indeed for those children who are eligible to come forward and get our jab\". \nChildren aged 12 to 15 in England will be able to book their jabs at vaccination centres, as well as through school, after concerns about rollout delays.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs younger teenagers would be able to book their jabs outside of school to \"make the most of half-term\".\nEarlier Prof Neil Ferguson, who is a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was \"critical\" to accelerate the booster jab programme, as well as for younger teenagers to receive a vaccine.\nHe said there was no reason to \"panic right now\" but \"people need to be aware that we have currently higher levels of infection in the community than we've almost ever had during the pandemic\".\nOn Tuesday Northern Ireland announced its own autumn and winter plan, which will see face coverings remain a legal requirement in crowded indoor spaces. \nThe Welsh government has previously set out its plans for winter, with First Minister Mark Drakeford saying Christmas this year was likely to be more normal. \nScotland has set out a winter vaccination strategy and already has measures in place such as the requirement of proof of vaccination status at nightclubs and face masks in schools.\nMeanwhile, officials say they are monitoring a new descendant of the Delta variant of Covid, which is causing a growing number of infections.\nDowning Street said that there was \"no evidence to suggest it is more easily spread\"."

      "text": "The elder brother of the Manchester Arena suicide bomber has left the UK ahead of an appearance at a public inquiry he had been ordered to attend.\nIsmail Abedi, 28, has always refused to answer questions from the inquiry in case he incriminates himself.\nIts chairman, Sir John Saunders, had rejected Ismail Abedi's position and demanded he appear as a witness.\nThe BBC found him in Manchester, where he still lived, last year and asked him why he was refusing to participate.\nAbedi left the UK some weeks ago on a flight to the Middle East, the BBC understands.\nHe asked for immunity from prosecution before he would agree to give evidence, but Sir John refused his request. \nTwenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017.\nHis younger brother Hashem Abedi was jailed last year after being convicted of murdering all those who died.\nPaul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, said Ismail Abedi was \"not currently in the country and there is no indication as to when he will return\".\nMr Greaney suggested Sir John may want to use his powers to compel attendance and urged Ismail Abedi to comply.\n\"As he surely must understand, the public may infer he has something to hide and so, sir, may you\", Mr Greaney said.\nIsmail Abedi was arrested the morning after the bombing and interviewed extensively by counter-terrorism police for nearly a fortnight but was later released without charge.\nHe denied any involvement in or knowledge of the bombing and stated he had played no part in the radicalisation of his younger brother.\nWhile he initially answered police questions, he subsequently gave \"no comment\" answers during the majority of his 25 interviews.\nThe inquiry was also told he was stopped by police after arriving at Heathrow Airport in 2015 and his mobile phone had contained recruitment videos and literature produced by the Islamic State group.\nThe hearing heard authorities viewed his Facebook account, which included a picture of him holding a machine gun with the Islamic State group logo imprinted on the image. \nEvidence presented during Hashem Abedi's trial also related to his brother Ismail.\nHis name was used to buy car insurance for Salman and Hashem Abedi, neither of whom had a driving licence, for a car they bought to transport materials around Manchester during the preparations before the attack. \nA bank card in the name of the brothers' mother Samia - which received more than \u00a31,000 in benefits each month despite her being in Libya - was used by Salman and Hashem Abedi to buy relevant items during their attack preparations.\nThe card was found in Ismail's possessions when he was arrested following the bombing.\nThe inquiry previously heard the police investigation remains open and there would be further attempts to speak to him.\nThe Abedi brothers' father Ramadan and mother, both suspects over the attack, are in Libya. Neither has engaged with the inquiry.\nMeanwhile, the inquiry has also heard Ahmed Taghdi, another witness due to give evidence this week, was stopped from leaving the UK on Monday.\nCurrently in custody, he is expected to appear before the inquiry as a witness on Thursday.\nThe hearing was told he was able to provide evidence of a return ticket to the UK on 20 October. His original destination was not disclosed.\nLast week, the inquiry chairman went to the High Court in order to compel the 29-year-old to attend.\nMr Taghdi, a childhood friend of Salman Abedi, was arrested during the police investigation into the atrocity. \nThe inquiry has previously heard how he accompanied Salman Abedi on a visit to jailed terrorist Abdalraouf Abdallah, who experts believe \"groomed\" the bomber and helped buy a car that was used to store explosives.\nMr Taghdi, who was a prosecution witness in the trial of Hashem Abedi, has denied any involvement in or knowledge of the attack when questioned by police and was later released without charge.\nHe is now due to give evidence on Thursday, while Abdallah, currently in custody, is due to give evidence on Wednesday, both in person.\nThe inquiry has been told that both are key witnesses as the hearings turn to why and how Salman and Hashem Abedi became radicalised. \nMr Greaney said: \"This is without question one of the most difficult and troubling questions for the inquiry to grapple with.\n\"It is very difficult to comprehend why a person with any shred of decency could ever think of detonating a suicide bomb in the midst of a crowd, killing or maiming many innocent victims.\"\nOn Tuesday the inquiry heard evidence from radicalisation expert Dr Matthew Wilkinson, who detailed his general overview report of Islamist extremism.\nHe will return to give evidence later this year on matters relating to Salman Abedi.\nThe inquiry will also hear evidence about Salman Abedi's family, his friends and associates, his internet and social media use, his educational background and the mosques which he and other family members attended.\nThe inquiry continues. \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann",
      "text": "Twenty-four children in Northern Ireland with confirmed or suspected cancers had to wait over a year for a first appointment, a review has found.\nThe figure, for April, is in a review of waiting lists by the NI Commissioner for Children and Young People. \nMore than 17,000 children were waiting more than a year to see a hospital consultant for the first time.  \nThe health minster later said that by September there were no \"red flag\" paediatric patients waiting that long.\nThe review examined official waiting list data for children's health services not published as part of the Department of Health's statistical bulletins.\nThe commissioner said the waiting times were \"terrifying\".\nKoulla Yiasouma said that waiting for any health service treatment can and does have a \"profound impact on a child's health outcomes, emotional and mental well-being\".\nShe said it was \"shocking not only for the child but their families too\".\n\"Each and every single one of them is a child and each and every single one of them is a child whose life has almost been put on hold, and a family whose life has been put on hold, because they are not getting the most fundamental right of healthcare that they deserve,\" she said.\nDr Ray Nethercott, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said he was shocked by the cancer figures.\n\"It is outrageous and there are probably many other words that spring to the minds of parents who are worried and concerned and colleagues who are facing into this,\" he said.\n\"Some of the answer will be about embracing and delivering that reform, delivering innovation, delivering different ways of managing children as close to home as possible.\n\"To be able to do that, it's not all about the workforce, but it's actually about giving some due care and attention to child health services as a distinct entity.\n\"I can't say that there's any way to do it immediately - I've got lots of ideas as do many of my colleagues.\n\"But really children and children's voices and people that work with children have a very small voice in our health system.\"\nThe review, called More Than Just a Number, examined the number of children and young people on waiting lists, and the length of time they wait to access first or review appointments with consultants for treatment in hospitals and also for services based in the community. \nIt found that in April 2021, one in five children and young people in Northern Ireland were waiting for a first or review appointment with a consultant. \nIt also found 17,194 children and young people were waiting more than one year and 510 more than four years.\nThe conditions affected included scoliosis, speech and language therapy and autism.    \nMandy O'Connor has two daughters waiting for reviews. \nHer eldest daughter had an operation in Turkey for scoliosis in 2018 that cost them \u00a335,000 for the operation alone, otherwise she would have been waiting 18 months for surgery in Northern Ireland.\nShe has not been seen in Northern Ireland since that operation and the family is travelling to Turkey on Wednesday for a follow-up appointment. \nHer second daughter doesn't know if she has scoliosis which means time is of the essence to find out so they can tackle it early. \n\"From when Tasha [her eldest daughter] was diagnosed she was in extreme pain for the 16 weeks while we were fundraising,\" Mrs O'Connor said. \n\"To think what she would have been like for 18 months on that waiting list and even for the referral it was 16 weeks.\n\"It was marked urgent at the time - Tasha wasn't seen for a referral. The referral went in on July 2018, she wasn't seen until November 2018.\"\nShe said her second daughter had to wait 12 months for a first referral.\n\"That was in August 2019. She wasn't seen until August 2020 and as yet she hasn't been seen since.\"\nAs well as looking at hospital waits, it also raises other issues including the \"complete absence\" of regional monitoring or reporting of waiting times for child health services in the community. \nThe absence of such critical information according to the commissioner makes it impossible to get a clear understanding of the number of children who are waiting for these services. \nIt found that at least 26,818 children in Northern Ireland were waiting for a community-based health service but it is thought the figure is much higher. \nThe report makes 17 recommendations.\nThese include:\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said he was grateful to the commissioner for the \"detailed review\".\n\"My department and the wider HSC (Health and Social Care) system will carefully consider the report and recommendations from the commissioner as part of our ongoing work to transform and rebuild services,\" he said.\n\"Waiting times were clearly unacceptable prior to Covid-19 and have been exacerbated by the devastating impact of the pandemic across all aspects of service provision including, unfortunately, across children's services. \n\"Addressing these waiting lists is a top priority for me... it will require systemic change and long-term investment.\"\nMs Yiasouma said she welcomed the health minister's commitment to improve waiting lists and to address the \"underlying issues which drive them\".\n\"Waiting times are one of the clearest indicators of a system under immense strain and unable to meet the needs of its population,\" she added.\n\"We must strive to get to a point where all children and young people can get access to the right care, at the right time and the right place and no child ls left waiting months or years in a queue to access services.\"\nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the waiting times figures for children with cancer were \"utterly appalling\".\n\"I think we should see somebody very senior in the Department of Health appointed as a deputy chief medical officer to oversee children's health in Northern Ireland,\" he said. \n\"I think we need to invest more in children's health.\n\"I think children should have a degree of priority when it comes to such services.\""

      "tags": "European Commission,European Union,Poland",
      "text": "Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has accused the EU of blackmail in a heated debate with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen over the rule of law.\nThe clash in the European Parliament follows a top Polish court ruling that rejected key parts of EU law.\nMrs von der Leyen said she would act to prevent Poland undermining EU values.\nIn response, Mr Morawiecki rejected \"the language of threats\" and accused the EU of overstepping its powers.\nPoles overwhelmingly support being part of the EU, opinion polls suggest, but Poland's right-wing nationalist government has increasingly been at odds with the union on issues ranging from LGBT rights to judicial independence.\nThe latest row has come to a head over an unprecedented and controversial ruling by Poland's Constitutional Tribunal that in effect rejects the core principle that EU law has primacy over national legislation.\nThe case, brought by the Polish prime minister, was the first time that an EU member state's leader had questioned EU treaties in a national constitutional court.\nOn Tuesday, Mrs von der Leyen told the European Parliament that the European Commission - the EU's executive - was \"carefully assessing this judgement\".\nShe said the situation had to be resolved, but she was adamant: \"This ruling calls into question the foundations of the European Union. It is a direct challenge to the unity of the European legal order.\"\nVowing to take action, Mrs von der Leyen set out three ways the European Commission could respond to the Polish court judgement.\nThe options, she said, were legally challenging the court ruling, withholding EU funds and suspending some of Poland's rights as a member state.\nThe European Commission is yet to approve \u20ac57bn (\u00a348bn; $66bn) of Covid-19 recovery funds earmarked for Poland, and may not do so until the dispute is settled.\nIn a speech that ran over his allotted time, Mr Morawiecki said Poland was \"being attacked\" by EU leaders and it was \"unacceptable to talk about financial penalties\".\n\"Blackmail must not be a method of policy,\" said Mr Morawiecki of Poland's ruling conservative-nationalist Law and Justice party.\nSeeing this fiery debate in Strasbourg, you might wonder whether this so-called Polexit is a real prospect - given that it appears there are two very different legal, political and cultural perspectives set on a collision course.\nBut the resounding answer amongst those I've spoken to is no. \nOn the EU side, one diplomat recently told me they believed the EU couldn't survive another exit. \nSo there are huge political calculations to weigh up here, as well as legal ones. \nPresident von der Leyen is under mounting pressure to take action. It's a major test of her presidency. \nYou could see on Tuesday she wished to impress upon MEPs she was ready, if needed, to take a tough line. Yet last Friday, outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared to urge compromise over confrontation. \nThere is an argument to say that, if the EU opted for strong action, it could just serve to escalate the crisis and push Poland further away. \nBut, if it decides on a more conciliatory course, does the bloc look weak and undermine its entire legal basis? \nMr Morawiecki said the Polish court ruling on 7 October had been misunderstood and only questioned one area of EU treaties.\nHe said EU treaties must not threaten a member state's constitution, which outline laws and principles that specify how a country should be governed.\nThe Polish court ruling and the European Commission's response to it has divided opinion among the political leaders of EU member states.\nLuxembourg's Foreign Minister, Jean Asselborn, said the clash threatened the existence of the EU, while Germany's Minister for European affairs, Michael Roth, said the union must not compromise on its founding values.\nBut Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said linking issues about the rule of law to funding risked inflicting \"unimaginable harm to European Union unity\".\nMr Nauseda offered to mediate EU talks after a meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda.\nThe tribunal ruling has raised concerns that Poland - like the UK - could exit the EU in a so-called Polexit. But Mr Morawiecki has repeatedly insisted the country has no plans to leave the union.\n\"We should not be spreading lies about Polish Polexit,\" he told the European Parliament.\nUnlike the UK before its Brexit referendum in 2016, support for membership of the EU remains high in Poland. Mass protests have been held by Poles who back remaining a member.\nEarlier this month, more than 100,000 people gathered in the capital, Warsaw, to show their support for Poland's EU membership.\nAt one rally, Donald Tusk, former president of the European Council and now leader of the opposition party Civic Platform, called on people to \"defend a European Poland\"."

      "text": "Food and drink firms are seeing \"terrifying\" price rises, a sector trade body has said, warning of a knock-on effect for consumers.\nFood and Drink Federation boss Ian Wright told MPs inflation is between 14% and 18% for hospitality firms.\nThe price rises for food firms' ingredients will lead to consumer price rises, he said, and described the situation as concerning.\nThe UK's rate of inflation was 3.2% in August and is expected to rise further.\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey recently warned it \"will have to act\", suggesting that UK interest rates may soon rise from the historic low of 0.1%.\nMr Wright told MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee: \"Inflation is a bigger scourge than anything else because it discriminates against the poor.\"\nThe Office for National Statistics will publish the latest inflation figures for September on Wednesday. It is expected to rise further above the Bank of England's target of 2% for longer than previously thought.  \nMake UK, the manufacturers' organisation, said that inflation was becoming \"baked in\" among its members.\nStephen Phipson, chief executive at Make UK, told MPs that while there was a welcome rise in demand, many manufacturers are looking at 30% to 40% average increases in material costs.\n\"When people are able to get hold of materials they are passing those costs on which does imply to us that inflation is more or less baked in at this stage now,\" he said.\n\"This is not a transitory inflationary demand we are seeing really serious issues now in terms of price increases.\"\nDes Gunewardena, chief executive of high-end restaurant group D&D London, says his business has seen half of its costs rise, including surging energy prices. \nHe says staff shortages are his \"number one issue\" and has increased salaries by 10%.\nThe business has 1,700 employees across the UK and is currently 150 staff short, which he said could lead to a \"nightmare situation\" in the busier December period.\nTable covers have been reduced from 400 on a Friday night at his Quaglino's restaurant to between 300 and 350 due to staff shortages. \nHowever, he said the restaurants have seen increased customer spending, so he is stocking up on specific champagne brands ahead of time, to pre-empt possible supply problems. \n\"I think we'll have a very strong Christmas so there's no need to panic yet, but I expect further inflation in January when there won't be the same spending to offset the extra costs\". \nAmid concerns about deliveries of food, fuel and other items in the run-up to Christmas, the government is taking steps to address the shortage of HGV drivers.\nThe shortage has been blamed on several factors, including Covid, Brexit and tax changes.\nThe government introduced temporary visas for 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK, although only just over 20 of the 300 applications have been approved so far, according to Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden.\nDuncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association (RHA), told the select committee that the government's visa scheme to ease driver shortages had been \"designed to fail\". \n\"Reports haven't really eased at all things are not visibly getting better at this stage,\" he said. \nRegarding the government's measures to try to ease the crisis, Mr Buchanan said \"visually on the ground that is not having an effect\". \nA survey by the RHA of its members estimated there was now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK.\n\"The consumer is really going to visualise this in terms of reduced choice. We have supply chain disruption but that doesn't mean we are going to run out of food,\" Mr Buchanan added. "

      "text": "All remaining investigations into allegations of abuse by British soldiers in Iraq have now finished without any prosecutions being brought.\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said the Service Police Legacy Investigations - which was looking at the claims - had now \"officially closed its doors\".\nThe SPLI's job was to investigate Iraqi civilians' claims of serious criminal behaviour by UK armed forces.\nSince it began, it has assessed 1,291 allegations, Mr Wallace said.\nThe SPLI was made up of Royal Navy Police and Royal Air Force Police.\nIt took charge of investigations in February 2017, after the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT) - which had been looking at them - was shut down. \nThe investigations related to the alleged behaviour of UK armed forces in Iraq during the war from 2003 to 2009.\nIn a written statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mr Wallace said that although 178 allegations had been formally pursued through 55 separate investigations, no soldiers had been prosecuted as a result of the SPLI's work.\nAccording to the SPLI, in 2019 five people were referred to the military prosecutor, the Service Prosecuting Authority, but no charges were brought.\n\"The vast majority of the more than 140,000 members of our armed forces who served in Iraq did so honourably,\" said Mr Wallace in his statement. \"Many sadly suffered injuries or death, with devastating consequences for them and their families.\"\nHe said while some allegations against British troops were credible, others were not.\nThe credibility of allegations had been a \"significant challenge throughout the investigations\", he said.\n\"However not all allegations and claims were spurious, otherwise investigations would not have proceeded beyond initial examination and no claims for compensation would have been paid.\"\nThe Ministry of Defence's investigations into allegations of war crimes will have satisfied few. \nThe initial investigations, under IHAT, were criticised by MPs in 2017 who said it empowered law firms to bring cases on an \"industrial scale\". One of those lawyers, Phil Shiner, was later found guilty of misconduct. \nVeterans and those still serving were swept up in long, costly and often clumsy investigations, even when some had already been cleared of wrongdoing. \nNor did IHAT satisfy those who believed that there were genuine cases to answer. \nThe MoD wanted to show it was properly investigating allegations of war crimes. But it did not want those investigations to be conducted by anyone else. \nMost importantly, the MoD did not want this to end up in the International Criminal Court in the Hague. \nIn 2020 the ICC decided not to pursue a formal investigation into alleged war crimes by British troops in Iraq. But prosecutor Fatou Bensouda still said there was clear evidence that UK forces were responsible for numerous war crimes including illegal killings, torture and rape in Iraq. \nMr Wallace added: \"It is sadly clear, from all the investigations the UK conducted, that some shocking and shameful incidents did happen in Iraq. We recognise that there were four convictions of UK military personnel for offences in Iraq including offences of assault and inhuman treatment.\n\"The government's position is clear - we deplore and condemn all such incidents.\"\nIn 2005, three British soldiers who abused Iraqi civilians were jailed and dismissed from the Army in disgrace.\nTwo years later, a soldier was jailed for a year in connection with the death of Iraqi civilian Baha Mousa in September 2003.\nIn total, the Ministry of Defence has paid out more than \u00a320 million in compensation settlements for abuse claims from Iraqi nationals."

      "tags": "Film,Musical Theatre",
      "text": "Leslie Bricusse, the prolific British songwriter behind many of cinema's biggest hits such as Candyman and Goldfinger, has died at the age of 90.\nHis friend Dame Joan Collins described him as \"one of the giant songwriters of our time\".\nPetula Clark, who sang You and I from 1968's Goodbye Mr Chips, told BBC Radio 4 he was \"extraordinary\".\nBricusse's career spanned 60 years with other credits including Talk to the Animals from Doctor Dolittle.\nHe also wrote Candyman and Pure Imagination from the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\nStage impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber released a statement, calling Bricusse \"the most underestimated British songwriter of all time\".\nJohn Berlinsgame from Variety told the Today programme that Bricusse was \"not only an artist but a lyrical genius\".\nIn his six decade career, he was constantly writing and had a catalogue of more than 1,000 songs to his name.\nHe wrote the lyrics to Shirley Bassey's classic Goldfinger, one of the most memorable Bond theme tunes, with long-time collaborator Antony Newley.\nBricusse also wrote the lyrics to You Only Live Twice, sung by Nancy Sinatra.\nOther collaborations with Newley, Dame Joan's former husband, included Feeling Good, made famous by Nina Simone.\nBricusse's agent confirmed the songwriter's death \"with a breaking heart\", saying he died in his sleep on Tuesday morning. He had been married to actress Yvonne Romain for more than 60 years.\nDame Joan said: \"One of the giant songwriters of our time, writer of Candyman, Goldfinger amongst so many other hits, and my great friend Leslie Bricusse has sadly died today. \n\"He and his beautiful Evie have been in my life for over 50 years. I will miss him terribly, as will his many friends.\"\nFilm expert Berlinsgame told the Today programme: \"He would be clever, very witty but also heartfelt and emotional.\"\nVocalist and actress Clark also told Today: \"He was a dear friend who I've known for many years. He wrote all the time, never stopped. I will miss him\u2026 he was extraordinary, I'm just beside myself.\" \nStage star Elaine Paige said on Twitter: \"Shocked & saddened by the news that the brilliant & wonderful Leslie Bricusse has died.\n\"One of our great songwriters. My first ever professional role was in Roar of the Greasepaint musical [for which Bricusse wrote Feeling Good]. We've been friends for many years.\"\nBorn in Pinner, north west London, Bricusse and Newley's fruitful partnership saw them write 1961 musical Stop the World I Want to Get Off and the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, based on Roald Dahl's popular children's book. \nDavid Walliams paid tribute to Bricusse's songwriting saying on Twitter: \"The great Gene Wilder sings Leslie Bricusse's magical Pure Imagination from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. It is so beautiful it makes me weep.\"\nBricusse also wrote many other musicals including Scrooge and Hook, the latter with Hollywood composer John Williams.\nSometimes working under the pseudonym Beverley Thorn, he co-wrote skiffle singer Lonnie Donegan's 1960 hit My Old Man's a Dustman (Ballad of a Refuse Disposal Officer).\nBut it was Bricusse's contribution to musicals that defined his career. This included two Oscars for his work. Talk to the Animals won best original song in 1968, while Victor/Victoria - which he wrote with Henry Mancini - won best original song score or adaptation in 1983. \nHe won a Grammy in 1963, which he shared with Newley, for the song What Kind of Fool Am I? from Stop the World I Want to Get Off.\nAsked in 2015 how he felt about winning his Academy Awards, he said: \"The Oscars are brilliant. If the whole world was run by the Oscar committee it would be a much better place.\n\"I have nothing but admiration for them. I'm playing par - I'm 10 nominations and two wins. So if you reckon you win one in five, I'm on par,\" he said.\nAlso in 2015, he staged Pure Imagination - The Songs of Leslie Bricusse, a musical revue reflecting on his vast back catalogue.\nThe composer and lyricist was said to be adamant that his musical theatre scores should be sung traditionally, rather than jazzed up to suit a particular producer's whims.\nPresenter and former musical theatre star Philip Schofield said: \"I'm so sad to hear of the death of my friend, the brilliant Leslie Bricusse whose songs I loved singing in Dr Dolittle. My love to his family.\"\nBricusse described himself in his book Pure Imagination: A Sorta-biography as \"one of the luckiest people I know, second only perhaps to Ringo Starr\".\n\"It's not really an autobiography. It's about incidents rather than my entire life, and it's about other people as much as me. I just put down the things I remembered!\"\nBricusse stated at the outset of one of his early chapters that he would be dropping names \"like fragrant rose petals\".\nThe book was interspersed with anecdotes and quotes from some of his famous friends, including Dame Julie Andrews, Sir Elton John and Sir Michael Caine. \nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Officials are keeping a close watch on a new descendant of the Delta variant of Covid that is causing a growing number of infections. \nDelta is the UK's dominant variant, but latest official data suggests 6% of Covid cases that have been genetically sequenced are of a new type.\nAY.4.2, which some are calling \"Delta Plus\", contains mutations that might give the virus survival advantages. \nTests are under way to understand how much of a threat it may pose.  \nExperts say it is unlikely to take off in a big way or escape current vaccines. \nIt is not yet considered a variant of concern, or a variant under investigation - the categories assigned to variants and the level of risk associated with them.\nThere are thousands of different types - or variants - of Covid circulating across the world. Viruses mutate all the time, so it is not surprising to see new versions emerge.\nOriginal Delta was classified as a variant of concern in the UK in May 2021 after overtaking the Alpha variant to become the dominant type of Covid in circulation. \nBut in July 2021 experts identified AY.4.2. \nThis offshoot or sublineage of Delta has been increasing slowly since then. It includes some new mutations affecting the spike protein, which the virus uses to penetrate our cells. \nSo far, there is no indication that it is considerably more transmissible as a result of these changes, but it is something experts are studying. \nThe mutations - Y145H and A222V - have been found in various other coronavirus lineages since the beginning of the pandemic.\nScientists are constantly checking for new genetic changes that Covid is undergoing.\nSome emerging variants are worrying, but many are inconsequential. The difficult job is spotting, tracking and managing the ones that could matter.\nThe UK is a front-runner in carrying out these vital lab analyses, having completed more than a million tests so far. \nThe first step is to pick up new mutants worth watching, such as this new offshoot - AY.4.2.\nNext, if there is a strong suggestion that the genetic changes might make the virus more contagious, it is classified as a variant under investigation and more checks are done.\nIf it becomes clearer that it could be more transmissible and escape some of the built up immunity from past infections or vaccines, or potentially cause more serious disease, it is moved into the variant of concern category. That's the one Delta belongs to. \nAt this stage, experts don't think AY.4.2 is likely to take hold - so in time it could well burn out and drop off the watch list. \nProf Francois Balloux, director of University College London's Genetics Institute, said: \"It is potentially a marginally more infectious strain.\n\"It's nothing compared with what we saw with Alpha and Delta, which were something like 50 to 60 percent more transmissible. So we are talking about something quite subtle here and that is currently under investigation.\n\"It is likely to be up to 10 percent more transmissible. \n\"It's good that we are aware. It's excellent that we have the facilities and infrastructure in place to see anything that might be a bit suspicious.\n\"At this stage I would say wait and see, don't panic. It might be slightly, subtly more transmissible but it is not something absolutely disastrous like we saw previously.\"\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said: \"It's something we're keeping a very close eye on.\n\"As you would expect we're monitoring it closely and won't hesitate to take action if necessary.\" \nA few cases have also been identified in US. There had been some in Denmark but new infections with AY.4.2 have since gone down.\nThe UK is already offering booster doses of Covid vaccine to higher risk people ahead of winter to make sure they have the fullest protection against coronavirus. \nThere is no suggestion that a new update of the vaccine will be needed to protect against any of the existing variants of the pandemic virus.

      "tags": "UK economy,Food,Brexit,Haulage",
      "text": "Food and drink firms are seeing \"terrifying\" price rises, a sector trade body has said, warning of a knock-on effect for consumers.\nFood and Drink Federation boss Ian Wright told MPs inflation is between 14% and 18% for hospitality firms.\nThe price rises for food firms' ingredients will lead to consumer price rises, he said, and described the situation as concerning.\nThe UK's rate of inflation was 3.2% in August and is expected to rise further.\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey recently warned it \"will have to act\", suggesting that UK interest rates may soon rise from the historic low of 0.1%.\nMr Wright told MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee: \"Inflation is a bigger scourge than anything else because it discriminates against the poor.\"\nThe Office for National Statistics will publish the latest inflation figures for September on Wednesday. It is expected to rise further above the Bank of England's target of 2% for longer than previously thought.  \nMake UK, the manufacturers' organisation, said that inflation was becoming \"baked in\" among its members.\nStephen Phipson, chief executive at Make UK, told MPs that while there was a welcome rise in demand, many manufacturers are looking at 30% to 40% average increases in material costs.\n\"When people are able to get hold of materials they are passing those costs on which does imply to us that inflation is more or less baked in at this stage now,\" he said.\n\"This is not a transitory inflationary demand we are seeing really serious issues now in terms of price increases.\"\nDes Gunewardena, chief executive of high-end restaurant group D&D London, says his business has seen half of its costs rise, including surging energy prices. \nHe says staff shortages are his \"number one issue\" and has increased salaries by 10%.\nThe business has 1,700 employees across the UK and is currently 150 staff short, which he said could lead to a \"nightmare situation\" in the busier December period.\nTable covers have been reduced from 400 on a Friday night at his Quaglino's restaurant to between 300 and 350 due to staff shortages. \nHowever, he said the restaurants have seen increased customer spending, so he is stocking up on specific champagne brands ahead of time, to pre-empt possible supply problems. \n\"I think we'll have a very strong Christmas so there's no need to panic yet, but I expect further inflation in January when there won't be the same spending to offset the extra costs\". \nAmid concerns about deliveries of food, fuel and other items in the run-up to Christmas, the government is taking steps to address the shortage of HGV drivers.\nThe shortage has been blamed on several factors, including Covid, Brexit and tax changes.\nThe government introduced temporary visas for 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK, although only just over 20 of the 300 applications have been approved so far, according to Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden.\nDuncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association (RHA), told the select committee that the government's visa scheme to ease driver shortages had been \"designed to fail\". \n\"Reports haven't really eased at all things are not visibly getting better at this stage,\" he said. \nRegarding the government's measures to try to ease the crisis, Mr Buchanan said \"visually on the ground that is not having an effect\". \nA survey by the RHA of its members estimated there was now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK.\n\"The consumer is really going to visualise this in terms of reduced choice. We have supply chain disruption but that doesn't mean we are going to run out of food,\" Mr Buchanan added. "

      "text": "An ex-soldier has died while on trial over a fatal shooting during Northern Ireland's Troubles.\nDennis Hutchings, 80, denied attempting to murder and cause grievous bodily harm to John Pat Cunningham.\nMr Cunningham, 27, was shot in the back as he ran from an Army patrol near Benburb, County Tyrone, in 1974.\nMr Hutchings' trial was adjourned for three weeks due to illness and the court heard on Monday that he had tested positive for Covid-19.\nThe non-jury trial had been sitting at Belfast Crown Court for three days a week to allow Mr Hutchings, who had been suffering from kidney disease, to receive dialysis treatment.\nMr Hutchings, from Cawsand in Cornwall, was an ex-member of the Life Guards regiment.\nHe also suffered from heart failure and fluid on the lung. He died in the Mater Hospital in Belfast on Monday afternoon.\nHis death was confirmed by an Army veterans' group on behalf of his family.\nDennis Hutchings' supporters had made an issue of his age and ill-health during a long campaign against his prosecution.\nLegal attempts to have his case thrown out failed before it reached trial stage.\nHis death will very likely reopen arguments around legacy prosecutions.\nThe government is proposing to end all future investigations and court cases related to Troubles incidents prior to the  1998 Good Friday Agreement.\nPart of its reasoning is to protect veterans.\nThis development leaves just one other veteran facing trial, David Holden, who is accused of the manslaughter of Aidan McAnespie in 1988.\nAll other recent cases involving former soldiers have collapsed.\nUnionist politicians have criticised the decision to prosecute Mr Hutchings.\nDemocratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there were \"serious questions around those who made the decision that Dennis should stand trial once more\". \n\"Whilst understanding the desire of the Cunningham family for justice, we have consistently challenged those in legal authority who insisted that Dennis stand trial again. \n\"He was an 80-year-old veteran, in ill-health on dialysis and there was a lack of compelling new evidence.\n\"This is a sad indictment on those who want to rewrite history, but also demands serious questions of the Public Prosecution Service about how this trial was deemed to be in the public interest.\"\nUlster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said the decision by the Public Prosecution Service to proceed with a trial given Mr Hutchings' ill-health demanded an independent review. \n\"The questions must be asked, did this trial hasten Mr Hutchings' death and did it meet the evidential and public interest tests?\" he said.\n\"Regrettably that will be too late for the Hutchings family and will be of little comfort to them at this time.\"\n Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the \"needless dragging of an 80-year-old soldier through the courts has had a very sad end\".\n\"The strain on this man was cruel, with him requiring regular dialysis, while being brought to Belfast to face a trial of dubious provenance,\" he said.\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone Michelle Gildernew said she was aware of a grieving family following the death of Mr Hutchings, but the Cunningham family also continued to grieve.\n\"Let's remember that grief knows no bounds,\" she tweeted.\nMr Hutchings had previously lost a Supreme Court challenge to have a trial before a jury.\nIn July, the UK government confirmed plans to bring forward legislation to ban all prosecutions related to the Troubles.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the legacy proposals would allow Northern Ireland to \"draw a line under the Troubles\".\nThe plans, which are opposed by NI political parties and victims organisations, include an end to all legacy inquests and civil actions related to the conflict."

Why me and how?\"\nShe called for security to be bolstered at nightclubs with extra bag and pocket searches.\nMeanwhile Ellie Simpson said her sister, who does not want to be named, also believes she was injected with a mystery liquid during a night out in Nottingham.\nShe said the 19-year-old - who is a student from Derby - felt a \"pinch on the back of her arm\" as she left Stealth nightclub on 12 October.\nShe then blacked out and was taken to hospital.\nMs Simpson, 21, said: \"I don't think it's quite yet sunk in what's happened to her.\n\"It's really frightening because I don't know how you're meant to prevent it. \n\"Obviously you can put your hand over your drink but how do you stop somebody stabbing you with a needle?\"\nMs Simpson said her sister was still \"in shock\" and has not been out clubbing since.\n\"Normally she's the type of person that would stick up for herself, so I think if it could happen to her it could happen to somebody who is more vulnerable,\" she said.\nNottinghamshire Police said it had been made aware of similar incidents in the city over recent weeks.\nSupt Kathryn Craner said: \"We are currently investigating reports of individuals suspecting that their drinks have been spiked. \n\"Linked to this a small number of victims have said that they may have felt a scratching sensation as if someone may have spiked them physically.\"\n\"We do not believe that these are targeted incidents.\n\"They are distinctly different from anything we have seen previously as victims have disclosed a physical scratch type sensation before feeling very unwell.\n\"This is subtly different from feelings of intoxication through alcohol according to some victims.\"\nThe force said a 20-year-old man had been arrested \"on suspicion of possession of class A and class B and cause [to] administer poison or noxious thing with intent to injure, aggrieve and annoy\" following an incident in Lower Parliament Street on 16 October. \nThe man has now been released on bail.\nStealth nightclub confirmed it had received two reports within the past two weeks from customers who thought they may have been spiked by a needle.\nA spokesperson said: \"Both were seen by our on-site medic, and we are currently liaising with police to aid in their investigations.\"\nThe nightclub said reports of spiking were taken very seriously and staff would continue to carry out thorough searches and capture CCTV footage to aid police investigations.\nA spokesman for Rekom UK, which owns Pryzm, said: \"While these incidents are incredibly rare, we take all reports of this nature very seriously and will do all we can to make sure that they don't happen in our clubs. \n\"We urge anyone who sees suspicious behaviour, or suspects they have been a victim of spiking, to seek assistance immediately from a member of staff.\n\"We would also encourage them to contact police, so that any allegation can be properly investigated.\"\nMeanwhile concerned female students in the city have set up a group and are planning a nightclub boycott next week to put pressure on venues to do more to prevent spiking.\nA spokeswoman said: \"We want to raise awareness and implement some changes.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Greenhouse gas emissions,Climate change,Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy,Kwasi Kwarteng,Renewable energy",
      "text": "Experts have criticised plans to subsidise low-carbon heat pumps in place of gas boilers for homeowners in England and Wales from next April.\nHouseholds will be offered subsidies of \u00a35,000 from next April to help them make the switch.\nAlthough up to 25 million UK homes have gas boilers, the grants will fund just 90,000 pumps over three years.\nThe government says this will boost demand for the pumps, but critics say the plan does not go far enough.\nHomeowners will be encouraged to switch to a heat pump or other low-carbon technology when their current boiler needs replacing.\nAn air-source heat pump costs between \u00a36,000 and \u00a318,000, depending on the type installed and the size of a property.\nMinisters say the subsidies will make heat pumps a comparable price to a new gas boiler. However, the \u00a3450m being allocated for the subsidies over three years has been criticised as insufficient.\nExperts also point to the need for costly new insulation and other home improvements to help households get the best out of the switch.\n\"Gas is in the news for price increases that are on the horizon,\" said Dr David Glew, head of energy efficiency and policy at the Leeds Sustainability Institute at Leeds Beckett University.\n\"But gas is actually relatively cheap to heat your home with,\" he added.\n\"Needing to insulate your house might cost you tens of thousands of pounds and you're only going to be saving several hundreds of pounds, so the economics of that doesn't really add up.\"\nMike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said the number of heat pumps that the grants would cover \"just isn't very much\" and meant the UK would not meet its climate targets.\n\"These grants will only incentivise the best-off households,\" he said.\nGreenpeace UK's climate campaigner, Caroline Jones, said the government needed to provide more money to speed up the switch.\n\"A clearer signal would have been a phase-out of new boilers before 2035,\" she said.\nThe government says it wants no new gas boilers to be sold after 2035, but it has not banned them outright.\nWriting in the Sun, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"The Greenshirts of the Boiler Police are not going to kick in your door with their sandal-clad feet and seize, at carrot-point, your trusty old combi.\"\nDowning Street later declined to say whether the government would ban gas boilers in the future, after international trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said \"there will be a point\" when the voluntary approach would change. \nJonny Marshall, senior economist the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on poverty, said the UK would struggle to meet its goal of cutting emissions from homes in half by 2035.\nThe UK has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.\nBut a group of experts that advises the government says Boris Johnson's government has credible policies in place to deliver only about a fifth of this cut.\nHelen Selman lives with her husband and two children in Chippenham. When they moved into a 1930s semi, they knew they wanted to undertake home improvements, an upgrade to the heating system and an extension. \n\"It was not cheap,\" she said. \"But because we were doing everything else, and because this was going to be our forever home, it made sense.\" \nHelen chose an air-source heat pump but alongside it, they had a specifically designed insulation upgrade, new radiators and brand new underfloor heating. \n\"With a heat pump, the problem is that you have to make sure that your house is as well insulated as possible,\" she explained. \"We already had double or triple-glazing, we had insulated walls, we were upgrading the lofts.\"\nTo help with the project, Helen and her family used the old Renewable Heat Initiative funding: \"The RHI money will pay back quarterly over seven years and will go quite a long way to covering the costs.\"\nShe said: \"It's been definitely worth the bother.\" \nBut she admitted that without their own plans to extend and the added bonus of government cash, it might not have happened. \"Without an incentive, there are few people who have the cashflow or the passion to do this,\" she said. \nHeating buildings accounts for more than a fifth of the UK's overall greenhouse gas emissions, so there is pressure on the government's Heat and Buildings Strategy to deliver effective reductions.\nBusiness and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the grants to support the adoption of heat pumps, available from next April, would help to bring down the cost of the relatively new technology by 2030.\nHeat pumps extract warmth from the air, the ground or water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse.\nThey are powered by electricity, so if you have a low-carbon source of electricity, they provide greener heating.\nOne energy firm, Octopus Energy, said it expected homeowners to pay about \u00a32,500 to the cost of installing a heat pump, roughly equivalent to the cost of a new gas boiler. The government subsidy would cover the rest.\nBut many houses will require an upgrade to their energy efficiency, including insulation, before installing one.\nA box of about one metre by one metre needs to be outside (close to or attached to the property) to draw in air.\nIt should be at least one metre from your neighbour's property so they will not be able to hear it, although it shouldn't be much louder than your fridge.\nRead more: Should I get a heat pump and how much will it cost me?\nIn total, \u00a33.9bn funding is being provided, with most of that invested in decarbonising public buildings, insulating and installing new heating systems in social housing and for those on low incomes, and helping to provide clean heating networks for homes that are unsuitable for heat pumps.\nThe plan also includes:\nIndependent climate think tank E3G said that setting the phase-out date for new fossil fuel boilers was \"a world-leading achievement\" and the pledge to reduce heat pump costs by 2030 was to be welcomed. \nHowever, the funding was insufficient to achieve the government's goals on reducing emissions, programme leader Pedro Guertler said.\n\"On energy efficiency alone, the public investment announced today falls \u00a32bn short of what was pledged in the Conservative manifesto to 2025,\" he said.\nEd Miliband, the shadow business secretary, described the strategy as \"meagre, unambitious and wholly inadequate\", adding that Labour had pledged to spend \u00a36bn a year on insulation and low carbon heating.\nThe Liberal Democrats described the heating plan as \"a kick in the teeth for families across the country facing soaring energy bills this winter\".\nIt's another piece in the Boris Johnson climate-calming jigsaw. \nFirst, he slots in a world-leading policy halting the sale of petrol cars by 2030. \nNow he lays down another piece - no new gas boilers after 2035. It's another trend-setting initiative that other nations will surely follow.\nThere's a problem, though. Because by that date in the middle of the next decade, the PM has already pledged to cut emissions overall by 78% over 1990 levels.\nEnergy experts say that simply won't happen unless he provides much wider incentives for people to insulate their homes and to buy heat pumps to replace their gas boilers. \nOne group of researchers estimates that to meet his net zero targets he needs to invest nearly another \u00a310bn over three years. \nThey hope the chancellor will fill that piece of the jigsaw in his spending review next week.\nIndustry sources welcomed the new strategy.\nThe Confederation of British Industry said it would help members prepare for the changes ahead, but its chief policy director, Matthew Fell, called for \"a clear delivery plan for consumers, businesses and local authorities\".\nScottish Power's chief executive, Keith Anderson, said it would kick-start demand for electric heating, \"allowing the industry to accelerate the delivery of electrification and quickly bring down upfront costs\"."

      "tags": "Apple,Semiconductors",
      "text": "Apple has unveiled its M1Pro and M1Max chips used to power new MacBook Pro laptop computers.\nApple says the M1 Max chip, with 57 billion transistors is the most powerful it has ever built. \nThe new chips were announced almost a year after the firm revealed its first Mac computers powered by silicon of its own design.\nIt comes after reports that Apple cut its iPhone 13 production targets amid the global computer chip shortage.\nIndustry analyst Mikako Kitagawa of Gartner said \"the performance boost is pretty impressive\".\nApple claims the new chips will achieve comparable performance to the latest 8-core PC laptop chip running at top speed while using 70% of the power. \nGoing flat-out the chip, the company claimed, would be up to 1.7 times faster than the 8-core PC chip.\nSuch claims have not yet been independently verified.\nApple's chips are sometimes referred to as being 'Arm-based' because it licenses the instruction sets from the British-based company of that name.  \nThese instruction sets determine how processors handle commands. However, the core processor circuits are of Apple's own design. \nFor years Apple has used chips designed by Intel. The move to designing its own silicon has been positive for the firm, says Ben Wood, chief analyst of CCS Insight.\n\"The advent of Apple Silicon has been a shot in the arm for the MacBook line-up,\" he said.\nThe two chips power the new 14in and 16in MacBook Pro laptops and a new operating system, macOS Monterey.\nIn the \"Unleashed\" launch presentation Apple stressed the MacBook's power and long battery life.  \nThere has been a sense, one analyst said, that workers in creative industries are starting to drift away from the Macbook Pro.\nBut they would find the new machines appealing, according to Ms Kitagawa. \"Apple is really defending the creative professional market which is their core market,\" she said.\nThe MacBooks were unveiled at a time when the company has warned of the impact of the global chip shortage.\nPreviously Apple boss Tim Cook said that the issue could affect products using M1 chips. Recent reports suggest that the shortage might hit iPhone 13 production.\nApple designed-silicon will not, Ben Wood says, insulate the company from the shortage.\n\"The fact that Apple has designed its own chips does not necessarily mean it is immune from the wider chipset shortages,\" he said. \n\"There is little doubt it will be in a strong position to secure supply, but ultimately the overall shortage of semiconductors comes down to manufacturing capacity.\"\nMs Kitagawa also noted that as dedicated graphics chips (GPUs) are in short supply, the new MacBook Pros may be \"more immune to the shortage as the machine does not have discrete graphics: one less component that they need to worry about.\"\nThe new laptops reverse a much-criticised Apple design decision. \nIn particular the abandonment of Magsafe - a magnetically secured power-supply that releases with a firm pull.\nBen Wood said, \"many users will be ecstatic that the MagSafe power connector has returned. When you've invested a small fortune in a MacBook, the last thing you want is for a careless trip over a power cable to see it crashing off the desk onto the floor.\" "

      "text": "Foreign investment deals in low-carbon sectors in the UK to be announced on Tuesday will create about 30,000 jobs, the government has said. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce 18 new deals worth \u00a39.7bn as he opens a global investment summit.\nThey include investments in sectors such as wind and hydrogen energy, sustainable homes and carbon capture.\nThe prime minister said investors had recognised \"the massive potential in the UK for growth and innovation\".\nInvestments from companies such as Spanish energy firm Iberdrola, logistics firm Prologis and grocery service Getir would power the UK's economic recovery and help to achieve the government's levelling up agenda, he added.\nMr Johnson will open the Global Investment Summit in London on Tuesday, bringing together more than 200 business executives.\nThe government has assembled a formidable guest list of the great and good of global business for an investment summit it hopes will alert other international investors to opportunities in the UK. \nThe bosses of the world's biggest investment firm, Blackrock, the biggest bank in the US, JP Morgan, as well as the top brass from energy giants such as EDF will gather at the Science Museum in London. \nAnnouncements of nearly \u00a310bn in investment in the UK have been timed to coincide with the event.\nBy far the biggest single investment is from Spanish firm Iberdrola, which owns Scottish Power. Its announcement of a further \u00a36bn in offshore wind investment - on top of \u00a310bn over the last five years - will cement the UK's position as a world leader in offshore wind, just two weeks before the major climate summit in Glasgow.\nThe recent spike in gas prices has brutally exposed UK and EU reliance on fossil fuels, which may also encourage French firm EDF that their plans for a new nuclear plant at Sizewell in Suffolk will get government blessing. The chairman of EDF is due to have a breakfast meeting with the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng.\nThe government will hope this summit will help reverse a declining trend in foreign investment in new projects since 2015.  \nLater, Mr Johnson will take part in a panel discussion with Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates on the role of private companies in tackling climate change.\nIberdrola, which owns Scottish Power, will confirm that it will invest a further \u00a36bn in off-shore wind farms off the coast of Suffolk.\nThe wind turbines in its East Anglia \"hub\" are set to create about 7,000 jobs - although they have yet to secure planning permission.\nPrologis will commit to invest \u00a31.5bn in the UK over the next three years to develop net zero carbon warehouses across London, the South East and the Midlands, supporting about 14,000 new jobs. \n\"We believe private sector innovation has, and will continue to play, a major role in overcoming the environmental challenges the world faces today,\" said Prologis chief executive Hamid Moghadam.\nMeanwhile, Getir plans to put more money into expanding its activities across the UK. The firm uses a fleet of electric vehicles and is aiming to create about 7,000 permanent jobs in 2022.\nUltimate Battery Company will also invest \u00a328m in setting up a UK plant for eco-friendly batteries.\nOn Tuesday, the UK government is expected to announce its overall strategy for radically reducing the greenhouse gas emissions generated in across all sectors including industry, agriculture, transport and homes.\nThe government has pledged to reduce emissions sharply by 2035 and to reach net zero by 2050 - meaning the country will absorb as much carbon dioxide (through actions such as tree planting) as it emits.\nThe announcements come just two weeks before the start of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow - one of the largest world meetings to date on how to tackle global warming."

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,Carbon neutrality",
      "text": "Another big push towards electric vehicles is being made in the UK government's latest strategy to make the great shift to a virtually zero-carbon economy.\nMinisters are investing \u00a3620m in grants for electric vehicles and street charging points.\nCar makers will be mandated to sell a proportion of clean vehicles each year.\nAn extra \u00a3350m is promised to help the automotive supply chain move to electric.\nThe new plan set out by the government is supposed to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050.\nThe announcement comes 12 days before global leaders meet in Glasgow to negotiate how to curb climate change.\nAchieving\u00a0net zero means the\u00a0UK will\u00a0no longer be\u00a0adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nWithout action on climate change, the world faces a hotter planet, rising sea levels and extreme weather that threaten many forms of life.\nThe UK has already made progress in cutting emissions compared to the levels released in 1990. In 2019, the country released 40% less than in 1990. \nOn Tuesday the government also announced a strategy to address emissions from the UK's 30 million buildings.\nHomeowners will be able to apply for grants of up to \u00a35,000 to install low-carbon heat pumps to replace gas boilers.\nThe Labour party's Ed Miliband responded to the strategy, saying the \"plans falls short on delivery\" adding \"we've waited months for a heat and buildings strategy, it's a massive let-down\".\nProf Lord Nicholas Stern, Chair of LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said the plan will require \"strong investment and innovation\" and would generate a \"new and attractive form of growth\". But he warned that low-income households will need support.\nAnd Prof Dan Lunt, Professor of Climate Science at University of Bristol, called the strategy's approach to flying weak and unambitious. \nEnvironmental group Friends of the Earth criticised the strategy as \"riddled with holes and omissions\".\n\"The rapid electrification of new vehicles is certainly welcome, but many of the carbon savings this could bring will be wiped out by the government's \u00a327 billion road programme,\" it said.  \nIt also offers a further \u00a3120m to develop SMRs - small \"modular\" nuclear reactors that can be factory-built. These might go to the Wylfa site in Wales, although that's not certain.\nThese mini-reactors are being promoted heavily by Rolls Royce, although critics say the technology won't be mature in time to meet the UK's carbon targets.\nOn large nuclear: there's been much speculation about a go-ahead for Sizewell C in Suffolk. But funding has been a key sticking point and it seems an announcement has been put off until the Chancellor's spending review next week.\nThere will be an extra \u00a3625m for tree-planting and peat restoration, too - even though the current schedule is running way behind its targets.\nThe government is committing \u00a3140m to two clusters promoting carbon capture and storage to produce hydrogen. The hubs will be the North-West of England and North Wales, with Teesside and Humberside - the government has previously promised \u00a31bn to support CCS. \nHeavy industries in these areas will be fuelled by hydrogen split from natural gas. The resulting CO2 emissions will be pumped into undersea rocks for storage.\nThis will be controversial because environmentalists believe hydrogen should be obtained instead through electrolysis - using surplus wind energy. \nIt looks unlikely that there will be much hydrogen left over to heat people's homes, which is why the government is postponing any decision about hydrogen boilers until 2026.\nThe Treasury has hinted tax rises may be necessary to fund the government's net zero strategy.\nIn a review exploring the economic impact of decarbonising, the Treasury said: \"There will be demands on public spending, but the biggest impact comes from the erosion of tax revenues from fossil fuel-related activity.\"\nIt said future governments \"may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue\" rather than relying on higher borrowing.\nMinisters are keen to stress their intention that the so-called net zero transition will be led by business.\nThey say it will create 440,000 jobs and draw in up to 90bn of private investment by 2030.\nThe government says since the Prime Minister announced his 10-point plan for the climate a year ago, it has invested \u00a326bn of public funds into the low-carbon revolution.\nPart of that portfolio will be an extra \u00a3500m fund for low carbon innovation.\nEnvironmentalists will be scrutinising the numbers to see if various recent policy announcements will add up to the policy portfolio needed to present a plausible plan for decarbonising the economy by 2050.\nSo what's missing from the strategy? Well, there's no reference to eating less meat - which the government's advisers say is needed. And the aviation strategy - putting no constraint on flying - runs counter to advisers' opinions. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThere were 69,000 fewer jobs in the British music industry in 2020 than in 2019 - a drop of 35% - due to the \"devastating impact\" of coronavirus, according to trade body UK Music. Live music revenues collapsed by about 90%, leaving musicians and those working in venues or recording studios badly affected because many were ineligible for the furlough scheme, its report says.\nThe daily number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has risen in recent days to more than 40,000, meaning infections are approaching the levels of this time last year. While the vaccine means there are fewer cases of serious illness, soaring infections are still a cause for concern. Our Reality Check team explores why UK cases are so high.\nMore than 17,000 children in Northern Ireland were waiting more than a year to see a hospital consultant for the first time, as of April, according to a review by the Commissioner for Children and Young People. Koulla Yiasouma says the waiting times are \"terrifying\", having found 24 children with confirmed or suspected cancers had to wait more than 12 months. Health Minister Robin Swann says addressing the waiting lists is a priority.\nNHS Grampian has become the latest health board in Scotland to ask for military support, as it tries to cope with staff shortages amid the Covid pandemic. The request comes after confirmation the armed forces would be drafted into Lanarkshire and the Borders to relieve pressure ahead of winter.\nWhile many of us might think back and wonder how we passed the long days of lockdown, Paul Jode has an unusual business to show for it. He turned his hobby of hand-crafting traditional Viking drinking vessels from African cow horns into an enterprise. And they make quite a sight - and sound.

      "text": "The decision to prosecute a former soldier over a fatal shooting during Northern Ireland's Troubles was in the public interest, prosecutors have said.\nDennis Hutchings, 80, from Cawsand in Cornwall, died in Belfast on Monday.\nHe had denied attempting to murder and cause grievous bodily harm to John Pat Cunningham.\nThe Cunningham family said they \"wish to acknowledge that this is a\u00a0difficult time for his family and they\u00a0should be given time to grieve\".\nMr Cunningham, 27, was shot in the back as he ran from an Army patrol near Benburb, County Tyrone, in 1974.\n\"When the time is judged appropriate, the\u00a0family will respond in more detail to the issues surrounding the prosecution of\u00a0Dennis Hutchings,\" they said in a statement.\n\"We respectfully remind the public of the\u00a0facts that were pronounced at the trial, which were uncontested.\"\nSpeaking before the trial got under way, Mr Hutchings told the BBC he felt ex-soldiers were being used as \"cannon fodder\" by politicians.\nMr Hutchings was interviewed earlier in October, shortly before his death, by the BBC's Ireland correspondent Emma Vardy.\nHe said that former soldiers were being unfairly reinvestigated for their actions because records were kept by the military on soldiers' activities.\n\"Everything a soldier does from the minute a round is fired, it's logged, on the radio, it's logged in the control room. \n\"Talking abut the other side, the terrorist sides, there are no records.\"\nHe added: \"It was a bloody war between two sides, and we were stuck in the middle, it was my job when I was here to try and keep the peace, try and protect people.\" \nMr Hutchings' solicitor, Philip Barden, who had worked with him for 10 years, has called on the government to \"halt the historic prosecution of veterans\".\n\"I was with him on Monday shortly before he passed away,\" he added.\n\"I hope that the government will now enact a statute of limitation that will end the shameful pursuit of Army veterans in Northern Ireland. \n\"This should be known as Dennis' Law as it is the cause that he fought and died for.\"\nThe Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland, Michael Agnew, said the file submitted to the PPS by police \"included certain evidence not previously available\".\nYou can read his full statement here. \nThe non-jury trial had been sitting at Belfast Crown Court for three days a week to allow Mr Hutchings, who had been suffering from kidney disease, to receive dialysis treatment.\nIt was adjourned on Monday after the court heard he had tested positive for Covid-19. He died in the Mater Hospital in Belfast later that afternoon.\nUnionist politicians have criticised the decision to prosecute Mr Hutchings.\nDemocratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there were \"serious questions around those who made the decision that Dennis should stand trial once more\". \n\"Whilst understanding the desire of the Cunningham family for justice, we have consistently challenged those in legal authority who insisted that Dennis stand trial again. \n\"He was an 80-year-old veteran, in ill-health on dialysis and there was a lack of compelling new evidence.\"\nUlster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said the decision by the Public Prosecution Service to proceed with a trial given Mr Hutchings' ill-health demanded an independent review. \n\"The questions must be asked, did this trial hasten Mr Hutchings' death and did it meet the evidential and public interest tests?\" he said.\nThe deputy director of public prosecutions said the PPS commenced proceedings against Mr Hutchings in 2015 after \"a careful consideration of a wide range of issues, including the strength of evidence against him and the relevant public interest considerations\".\n\"The PPS decision to prosecute Mr Hutchings for attempted murder was taken after an impartial and independent application of the Test for Prosecution,\" Michael Agnew added.\n\"Whilst a review of a previous 'no prosecution' decision does not require the existence of new evidence, the police investigation in this case resulted in a file being submitted to the PPS which included certain evidence not previously available.\n\"In the course of the proceedings there were rulings by High Court judges that the evidence was sufficient to put Mr Hutchings on trial and also that the proceedings were not an abuse of process. \"\nDennis Hutchings' supporters had made an issue of his age and ill-health during a long campaign against his prosecution.\nLegal attempts to have his case thrown out failed before it reached trial stage.\nHis death will very likely reopen arguments around legacy prosecutions.\nThe government is proposing to end all future investigations and court cases related to Troubles incidents prior to the  1998 Good Friday Agreement.\nPart of its reasoning is to protect veterans.\nThis development leaves just one other veteran facing trial, David Holden, who is accused of the manslaughter of Aidan McAnespie in 1988.\nAll other recent cases involving former soldiers have collapsed.\nMr Agnew said the PPS recognised concerns \"in some quarters\" in relation to the decision to prosecute.\n\"However, where a charge is as serious as attempted murder, it will generally be in the public interest to prosecute.\"\nNorthern Ireland Veterans Commissioner Danny Kinahan said he was \"incredibly sad to learn of the passing\" of Mr Hutchings.\n\"It has to be recognised that we need a fair, balanced and proportionate system that has been promised,\" he said. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said \"sincere condolences go to the family, friends and loved ones of Dennis Hutchings\".\n\"The Ministry of Defence supported Mr Hutchings throughout his trial with legal representation and pastoral care, and that will continue to be offered to his family,\" he said.\n\"This tragic case highlights that the criminal justice approach broadly is no longer working and that is why we are committed to introducing new legislation to bring greater certainty for all communities, including the veterans and families of victims.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill said while she was conscious of Mr Hutchings' grieving family, she was also thinking of the family of John Pat Cunningham, who had been campaigning for 47 years.\n\"They shouldn't have had to wait this long,\" she said.\n\"My message today would be very straightforward to the British government - get on with implementing the Stormont House Agreement, find a way to allow families to have closure, to deal with the past in an adequate way.\n\"We agreed that many, many years ago in the Stormont House Agreement and the proposals they have put on the table at this moment in time are not acceptable to anyone.\"\nJohnny Mercer, Plymouth MP and former veterans minister, who travelled to Northern Ireland with Dennis Hutchings, said he was devastated by his death. \n\"He was polite, kind, generous and strong. He was determined to prove his innocence,\" Mr Mercer said. \n\"I have huge admiration and respect for his resilience, and that of his family and his partner, Kim. \n\"In a nation that is quick to forget the price of the freedoms we enjoy, it was a privilege to be close to him, and I remain fiercely proud of him.\"\nMeanwhile, relatives of Troubles victims were in London on Tuesday lobbying politicians in their campaign against the government's legacy proposals\nIn July, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis announced plans for a statute of limitations which would end all prosecutions related to the Troubles up to April 1998 and would apply to military veterans as well as ex-paramilitaries.\nThe proposals, which the prime minister said would allow Northern Ireland to \"draw a line under the Troubles\", would also end all legacy inquests and civil actions related to the conflict.\nAt Westminster on Tuesday afternoon, a cross-party group of MPs signed an open letter \"totally rejecting\" the UK government's proposals on how to deal with legacy issues. \nIt was signed by, among others, Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Louise Haigh, SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood and MP Joanna Cherry from the Scottish National Party. \nSpeaking outside Parliament, campaigner Raymond McCord, whose son Raymond Jr was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in 1997, called on the prime minister \"to take these proposals away\" and said they have to be scrapped\".\nHe said they had received \"total support from every political party at Westminster except the Tories\"."

      "text": "The government is to offer \u00a35,000 to people in England and Wales to replace their gas boilers with heat pumps.\nIt is part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the UK.\nHeat pumps are quite costly - between \u00a36,000 and \u00a318,000, depending on the type and the size of your home.\nThe \u00a35,000 subsidy - available from next April - will bring the price closer to that of installing a new gas boiler. \nCurrently, gas heating accounts for 21% of the UK's carbon emissions.\nNo new gas boilers will be sold after 2035.\nA heat pump is an electrically powered device that absorbs heat from the air, ground or water around a building.\nFor example, air-source pumps suck in outdoor air and pass it over tubes containing refrigerant fluids to produce heat.\nRight now, given the soaring price of gas, it's possible, but it's not clear whether heat pumps will be cheaper to run in the long run.\nThe government says it will look at measures to ensure heat pumps are no more expensive to run than a gas boiler.\nIt's easiest to put them in new builds, but older homes can also be fitted with heat pumps.\nMost domestic heat pumps will extract heat from the air.\nA box of about one metre by one metre needs to be outside (close to or attached to the property) to draw in air.\nIt should be at least one metre from your neighbour's property so they will not be able to hear it, although it shouldn't be much louder than your fridge.\nYou also need space inside for a heat pump unit and hot water cylinder. The unit will be about the size of a gas boiler - while the cylinder depends on the size of the home.\nA ground source heat pump needs much more space outside: either a bore hole as much as 100m deep; or a horizontal system dug into the ground over a large area.\nInstallation can be difficult and expensive - you may need bigger radiators or to dig into floors.\nAnd the high levels of insulation needed aren't always possible in older, solid-walled homes common across the UK.\nEngineers who are trained in installing and servicing heat pumps are - for the moment, anyway - harder to find. \nAnd it is unclear whether people renting their homes will have a way to insist on them being warmed by heat pumps.\nThe government has set itself a target of installing 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028. \nHowever, only \u00a3450m is being set aside for the new subsidies over three years. This will cover a maximum of 90,000 boilers.\nEnvironmental campaigners Greenpeace also say that gas boilers should be phased out much earlier than 2035.\nDistrict heating\nEnergy giant Vattenfall is planning a network of hot water pipes in south-east London that could benefit up to half a million homes, businesses, and public buildings. \nHeat will be produced from burning waste, which is controversial. In other places it may come from heat pumps sunk into rivers and the sea.\nHydrogen\nBig gas companies are keen on the use of hydrogen, because it could continue to flow through their pipes to many homes.\nThe government is pioneering trials of hydrogen heating, with a series of pilots before the end of the decade,  \nBut there are huge challenges to producing low carbon hydrogen and it's a technology in its infancy.  \nOther options being considered include:"

      "text": "More MPs have opened up about their own personal safety following the death of their colleague, Sir David Amess, who was stabbed multiple times during a meeting with his constituents in Essex on Friday.\nMany have spoken of a toxic and increasingly polarised political culture where online trolling has become widespread, ranging from personal insults at one end of the spectrum to direct threats of violence and even death at the other.\nLabour MP, Tulip Siddiq, told BBC Breakfast all MPs, especially women, are subject to attack and that her mother feared for her doing the job. \nSeveral too have spoken of concerns about the safety of their staff and their families amid calls for security measures to be stepped up, particularly while MPs are in their constituencies meeting voters.\nMs Siddiq said the threats and abuse she gets \"range from very trivial things\" such as commenting on her appearance, her height and her name to \"more sinister\" threats such as advocating violence against her or her family. \nShe said being an MP had had a \"constant effect\" on her family for years, especially her parents. \nShe recalled the murder of the former Labour MP, Jo Cox, in 2016 and said her own mother called her immediately on hearing an MP had been attacked \"because her first thought was it must have been me\".\nShe added: \"It is just this constant effect on her of hearing there has been abuse directed at us, that we're getting death threats, that all of us MPs are constantly racially abused, whether you're from a Jewish faith or have a Muslim last name.\n\"Whatever it is, people will pick on you.\n\"These keyboard warriors, at some point you do think I just need to ignore them and get on with my job.\n\"You do start to develop very thick skin but maybe that's the wrong way to go about it.\"\nSir David's neighbouring MP in Southend, Conservative James Duddridge, told Radio 4's Today programme about the fears his family and friends live with.\n\"No-one that loves me, none of my friends would want me to be a Member of Parliament.\n\"The only reason they support it is because they know that that's what I believe is an honourable thing to do, a worthwhile thing to do, something I'd always wanted to do, something that I have enjoyed. \"\nLabour MP, Chris Bryant said he received a death threat this weekend after calling for people to be kinder following Sir David's death. \nHe said Parliament has been \"turned into a bit of a fortress\" in recent years, but he believed MPs are most vulnerable in their constituencies when they hold surgeries and meeting voters. \nHe said one of the best things about the British political system is that MPs are \"very accessible\" but \"over the last few years, there has been a terrible ratcheting up of nastiness\". \nMr Bryant said he questions \"all the time\" why he does the job but his concerns are \"not just about me\".\n\"It's about my staff and it's about my family as well.\"\nHe said he went in to politics because he cares about poverty, climate change, human rights and the growing use of food banks.\n\"I'm passionate about wanting to change the world and no-one is going to stop me,\" he added. \nJustice Secretary Dominic Raab said: \"Although it is shocking and it is heart-wrenching, this is not entirely out of the blue\" because \"everyone has had this experience of intensifying abuse and that tipping in to threats\". \nHe said he has had \"three threats to life or limb that have required an intervention in the last two years\". \nMr Raab said that while every step must be taken to make sure MPs, especially female politicians, can do their jobs, \"we don't want the terrorists to win, we do not want this wedge placed between us and our communities\".\nAnd he said he will continue to have face-to-face surgeries rather than moving all his meetings online. \nDowning Street has said that it will be \"down to individual MPs and the police\" whether MPs should continue to meet constituents face to face. \nThe prime minister's official spokesman said MPs may \"rightly\" be concerned about their security following the killing of Sir David. \nThe spokesman said MPs \"have been contacted by the police to discuss their activities and events so their arrangements can be reviewed.\" \nLabour's Jess Phillips said while security advice is welcome, she individually has to \"make the decision about how close I am to my constituents\".\n\"Often the best security advice in the world is quite hard to follow when you're in your home town, not just because I want to be a good representative but because I live there\", she said.\nShe added that MPs need to \"demystify what politics is\" because \"people don't consider people like me to be frontline workers but that's exactly what we are\". \nShadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told BBC Breakfast he too had received death threats due to his job.\n\"I've had incidents since I've become a Member of Parliament, whether it's intimidation while out on the streets, death threats, terrible letters, awful emails. \n\"I am in no sense alone in that.\n\"I don't know a Member of Parliament who has not suffered in that way. \n\"It's clear that something now has to change.\" \nDeputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing told Radio 4's Today it was a \"pity\" the media does not say nice things about MPs when they are still doing their jobs.\nShe said: \"It can be deeply upsetting when you know that MPs and ministers are working hard to solve some problem or other and when the matter is discussed in the media, MPs are vilified, ministers are spoken to very harshly and it does help to create a culture of aggression. \n\"Why can't we just try to have a culture of kindness?\" she added."

      "text": "World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.\nLeft unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. \nWe face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.\nClimate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.\nThe rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. \nWhen these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.\nThe world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.\nTemperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100. \nHowever, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.\nIf nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species. \nExtreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. \nWith further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nPeople in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.\nOur oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.\nWildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather. \nAnd as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.\nIn a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.\nScientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken. \nClimate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. \nIf temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:\nCountries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. \nThe UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP26, in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030. \nMany countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.\nExperts agree that this is achievable, but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes.\nMajor changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "text": "Police investigations into allegations of child abuse against a former MP were marred by \"a series of failings\", a report has found.\nThe Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) said Leicestershire Police officers \"shut down\" investigations into Lord Janner \"without pursuing all inquiries\".\nIt also criticised Leicestershire County Council's \"sorry record of failures\" over abuse.\nThe former MP died in December 2015.\nProfessor Alexis Jay, chairman of the inquiry, said police and prosecutors \"appeared reluctant to fully investigate\" claims against Lord Janner despite \"numerous serious allegations\".\n\"On multiple occasions police put too little emphasis on looking for supporting evidence and shut down investigations without pursuing all outstanding inquiries,\" she said.\n\"This inquiry has brought up themes we are now extremely familiar with, such as deference to powerful individuals, the barriers to reporting faced by children and the need for institutions to have clear policies and procedures setting out how to respond to allegations of child sexual abuse.\"\nLord Janner's family has always maintained his innocence.\nHis son Daniel said the inquiry \"fails to challenge our late father's innocence\" and \"offers no proof whatsoever of guilt\".\nThe inquiry heard accounts from 33 complainants, with allegations of abuse stretching across three decades.\nIn 1999, Leicestershire Police's Operation Magnolia looked into allegations made against the politician, but the inquiry found it \"seemingly involved a deliberate decision by [the force] to withhold key statements\" from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which it described as \"serious and inexcusable\".\nOperation Dauntless was set up in May 2006 following further claims from another alleged victim, with the report criticising police and CPS decisions not to carry on the investigation as \"unsound and strategically flawed\".\nIn 2012 a further police probe, named Operation Enamel, was set up to look at evidence that may not have been considered in earlier investigations.\nAfter further evidence and more complainants came forward, Lord Janner was charged with 22 offences, including indecent assault and buggery, which dated from the 1960s to the 1980s.\nAt the time of his death, Lord Janner was due to face a trial over claims made by nine complainants, with the prosecution seeking to add further charges.\nIn October 2020, the inquiry heard evidence from Lord Janner's alleged victims.\nNone of the complainants were called to give evidence in person, due to it focusing solely on the state responses to their allegations, rather than the authenticity of the claims.\nChristopher Jacobs, who represented some of the complainants, described the case of Tracey Taylor - who has waived her right to anonymity - who was put into care as a 14-year-old in the 1970s.\n\"She said she was raped by a man who said his name was Greville Janner, he said he was an MP and that he could make her the next prime minister's wife,\" Mr Jacobs told the inquiry.\n\"She has told the police about the abuse, but she has never been believed due to her mental health problems. On some occasions, police mocked her statements, calling her Crazy Tracey.\" \nTim Betteridge, another complainant to waive his anonymity, said he was sexually abused by Lord Janner on two occasions, including once in an allotment and once in a mobile unit.\nThe inquiry heard Mr Betteridge raised the alarm but was told by care home staff \"nobody would believe him because he was just a brat in care\".\nBy Tom Symonds, BBC Home Affairs Correspondent\nThis report did not find evidence of a conspiracy to protect a local MP, but its officials believe what they discovered was actually more serious. \nAdults who had grown up in children's homes weren't taken seriously when they came forward to make allegations, because of their backgrounds. \nThe claims of one accuser were rejected because he may have had a history of mental illness. However, later police inquiries looked at his medical records and concluded that wasn't the case. \nThis investigation isn't the only one where the inquiry has seen evidence that alleged crimes against children have been dismissed prematurely. \nIts final report will have to come up with recommendations to prevent it happening again. \nThe inquiry also heard \"a number\" of staff at Leicestershire County Council had concerns over Lord Janner's association with a child in care.\nThe report stated \"undue deference\" was shown to the politician, who had \"unrestricted access\" to the child, with \"little if any thought given to any child protection issues\".\nNo inquiries were made into staff concerns, and the council has accepted it \"failed to take adequate steps in response\" to them.\nThe inquiry also examined the Labour Party's response to the allegations, saying it was not enough for it to leave it to the police and CPS due to Lord Janner's \"privileged and powerful position\".\nDavid Evans, the current general secretary, told the inquiry new systems were now in place should any allegations be made against a sitting MP.\nThe inquiry also said Lord Janner should have been subject to scrutiny when he was nominated for a peerage by then-prime minister Tony Blair, weeks after sweeping to power in 1997.\nMr Blair previously told the inquiry he was aware of the allegations but they were not a \"bar\" as Lord Janner had denied them, and there had not been any charges.\nLeicestershire Police said the force would study the report \"scrupulously and examine it for any actions or improvements\".\nChief Constable Simon Cole said: \"I would like to reiterate the wholehearted apology I gave in February 2020 to any complainant whose allegations during earlier police investigations into Lord Janner were not responded to as they should have been.\n\"It is fair and correct to say that the allegations could and should have been investigated more thoroughly, and Lord Janner could and should have faced prosecution earlier than 2015.\"\nLeicestershire County Council leader Nick Rushton said the authority accepted the report's findings.\n\"The council at the time simply did not do enough to keep the children in its care safe and for that, I am sorry,\" Mr Rushton said.\nA spokesperson for the CPS added: \"The CPS has acknowledged past failings in the way allegations made against Lord Janner were handled. It remains a matter of sincere regret that opportunities were missed to put these allegations before a jury.\"\nRichard Scorer, a lawyer at Slater and Gordon - which represented 14 complainants at the inquiry - said: \"Had investigations been conducted properly, it is clear that Lord Janner could have been prosecuted in his lifetime.\n\"Sadly the clock cannot be rolled back and the criminal trial of Lord Janner which could and should have taken place will never be possible.\"\nIf you or someone you know has been affected by this story please visit the BBC Action Line."

      "text": "America's climate envoy John Kerry says the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow is the \"last best hope for the world to get its act together\".\nMr Kerry told the BBC that key countries were pursuing policies that border on being \"very dangerous\".\nHe said that if greenhouse gas emissions were not reduced enough over the next nine years there was no chance of meeting long-term targets.\nThe aim is to hold the rise in the earth's temperature to 1.5C.\nScientists have said that would require global carbon emissions to fall by 45% from 2010 levels by the end of this decade.\nBut apart from a brief period during Covid-19 lockdowns, emissions are still rising.\nChina, the world's biggest emitter, will be key to any hopes of a strong outcome at COP26, when it is held in Glasgow from 31 October to 12 November.\nLeaders and delegates from around the world will attend the summit, including Mr Kerry and US President Joe Biden.\nMr Kerry has previously said the US will push for rapid action after four years of \"reckless behaviour\" under previous President Donald Trump.\nHe said the US would now move forward with \"humility and ambition\" in the global negotiations.\nA former presidential candidate, Mr Kerry has long been a powerful voice in climate politics. As President Obama's Secretary of State he played a key role in securing the Paris agreement in 2015.\nThe US Special Envoy on Climate Change told BBC Radio 4 documentary Glasgow: Our last best hope? that there were a lot of big promises without the necessary action.\n\"The truth is emissions are going up around the world, not down in enough countries, and key countries are pursuing policies that border on being very dangerous for everybody.\"\nMr Kerry has previously called on China to increase the speed and depth of its efforts to cut carbon.\nChina has promised to peak emissions by 2030 - but the US diplomat said that was not good enough.\n\"If you don't reduce enough between 2020 and 2030 the scientists tell us we can't get where we need to go. We will not be able to hold the earth's temperature rise to 1.5 degrees and we won't be able to achieve net zero by 2050.\"\nMr Kerry said he wanted Glasgow to raise the ambition of the 20 major economies in the world. \nHe said he would be looking for definite road-maps to net zero and money to help less developed countries also reach their goals without suffering economic hardship.\nMr Kerry called this the \"greatest test of global citizenship\" he could think of.\n\"Glasgow is coming at a point where these scientists have told us we have about nine years remaining within which to make the most critical decisions. Those decisions have got to really start in earnest and in a significant sum in Glasgow.\" \n\"We have to get on the road here and we've been talking about it for 30 years. \n\"So this is really what Glasgow is about, the last best hope to do what the scientists tell us we must which is to avoid the worst consequences of climate by making decisions now and implementing them now.\" \nCOP26 President Alok Sharma has also said world leaders must act now to limit global warming.  \nMr Sharma told the BBC's No Hot Air podcast the aim was to get countries to \"stick with the goals\" agreed at the Paris summit in 2015.\nHe said: \"World leaders came together and said that they would act to limit global temperature rises to well below 2C, aiming for 1.5C and that's what we want to try and achieve.  \n\"I think Glasgow has to be the moment that the world acts. We've got some commitments but we need to go further.\"  \nMr Sharma added: \"We need to make sure that we can say with credibility that we've kept 1.5C in reach.  \n\"Now is the time for all of us to act, but particularly for the biggest emitters - the G20 nations and the developed countries who promised finance to support developing countries - they also need to step up.\""

      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann",
      "text": "Twenty-four children in Northern Ireland with confirmed or suspected cancers had to wait over a year for a first appointment, a review has found.\nThe figure, for April, is in a review of waiting lists by the NI Commissioner for Children and Young People. \nMore than 17,000 children were waiting more than a year to see a hospital consultant for the first time.  \nThe health minster later said that by September there were no \"red flag\" paediatric patients waiting that long.\nThe review examined official waiting list data for children's health services not published as part of the Department of Health's statistical bulletins.\nThe commissioner said the waiting times were \"terrifying\".\nKoulla Yiasouma said that waiting for any health service treatment can and does have a \"profound impact on a child's health outcomes, emotional and mental well-being\".\nShe said it was \"shocking not only for the child but their families too\".\n\"Each and every single one of them is a child and each and every single one of them is a child whose life has almost been put on hold, and a family whose life has been put on hold, because they are not getting the most fundamental right of healthcare that they deserve,\" she said.\nDr Ray Nethercott, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said he was shocked by the cancer figures.\n\"It is outrageous and there are probably many other words that spring to the minds of parents who are worried and concerned and colleagues who are facing into this,\" he said.\n\"Some of the answer will be about embracing and delivering that reform, delivering innovation, delivering different ways of managing children as close to home as possible.\n\"To be able to do that, it's not all about the workforce, but it's actually about giving some due care and attention to child health services as a distinct entity.\n\"I can't say that there's any way to do it immediately - I've got lots of ideas as do many of my colleagues.\n\"But really children and children's voices and people that work with children have a very small voice in our health system.\"\nThe review, called More Than Just a Number, examined the number of children and young people on waiting lists, and the length of time they wait to access first or review appointments with consultants for treatment in hospitals and also for services based in the community. \nIt found that in April 2021, one in five children and young people in Northern Ireland were waiting for a first or review appointment with a consultant. \nIt also found 17,194 children and young people were waiting more than one year and 510 more than four years.\nThe conditions affected included scoliosis, speech and language therapy and autism.    \nMandy O'Connor has two daughters waiting for reviews. \nHer eldest daughter had an operation in Turkey for scoliosis in 2018 that cost them \u00a335,000 for the operation alone, otherwise she would have been waiting 18 months for surgery in Northern Ireland.\nShe has not been seen in Northern Ireland since that operation and the family is travelling to Turkey on Wednesday for a follow-up appointment. \nHer second daughter doesn't know if she has scoliosis which means time is of the essence to find out so they can tackle it early. \n\"From when Tasha [her eldest daughter] was diagnosed she was in extreme pain for the 16 weeks while we were fundraising,\" Mrs O'Connor said. \n\"To think what she would have been like for 18 months on that waiting list and even for the referral it was 16 weeks.\n\"It was marked urgent at the time - Tasha wasn't seen for a referral. The referral went in on July 2018, she wasn't seen until November 2018.\"\nShe said her second daughter had to wait 12 months for a first referral.\n\"That was in August 2019. She wasn't seen until August 2020 and as yet she hasn't been seen since.\"\nAs well as looking at hospital waits, it also raises other issues including the \"complete absence\" of regional monitoring or reporting of waiting times for child health services in the community. \nThe absence of such critical information according to the commissioner makes it impossible to get a clear understanding of the number of children who are waiting for these services. \nIt found that at least 26,818 children in Northern Ireland were waiting for a community-based health service but it is thought the figure is much higher. \nThe report makes 17 recommendations.\nThese include:\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said he was grateful to the commissioner for the \"detailed review\".\n\"My department and the wider HSC (Health and Social Care) system will carefully consider the report and recommendations from the commissioner as part of our ongoing work to transform and rebuild services,\" he said.\n\"Waiting times were clearly unacceptable prior to Covid-19 and have been exacerbated by the devastating impact of the pandemic across all aspects of service provision including, unfortunately, across children's services. \n\"Addressing these waiting lists is a top priority for me... it will require systemic change and long-term investment.\"\nMs Yiasouma said she welcomed the health minister's commitment to improve waiting lists and to address the \"underlying issues which drive them\".\n\"Waiting times are one of the clearest indicators of a system under immense strain and unable to meet the needs of its population,\" she added.\n\"We must strive to get to a point where all children and young people can get access to the right care, at the right time and the right place and no child ls left waiting months or years in a queue to access services.\"\nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the waiting times figures for children with cancer were \"utterly appalling\".\n\"I think we should see somebody very senior in the Department of Health appointed as a deputy chief medical officer to oversee children's health in Northern Ireland,\" he said. \n\"I think we need to invest more in children's health.\n\"I think children should have a degree of priority when it comes to such services.\""

      "text": "Tesco has opened its first checkout-free store in central London where people can shop without having to scan a product. \nThe UK's biggest retailer said its branch in High Holborn has been converted to allow customers to shop and pay without using a checkout. \nThe new format, known as GetGo, follows similar stores opened by Amazon.\nCustomers with the Tesco.com app will be able to pick up the groceries they need and walk straight out again.\nTesco said \"a combination of cameras and weight sensors\" would establish what customers had picked up and charge them for products directly through the app when they left the shop. \nThe technology is provided by Israeli tech start-up Trigo, which has similar partnerships with supermarkets in Germany and the Netherlands.\nPreviously, some of Tesco's staff have been able to use the system in the store at its headquarters in Welwyn Garden City, but this is the first time it has been available to regular customers.\nKevin Tindall, managing director of Tesco Convenience, said: \"Our latest innovation offers a seamless checkout for customers on the go, helping them to save a bit more time. \n\"This is currently just a one-store trial, but we're looking forward to seeing how our customers respond.\"\nHowever, Tesco is not the only supermarket experimenting with till-free tech in the UK.\nRichard Lim, chief executive of retail analyst group Retail Economics, said Tesco's move was \"reflective of the way the wider industry is heading\".\nAmazon Fresh now has six \"just walk out\" stores in London, having initially rolled out the technology in 2018 in the US city of Seattle, for example.\n\"One critical element of this for Tesco is also about gaining data and trying to elevate their proposition as much as they can for their customers,\" Mr Lim added.\nThe firm's Clubcard programme already has 6.6 million users on its app, so the retailer is \"well ahead of the curve\" when it comes to using information on what a customer buys, or how they shop, to personalise their experience, Mr Lim says.\nThe supermarket has also benefited from a swing to online shopping during the pandemic.\nAccording to its most recent set of results, Tesco's group revenues jumped by 5.9% to \u00a330.4bn for the six months to August compared with the same period last year.

      "tags": "Children,Stillbirth,Photography,Mold,Babies & toddlers,Parenting,Pregnancy",
      "text": "It was the look on the face of the sonographer that told one mother something was wrong with her baby.\nSharon Gorvett was 20 weeks pregnant with her third child in 2004 when a doctor told her that her unborn daughter was \"incompatible with life\".\nShe was automatically booked for a termination, but surprised her doctors when she said she did not want one.\nShe is now taking part in an exhibition to help awareness for baby loss, and give other parents \"a little hope\".\nDoctors thought Ms Gorvett's daughter Sophie had Edwards Syndrome, a rare but serious condition where most babies die before or shortly after being born, due to organ defects.\nChildren with the condition often die before or shortly after birth, with 5-10% living beyond their first year.\nMs Gorvett said she had not been asked, and had not agreed to a termination, but was automatically given a slot for one.\n\"They explained what was involved and I said: 'No, it's not something I want to do',\" she said.\nAt one point  she said the consultant asked her: \"Are you telling me that this pregnancy is very precious to you?\"\n\"Of course it's very precious, she's still my child, my baby, and I want to spend as much time with her as possible,\" she said.\nShe was told her daughter would either pass away in the womb, while she was being born or shortly after birth.\nShe was told most parents in her situation did not want interventions to help the baby if anything went wrong.\n\"Well, I'm not most parents,\" she said.\nSophie was born early at 5lb 12oz born and \"was a little fighter\" and \"so pretty\", said her mother.\n\"I didn't even have a bed for her to sleep in because I didn't think I'd be leaving the hospital with a live baby.\n\"We had to stop on the way home and buy a Moses basket for Sophie.\"\nThe family spent 13 weeks with Sophie, and said even though her life was short, it was filled with love, and with the small beautiful things we often take for granted in our day-to-day lives.\nShe said: \"We took her to see the cows and we picked a bluebell for her. She felt the sun on her face and we showed her the moon.\n\"We took her out, like you would any other baby, visited family and friends, took lots of photos and just made every day special.\"\nWhen Sophie's heart started to fail, the family went away to a cottage where she died.\n\"We were out walking by the side of the Brecon canal. She took about three breaths and she was gone. She didn't struggle, it was very peaceful. We've since planted a pink Hawthorn tree there and put a plaque where she passed away.\"\n\"Our family was complete when she was there, and now she's not there, it'll never be complete, but she's still very much with us, I've told my grandchildren all about their aunty Sophie, and we still mark her birthday every year. \n\"She was my daughter from the moment I found out I was pregnant, and she will always be my daughter.\"\nMs Gorvett is one of a number of women taking part in a new digital exhibition which aims to offer more support to grieving parents.\nPartly funded by The National Lottery Community Fund, 'You're Not Alone' calls for more open discussion around life limiting genetic birth disorders. \nThe project has been created by the Mold based charity, Same but Different but in conjunction with Soft UK, who provide information and support to families affected.\nPhotographer and Founder of the Same but Different charity, Ceridwen Hughes, said the project aims to raise awareness about the importance of talking about grief through baby loss, whilst celebrating the lives of the babies, no matter how short their lives. \nShe said baby loss often feels like a \"whispered secret.\"\nShe added: \"No-one knows what to say to a grieving parent and often people are too afraid to even say the child's name for fear of causing more upset and yet the parents I have spoken to yearn to remember and celebrate the lives of their child, no matter how short their life.\" \nFor Ms Gorvett, taking part in the project was a way to honour Sophie's memory, 17 years after she was born, and also to remind medical professionals that all parents really want is \"a little hope\", and the recognition that their children are individuals who should be assessed on their own merit.  \nIf you've been affected by the issues discussed, help and support is available via BBC Action Line."

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,Carbon neutrality",
      "text": "Another big push towards electric vehicles is being made in the UK government's latest strategy to make the great shift to a virtually zero-carbon economy.\nMinisters are investing \u00a3620m in grants for electric vehicles and street charging points.\nCar makers will be mandated to sell a proportion of clean vehicles each year.\nAn extra \u00a3350m is promised to help the automotive supply chain move to electric.\nThe new plan set out by the government is supposed to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050.\nThe announcement comes 12 days before global leaders meet in Glasgow to negotiate how to curb climate change.\nAchieving\u00a0net zero means the\u00a0UK will\u00a0no longer be\u00a0adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nWithout action on climate change, the world faces a hotter planet, rising sea levels and extreme weather that threaten many forms of life.\nThe UK has already made progress in cutting emissions compared to the levels released in 1990. In 2019, the country released 40% less than in 1990. \nOn Tuesday the government also announced a strategy to address emissions from the UK's 30 million buildings.\nHomeowners will be able to apply for grants of up to \u00a35,000 to install low-carbon heat pumps to replace gas boilers.\nThe Labour party's Ed Miliband responded to the strategy, saying the \"plans falls short on delivery\" adding \"we've waited months for a heat and buildings strategy, it's a massive let-down\".\nProf Lord Nicholas Stern, Chair of LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said the plan will require \"strong investment and innovation\" and would generate a \"new and attractive form of growth\". But he warned that low-income households will need support.\nAnd Prof Dan Lunt, Professor of Climate Science at University of Bristol, called the strategy's approach to flying weak and unambitious. \nEnvironmental group Friends of the Earth criticised the strategy as \"riddled with holes and omissions\".\n\"The rapid electrification of new vehicles is certainly welcome, but many of the carbon savings this could bring will be wiped out by the government's \u00a327 billion road programme,\" it said.  \nIt also offers a further \u00a3120m to develop SMRs - small \"modular\" nuclear reactors that can be factory-built. These might go to the Wylfa site in Wales, although that's not certain.\nThese mini-reactors are being promoted heavily by Rolls Royce, although critics say the technology won't be mature in time to meet the UK's carbon targets.\nOn large nuclear: there's been much speculation about a go-ahead for Sizewell C in Suffolk. But funding has been a key sticking point and it seems an announcement has been put off until the Chancellor's spending review next week.\nThere will be an extra \u00a3625m for tree-planting and peat restoration, too - even though the current schedule is running way behind its targets.\nThe government is committing \u00a3140m to two clusters promoting carbon capture and storage to produce hydrogen. The hubs will be the North-West of England and North Wales, with Teesside and Humberside - the government has previously promised \u00a31bn to support CCS. \nHeavy industries in these areas will be fuelled by hydrogen split from natural gas. The resulting CO2 emissions will be pumped into undersea rocks for storage.\nThis will be controversial because environmentalists believe hydrogen should be obtained instead through electrolysis - using surplus wind energy. \nIt looks unlikely that there will be much hydrogen left over to heat people's homes, which is why the government is postponing any decision about hydrogen boilers until 2026.\nThe Treasury has hinted tax rises may be necessary to fund the government's net zero strategy.\nIn a review exploring the economic impact of decarbonising, the Treasury said: \"There will be demands on public spending, but the biggest impact comes from the erosion of tax revenues from fossil fuel-related activity.\"\nIt said future governments \"may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue\" rather than relying on higher borrowing.\nMinisters are keen to stress their intention that the so-called net zero transition will be led by business.\nThey say it will create 440,000 jobs and draw in up to 90bn of private investment by 2030.\nThe government says since the Prime Minister announced his 10-point plan for the climate a year ago, it has invested \u00a326bn of public funds into the low-carbon revolution.\nPart of that portfolio will be an extra \u00a3500m fund for low carbon innovation.\nEnvironmentalists will be scrutinising the numbers to see if various recent policy announcements will add up to the policy portfolio needed to present a plausible plan for decarbonising the economy by 2050.\nSo what's missing from the strategy? Well, there's no reference to eating less meat - which the government's advisers say is needed. And the aviation strategy - putting no constraint on flying - runs counter to advisers' opinions. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

His constituents should be able to decide if he is the right person to represent them.\""

      "tags": "Carbon capture and storage,Greenhouse gas emissions,COP26,Climate change,Carbon neutrality",
      "text": "Countries have set out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.\nThey hope to achieve the target of \"net zero\" by 2050, to help slow global warming.\nNet zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \nAchieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount.\nGreenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) are released when we burn oil, gas and coal for our homes, factories and transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. These gases cause global warming by trapping the sun's energy.\nMeanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees and plants to absorb CO2.\nUnder the 2015 Paris Agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to keep temperature rises \"well below\" 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. \nExperts say that to achieve this, net zero must be reached by 2050. \nNot all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain have to be compensated for, or offset - for example, by planting more trees.\nAlmost every country has embarked on tree planting as a cheap way of reducing carbon, although there may not be enough space for the number required.\nCarbon capture and storage has also been suggested as another solution. \nThis involves using machinery to remove carbon from the air, then solidifying it and burying it underground.\nHowever, the technology is still emerging, very expensive and as yet unproven.\nIt won't be easy. \nReaching net zero will involve moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy for our power, and abandoning vehicles run on petrol and diesel, in favour of those powered by electricity and hydrogen.\nGas central heating will need to be replaced by alternative sources, such as heat pumps. \nReaching net zero could also mean flying far less in future, and eating less red meat.\nPresenting the government's net zero strategy to the House of Commons in the run up to COP26, the government pledged:\nThe government had already announced a ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, and that all the UK's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035.\nAt the time, Shadow Business Secretary Ed Miliband called the latest announcements \"a massive let-down\".\nMore than 130 countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions before 2050.\nHowever, China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 in the world - says it's aiming for \"carbon neutrality\" by 2060. It hasn't set out exactly what this means or how it will get there. \nRussia - the third-largest producer of oil worldwide - has also pledged to reach net zero by 2060, although its draft commitment hasn't been legally ratified. \nUntil recently President Putin dismissed the risks posed by rising temperatures.\nUS President Joe Biden criticised the Russian and Chinese leaders for not attending the COP26 summit. \nIndia - the world's fourth biggest emitter of CO2 after China, the US and the EU - has promised to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070. \nSome of the world's most heavily populated countries - including Indonesia - haven't made any net zero commitment.\nBut many of the announcements which have already come out of the COP26 summit on deforestation, cutting methane and reducing coal are directly linked to helping countries hit their net zero goal.\nThere's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.\nFor instance, Country A might record lower emissions if it shuts down energy-intensive industries such as steel production. \nBut if Country A then imports steel from Country B, it's effectively handed on its carbon emissions to Country B instead of reducing the sum total of greenhouse gases.\nThere are schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels. \nHowever, some climate scientists worry such arrangements could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their own fossil fuel usage. \nAnd it's hard to say that initiatives funded to offset emissions elsewhere would not have happened anyway.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "Babies born to women under 35 were more likely to be given short, modern names last year compared to older mothers. \nOfficial birth data in England and Wales for 2020 showed Olivia and Oliver were still the most popular baby names overall - for the fifth year running.\nNew entries into the top 10 included Ivy, Rosie and Archie. Oliver was particularly popular in the North East.\nThe largest movers into the top 100 boys' names were Milo (80th) and Otis (96th) and the girls' was Maeve (94th).\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed 4,225 baby boys were named Oliver in 2020, down from 4,932 the previous year, while a total of 3,640 newborn girls were named Olivia, down from 4,082.\nOlivia and Oliver have been the most popular names in England and Wales since 2015.\nThe name of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's son, Archie, moved up the boys' list from 19th to ninth, with 2,944 babies named Archie in 2020, up from 2,544 in 2019. It is the first time Archie has made the top 10.\nIt is also the first time Charlie has not been in the top 10 since 2005, slipping to 12th place with a total of 2,810 babies named Charlie in 2020, down from 3,355 in 2019.\nSince 2010, Ivy has risen 221 places to become the sixth most popular name for girls in England and Wales in 2020.\nArthur and Noah have seen an increase in popularity over the last two decades, both rising more than 200 places in the ranks to the boys' top five in 2019 and 2017 respectively.\nIn 2020, the largest movers into the top 100 boys' names were Milo (80th) and Otis (96th), both rising 28 places since 2019.\nMaeve has risen 124 places since 2019 and was the largest new entry into the top 100 girls' names (94th).\nMuhammad was top in four regions of England and Arthur in three regions.\nIn Wales, Noah was the top boys' name but only the fourth most popular name in England and Wales combined.\nSi\u00e2n Bradford, from the ONS, said popular culture and celebrities continued to provide inspiration for many parents.\n\"Maeve and Otis, characters from the popular programme Sex Education, have seen a surge in popularity in 2020,\" she said. \n\"While the name Margot has been rapidly climbing since actress Margot Robbie appeared in the popular film The Wolf of Wall Street.\"\nShe added: \" We continue to see the age of mothers having an impact on the choice of baby name.\"\nExplaining why it uses mothers' data to glean the most popular baby names, an ONS spokeswoman said: \"To get a complete statistical picture for our baby names analysis, we rely on a mother's data, because information relating to mothers should appear on every birth registration.\"\nIn 2019, pop star Dua Lipa and Star Wars' Kylo Ren were among the influences on parents for the choice of baby names."

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced the Queen has agreed Southend will be granted city status following the killing of MP Sir David Amess.\nSir David was stabbed to death at Belfairs Methodist Church on Friday.\nHe regularly championed Southend's case to be a city during his time in Parliament.\nMr Johnson told the House of Commons he was \"happy\" to announce Southend \"will be accorded the city status it so clearly deserves\". \nThe prime minister said: \"That Sir David spent almost 40 years in this House, but not one day in ministerial office, tells everything about where his priorities lay.\"\nHe added Sir David \"never once witnessed any achievement by any resident of Southend that could not somehow be cited in his bid to secure city status for that distinguished town\". \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer told Parliament he was \"so pleased\" by the announcement.\nSir Keir said the news was \"a fitting tribute to Sir David's hard work\".\nJames Duddridge, who represents Rochford and Southend East, the constituency neighbouring Sir David's Southend West seat, said the decision \"means a lot to everybody\".\nHe said residents did not want Southend to be remembered as the city where Sir David was killed but \" for characteristics such as its pier, airport and football\". \nSir David, who championed Southend's bid for city status as part of The Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022, was described by Home Secretary Priti Patel as \"Mr Southend\" following his death.\nAs well as bringing extra prestige, city status is an opportunity for areas to attract more tourism and boost the local economy.\nOn its website, Southend-on-Sea Borough Council, which had campaigned with Sir David, previously said city status would bring not only \"prestige and standing, but an opportunity to lever further investment\".\nOn the latest announcement, council leader Ian Gilbert said he felt a \"mixture of emotions\" after hearing the news.\nHe said it was \"clearly what Sir David would have wanted\".\n\"While I don't want it to have come in these circumstances, I'm still pleased and proud that it is happening,\" he added.\nLeader of the council's Conservative group, Tony Cox, said the decision meant Sir David's \"legacy will forever live on in Southend-on-Sea\".\nHe added: \"I cannot thank Her Majesty the Queen and the prime minister enough for granting that legacy, but what truly breaks my heart is that he is not around to see it.\n\"I am sure he will be looking down on us now saying, 'My work in Southend is now complete'.\"\nLabour councillor for Kursaal ward in Southend, Matt Dent, said: \"Everyone who knew Sir David knew how passionate he was about Southend getting city status.\n\"It was something he worked into every conversation. It's such a shame he is not here to see it.\"\nThe Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend Stephen Cottrell, who grew up in Southend and was a friend of Sir David's, said with Southend having been declared a city people can \"forget about a statue of Vera Lynn at Dover, we are going to put a statue of David Amess at the end of Southend pier\".\nChelmsford MP Vicky Ford and Southend United FC both tweeted that it was a \"fitting\" tribute to Sir David. \nDowning Street said the award of city status to Southend was a \"very rare honour\".\n\"This was an exceptional circumstance,\" the prime minister's official spokesman said.\n\"It is a very rare honour which Sir David campaigned passionately for.\n\"He was a tireless champion of Southend, celebrating its achievements, the work of its residents and its thriving local businesses and diversity.\"\nSpeaking after signing a Book of Condolence at Southend's Civic Centre, Essex Police Ch Supt Simon Anslow said: \"Having long been a champion for Southend, it is of course truly tragic that his main goal in Parliament has been achieved in the days following his sad death, with confirmation today that Southend will be afforded city status by Her Majesty The Queen.\n\"Today has been a mark of respect for the man - indeed it has been a mark of respect for what will be Essex's new city.\"\nIn a 2019 speech to the Commons calling on Southend to be given city status, Sir David celebrated the town for everything from its hospital and airport to its investment in digital infrastructure.\nHe also praised Leigh-on-Sea for being voted the \"happiest place in the United Kingdom\" and said people in Southend \"walk on water\" while on its famous pier.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Officials are keeping a close watch on a new descendant of the Delta variant of Covid that is causing a growing number of infections. \nDelta is the UK's dominant variant, but latest official data suggests 6% of Covid cases that have been genetically sequenced are of a new type.\nAY.4.2, which some are calling \"Delta Plus\", contains mutations that might give the virus survival advantages. \nTests are under way to understand how much of a threat it may pose.  \nExperts say it is unlikely to take off in a big way or escape current vaccines. \nIt is not yet considered a variant of concern, or a variant under investigation - the categories assigned to variants and the level of risk associated with them.\nThere are thousands of different types - or variants - of Covid circulating across the world. Viruses mutate all the time, so it is not surprising to see new versions emerge.\nOriginal Delta was classified as a variant of concern in the UK in May 2021 after overtaking the Alpha variant to become the dominant type of Covid in circulation. \nBut in July 2021 experts identified AY.4.2. \nThis offshoot or sublineage of Delta has been increasing slowly since then. It includes some new mutations affecting the spike protein, which the virus uses to penetrate our cells. \nSo far, there is no indication that it is considerably more transmissible as a result of these changes, but it is something experts are studying. \nThe mutations - Y145H and A222V - have been found in various other coronavirus lineages since the beginning of the pandemic.\nScientists are constantly checking for new genetic changes that Covid is undergoing.\nSome emerging variants are worrying, but many are inconsequential. The difficult job is spotting, tracking and managing the ones that could matter.\nThe UK is a front-runner in carrying out these vital lab analyses, having completed more than a million tests so far. \nThe first step is to pick up new mutants worth watching, such as this new offshoot - AY.4.2.\nNext, if there is a strong suggestion that the genetic changes might make the virus more contagious, it is classified as a variant under investigation and more checks are done.\nIf it becomes clearer that it could be more transmissible and escape some of the built up immunity from past infections or vaccines, or potentially cause more serious disease, it is moved into the variant of concern category. That's the one Delta belongs to. \nAt this stage, experts don't think AY.4.2 is likely to take hold - so in time it could well burn out and drop off the watch list. \nProf Francois Balloux, director of University College London's Genetics Institute, said: \"It is potentially a marginally more infectious strain.\n\"It's nothing compared with what we saw with Alpha and Delta, which were something like 50 to 60 percent more transmissible. So we are talking about something quite subtle here and that is currently under investigation.\n\"It is likely to be up to 10 percent more transmissible. \n\"It's good that we are aware. It's excellent that we have the facilities and infrastructure in place to see anything that might be a bit suspicious.\n\"At this stage I would say wait and see, don't panic. It might be slightly, subtly more transmissible but it is not something absolutely disastrous like we saw previously.\"\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said: \"It's something we're keeping a very close eye on.\n\"As you would expect we're monitoring it closely and won't hesitate to take action if necessary.\" \nA few cases have also been identified in US. There had been some in Denmark but new infections with AY.4.2 have since gone down.\nThe UK is already offering booster doses of Covid vaccine to higher risk people ahead of winter to make sure they have the fullest protection against coronavirus. \nThere is no suggestion that a new update of the vaccine will be needed to protect against any of the existing variants of the pandemic virus.

      "text": "A seriously ill two-year-old girl whose parents wanted her to be at home at the end of her life has died in a hospice.\nAlta Fixsler, from Salford, suffered a brain injury at birth and died, surrounded by her family, on Monday.\nEarlier this month, her parents lost their legal battle against Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust for life support to be withdrawn at home rather than in hospital or a hospice.\nHer father told the BBC that Alta \"was our whole world\".\nA High Court judge had ruled her treatment should be withdrawn in a children's hospice.\nHer father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: \"She passed away in a hospice on Monday. I don't know even how to explain how I am feeling.\n\"She fought for her life for three hours after the life support was turned off.\"\nFollowing her brain injury at birth, Alta was left unable to breathe, drink or eat without medical help.\nHer father said the protracted court battle had been \"very painful\". \n\"The trust would not let us take her home,\" he added.\nThe girl's parents, who are Hasidic Jews, previously lost their fight against the removal of life support. They had argued it was against their faith.\nHer father previously told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that taking her home was \"something that we wanted from day one when the doctors said she is not going to live more than a few hours\".\nThroughout the legal battle medics insisted Alta had no chance of recovery. \nHigh Court judge Mr Justice MacDonald also said her parents' idea of taking her abroad to Israel for alternative treatment would expose her to \"further pain\".\nHe said ceasing life-sustaining treatment was in the toddler's \"best interests\" and moving her would cause her discomfort \"for no medical benefit\".\nA spokesman for Alta's family said: \"Despite our best efforts and deep discussions to continue Alta's critical care and give her the best possible quality of life, we are distraught at the decision taken by the court to end her life.\n\"We strongly believe that making life-changing decisions on behalf of children ought to be a parental right and it is important that we open up the debate around this. \n\"We call on the government to look at the current legislation and change it.\"\nA spokesman for law firm TKD Solicitors, which represented Alta's parents, said she had been remembered at a funeral service in Israel.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Deafness and hearing-impairment,Ofcom,Television,Channel 4,Broadcasting",
      "text": "Channel 4 subtitles, signing and audio description are not likely to return on TV until mid-November, almost two months after a catastrophic fault.\nThe outage, which has already lasted more than three weeks, has angered deaf, hard of hearing and visually impaired viewers.\nMore than 500 people have complained to broadcasting regulator Ofcom.\nThe fault happened on 25 September when a fire suppressant system destroyed hard disks at a broadcast centre.\nAn emergency back-up subtitling system also failed. The channel is building a new system from scratch, and said it will fix the problem more quickly than its current prediction of mid-November if it can.\nThe incident at the broadcast centre owned by Red Bee Media also affected other broadcasters like the BBC and Channel 5, although their services have now been restored.\n\"Channel 4 would like to apologise to viewers for not currently being able to provide access services,\" a statement said. \"We realise how frustrating this is for our viewers.\" \nThe broadcaster will begin to offer subtitles for its biggest shows like The Great British Bake Off and Gogglebox on its online catch-up service All4 from this week.\nHowever, the channel cannot provide audio description or sign language services at all. \"These services were irretrievably lost during the incident and we won't be able to restore them until we move to the new system we are building,\" it said in an update published on Tuesday.\nIt added: \"We cannot rush this and run the risk of something going wrong. Something like this needs to be installed slowly to ensure our channels don't come off air and to prevent something like this happening again.\n\"That means that full access services might not be available until the middle of November. Clearly, if we can do anything to speed up this process, we will.\"\nMark Atkinson, chief executive at hearing loss charity RNID, said: \"For more than three weeks, the 12 million people in the UK who are deaf or have hearing loss have felt excluded and increasingly angry, because the system to provide subtitles and signed content is broken.\n\"It's impossible to imagine a failure that affected the hearing community being allowed to go on for so long.\n\"The BBC and Channel 5 are now offering a near-normal service, but it is unacceptable that the system could have failed so spectacularly, and that Channel 4 have still not fixed the problem. Further, there was a failure across the board to communicate to deaf people regularly and - most importantly - accessibly.\n\"We're pleased that Channel 4 have started providing updates in British Sign Language to the deaf community. They must ensure deaf people and people with hearing loss are kept informed about what steps they are taking until the problem is fixed.\" \nAn Ofcom spokesperson said: \"We remain extremely concerned by the impact on people who rely on these services. Channel 4 did not have strong backup measures in place, and it should not have taken several weeks to provide a clear, public plan and timeline for fixing the problems.\n\"We now expect Channel 4 to meet the timings it has set for restoring these vital services.\"\nA spokesman for Red Bee Media said: \"Things are improving every day and we are able to deliver more and more accessible programmes, but we are unfortunately still experiencing issues with receiving the media for which our access teams create pre-recorded subtitles, audio descriptions and signing.\n\"As soon as there are any more updates, we will share these.\"\nThe original fault temporarily took Channel 4, Channel 5 and S4C off air completely, and led to transmission problems in the subsequent days, such as E4 being forced to delay the Married At First Sight series finale.\nOn 8 October, presenter Adam Hills addressed the problems on Channel 4's The Last Leg, holding up a hand-written sign reading \"Sorry there's still no subtitles\", followed by another saying \"Sort it out\".\nThe Times reported that the fire suppression system at Red Bee's headquarters sucked all the oxygen out of a room, causing a \"sonic wave\" that shut down the transmission servers.\nA spokesperson for the London Fire Brigade said: \"Firefighters were called to reports a gas suppression system had activated at a building on Wood Lane in White City on Saturday 25th September.\n\"The suppression system had activated in a server room and on site engineers worked to ventilate the room. Firefighters carried out a search of the building and a sweep of the room but found no fire apparent.\""

      "tags": "Menopause",
      "text": "Northern Ireland's employers could end up on the \"wrong side of the law\" unless they make strides to facilitate women going through the menopause.\nThat is according to the Equality Commission's chief commissioner.\nWith women making up nearly half of the working population, there is pressure for better awareness and for workplaces to support those experiencing symptoms. \nThe commission's Geraldine McGahey said that \"many employers are doing really well - others are not\". \n\"I think every employer should be walking away thinking I need to check my practices and procedures, I need to check what the needs are of my female employees, both now and in the future,\" she told BBC News NI.\nThe issue has reached parliament, where Westminster's women and equalities committee has begun an inquiry into the consequences of menopause in the workplace. \nIt is estimated 900,000 women in the UK have left jobs as a result of menopausal symptoms.  \nThe Equality Commission said positive strides are being made. \nEven with the pandemic, some employers have been making changes including the local health trusts.\nBelfast City Council is currently finalising a menopause policy developed through its women's steering group. \nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which has offices in Belfast, has implemented a number of changes, including changing insurance arrangements so women can access cover for menopause. \nFacilitating working from home and training career coaches about the issue is also on offer. \nPwC partner Lynne Rainey said it makes good business sense. \n\"It is a business-critical issue for us. Women over 40 are the fastest growing demographic in the workforce. \n\"They bring a huge amount of experience and expertise and, as a business, which is clearly a space of diversity and inclusion, we need a workforce that remains inclusive and diverse and we want to retain that talent. \n\"We also want to attract to us as well.\"  \nFor those going through the menopause, such as Linzi Conway, a 51-year-old self-employed management consultant, the symptoms can be \"debilitating, especially the impact of insomnia\". \n\"As I have no one to pass the work on to, I sometimes muddle through and that lack of support is a challenge,\" she said.\nLinzi, who works from home, said a result for her would be being able to explain to a client that she is unable to work on a particular day due to menopause symptoms - but \"we aren't quite there yet\", she added. \n\"It's absolutely not an excuse, these are real symptoms, especially the tiredness, the pains and the brain fog - they all affect our ability to do a day's work.\n\"I think one of the benefits of the pandemic is forcing us to remodel and look at our work place differently and allowing that flexibility of working life, and that is going to help a lot of people whether it is menopause, mental health or anything else.\" \nEarlier this year, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' NI committee and the Labour Relations Agency produced new guidance to address equality issues in relation to women affected by the menopause in employment. \nIt provides good practice examples and suggested tools for both employers and employees. \nGeraldine McGahey said the tools can be as simple as good ventilation, a fan on the desk, change in uniform or just providing a culture where people feel comfortable talking about it. \n\"We are finding a really positive interest in the subject,\" she said.\n\"Our first conference had 121 delegates and that is organisations not people. \n\"We are running more events and have had over 500 downloads of our guidance notes.\" "

      "tags": "George W Bush,United States",
      "text": "Tributes are being paid to former US Secretary of State Colin Powell, who has died of Covid-19 complications aged 84. \nThe former top military officer died on Monday morning, his family said. He was fully vaccinated.\nPowell became the first African-American secretary of state in 2001 under Republican President George W Bush.\nHe also sparked controversy for helping garner support for the Iraq War.\n\"We have lost a remarkable and loving husband, father, grandfather and a great American,\" the family said in a statement, thanking the staff at the Walter Reed Medical Center \"for their caring treatment\".\nPowell had previously been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer which may have made him more susceptible to Covid symptoms, according to US media, as well as Parkinson's disease.\nPresident Joe Biden, calling Powell a \"dear friend\", said he had embodied the \"highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat\". \nFormer President Bush was among the first to pay tribute to \"a great public servant\" as well as \"a family man and a friend\" who \"was such a favourite of presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom - twice\".\nMr Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney saluted Powell as \"a man who loved his country and served her long and well\" while also being \"a trailblazer and role model for so many\".\nFormer President Barack Obama, a Democrat, tweeted that Powell  \"understood what was best in this country, and tried to bring his own life, career, and public statements in line with that ideal\".\nCondoleezza Rice, Powell's successor as secretary of state and the first black woman in the role, called him \"a truly great man\" whose \"devotion to our nation was not limited to the many great things he did while in uniform or during his time spent in Washington\". \n\"Much of his legacy will live on in the countless number of young lives he touched.\"\nCurrent secretary of state Antony Blinken called Powell's life \"a victory of the American Dream\". \nPowell gave the Department of State \"the very best of his leadership,\" Mr Blinken said. \"He never stopped believing in America, and we believe in America in no small part because it helped produce someone like Colin Powell.\"\nFormer UK Prime Minister Tony Blair - who worked closely with Powell during the early years of the Iraq War -  said he was someone of \"immense capability and integrity\" who was \"a great companion, with a lovely and self-deprecating sense of humour\".\nRemembrances also poured in from prominent African-American leaders. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton called him \"a sincere and committed man\", while members of the Congressional Black Caucus praised his \"legacy of valour and integrity\".\nUS Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin, the first black man to serve in that role, hailed Powell as \"a tremendous personal friend and mentor\" who would be \"impossible to replace\".\nOnce a moderate Republican, Powell became a trusted military adviser to a number of leading US politicians.\nBut he broke with his party to endorse Barack Obama in 2008, as well as Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. A sharp critic of Republican president Donald Trump, Powell said he could no longer call himself a Republican after the violent 6 January riot at the US Capitol.\nHe also saw service and was wounded in Vietnam, an experience that later helped define his own military and political strategies.\nHowever, he would say himself that his own legacy had been damaged by a speech to the United Nations Security Council which used faulty intelligence to back the invasion of Iraq.\n\"It was painful. It's painful now,\" Powell told ABC News in 2005.\nColin Powell was an iconic American success story. The child of immigrants, he became the first black man to rise to the highest positions in US military and diplomacy.\nIn the 1990s, Powell was one of the few American public figures with appeal that crossed political boundaries - reminiscent of General Dwight D Eisenhower after the Second World War.\nUnlike Eisenhower, Powell would not ascend to the presidency - although there were abundant calls for him to run.\nThose calls dwindled after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, a decision Powell later acknowledged was a \"blot\" on his legacy. He had staked his reputation on the presence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction - and his reputation suffered for it.\nIn his later years, Powell became a different kind of icon. His drift away from the Republican Party following Donald Trump's rise to power reflected the dwindling influence of Powell's moderate, internationalist faction within the American conservative movement.\nPowell's life may be somewhat overshadowed by his cause of death, as he now ranks as the most prominent American to succumb to Covid-19.
