      "title": "Amanda Gorman: US poet says security guard labelled her 'suspicious'",
      "tags": "Poetry,Racism,US race relations",
      "text": "Amanda Gorman, the young poet who found global fame after performing at President Joe Biden's inauguration, has shared her experience of alleged racial profiling by a security guard.\nThe 22-year-old said on Twitter that she was accosted on a walk home on Friday and told \"you look suspicious\". \n\"This is the reality of black girls: One day you're called an icon, the next day, a threat,\" she wrote.\nGorman received widespread acclaim for her reading of The Hill We Climb.\nHer poem was seen as a rousing and timely call for national unity - delivered at the US Capitol just weeks after it was the scene of deadly riots. \nTweeting about her experience, Gorman described being \"tailed\" by the security guard who she said offered no apology after she was able to prove she lived in her own apartment building.\nIn revealing her experience, she re-shared a post she made in February which said: \"We live in a contradictory society that can celebrate a black girl poet & also pepper spray a 9 yr old\" - in reference to a recent incident in Rochester, New York. \n\"Yes see me, but also see all other black girls who've been made invisible. I can not, will not, rise alone.\"\nIn a second tweet about the incident, Gorman added: \"In a sense, he was right. I AM A THREAT: a threat to injustice, to inequality, to ignorance.\"\nLater, she returned to Twitter to thank people for their support.\nThe BBC has contacted her for further comment. \nGorman's social media posts have been widely shared - highlighted as an example of the everyday prejudice faced by black people in the US.\n\"Let this story sink in,\" Mark Keam, a state legislator in Virginia, tweeted. \"And realise how - while I'm glad it ended safe for @TheAmandaGorman - this type of confrontation is an every day occurrence for millions of our fellow Americans.\"\nIn her inauguration poem, Gorman described herself as \"a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother [who] can dream of becoming president, only to find her self reciting for one\".\nBorn in Los Angeles in 1998, Gorman became the city's youth poet laureate at 16. Three years later, while studying sociology at Harvard, she was named the first ever National Youth Poet Laureate.\nShe was the youngest poet to ever perform at a presidential inauguration and her performance was praised by influential national figures, including former First Ladies Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton."

      "text": "More than 100 UK charities have condemned the government's decision to cut aid to Yemen, following cross-party criticism.\nAt least \u00a387 million has been pledged in aid to the Middle Eastern country, down from \u00a3164m in 2019-2020.\nA Foreign Office spokesman said the government remained \"steadfast\" in its support to the Yemeni people.\nYemen is among several Middle Eastern and African countries whose UK aid is at risk, a leaked email suggests. \nFirst reported by openDemocracy, a leaked document dated last month suggests officials are considering cutting aid to Syria by 67% and Lebanon by 88%.\nAid to Nigeria could drop 58%, Somalia 60%, South Sudan 59% and the Democratic Republic of Congo by 60%, it says. \nIn a letter to Boris Johnson, charities say the government has made a \"misjudgement\" by thinking the public is happy to turn away from countries affected by poverty, war and disease.\n\"History will not judge this nation kindly if the government chooses to step away from the people in Yemen and thus destroy the UK's global reputation as a country that steps up to help those most in need,\" the letter says.\nOxfam, Christian Aid, Save the Children and Care International are among the 101 signatories.\nDanny Sriskandarajah, Oxfam GB chief executive, said: \"Aid cuts are a false economy that will remove a vital lifeline from millions of people in Yemen and beyond who can't feed their families, have lost their homes and whose lives are threatened by conflict and Covid.\"\nHe also urged the government to stop the \"immoral\" practice of selling arms to the war-torn state.\nThe government wants to reduce its overall international aid budget by about \u00a34bn in 2021-2022, which will mean missing the UN target of spending 0.7% of national income on foreign aid.\nBut it has yet to say where the axe will fall.\nThe leaked Foreign Office email gives the first indication of which countries might lose out. \nKevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children, said the UK's decision to cut aid would have \"devastating real-life consequences\".\nMPs from across the political spectrum have criticised the reduction in aid.\nConservative former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell said the \"unimaginable\" move would \"condemn hundreds of thousands of children to starvation\".\nShadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the change represented the UK \"abandoning our moral obligations\".\nThe decade-long conflict in Yemen has left an estimated 20 million people - two-thirds of the population - dependent on humanitarian assistance while two million children are acutely malnourished. \nIn Syria, the country has been left devastated by a conflict that erupted after President Bashar al-Assad's government responded with deadly force to peaceful anti-government protests in March 2011.\nThe fighting has left at least 380,000 people dead and caused half the population to flee their homes, including almost six million refugees abroad.\nA UK government spokesman said: \"The seismic impact of the pandemic on the UK economy has forced us to take tough but necessary decisions, including temporarily reducing the overall amount we spend on aid.\n\"We are still working through what this means for individual programmes and decisions have not yet been made.\n\"We remain a world-leading aid donor and we will spend more than \u00a310 billion this year to fight poverty, tackle climate change and improve global health.\""

      "text": "About 100 high-profile figures have signed a letter to the Treccani Italian dictionary calling on it to change its definition of the word \"woman\".\nThe campaign argues that derogatory terms such as \"puttana\" (whore) should be removed from the list of synonyms.\nSuch words reinforce \"misogynist stereotypes that objectify women and present them as inferior\", it adds.\nTreccani, a leading online Italian dictionary, has not yet responded, but previously defended its approach.\nAmong the letter's signatories are LGBTQ+ activist and politician Imma Battaglia, politician Laura Boldrini, and Alessandra Perrazzelli, deputy director general of the Bank of Italy.\nIt was written by activist Maria Beatrice Giovanardi, who was also behind an earlier campaign to get the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) to remove words such as \"bint\" and \"bird\" as other ways of saying \"woman\". After a similar petition attracted tens of thousands of signatures, Oxford University Press updated its definition.\nThe synonyms given in Treccani's definition are even worse than the OED's because there are 30 terms used to describe sex workers, Ms Giovanardi told Reuters. \nMeanwhile, she added, the word \"man\" was associated with positive terms such as \"businessman\".\n\"Language shapes reality and influences the way women are perceived and treated,\" she wrote in her letter.\n\"Vocabularies, dictionaries of synonyms and antonyms, encyclopaedias are educational tools of reference and Treccani.it, as such, is consulted in schools, libraries and in all of our homes.\"\n\"This will not put an end to everyday sexism, but it could contribute to a correct description and vision of women and their role in today's society.\"\nIn a blog post published in November, Treccani said that the dictionary did not \"select lexicon based on moral judgment or prejudices\".\n\"If society and culture express negativity through words, a dictionary cannot refuse to document them,\" it added."

      "title": "Covid-19: Is school mask and testing policy flawed?",
      "tags": "Schools,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Schools reopen to all pupils next week in England - the first part of the UK where this will happen. It is a crucial step for children and wider society in the route out of lockdown.\nMasks are to be worn by secondary school children in classes, while mass testing is being introduced. But will these steps be a help? And does it even matter if infection rates go up?\nTo reduce the risk of spread of the virus, the government has introduced mass testing. All secondary school pupils will be offered three tests on their return before being asked to carry them out twice a week at home. \nThese will be rapid lateral flow tests that provide a quick result on the spot, unlike the ones that are carried out in official testing centres - known as PCR tests - that are sent off to labs. The rapid tests are less accurate - they may pick up only between half to three-quarters of positive cases, but given they are being used to spot cases before people develop symptoms or for those who do not develop symptoms, the government is adamant they have an important role.\nThe problem is they can result in a false positive, telling people they are infected when they are not. Research suggests this happens one to three times for every 1,000 tests carried out.\nOne safeguard would be to get anyone who tests positive to then take a PCR test to confirm it. This is being done for tests that are done in people's homes, but not for those carried out in school.\nAssuming most pupils take up the option of the tests, that could result in thousands of pupils and their close contacts being asked to isolate unnecessarily.\nThat may be a price worth paying if it was spotting many more positives, but the testing done in schools in recent weeks, of pupils and staff who have been attending, shows the number testing positive is now at the lower estimate for the false positivity rate.\nBirmingham University biostatistician Prof Jon Deeks says given the low detection rates that are being seen it is \"absolutely clear\" many of those getting positive test results next week will be false positives.\n\"Any testing system is a trade-off between benefits and harms,\" he says. \"My concern is that it will actually cause more harm than good.\"\nConcerns have been raised by the Royal Statistical Society, too. Prof Sheila Bird, a member of the society's Covid-19 Task Force, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme false positives were \"very likely\" and that every positive lateral flow test should have a PCR test to confirm it.\nThe second key change - and the most controversial - is the recommendation of masks in classes for secondary age schoolchildren. Previously pupils were just expected to wear them in communal areas, like corridors.\nCritics say it will harm learning and is unfair to expect children to wear masks for hours on end. But others have argued it is an absolute necessity and should have been introduced in primary schools too.\nThe problem is the benefit of mask-wearing is difficult to quantify. Recent evidence from the government advisory group Sage acknowledges this, although it says there is evidence that worn correctly they will have a \"small but significant\" impact on transmission by preventing the wearer from spreading the virus if they are unknowingly infected.\nThis is mainly derived from lab experiments though, and much will depend on how they are used, it says. Will teenagers adhere to the best practice on mask-wearing for hours on end?\nIt is for this reason some experts say they would have liked to see a proper trial in schools to measure the impact. \"We always do this for a medical intervention - there are lots of things that work in the lab but not in the real world,\" says Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at Nottingham University. \n\"But for some reason we don't do this with non-medical interventions. It would be complicated, but this would be the ideal opportunity to do it - and help us decide if they are useful or make matters worse.\"\nWithout a trial, the fear is it will be difficult for the government to stop the practice. If cases remain low, it could be argued masks have made the difference and if they creep up, the case could be made they would have gone up more without mask-wearing. The move could, in other words, open a can of worms.\nBut it is a risk ministers seem happy to tackle. The government insists the use of masks is \"temporary and precautionary\" - and  will be reviewed at Easter. Or, in the words of one scientific adviser: \"We know it's not going to make much difference, but if it helps us get schools back, it's worth the hassle when it's dropped.\" \nIt is well-established that children are at incredibly low risk from the virus, while research by the Office for National Statistics has shown that teachers are at no higher risk of infection than other working-age people.\nWhat role will schools play in the wider spread of the virus though remains more open for debate. Children, after all, come home and mix with their families. \nGovernment advisers say schools have not been a key driver of infections so far. This much can be seen from the impact of the second national lockdown in England in November when infection levels fell despite schools being open. \nBut this was before the new UK variant became dominant. Modelling has suggested reopening schools now could be enough to drive the R number above one, which would lead to a growing epidemic.\nMinisters have already indicated this matters less than it used to because the vaccination programme has begun to break the link between infection rates and serious illness and death - the R number is not one of their tests for slowing the pace of lifting lockdown. \nDr Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St Andrews, says it is impossible to disentangle exactly what impact schools have - although she says all the evidence suggests the school outbreaks that have happened have mainly been small.\n\"The evidence of harms of closing schools is clear. They should be open as default unless there is very strong evidence that closing them will have a significant impact on hospitalisations and mortality.\"\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nA mystery person infected with the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil has now been traced. Six cases of the apparently more contagious P.1 variant had been located in the UK - but the identity of one patient remained unknown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street briefing the person concerned has been staying at home - and there was no sign of further transmission. But extra testing is being put in place in Croydon, where they live. Read more about the Brazil variant here. - and watch Mr Hancock's comments below.\nThe number of people infected with coronavirus in the UK has continued to decrease. The weekly survey carried out by the Office for National Statistics indicates about one in 230 people had the virus in the seven days ending on 27 February, compared with one in 155 the previous week. The health secretary called the figures \"encouraging news\" ahead of the opening up of schools to all pupils in England on Monday. Matt Hancock added an extra \u00a379m would be spent on mental health support for pupils - saying the return to school was a \"long-awaited day for many... but for some it's also a moment of unease and anxiety\".\nAt the same briefing, the health secretary defended a proposed 1% pay increase for NHS staff in England this year, amid a backlash from unions. Mr Hancock said the proposal was \"what we think is affordable\" given financial pressures caused by the pandemic. But the union the Royal College of Nursing has set up a fund to prepare for possible strike action over the proposals, which it calls derisory. Our health editor says the unions see the proposal as scant reward for the huge efforts of staff during the pandemic. \nAnyone travelling overseas from England from Monday will have to prove they are allowed to travel, or risk being turned away from the airport and fined. A \"Declaration to Travel\" document - available on  a government website - sets out that the trip is permitted under current restrictions, such as for education or work. Individuals could face a \u00a3200 penalty if they fail to produce a completed form.\nDuring the pandemic, the government has awarded thousands of contracts to private companies, spending billions of pounds of public money in the process. But the way these contracts have been awarded - and the huge sums of money involved - have led to accusations of a lack of transparency. So what are the rules on government contracts, and has anything changed during the pandemic?

      "tags": "Nasa Perseverance Mars rover,Space exploration,Mars rovers,United States",
      "text": "The US space agency's Perseverance rover has wiggled its wheels and undertaken its first Martian drive.\nIt didn't move far - just 6.5m (21ft) in total.\nBut Nasa's deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan said it was a significant moment.\n\"While the rover is still doing a lot of engineering checkouts, the minute the rover begins to move we can consider ourselves explorers on the surface of Mars,\" she told BBC News.\nIt's two weeks now since the one-tonne robot made its dramatic descent to the Red Planet.\nEngineers have spent the time commissioning the vehicle and its many complex systems, including its instruments and robotic arm.\nEveryone, however, has been waiting for Perseverance to start rolling. It happened on Thursday. The robot went forward a short way, spun on the spot 150 degrees, and then backed up a bit.\n\"You can see the wheel tracks that we left on Mars; I don't think I've ever been happier to see wheel tracks,\" said Perseverance mobility engineer Anais Zarifian.\n\"This is just a huge milestone for the mission and the mobility team. We've driven on Earth but driving on Mars - that's the ultimate goal, and just so many people have worked towards this very moment for years.\"\nPerseverance was put down in a near-equatorial crater called Jezero, to search for evidence of past life.\nThis will involve roving some 15km over the coming Martian year (roughly two Earth years).\nScientists want to reach a number of enticing rock formations in the crater that might retain a record of ancient biological activity.\nAmong these is what looks in satellite imagery to be a delta - a structure built up from the silt and sand dumped by a river as it enters a wider body of water. In Jezero's case, this wider body was very likely a crater-wide lake that existed billions of years ago.\nThe mission team is considering two possible routes to the delta, one of which would give scientists a preview by taking the robot past an isolated remnant.\n\"This (mound) is about a mile-and-a-half away from the rover. You can actually resolve layering within the rocks,\" said Dr Stack Morgan. \n\"In this outcrop, these resistant layered rocks were likely deposited by rivers flowing into the ancient Lake Jezero, and scientists on the team are hard at work trying to understand the significance and origin of rocks like this.\"\nAn immediate goal for Perseverance is its helicopter experiment. The rover brought a small chopper with it from Earth. \nThe vehicle will spend the next few weeks driving from its present location to a suitable stretch of terrain where the 2kg device called Ingenuity can be put safely on the ground. At present, the aircraft is slung beneath Perseverance's belly. \n\"We're still figuring out the possible flight zones,\" said Robert Hogg, Perseverance's deputy mission manager. \"We're taking navigation camera images, stereo images, to be able to analyse the terrain. And also the team's been looking at orbital images looking at possible flight zones. Long story short, we're still aiming for getting that done in the spring,\" he told reporters.\nPerseverance is the fastest rover Nasa has ever put on Mars. This is not so much because of the rate at which the wheels can turn (about 5cm/s), but rather because of advances in autonomous navigation.\nThe robot takes pictures to assess the road ahead. Previous vehicles had to stop while these images were processed onboard. Perseverance can do this on the fly.\n\"Perseverance can walk and chew gum at the same time,\" said Anais Zarifian.\nNasa announced on Friday that it had named Perseverance's landing site in Jezero Crater after the celebrated American science fiction writer Octavia E. Butler. The same honour was given to scifi author Ray Bradbury in 2012. His name will forever be associated with the touchdown location of the US space agency's previous rover, Curiosity."

      "text": "England's pubs have been deluged by people eager to book space from when beer gardens reopen on 12 April, industry group UK Hospitality has said.\nFrom that date, pubs are expected to be able to serve customers sitting outdoors.\nOne Leeds pub reported that it had taken in 700 bookings in just five hours this week.\nDemand has been so high that scammers have even taken to advertising fake pub bookings.\nPubs in most of the UK have been closed to sit-in customers during the latest lockdown, creating pent-up demand.\n\"Our members that can open outdoor areas have reported strong interest from customers, which is not surprising after such a long period of closure,\" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality.\nDuring the most recent lockdown, pubs in England have been allowed to serve takeaway food and non-alcoholic drinks until 23:00 GMT, but not takeaway alcohol. Pubs have been closed to customers wishing to sit in throughout the UK.\nIn Scotland, alcohol cannot currently be sold for outdoor consumption, while venues are closed on the mainland except for takeaways picked up outside the premises, although they are open on some of the islands. Hospitality venues on the mainland are set to reopen from about 26 April.\nIn Wales, pubs can sell takeaway drinks if licensed, and in Northern Ireland, takeaway off-sales must stop at 20:00 GMT.\nWhen the Water Lane Boathouse pub in Leeds announced on Wednesday that bookings were open, it had more than 700 in just five hours.\n\"Please bear with us as we work our way through them,\" it told customers on Twitter.\nThe rush to secure pub places when lockdown lifts prompted one fraudster to advertise fake bookings for a south London pub at \u00a315 a time.\nThe scammer posted an ad on Craigslist claiming: \"I have taken the liberty of procuring all the bookings at the Half Moon Pub in Herne Hill, from 12-close in the date range 12-18 April. \n\"Love it or hate it, now you must pay for it. \u00a315 per booking.\"\nThe ad has since been removed.\nAt the Wiremill, near Lingfield in Surrey, bookings have been flooding in, even though the pub has not advertised its reopening plans.\n\"We're almost fully booked for the first week of opening and have already got about 2,500 people booked in for the first two weeks, even though we haven't gone out to tell customers,\" says pub owner Tim Foster, who runs the four-strong Yummy Pubs chain.\n\"They've all come from inquiries, people asking when we'll be open and if they can book.\"\nThe pub used the time after the first lockdown to boost its outdoor area and double the capacity.\n\"We're now capable of seating 230 outside, or 160 with social distancing, but we'll limit bookings to around 50% capacity for the first couple of weeks to help us and our customers get used to it,\" Mr Foster said.\nPubs will be helped by not having to keep to a 22:00 curfew, as they were last time they were allowed to open, but bookings are coming in at a high level for every day, he said.\n\"We'll be full every day, not just the weekends. There's a huge pent-up demand - people are desperate to get out of their houses.\"\nOther pub chains have reported an uplift in bookings.\n\"We experienced a 300% spike in bookings when the roadmap was announced,\" said Zoe Cooper, senior marketing executive at the Inn Collection Group, which has 15 pubs in north-eastern and north-western England.\n\"We're looking forward to welcoming guests back.\"\nA spokesperson for Fuller Smith & Turner, which runs about 400 pubs around the country, said: \"People are clearly keen to get back to the pub and where we are opening our gardens and patios on 12 April, we've seen a high number of people pre-booking their tables.\n\"We just can't wait to welcome our customers back into our pubs. It's been a long time coming.\"\nMitchells & Butlers owns a number of national pub chains, including All Bar One, Browns, Castle and Harvester.\nIt said it would open 250-300 pubs in England on 12 April, and about 100 more from the Bank Holiday weekend at the end of the month. \n\"In pubs which do reopen, we'll be encouraging customers to use apps to both pre-book and then to order from their table,\" a spokesperson said.\nLast month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that he hoped that hospitality venues could reopen from 12 April for outdoor service only.\nThe reopenings depend on how the pandemic progresses in the next few weeks.\nBut if all goes as planned, people will be able to meet friends or family in beer gardens or to eat dinner outside as a group of six or a mixture of two households.\n\"Bookings will not be mandatory, although lots of venues will probably implement a booking system,\" said UK Hospitality's Ms Nicholls.\n\"Businesses will have their own systems in place for managing high demand, processing bookings and ensuring high levels of safety are met.\"\nOne chain where you won't need to book is Wetherspoons. It said this week it would reopen 394 of its 750 England pubs with outdoor spaces, including beer gardens, rooftops gardens and patios.\nBut the pub reopenings on 12 April are only a small part of the industry, pointed out Ms Nicholls.\n\"April isn't going to represent a reopening of any significance, or a reopening at all, for much of the sector. We need to remember that nearly 60% of hospitality businesses don't have outdoor areas and many that do only have small spaces.\"\nPubs and restaurants will be given the green light to offer indoor seating from 17 May, providing specific Covid conditions are met.\nFrom that date, indoor parties can be made up of a maximum of six people or two households of any size, while groups seated outside must be smaller than 30 people.\nFrom 21 June, all restrictions could be lifted."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

Officers had to tell him he had been in a crash, according to the documents. \nThe local resident who first found him has not been named.\nPolice filed the affidavit in order to try to obtain the SUV's data recorder for the investigation into what caused the crash. \"I believe the data will explain how/why the collision occurred,\"  Los Angeles County sheriff's Deputy Johann Schloegl wrote.\nPolice have previously said that Woods was driving alone along a downhill stretch of road that has a high frequency of accidents.\nHis car struck the central reservation, crossed into the opposite lane, rolled over several times and then plunged off the road and down an embankment.\nCounty Sheriff Alex Villanueva has said that it was \"purely an accident\".\nWoods suffered \"open fractures\" on the tibia and fibula of his lower right leg and a rod was inserted into the tibia. Injuries to his foot and ankle were stabilised with screws and pins."

It would cover nearly all hospital staff, but not GPs and dentists. \nIn addition, some staff whose pay band is being changed will get more than a 1% increase as a result of a previously agreed three-year pay deal. \nThe government says newly-qualified nurses got a 12% pay rise over the course of that three-year agreement. \nIn its submission to the panel, officials at the department argued the 1% rise would strike the \"right balance between pay and staff numbers\".\nThe panel is due make its own pay recommendations in early May, when ministers will make their final decision.\nSome 1.3 million public sector workers will see a pay freeze next year, with those earning less than \u00a324,000 guaranteed a pay rise of at least \u00a3250.\nA government spokesperson said 1% was a \"real-terms increase\", as the latest official inflation figure was 0.9%.\nBut Unite's national officer for health Colenzo Jarrett-Thorpe said it would turn into a \"pay cut in real terms\" if inflation rises over this year. \nRCN Chief Executive Dame Donna Kinnair has said the award shows ministers are \"dangerously out of touch with nursing staff, NHS workers and the public\".\nLabour's shadow health minister Rosena Allin-Khan said the recommended 1% pay increase was \"nothing short of an insult\".\nThe NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by the devolved administrations.\nThe Scottish government has announced that 2021-22 pay negotiations will be delayed until the summer because of the disruption caused by Covid. Staff have been given an \"interim\" pay rise of 1%, which will form part of the new settlement.\nNHS workers in Northern Ireland were promised a one-off \u00a3500 \"special recognition\" payment in January, following a similar announcement in Scotland.\nThe Welsh government has said it will not set a \"ceiling\" of 1% on NHS pay rises for 2021-22.\nIf you are an NHS worker, what are your views about your pay?

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nA growing number of unions are criticising the government over its planned 1% pay rise for NHS workers in England. The British Medical Association and other unions say their staff \"have literally kept the country alive for the past year\". Health Secretary Matt Hancock has defended the increase, saying it is what the government thinks is \"affordable\".\nThere are concerns that thousands of pupils could be forced to isolate unnecessarily because of inaccurate results from mass testing at secondary schools when they reopen in England from next week. The lateral flow tests that will be used are less accurate than the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique used by official testing centres. So, how will measures introduced at schools help? And how much does it matter if infection rates go up?  \nFrom 12 April, pubs in England are expected to be able to start serving customers sitting outdoors. This has sparked a rush for bookings, with one Leeds pub taking 700 reservations in just five hours. Meanwhile, one regular says he owes a local landlord a \"debt of gratitude\" after joining his bubble during lockdown.\nIn January, the Covid mortality rate in Burnley, Lancashire, was more than double the English average. For some families, they are not only having to cope with bereavement, but also the financial costs that come with burying a loved one.

      "text": "NHS worker Holly Ciesielczuk bought 75% of her first-floor flat in Redbridge in March 2019, under shared ownership.\nBut when she tried to borrow more money to increase her share of ownership a year later, she hit a stumbling block.\nFollowing their initial survey, her mortgage lender requested an EWS1 form, which can be obtained following an assessment of a building's external walls.\nThese were first developed to assess the potential financial impact of cladding on high-rise flats, after 72 people died at Grenfell Tower. \nTo begin with, only those who owned flats in tall buildings with dangerous flammable cladding were affected. \nBut after the government extended its advice to smaller properties in January 2020, mortgage lenders began demanding fire surveys from a much wider range of sellers. \nThe reason Holly was given by her lender for requesting one was that a balcony on the building had a wooden floor.\nHowever, she says her housing association would not agree to an EWS1 because, it said, the building was not high enough to meet the criteria.\nThe lender refused a mortgage without it, as did the next bank she tried. The combination of this and her partner's cancer diagnosis took its toll.\n\"I properly broke down. If I knew how much stress this was going to cause, I would never have bought my flat,\" she told the BBC.\nIn November, the government said an agreement had been reached with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), banking trade body UK Finance and the Building Societies Association. \nIt said this meant owners of flats in buildings without cladding would no longer need the form to sell or remortgage.\nBut mortgage lenders said they \"did not consent\" to the announcement. \nProblems are still being encountered - including by Holly.\nWhen she contacted her lender after the November announcement, their position had not altered. \"I was so hopeful, so excited - but then so dismayed when I was told, 'You still need an EWS1 form.'\"\nFollowing a consultation on the requirement for EWS1 checks, RICS plans to release updated guidance. It's understood this could be published as soon as next week.\nIt will be aimed at narrowing down the number of EWS1 requests, but there's no obligation for lenders to follow it.\n\"Naively or optimistically, I hope the guidance will provide clarity about whether I will be able to get a mortgage,\" Holly says. \nEven when building management agree to having checks done, it can be a lengthy process.\nAlex Cross from Berkshire was excited to find what he thought was his \"perfect\" first flat, yet he too has been held up.\nWhen he was asked to obtain an EWS1 form to secure a mortgage, the property management company refused to help.\nThey said they owned 4,000 blocks, but only 48 inspections had been booked that financial year.\n\"At that rate, it would take decades to obtain the required information,\" Alex points out.\nHe eventually found one bank that did not require the full survey, but asked a set of questions about the building's safety, which the property developer would not answer.\nRebecca Frisina and her family were hoping to move to a larger property, but have been unable to sell their flat. Although they have found a buyer, the mortgage provider has requested a EWS1 form for their property. \nThe management company which owns the freehold eventually agreed to pursue the safety checks. However, it isn't clear when they might take place.\nRebecca's family are now living with her parents and their buyer has moved into rented accommodation. \n\"We have asked for a rough estimated timeline and they have refused to answer us,\" she says. \"It's been a nightmare.\"\nAndrew Montlake is managing director of mortgage broker Coreco and chairman of the Association of Mortgage Intermediaries. He says one of the first things his team now ask about a property is whether there is cladding and whether an EWS1 has been produced.\n\"There are cases I'm sure where the buildings are probably OK. However, where you're dealing with such a serious subject, surely it's better to be safe than sorry. If the valuers aren't sure, they're going to cover themselves\n\"If there's a risk of a leaseholder having to pay repair bills in future, that could have an impact on affordability.\"\nUK Finance also pointed out that some buildings might have cladding that is not obvious.\nThe fee for an EWS1 survey can be up to \u00a350,000, depending on the size and style of the property.\nIt's estimated that there are only 300 chartered fire engineers in the UK who can carry out the survey, which is believed to be a cause of delays.\nA social media campaign, #EndOurCladdingScandal, has attracted support from a wide range of homeowners, including those subject to EWS1 requirements.\n\"RICS and the government can offer as much guidance as they want, but the truth is the genie is out of the bottle - and mortgage lenders are spooked,\" a spokesperson for the campaign said.\nThe Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said in a statement: \"The EWS1 is not a government form, nor a legal requirement, and we're disappointed this is being asked for in some cases where it's not needed.\n\"If a form is genuinely needed, we are providing \u00a3700,000 of funding to train up to 2,000 more surveyors to speed up the process and get through the backlog.\""

      "text": "Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has listed his first ever tweet for sale, with bids reaching $2.5m (\u00a31.8m).\n\"Just setting up my twttr,\" the post, sent from Mr Dorsey's account in March 2006, reads.\nIt will be sold as a non-fungible token (NFT) - a unique digital certificate that states who owns a photo, video or other form of online media.\nBut the post will remain publicly available on Twitter even after it has been auctioned off.\nThe buyer will receive a certificate, digitally signed and verified by Mr Dorsey, as well as the metadata of the original tweet. The data will include information such as the time the tweet was posted and its text contents.\nMost of this information, however, is already publicly available.\nThe tweet was listed for sale on 'Valuables by Cent'  - a tweets marketplace that was launched three months ago. \nIn a post on the site, the platform's founders compare the buying of a tweet to that of a more traditional autograph or piece of memorabilia.\n\"Owning any digital content can be a financial investment,\" it says. \"[It can] hold sentimental value. Like an autograph on a baseball card, the NFT itself is the creator's autograph on the content, making it scarce, unique, and valuable.\"\nTweets are the latest digital assets to be monetised through so-called non-fungible tokens.\nNFTs use the blockchain, the same distributed database technology underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, to create unique certificates of ownership of any kind of digital goods.\nWhile the idea that digital artists can earn an income by offering buyers some sense of ownership has its attractions, the \"sale\" of tweets will leave many scratching their heads.\nValuables, the platform marketing Mr Dorsey's tweet, seems to recognise that the concept will leave people bemused. In its FAQ it explains \"owning any digital content can... hold sentimental value and create a relationship between collector and creator\".\nMost of us might think that this is a high price to pay for a relationship with the Twitter boss. But given the feverish and often irrational state of any kind of cryptocurrency related market, maybe the buyer is betting there'll be someone along soon to take the tweet off their hands at an even higher price.\nMeanwhile, on the basis that if you can't beat them, join them, I put one of my tweets up for sale. It was about this story - and I've just accepted a bid of $1.  That might sound modest but seeing as I've got 72,466 other tweets available it could be the start of something big\u2026.\nOld offers for Mr Dorsey's tweet suggest that it was first put up for sale in December, but the listing gained more attention after he tweeted a link to it on Friday. That tweet has since been shared thousands of times.\nWithin minutes of the tweet being posted, bids reached more than $88,000.\nBut they skyrocketed on Saturday, with a bid of $1.5m being usurped by a $2m offer at around 15:30 GMT. \nAccording to Valuables by Cent's terms, 95% of a tweet's sale will go to the original creator with the remainder going to the website."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A mystery person in the UK infected with the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil has now been traced.\nLast week, it was announced that six cases of the P.1 variant had been found in the UK - but the identity of one of the cases was unknown.\nThe person, who lives in Croydon, has been traced, as have their contacts.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the person \"stayed at home\" and there was no sign of any onward transmission - but local testing is being rolled out.\nScientists say the variant appears to be more contagious and there are concerns vaccines may not be as effective against it.\nBut Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said it hoped vaccines would have a strong impact on reducing hospitalisations and deaths in cases of the new variant.\nNews that the Brazil variant had been found in the UK was released last Sunday. Three cases were found in England, and separately three in Scotland.\nThe three cases in Scotland were all oil workers who were returning to their families from Brazil, via Paris and London. Health officials have been trying to trace all the passengers who were on their flight from Heathrow to Aberdeen.\nIn England, two of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire who tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February.\nThe third case in England - now confirmed to be in Croydon - was unknown for several days after he or she failed to register their test properly.\nDr Hopkins said the person was finally identified when they called the NHS 111 number, after officials had spent days contacting potential households. \nThe person lived in a household that had recently returned from Brazil and all of them had quarantined at home, she added.\nMr Hancock said contact-tracers had worked \"flat out\" to narrow the search.\n\"The best evidence is this person in question stayed at home and there's no sign that there's been any onward transmission but as a precaution we're putting more testing in in Croydon, where they live, to minimise risk of spread,\" he said.\nEarlier this week, Mr Hancock said work was under way to tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of the new strains.\nDr Hopkins said there was not yet data to show whether the vaccine was effective against this variant - but there was some data for the variant from South Africa \"and we expect that it should at least perform in a similar way\".\n\"And therefore we think that it's likely there may be some reduction in risk of transmission, or reducing the risk of transmission, but we at least hope at the moment that it will have a strong impact in reducing hospitalisations and deaths.\n\"We do need to wait for studies to come out from South America and in particular Brazil, and those will come but it will take weeks rather than days I'm afraid.\"\nThe variant has been designated \"of concern\" because it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa.\nOne of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade some of the immunity people may have already built against Covid.\nPreliminary data from Manaus - the Brazilian city hit hard by this P.1 variant - suggested the variant could be up to twice as transmissible as earlier Covid.\nBut experts said this should not be used to predict what might happen in the UK.\nOne of the lead researchers said it was unlikely P.1 would quickly take off in Britain when only six cases had been identified and these were being closely monitored.\nMeanwhile, two-fifths of all adults in the UK have now had their first dose of the vaccine, Mr Hancock also said at Friday's press conference.\nHe said the fall in the number of deaths was accelerating - down 41% compared with last week - which suggested the vaccination programme was working. \n\"What this all shows is that the link from cases to hospitalisations and then to deaths that had been unbreakable before the vaccine - that link is now breaking,\" he said.\nLatest government figures show the total number of people who have had their first dose of vaccine has now reached 21,358,815, while the number who have had their second dose has topped one million.\nThere have been another 5,947 cases announced and a further 236 people recorded as having died within 28 days of testing positive."

      "tags": "Yazidis,Pope Francis,Roman Catholic Church,Middle East Christians,Iraq,Christianity,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Pope Francis has condemned extremism in the name of religion on a historic visit to Iraq where he discussed the plight of the Christian minority.\nHostility, extremism and violence are \"betrayals of religion\" he told an inter-faith prayer service. \nIraq has been wracked by religious and sectarian violence, both against minorities and between Shia and Sunni Muslims too. \nPope Francis also visited one of Shia Islam's most powerful figures.\nReceiving the head of the Roman Catholic Church at his home in the holy city of Najaf, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said Christians should be able to live in peace and security like all other Iraqis.\nThe meeting was seen as a highly symbolic moment in the Pope's visit, which is his first international trip since the start of the coronavirus pandemic more than a year ago, and the first ever papal visit to Iraq.\nCovid-19 and security fears have made this his riskiest trip yet.\nThe 84-year-old leader of the Catholic Church earlier told reporters that he had felt \"duty-bound\" to make the \"emblematic\" journey, which will see him visit several sites over four days in Iraq.\nHe delivered his message at the site of the ancient city of Ur, held to be the birthplace of the Prophet Abraham, who is revered in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\nAn inter-faith service brought together representatives of Iraq's religions, including Shia, Sunni, Christian and Yazidi clerics.  \n\"We believers cannot be silent when terrorism abuses religion,\" the Pope said.\n\"Indeed, we are called unambiguously to dispel all misunderstandings. Let us not allow the light of heaven to be overshadowed by the clouds of hatred.\"\nHe singled out the suffering of the Yazidi community which had \"mourned the deaths of many men and witnessed thousands of women, girls and children kidnapped, sold as slaves, subjected to physical violence and forced conversions\".\nLater on Saturday, Pope Francis celebrated Mass at St Joseph's Cathedral in central Baghdad. Security was tight with special forces deployed in the area and concrete barriers erected outside the church.\nGrand Ayatollah Sistani is spiritual leader of millions of Shia Muslims, the dominant religious community in Iraq.\nAudiences with the reclusive 90-year-old are rare but he received the Pope for around 50 minutes, the pair talking without face masks.\nHe \"affirmed his concern that Christian citizens should live like all Iraqis in peace and security, and with their full constitutional rights\", his office said.\nPope Francis thanked the ayatollah for speaking up \"in defence of those most vulnerable and persecuted\" amid the violence and hardships of Iraq's recent history, the Holy See press spokesman said.\nThe Shia leader's message of peace, he said, affirmed \"the sacredness of human life and the importance of the unity of the Iraqi people\".\nThis has been a meeting years in the making: an encounter between the leader of the Catholic Church and one of the most powerful figures in Shia Islam: Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. \nFor a pope passionate about reaching out to other faiths, the meeting is arguably the most symbolic moment of his visit to Iraq. \nThe dwindling Christian community here has suffered violence at the hands of Sunni extremists but some also fear the presence of Shia armed groups - and the cleric is seen as a voice of moderation. \nThe Pope visited Ur, the ancient birthplace of the Prophet Abraham, hoping that the biblical figure revered by Christians, Muslims and Jews, can spur reconciliation today.\nOne of the world's oldest Christian communities has seen its numbers plummet over the last two decades from 1.4 million to about 250,000, less than 1% of the country's population.\nMany have fled abroad to escape the violence that has plagued the country since the US-led invasion in 2003 that ousted Saddam Hussein.\nTens of thousands were also displaced when militants from the Sunni Muslim Islamic State (IS) group overran northern Iraq in 2014, destroying their historic churches, seizing their property, and giving them the choice to pay a tax, convert, leave or face death.\nA US state department report on religious freedom in Iraq in 2019 found that Christians, as well as Sunni Muslims, complained of harassment at checkpoints by Shia security forces and some discrimination in education.\nOn his arrival on Friday, the Pope said Iraq's Christian community should have a more prominent role as citizens with full rights, freedoms and responsibilities.\nThe last Christians in Iraq?\nDue to security concerns and a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections, the Pope will have limited exposure to the public.\nHe has had two shots of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, and his entourage will have been inoculated, but there are fears the trip could become a super-spreader event given the large crowds expected.\nWhen he arrived on Friday, the Pope was seen to have a pronounced limp, suggesting that his sciatica condition continues to bother him.\nOn Sunday, the pontiff will visit Mosul, where he will say prayers in Church Square for the victims of the war with IS, which left tens of thousands of civilians dead.\nLater, he is scheduled to lead Mass at a football stadium in Irbil in the north, which up to 10,000 people are expected to attend. \nThe Pope will also visit nearby Qaraqosh, where Christians have returned since the defeat of IS in 2017.\nAbout 10,000 Iraqi Security Forces personnel are being deployed to protect the Pope during his visit, while round-the-clock curfews are also being imposed to limit the spread of coronavirus.\nSome Shia militant groups have reportedly opposed the visit, suggesting the tour amounts to Western interference in the country's affairs. \nCorrection 29 March 2021: An earlier version of this article stated that Iraq's Christian minority has been \"long terrorised\" by Shia armed groups. This was amended in the hours after publication to instead make clear that the community has suffered violence at the hands of Sunni extremists, while noting that some also fear the presence of Shia armed groups."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": " The rate at which coronavirus infection is falling in the UK - as measured by the R number - has continued to level off. \nThe latest R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sage, is between 0.7 and 0.9, up slightly from the week before.\nIt means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine other people.\nThe R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. \nR is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average.\nMeasles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity. \nThat means, on average, one person will spread measles to 15 others. \nCoronavirus - known officially as Sars-CoV-2 - would have a reproduction number of about three if no action was taken to stop it spreading.\nYou can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards.  \nData - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading. \nIf the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases keeps increasing.\nBut if the R number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, because not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.\nGovernments everywhere want to force the R number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one.\nThe R number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes or as immunity develops. \nMathematical modellers at Imperial College London attempted to track how the number changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced in spring of 2020. \nBefore any measures came in, the R number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one. \nAlthough the R number across the UK is now between 0.7 and 0.9, there are regional differences.\nScotland's estimated R number is between 0.8 and 1.0, up slightly on the previous week.\nIn Wales the number is between 0.6 and 0.9 - while in Northern Ireland it remains between 0.75 and 0.95.\nIn England, the number is risen slightly to between 0.8 and 1.0.\nThe R number is one of the big three.\nAnother is severity - some people have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems. But coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly. \nThe last is the number of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases.\nA vaccination programme, like the one currently under way in the UK, is another way to bring down the reproduction number.\nA coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one."

The judge ruled the letter was \"personal and private\" and Meghan had a \"reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private\".\nThe publisher's lawyers applied for permission to appeal earlier this week but Lord Justice Warby refused.\nIn Friday's ruling the judge Lord Justice Warby said the MoS must print a single statement on the front page, referring readers to a further statement on page three.\n\"The defendant devoted a very considerable amount of space to the infringing articles, which it continued to publish for over two years,\" he said.\n\"It has devoted a very considerable number of further column inches, and many hundreds if not thousands of words, to coverage of earlier stages of this litigation and commentary upon them.\n\"The wording sought is modest by comparison and factual in nature.\"\nThe MailOnline must publish the statement for a week with a link to his full judgment.\nThe judge also granted Meghan a declaration that ANL \"misused her private information and infringed her copyright\".\nAlthough the judge found the publication of the letter infringed the duchess's copyright, there will still be a trial to decide whether Meghan is the exclusive owner of copyright in all parts of the letter, or whether any other person owns a share.\nThere will also be further hearings to determine whether the duchess is entitled to any profits or financial remedies relating to her claim."

On Monday, restrictions in England will begin to be eased as many pupils return to school. \nDeaths from coronavirus have fallen by 41% in a week, while hospital admissions have seen their fastest-ever fall, the health secretary said on Friday.\nMr Hancock said the average number of cases was 6,685 per day, the lowest since late September.\nMeanwhile, an infectious disease expert said the \"next few weeks are going to be crucial\" for keeping infection rates down with the full reopening of schools. \nDr Mike Tildesley, a member of the government's SPI-M modelling advisory panel, told Times Radio the R number - which shows the rate at which coronavirus is spreading - would rise when children go back to their classrooms, but the continuing progress of vaccinations would cause it to reduce. \nThere are concerns about getting parental consent for Covid tests ahead of pupils' return to schools. A survey found more than half of secondary head teachers had faced difficulties getting parental approval so far. \nQuestions have been raised too about the accuracy of the rapid lateral flow tests being used, while critics of masks for older pupils say they will harm learning."

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Brazil coronavirus variant now found in the UK appears more contagious and may evade immunity provided by past infection, scientists say.\nExperiences from Manaus - the Amazonian city hit hard by the P.1 variant - suggest it could be up to twice as transmissible as earlier Covid there, the first detailed study suggests.\nThe preliminary work puts the chance of reinfection at between 25% and 60%.\nBut experts say this should not be used to predict what may happen in the UK.  \nIndeed, one of the lead researchers said it was unlikely P.1 would quickly take off in Britain when only six cases had been identified and these were being closely monitored. \nInfectious diseases expert Prof Ester Sabino, from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, said: \"You need many introductions [of a virus] to start an epidemic. Six is very few. I would say if you take care and do contact tracing, this is going to decrease.\"\nProfessor Sharon Peacock, who is director of the UK's centre leading on genetic testing of coronavirus, said: \"We are taking appropriate action. These are very interesting and important findings for Brazil, but how they relate to the UK is yet to be determined.\"\nUpdating MPs on the six cases of the Brazil variant seen in the UK, Health Secretary Hancock said: \"We have no information to suggest the variant has spread further.\"\nOne of the six people affected has not yet been identified, but the search has narrowed from the whole country down to 379 households in the south-east of England.\nMr Hancock said: \"We're contacting each one.\"\nThe researchers have been tracking coronavirus in Brazil for nearly a year now. Manaus, like many other regions around the world, encountered a large first wave in the spring of 2020. \nLots of people were infected with the original version of the virus at that time, with blood test results suggesting as many as three-quarters of the population getting some degree of protection or immunity from this exposure. \nDespite this, people in Manaus were hit badly by another wave of coronavirus in the winter. \nThe research team from Brazil and Imperial College London have been studying the genetic makeup of coronavirus in some of those who were infected between November and December, as well as modelling the pandemic outcomes. \nThey say the P.1 variant probably emerged in early November, dominated and spread quickly, and caused many reinfections. \nThe data is preliminary, but fits with what experts have suspected - that some of these new variants of coronavirus the world is seeing are more infectious and can evade some of the immunity people may have already built against Covid. \nThis raises questions about how well current vaccines, which were designed around earlier versions of the virus, might work and how countries can ease restrictions without case levels rising too high.  \nWork is already under way to redesign or tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of these new \"variants of concern\", although existing ones should still provide some protection, particularly against severe disease. \nUpdated vaccines could be ready within months, meaning the UK would have millions of doses ready to give people a booster shot before next winter to make sure the population is protected. \nThe priority, along with mass vaccination, is to keep cases low to reduce the chance of new and emerging variants from spreading. \nMr Hancock said: \"Our current vaccines have not yet been studied against this variant and we're working to understand what impact it might have, but we do know that this variant has caused significant challenges in Brazil, so we're doing all we can to stop the spread of this new variant in the UK, to analyse its effects and to develop an updated vaccine that works on all these variants of concern and protect the progress that we've made as a nation.\""

      "text": "Calls have been made for specialist help in Wales to treat an incurable, life-limiting condition which takes an average of six years to diagnose.\nAn estimated 2,000 people in Wales are affected by lupus.\nCampaigner Wendy Diment said centres of excellence would \"extend the lives\" of lupus patients in Wales.\nA Welsh Government spokeswoman said health boards could refer people for further treatment if it was not available locally.\nThere is currently no cure for lupus and it occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body.\n\"Many GPs and even consultant rheumatologists have limited experience in diagnosing, treating and monitoring patients with lupus, which means that specialist care is often required,\" said Paul Howard, chief executive of charity Lupus UK.\nHe has called for investment in services - but until then, wants rules over cross-border referrals relaxed, so care in England's nine centres of excellence can be accessed by people in Wales.\nResearch suggests people with lupus in Wales were twice as likely to be refused specialist help than in the rest of the UK.\nFor Mrs Diment, 46, the crippling fatigue and headaches would often leave her confined to her bed in tears.\n\"Some days I couldn't get out of my pyjamas. If I had a shower, I'd need a lie down. It takes a long time to get used to it, it's overwhelming and frustrating,\" she said.\nMrs Diment, from Tenby, Pembrokeshire, believes the 'trigger' for her condition was the birth of her third child in 2008. \nAt first she put the symptoms down to tiredness, though she had to quit her job as a legal executive, aged 35.\nIt was not until four years later that a chance occurrence led to her diagnosis for the rare autoimmune disease.\n\"I became quite unwell in 2013, and had horrific rashes [another symptom of lupus] on my chest, feet and face. It seemed quite bizarre,\" she said. \n\"Steroids cleared it up and I forgot about it. But in October of that year, I was in bed at 7pm suffering from severe fatigue, when my husband watched a television programme on a new drug for a rare condition. \n\"He woke me up and said 'lupus'. It was the first time I'd heard of it.\"\nSource: Lupus UK\nShe was diagnosed with a type of lupus that year, but the rashes that had appeared made her believe it was a different variant of the complex condition she was suffering from.\nIt would take another four years - and paying to see a specialist in London - until her suspicions were proved right.\nWhile she acknowledges things have improved since the 1960s when it was treated as \"a terminal illness with survival not great past five years\", Mrs Diment still sees \"a bundle of prejudices\" around it. \nSome 90% of patients are women and it is sometimes treated in relation to mental health or dismissed as \"women saying they're tired\", she added.\nBy taking 15 tablets a day, Mrs Diment is able to now focus on essentials, such as preparing meals for her children, as well as campaigning and running a support group for 50 other sufferers.\nShe wants to see centres of excellence established in north and south Wales to employ specialists, researchers and nurses to help with health and lifestyle.\n\"I get frustrated how many ask for referrals to England or second opinions on their diagnosis,\" she said.\n\"They are so poorly and unwell, they don't question the system, just accept it as their fate. \n\"In England it is a specialism, so they have improved outcomes.\n\"People in Wales would just like reassurances they are getting the best care which can extend their lives.\"\nHer local Senedd Member, Paul Davies, said: \"I hope the Welsh Government will at least commit to looking at establishing centres of excellence in Wales, so people here have access to the same level of support and services that patients do in England.\"\nAmong those waiting for more specialised care is Les James, from Carmarthen.\nThe condition is far less common in men and Mr James has not been diagnosed by a doctor after nine years. \nHowever, he has shown many of the symptoms which can leave him in extreme pain for months at a time and is being helped by a lupus support group in west Wales. \nHe was forced to retire ten years ago, aged 53, and was given medication for a variety of conditions, including antiphospholipid syndrome - which also affects the immune system.\n\"For six months in 2019, I couldn't walk. My feet were so painful, it was like putting them on a cobbly beach,\" said Mr James, who takes 165 grams of morphine twice a day.\n\"Eventually, it went away. But I regularly get pains in my toes and heels.\"\nCambridge University research associate Melanie Sloan - who has lupus - is leading a team surveying attitudes of patients.\nOf 236 respondents, 43% of those in Wales said they had been refused a referral to see a specialist, compared to 21% in the rest of the UK.\nCampaign group Fair Treatment for the Women of Wales said there is a lack of awareness of the \"huge impact\" and lack of investment in specialist services.\n\"Within our patient community, we hear far too often of women's symptoms being downplayed or not adequately managed and this has significant consequences for patients' long-term health,\" a spokeswoman added.\nThe Welsh Government spokeswoman said it recognised the impact lupus can have on people's health and lives.\n\"We will be consulting about musculoskeletal conditions, including lupus, and their treatment,\" a spokeswoman added. \n\"We will continue to work with relevant organisations, including Lupus UK and Cymru Versus Arthritis, to improve treatment for people affected.\"\nAndrew Carruthers, director of operations at the Hywel Dda health board in west Wales, said it holds lupus clinics conducted by consultant rheumatologists.\nPatients who cannot be managed within the health board area are referred to tertiary centres of excellence as clinically required, he added.\nMr Carruthers said: \"We have participated in the British Society for Rheumatology lupus audit which showed the health board was above average for both the Welsh and UK average for most of the standards set out and we are committed to improving on these standards to further enhance the care for patients with lupus.\""

      "tags": "Schools,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Schools reopen to all pupils next week in England - the first part of the UK where this will happen. It is a crucial step for children and wider society in the route out of lockdown.\nMasks are to be worn by secondary school children in classes, while mass testing is being introduced. But will these steps be a help? And does it even matter if infection rates go up?\nTo reduce the risk of spread of the virus, the government has introduced mass testing. All secondary school pupils will be offered three tests on their return before being asked to carry them out twice a week at home. \nThese will be rapid lateral flow tests that provide a quick result on the spot, unlike the ones that are carried out in official testing centres - known as PCR tests - that are sent off to labs. The rapid tests are less accurate - they may pick up only between half to three-quarters of positive cases, but given they are being used to spot cases before people develop symptoms or for those who do not develop symptoms, the government is adamant they have an important role.\nThe problem is they can result in a false positive, telling people they are infected when they are not. Research suggests this happens one to three times for every 1,000 tests carried out.\nOne safeguard would be to get anyone who tests positive to then take a PCR test to confirm it. This is being done for tests that are done in people's homes, but not for those carried out in school.\nAssuming most pupils take up the option of the tests, that could result in thousands of pupils and their close contacts being asked to isolate unnecessarily.\nThat may be a price worth paying if it was spotting many more positives, but the testing done in schools in recent weeks, of pupils and staff who have been attending, shows the number testing positive is now at the lower estimate for the false positivity rate.\nBirmingham University biostatistician Prof Jon Deeks says given the low detection rates that are being seen it is \"absolutely clear\" many of those getting positive test results next week will be false positives.\n\"Any testing system is a trade-off between benefits and harms,\" he says. \"My concern is that it will actually cause more harm than good.\"\nConcerns have been raised by the Royal Statistical Society, too. Prof Sheila Bird, a member of the society's Covid-19 Task Force, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme false positives were \"very likely\" and that every positive lateral flow test should have a PCR test to confirm it.\nThe second key change - and the most controversial - is the recommendation of masks in classes for secondary age schoolchildren. Previously pupils were just expected to wear them in communal areas, like corridors.\nCritics say it will harm learning and is unfair to expect children to wear masks for hours on end. But others have argued it is an absolute necessity and should have been introduced in primary schools too.\nThe problem is the benefit of mask-wearing is difficult to quantify. Recent evidence from the government advisory group Sage acknowledges this, although it says there is evidence that worn correctly they will have a \"small but significant\" impact on transmission by preventing the wearer from spreading the virus if they are unknowingly infected.\nThis is mainly derived from lab experiments though, and much will depend on how they are used, it says. Will teenagers adhere to the best practice on mask-wearing for hours on end?\nIt is for this reason some experts say they would have liked to see a proper trial in schools to measure the impact. \"We always do this for a medical intervention - there are lots of things that work in the lab but not in the real world,\" says Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at Nottingham University. \n\"But for some reason we don't do this with non-medical interventions. It would be complicated, but this would be the ideal opportunity to do it - and help us decide if they are useful or make matters worse.\"\nWithout a trial, the fear is it will be difficult for the government to stop the practice. If cases remain low, it could be argued masks have made the difference and if they creep up, the case could be made they would have gone up more without mask-wearing. The move could, in other words, open a can of worms.\nBut it is a risk ministers seem happy to tackle. The government insists the use of masks is \"temporary and precautionary\" - and  will be reviewed at Easter. Or, in the words of one scientific adviser: \"We know it's not going to make much difference, but if it helps us get schools back, it's worth the hassle when it's dropped.\" \nIt is well-established that children are at incredibly low risk from the virus, while research by the Office for National Statistics has shown that teachers are at no higher risk of infection than other working-age people.\nWhat role will schools play in the wider spread of the virus though remains more open for debate. Children, after all, come home and mix with their families. \nGovernment advisers say schools have not been a key driver of infections so far. This much can be seen from the impact of the second national lockdown in England in November when infection levels fell despite schools being open. \nBut this was before the new UK variant became dominant. Modelling has suggested reopening schools now could be enough to drive the R number above one, which would lead to a growing epidemic.\nMinisters have already indicated this matters less than it used to because the vaccination programme has begun to break the link between infection rates and serious illness and death - the R number is not one of their tests for slowing the pace of lifting lockdown. \nDr Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St Andrews, says it is impossible to disentangle exactly what impact schools have - although she says all the evidence suggests the school outbreaks that have happened have mainly been small.\n\"The evidence of harms of closing schools is clear. They should be open as default unless there is very strong evidence that closing them will have a significant impact on hospitalisations and mortality.\"\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "England's pubs have been deluged by people eager to book space from when beer gardens reopen on 12 April, industry group UK Hospitality has said.\nFrom that date, pubs are expected to be able to serve customers sitting outdoors.\nOne Leeds pub reported that it had taken in 700 bookings in just five hours this week.\nDemand has been so high that scammers have even taken to advertising fake pub bookings.\nPubs in most of the UK have been closed to sit-in customers during the latest lockdown, creating pent-up demand.\n\"Our members that can open outdoor areas have reported strong interest from customers, which is not surprising after such a long period of closure,\" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality.\nDuring the most recent lockdown, pubs in England have been allowed to serve takeaway food and non-alcoholic drinks until 23:00 GMT, but not takeaway alcohol. Pubs have been closed to customers wishing to sit in throughout the UK.\nIn Scotland, alcohol cannot currently be sold for outdoor consumption, while venues are closed on the mainland except for takeaways picked up outside the premises, although they are open on some of the islands. Hospitality venues on the mainland are set to reopen from about 26 April.\nIn Wales, pubs can sell takeaway drinks if licensed, and in Northern Ireland, takeaway off-sales must stop at 20:00 GMT.\nWhen the Water Lane Boathouse pub in Leeds announced on Wednesday that bookings were open, it had more than 700 in just five hours.\n\"Please bear with us as we work our way through them,\" it told customers on Twitter.\nThe rush to secure pub places when lockdown lifts prompted one fraudster to advertise fake bookings for a south London pub at \u00a315 a time.\nThe scammer posted an ad on Craigslist claiming: \"I have taken the liberty of procuring all the bookings at the Half Moon Pub in Herne Hill, from 12-close in the date range 12-18 April. \n\"Love it or hate it, now you must pay for it. \u00a315 per booking.\"\nThe ad has since been removed.\nAt the Wiremill, near Lingfield in Surrey, bookings have been flooding in, even though the pub has not advertised its reopening plans.\n\"We're almost fully booked for the first week of opening and have already got about 2,500 people booked in for the first two weeks, even though we haven't gone out to tell customers,\" says pub owner Tim Foster, who runs the four-strong Yummy Pubs chain.\n\"They've all come from inquiries, people asking when we'll be open and if they can book.\"\nThe pub used the time after the first lockdown to boost its outdoor area and double the capacity.\n\"We're now capable of seating 230 outside, or 160 with social distancing, but we'll limit bookings to around 50% capacity for the first couple of weeks to help us and our customers get used to it,\" Mr Foster said.\nPubs will be helped by not having to keep to a 22:00 curfew, as they were last time they were allowed to open, but bookings are coming in at a high level for every day, he said.\n\"We'll be full every day, not just the weekends. There's a huge pent-up demand - people are desperate to get out of their houses.\"\nOther pub chains have reported an uplift in bookings.\n\"We experienced a 300% spike in bookings when the roadmap was announced,\" said Zoe Cooper, senior marketing executive at the Inn Collection Group, which has 15 pubs in north-eastern and north-western England.\n\"We're looking forward to welcoming guests back.\"\nA spokesperson for Fuller Smith & Turner, which runs about 400 pubs around the country, said: \"People are clearly keen to get back to the pub and where we are opening our gardens and patios on 12 April, we've seen a high number of people pre-booking their tables.\n\"We just can't wait to welcome our customers back into our pubs. It's been a long time coming.\"\nMitchells & Butlers owns a number of national pub chains, including All Bar One, Browns, Castle and Harvester.\nIt said it would open 250-300 pubs in England on 12 April, and about 100 more from the Bank Holiday weekend at the end of the month. \n\"In pubs which do reopen, we'll be encouraging customers to use apps to both pre-book and then to order from their table,\" a spokesperson said.\nLast month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that he hoped that hospitality venues could reopen from 12 April for outdoor service only.\nThe reopenings depend on how the pandemic progresses in the next few weeks.\nBut if all goes as planned, people will be able to meet friends or family in beer gardens or to eat dinner outside as a group of six or a mixture of two households.\n\"Bookings will not be mandatory, although lots of venues will probably implement a booking system,\" said UK Hospitality's Ms Nicholls.\n\"Businesses will have their own systems in place for managing high demand, processing bookings and ensuring high levels of safety are met.\"\nOne chain where you won't need to book is Wetherspoons. It said this week it would reopen 394 of its 750 England pubs with outdoor spaces, including beer gardens, rooftops gardens and patios.\nBut the pub reopenings on 12 April are only a small part of the industry, pointed out Ms Nicholls.\n\"April isn't going to represent a reopening of any significance, or a reopening at all, for much of the sector. We need to remember that nearly 60% of hospitality businesses don't have outdoor areas and many that do only have small spaces.\"\nPubs and restaurants will be given the green light to offer indoor seating from 17 May, providing specific Covid conditions are met.\nFrom that date, indoor parties can be made up of a maximum of six people or two households of any size, while groups seated outside must be smaller than 30 people.\nFrom 21 June, all restrictions could be lifted."

We will continue to engage with Police Scotland and the club.\"\nSteven Gerrard's side are within one point of their first Premiership title in 10 years, having ended their city rivals' Celtic's hopes of a 10th championship win in a row.\nFormer Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson said he could \"understand\" the emotions that led some Rangers fans \"to do daft things\" and break lockdown guidelines to celebrate with their team.\nHe said: \"It is a little disappointing when we consider what's going round the country, but these fans have been starved of success for so long and they just want some way to thank the team and Steven Gerrard.\n\"Obviously it's not right to do it in the numbers they did and it can't be excused, but we all do silly things when we get caught up in celebrations.\"\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has previously criticised fans for gathering in large numbers.\nAfter Celtic fans took part in a protest outside the club's stadium in November, she said: \"We have advice against gatherings and every day I stand up here and say avoid crowded places.\n\"We have a limit on people coming together outside... so it stands to reason any group of people that are gathering together in a crowd are putting themselves and others at risk.\n\"Whether it's football fans, rugby fans, any other kind of sport fans or just people in general, please don't do it because right now, in the middle of this pandemic, it is a risky thing to do that puts you and other people at risk.\""

      "text": "The current lockdown has been a success but the UK is \"not out of the woods\" yet, the head of the Office for National Statistics has warned.\nNational statistician Prof Sir Ian Diamond said there had been \"very strong reductions\" in case numbers. \nBut in the north-east and east of England the decline has \"flattened off, potentially\", he told the BBC. \nOther areas, like the South West and South East, have continued to see cases decline, Prof Diamond said. \nThe Office for National Statistics conducts a survey of thousands of households to gauge the spread of coronavirus. \nThere has been a decline in the number of cases in the UK, with the most recent figures, reported on Saturday, showing a further 6,040 positive tests. \nThe number of deaths in the UK has also been falling, with a further 158 within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test reported in the latest government figures.\nThis has coincided with the success of the UK's vaccination programme, which has seen two-fifths of adults receive a first dose so far. \nLockdowns have been in place across the UK since early January. On Monday, restrictions in England will begin to be eased as many pupils return to school. \nProf Diamond said: \"I think this lockdown has been a success but at the same time, while we have seen major reductions, we are still relatively high.\n\"I'm in very much the view that we should do everything we can not to blow it nationally.\n\"We have done fantastically well in the last couple of months but we are not completely out of the woods yet.\"\nHe added that it was \"very difficult\" to work out the difference between the impact of the lockdown and the vaccination scheme, but it was clear both were working in reducing the number of cases. \nDeaths from coronavirus have fallen by 41% in a week, while hospital admissions have seen their fastest ever fall, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Friday.\nHe said the average number of cases was 6,685 per day, the lowest since late September.\nMeanwhile, an infectious disease expert said the \"next few weeks are going to be crucial\" for keeping infection rates down with the full reopening of schools. \nDr Mike Tildesley, a member of the government's SPI-M modelling advisory panel, told Times Radio the R number - which shows the rate at which coronavirus is spreading - would rise when children go back to their classrooms, but the continuing progress of vaccinations would cause it to reduce. \nHe said: \"We do need to get this balancing act correct and we need to open up at the rate of vaccinations and keep the R number in check, as it were.\n\"Definitely things are moving in the right direction but the next few weeks are going to be crucial for us to monitor what happens when schools open.\"  \nThere are concerns about getting parental consent for Covid tests ahead of pupils' return to schools. A survey found more than half of secondary head teachers had faced difficulties getting parental approval so far. \nQuestions have been raised too about the accuracy of the rapid lateral flow tests being used, while critics of masks for older pupils say they will harm learning."

      "text": "Large numbers of staff could leave nursing when the pandemic is over after being offered a 1% pay rise, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has warned.\nPatricia Marquis from the RCN told Times Radio it made staff in England feel they were not valued and would worsen the NHS's recruitment issues.\nThe body representing NHS trusts has joined unions to criticise the offer.\nBut the government defended its proposal, saying public finances were under unprecedented strain.\nMs Marquis, south-east regional director of the RCN, said \"significant numbers\" of nurses were planning to leave and \"this slap in the face from the government really has just reinforced their belief that they are not valued by either the government or perhaps some of the public in the way they would want to be\".\nShe said there were 40,000 nursing vacancies when the pandemic began and there was a \"real risk\" of more experienced staff leaving.\nNurse Susan Graham from Kent told the BBC the proposed pay rise was a \"disgrace\" after NHS staff had worked \"crazy hours\" during the Covid crisis.\nJohn Anderson, a nurse from East Sussex, said he had taken colleagues to intensive care after they caught coronavirus and called the pay offer a \"kick in the teeth\" for them and their families.\n\"It feels like the government are happy to have us risk our lives - or even die in this pandemic - but not pay us properly for our jobs,\" he said.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has been under pressure to reconsider its pay proposal since last week, when it officially recommended the 1% rise to the independent panel that advises the government on NHS salaries.\nNHS Providers, the body that represents employers in the health service, has joined in criticism of the proposal, saying the government's long-term funding plan for the NHS assumed a pay increase in 2021-22 of 2.1% - more than double what is now being offered.\nSaffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Given where the NHS is at, given what frontline staff have been through, it seems absolutely wrong to take from their pockets right now the pay rise that was due to them.\"\nAlthough these assumptions were published in 2019, before the pandemic, NHS Providers said the last year has \"strengthened the case for a larger pay rise for NHS staff\", recommending they receive at least 3%.\nBut the Department of Health maintains that while it set out a legal commitment for funding the NHS, the assumption of a 2.1% pay rise was not enshrined in law, and the financial pressures from the pandemic could not have been foreseen.\nThe NHS pay row in England, fuelled by angry responses from health unions, rumbles on and seems unlikely to fade away. \nIt is significant that the employers have now entered the fray in the shape of NHS Providers, the group representing trusts in England. \nNHS trust leaders know only too well that morale is low among an exhausted workforce and they fear that the proposed wage rise will make things worse. They are in effect lining up with the unions to oppose the government.  \nMinisters argue that the pandemic changed everything, including the state of the public finances, and that earlier plans have had to be rethought. \nThey say that compared to other parts of the public workforce facing a pay freeze, the NHS workforce will fare better and that difficult measures were needed to respond to public borrowing increases. \nBut after the unprecedented pressures on hospitals during the pandemic there is growing sympathy for health workers. \nThere will be a difficult few months ahead as the pay review body considers the arguments and ministers decide on their next steps.\nSpeaking at Friday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said the pay award reflected the \"difficult financial circumstances the country is in\".\n\"We've proposed what we think is affordable to make sure in the NHS people do get a pay rise,\" he said.\nBut Tory MP Dan Poulter, a former health minister who continues to work as a doctor in mental health, said NHS staff had worked without the correct equipment in the early stages of the pandemic and went \"above and beyond\" their hours, so it was \"from a moral perspective, the wrong time to be applying pay restraint.\"\nHe said past experience of keeping down NHS wages had also proved it was \"quite counter-productive economically\", forcing the health service to pay more in agency costs instead.\nThe British Medical Association, the Royal College of Midwives, the Royal College of Nursing and Unison wrote a joint letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak to express their \"dismay\" at the pay rise.\n\"Our members are the doctors, nurses, midwives, porters, healthcare assistants and more, already exhausted and distressed, who are also expected to go on caring for the millions of patients on waiting lists, coping with a huge backlog of treatment as well as caring for those with Covid-19,\" the letter said.\nUnite - the third largest union in the NHS - has also said it is considering a strike ballot, while the Royal College of Nursing has said its members should get a 12.5% increase.\nThe pay award would cover nearly all hospital staff, but not GPs and dentists. \nIn addition, some staff whose pay band is being changed will get more than a 1% increase as a result of a previously agreed three-year pay deal. \nThe government said newly-qualified nurses got a 12% pay rise over the course of that three-year agreement, adding that 1% was a \"real-terms increase\" as the latest official inflation figure was 0.9%.\nMeanwhile, Labour has said NHS \"heroes\" deserve more money and the proposed increase is \"nothing short of an insult\".\nAlex Norris, Labour's shadow health minister, said he would have recommended a real-terms increase for NHS staff, but said the exact figure should be set by the independent pay review body.\nHe said the public had been out on their doorsteps clapping for the work of NHS staff during the pandemic, and the government should not be \"clapping for them one day and cutting their pay the next\".\nThe NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by the devolved administrations.\nThe Scottish government has announced that 2021-22 pay negotiations will be delayed until the summer because of the disruption caused by Covid. Staff have been given an \"interim\" pay rise of 1%, which will form part of the new settlement.\nNHS workers in Northern Ireland were promised a one-off \u00a3500 \"special recognition\" payment in January, following a similar announcement in Scotland.\nThe Welsh government has said it will not set a \"ceiling\" of 1% on NHS pay rises for 2021-22."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

He faces possible extradition to the US.\nMr Watson was arrested in Texas on Thursday. \n\"Jimmy Watson is a decorated veteran and former Navy Seal. He fought for other people's rights and liberties, and he is entitled to and looks forward to his day in court to exercise some of those very rights,\" said his lawyer Arnold Spencer.\nThe latest charges were filed in the Manhattan federal court in New York.

      "text": "President Joe Biden's relief bill aimed at helping Americans deal with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has cleared a major hurdle.\nThe $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) plan was approved in the Senate on Saturday despite every Republican senator voting against. \nThe House of Representatives - controlled by Mr Biden's Democrats - is expected to approve it next Tuesday. \nMr Biden described the Senate vote as \"one more giant step forward\" in delivering the promise to help people.\nAmerica's worst public health crisis in a century has left nearly 523,000 people dead and 29 million infected, with a current unemployment rate of 6.2%. \nThe relief package - the third in the US since the start of the pandemic - envisages one-off payments worth $1,400 to be sent to most Americans. Mr Biden said such payments could start being distributed later this month. \nRepublicans say the plan is too costly. Some Democrats have also voiced criticism of certain provisions and the party's leadership was forced to make a number of compromises, notably the lowering of federal unemployment benefit from $400 to $300 a week. The benefit will be extended until 6 September under the plan.\n\"It obviously wasn't easy. It wasn't always pretty. But it was so desperately needed, urgently needed,\" President Biden said. \nHe added that he hoped for a quick passage of the bill in the House so that he could sign it into law.\nThe so-called American Rescue Plan allocates $350bn to state and local governments, and some $130bn to schools.\nIt would also provide $49bn for expanded Covid-19 testing and research, as well as $14bn for vaccine distribution.\nThe $1,400 stimulus cheques will be quickly phased out for those with higher incomes - at $75,000 for a single person and for couples making more than $150,000.\nThe extension of jobless benefits until September, meanwhile, would mark a key reprieve for millions of long-term unemployed Americans whose eligibility for benefits is currently due to expire in mid-March.\nThe bill also includes grants for small businesses as well as more targeted funds: $25bn for restaurants and bars; $15bn for airlines and another $8bn for airports; $30bn for transit; $1.5bn for Amtrak rail and $3bn for aerospace manufacturing.\nWhile Republicans broadly backed two previous stimulus plans, passed when they controlled both the White House and the Senate under Donald Trump, they have criticised the cost of Mr Biden's bill.\nThere was a marathon 27-hour session before the final vote on Saturday, and the 50-49 tally along party lines was indicative of the widespread Republican opposition.\nThe even split between the parties in the Senate meant that every Democratic senator needed to support the party's plans.\nBut on Friday a moderate Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin, objected on the grounds that the huge bill might overheat the economy. It took 11 hours of negotiation throughout the night to come up with a deal.\nThe compromise on lowering unemployment benefit meant the package could move forward to a final vote.\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the plan would \"deliver more help to more people than anything the federal government has done in decades\". \nSpeaking ahead of the vote, he said: \"It's been a long day, a long night, a long year, but a new day has come and we tell the American people help is on the way.\"\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, however, criticised the aid package. \"The Senate has never spent $2tn in a more haphazard way or through a less rigorous process,\" he said.\nMr Schumer has predicted that the House will endorse the bill and President Biden will sign it before boosted unemployment benefits expire on 14 March."
