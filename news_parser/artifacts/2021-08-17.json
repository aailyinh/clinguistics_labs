      "text": "Jeff Bezos's space firm Blue Origin is suing Nasa over a decision to award a $2.9bn (\u00a32.1bn) lunar lander contract to Elon Musk's SpaceX.\nThe former Amazon boss's firm said there were \"fundamental issues\" with the deal, calling it unfair.\nThe row stems from a decision in April to hand the deal to one company, not two as expected, because of a funding shortfall. \nNasa is yet to comment, but it has the backing of a federal watchdog.\nIn a court filing on Friday, Blue Origin said it continued to believe that two providers were needed to build the landing system, which will carry astronauts down to the Moon's surface as early as 2024.\nIt also accused Nasa of \"unlawful and improper evaluation\" of its proposals during the tender process. \n\"We firmly believe that the issues identified in this procurement and its outcomes must be addressed to restore fairness, create competition and ensure a safe return to the Moon for America,\" Blue Origin said.\nAt the time of the award, Nasa's human exploration chief, Kathy Lueders, admitted that the space agency's current budget precluded it from selecting two companies. That was after Congress granted it only $850m of the $3.3bn it requested for the project. \nNasa also cited the proven record of orbital missions by Elon Musk's SpaceX firm as a factor in the award. Cost is also thought to have played a role: SpaceX's bid was the lowest-priced by some distance.\nIn July, Mr Bezos offered to cover up to $2bn of Nasa's costs in order to be reconsidered for the contract, but he was rebuffed. \nUS watchdog the Government Accountability Office (GAO), meanwhile, rejected a complaint from Blue Origin and defence contractor Dynetic, saying that Nasa had not \"acted improperly\" in handing the contract to just one firm.\nNasa must file a response to the legal action by 12 October. SpaceX is yet to comment on the lawsuit.\nUnder its Artemis programme, Nasa hopes to return humans to the moon for the first time since 1972.\nIn April, Ms Lueders said: \"This critical step puts humanity on a path to sustainable lunar exploration and keeps our eyes on missions farther into the solar system, including Mars.\""

      "tags": "Japan",
      "text": "Maki Kaji, the Japanese man known as the \"Godfather of Sudoku\", has died at the age of 69.\nKaji gave the number puzzle its name after publishing it in his magazine Nikoli in the 1980s.\nSince then the popular game - involving placing the numbers 1 to 9 in each row, column and square of a 9 by 9 grid - has spread around the globe.\nTournaments take place across the world and it is estimated that millions play versions of the game each day.\nOn Monday Nikoli published a statement on its website saying Kaji had died at his home in Tokyo from bile duct cancer on 10 August 2021. \nKaji was born in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo in 1951. \nAfter dropping out of Keio University, he set up the puzzle magazine Nikoli, which published its first edition in August 1980. \nThe origins of Sudoku are unclear. Some credit the 18th Century Swiss mathematician Euler as its creator, while others say it came to the Arab world from China via India in the 8th or 9th Century, according to the New York Times. \nFrench newspapers published a number of early versions of the game in the late 19th Century, including one called \"le carr\u00e9 magique diabolique\", or the evil magic square, published by La France newspaper in July 1895.\nBut US architect Howard Garns is often credited as the creator of the modern version of the puzzle in the 1970s, under the name Number Place. It was this game that Kaji spotted in 1984.\n\"It was a very interesting puzzle, fun to solve,\" he said in a 2008 speech. \n\"But the name, Number Place, did not hit me. I wanted to create a Japanese name.\"\nKaji landed on Suuji wa dokushin ni kagiru, meaning \"Numbers should be single\". \nPushed by colleagues to come up with a catchier name as he rushed to get to a horse race, he said he came up with the name Sudoku \"in about 25 seconds\".\nThe game became popular in Japan but only turned into a global phenomenon in 2004, after The Times of London published a puzzle.\nKaji did not trademark the game, and did not gain financially from its huge success. But he said the joy of the puzzle and of others enjoying the game was more important than any monetary reward. \n\"I get really moved when I see a new idea for a puzzle which has lots of potential,\" he told the BBC in 2007. \n\"I get really excited about it. It is like finding treasure.\""

      "text": "Rescue work following the deadly earthquake which struck Haiti on Saturday has been hampered by heavy rains brought by Tropical Storm Grace.\nTens of thousands of people left homeless by the quake had to decide whether to brave the storm under flimsy tarpaulins or risk returning into buildings damaged by the tremor. \nAt least 1,419 people are known to have died in the 7.2-magnitude quake. \nMore than 6,900 were injured, and an unknown number are still missing.\nRescue workers dug through rubble on Monday in a desperate attempt to find survivors before the heavy rains were able to turn the earth into cloying mud, making locating those buried even more difficult.\nAt 06:00 GMT Tuesday, Grace, which has been upgraded from a tropical depression to a tropical storm, was west of the city of Les Cayes and moving further westward towards Jamaica, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).\nThe NHC had earlier predicted that Grace could dump up to 25cm (10 inches) of rainfall over the worst affected area. It is feared the deluge could trigger landslides. \nOn Twitter, Haiti's civil protection agency urged \"good neighbours whose space has not been affected\" to help shelter displaced people.\nThe south-west of Haiti appears to have suffered the worst of the damage from the quake, especially around the city of Les Cayes. \nHomes, churches and schools were among buildings flattened in the quake. Some hospitals were left overwhelmed and in need of supplies as they struggled to treat the injured.\nBy James Clayton, BBC News, Les Cayes\nIt's hard enough to treat survivors of any natural disaster but when the hospitals themselves are under fear of collapse it makes it all the more difficult.\nLes Cayes Ofatma hospital is deemed too unsafe so they've brought everyone outside. People swat away flies on hospital beds placed under makeshift tents and trees. You can hear people screaming in pain.\nOne woman, Elsy, had only just woken up when the earthquake happened. Her son has a serious fracture to his leg.\nThere simply aren't the facilities needed to treat people in this remote part of the country. One doctor comes to us, angry, asking why he has no medicine.\nOne woman we spoke to - who has a very bad broken leg and is also pregnant - has had no pain relief for two days.\nThe people here need help, but at the moment not enough help is coming - and with a tropical storm close by it could become even more difficult.\nThe earthquake compounds problems facing the impoverished nation, which is already reeling from a political crisis following the assassination of its president last month. \nPrime Minister Ariel Henry, who is in power until fresh presidential election can be held, has declared a month-long state of emergency and urged the population to \"show solidarity\". \nHaiti has been hit by a series of natural disasters over the past years, including Hurricane Matthew in 2016.\nThe deadliest was the 2010 earthquake which killed more than 200,000 people and caused extensive damage to the country's infrastructure and economy."

      "tags": "Chronic fatigue syndrome",
      "text": "A health watchdog has paused a final update to ME treatment guidance just hours before planned publication due to disagreement on its contents - a move that has angered some charities.\nNICE says it needs more conversations with patient groups and professionals so that the advice is supported. \nThere are strong and varied views on how the illness should be best managed.\nAn earlier draft scrapped one controversial recommendation of graded exercise therapy.\nMany patients with ME or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) say the therapy, which encourages patients to slowly increase their levels of activity, makes their condition worse, not better.\nThe draft recommendations for England and Wales, published in November 2020, said people should remain in their \"energy envelope\" when undertaking activity of any kind, and a physical activity programme should only be considered in specific circumstances. \nIt is not clear yet if the final guidance will say the same when it is published. \nThe draft also changed advice on a talking therapy, known as CBT, clarifying that it was only helpful in treating anxiety around the condition, not the illness itself. \nIt said that there was no \"one size fits all\" approach to managing ME, which is estimated to affect more than 250,000 people in England and Wales. \nNICE has acknowledged that the controversy over the best treatment has served only to alienate many people with the condition and, in some cases, undermined the confidence of those caring for them.\nSeveral members of the committee who prepared the guidelines left the group last month. \nOne of them is Dr Charles Shepherd, medical advisor to the ME Association. He has said it became increasingly difficult to comment on graded exercise and CBT issues in public while holding both roles.   \nNICE said it wanted to thank everyone who had contributed to the guideline, particularly the committee and the patient groups who had worked so diligently. \n\"However, unless the recommendations in the guideline are supported and implemented by professionals and the NHS, people with ME/CFS may not get the care and help they need,\" it said. \nSian Leary, from #MEAction UK, accused NICE of \"capitulating to the vested interests of those who support graded exercise therapy, instead of standing up for the thousands of people being harmed.\"\nOther groups including Forward ME, Action for ME, ME Association, Doctors for ME and ME Research UK criticised the delay, saying the document had been approved by the committee and should be published.\nAndrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: \"We were extremely concerned that the final guidelines proposed by NICE may not have taken into consideration the extensive comments we made to the draft version, particularly in relation to treatments we know to have significantly benefited many patients.\n\"There is reasonable evidence, for example, that graded exercise therapy helps a group of patients with ME/CFS and, while not without risk, our experts strongly support its ongoing use as an option in this condition. \n\"Similarly, our experts would strongly recommend specialist individualised rehabilitation for patients with complex rehabilitation needs.\n\"We hope that in delaying the final publication of these guidelines, NICE will re-consider our evidence submitted and incorporate it into their final publication.\""

      "text": "Model, actress and activist Lily Cole has apologised for posting a picture of herself in a burka as a way to \"embrace diversity\" and promote her new book.\nCritics said posing in the garment, worn by some Muslim women, did not help diversity and was ill-advised given the current unrest in Afghanistan.\nCole said she understood why the image upset people and wanted to \"sincerely apologise for any offence caused\".\nShe agreed it was \"ill-timed\" and said she \"hadn't read the news at the time\".\nCole, 33, posted the pictures as Afghanistan was being taken over by the Taliban, who forced women to wear the burka when they were last in control there in the 1990s.\nOne photo showed her with a blue burka covering her face and body, and in another the garment was pulled up to reveal her face.\nThe caption read: \"Let's embrace diversity on every level - biodiversity; cultural diversity; diversity of thinking; diversity of voices; diversity of ideas.\"\nShe used the same post to promote her new book Who Cares Wins, about how to tackle the climate and ecological crisis.\nThe Times columnist Janice Turner accused Cole of \"putting Instagram posturing before universal human rights\".\nAnjum Peerbacos, co-founder of the Hijabi Half-Hour podcast, said the pictures were \"disrespectful\".\n\"It's not a fashion accessory to be able to be deployed as a publicity stunt,\" she told BBC News.\n\"Regardless of how people around the world have chosen to wear that garment, that garment is a respectful religious symbol and is worn and used as such.\n\"So for her to use it as what can only be described as a publicity stunt, I think is abhorrent and really displays to us her level of ignorance with regards to it.\"\nAisha Ali-Khan, a media commentator and women's rights campaigner, said Cole was \"playing dress-up\".\n\"You can't embrace diversity if you are still the white woman dressing in ethnic clothing. That's not embracing diversity,\" she said.\n\"If you are serious about it and you're passionate about it and you want to see diversity normalised, you bring women forward that are from that diverse background and you platform them.\"\nSpeaking about the situation in Afghanistan, Ali-Khan added: \"I understand the mentality and the subject of subjugation and the men who want women to be subservient, and the hijab and burqa, in that part of the world, will always be used as a tool to oppress and a tool for women to cover up for the sake of men.\"\nCole later deleted her post and apologised on her Instagram story.\nShe wrote: \"This week, I posted an old photo of me wearing a burqa loaned to me by a friend, as she pointed out I was undermining its original purpose by wearing it with my face exposed, but I understand why the image has upset people and want to sincerely apologise for any offence caused.\n\"I hadn't read the news at the time I posted so it was incredibly ill-timed (thank you for pointing that out to me).\"\nShe added that her \"heart breaks reading about what is happening in Afghanistan at the moment\" and said she was \"looking for organisations helping women on the ground I can support\".\nCole began modelling in her teens and was named British Model of the Year in 2004. \nShe was a regular on the front covers of magazines and in advertising campaigns, and starred in films like St Trinian's and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, and TV shows including Elizabeth I and Doctor Who.\nShe graduated with a double first from the University of Cambridge, and in recent years has become known for her charity work and environmental campaigning.\nShe has a child with husband Kwame Ferreira, but this weekend told The Sunday Times she is queer, saying: \"I feel the need to acknowledge that I am not straight.\""

      "text": "US President Joe Biden admitted the Taliban's lightning-fast return to power would be \"gut-wrenching\" to the many Americans with a profound connection to Afghanistan. We spent the day with military veterans who served - and lost loved ones - in the conflict, and with Afghans who now call the US home.\nDespite the driving rain, dozens of people congregated outside the post office in Hookstown, Pennsylvania, as it was renamed after Staff Sergeant Dylan Elchin, a son of the town killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan.\n\"It's very wonderful to see Dylan honoured,\" said Sgt Elchin's grandfather Ron Bogolea.\n\"He sacrificed everything for our country and I believe that we should all be honouring our military more - for what they do for not only the USA but for the entire world,\" he said.\nThough the process to pay this tribute to Sgt Elchin started soon after the 25-year-old died in 2018, the renaming event ultimately happened as the US scrambles to leave Afghanistan and with the Taliban now in charge. That was not lost on the speakers at the Hookstown ceremony.\n\"The events of the last several days have shown that we don't always succeed, we certainly are not perfect, but our hearts are in the right place,\" said US Congressman for this area, Conor Lamb, during his speech here.\nBut Christian Easley, an Air Force recruiter who helped train Sgt Elchin, told me that for him the current circumstances in Afghanistan had not changed his perspective at all.\n\"Dylan had to follow his orders to go accomplish his mission. He did everything that was asked of him and then some,\" Mr Easley said.\n\"Regardless of what has happened during this past week I knew that Dylan did everything right.\"\nFor some though, this has clearly been a time for profound reflection.\nCaptain Jeremy Caskey, the Chaplain that offered the invocation at the ceremony here, had himself served in Afghanistan. His brother, Marine Sgt Joseph Caskey, was killed in action there in 2010.\nWhen asked about the turn of events in Afghanistan this week, he took a moment to collect his thoughts.\n\"It has been very difficult. You always want to know that what you are doing has purpose and meaning, but purpose and meaning doesn't just come in victory. I believe sometimes it comes in the sacrifice and the experience of it,\" says Capt Caskey.\n\"Are we better off? Is the country better off? Are they better off? It's hard to say.\"\nJust miles from the White House, Fawzia Etemadi and her cousin, Hamid Naweed, watched President Biden's address in numb silence. \n\"We trusted Joe Biden, but we are a little disappointed - the world is disappointed,\" Fawzia said. She had hopes that Mr Biden would uphold his promise to bring peace to her country.\n\"Afghans have suffered for the last 40 years. America is the world's father, democracy's father. No-one can explain why this is happening.\"\nLike thousands of Afghans living in northern Virginia, Fawzia and Hamid both fled Afghanistan as refugees in the 1980s and ultimately settled a few miles away from the nation's capital. The area is home to one of the largest Afghan diasporas in the country. \nAs we sip tea at Afghan Bistro, the family's restaurant, Fawzia and Hamid admit they've spent much of the last week in stunned disbelief.\n\"We couldn't go to sleep, we were worried about our loved ones back home,\" said Hamid, a former professor at the University of Kabul. Seeing so many people trying to flee their homeland, \"running away from their hopes\", was also difficult.\n\"I don't know how the Taliban came in power so fast,\" Hamid continued, \"but I hope that the world will recognise that people of Afghanistan need their freedom and independence and we deserve to live in peace.\"\nAdditional reporting by Xinyan Yu."

      "text": "The widow of a soldier from County Down who was killed in Afghanistan has said her husband \"died in vain\".\nAlmost 20 years after they were ousted from power, the Taliban has effectively seized control of the country.\nIt follows the withdrawal of most foreign troops in recent days.\nBrenda Hale, whose husband Capt Mark Hale was killed in August 2009, said by withdrawing from the country, Western governments have left people \"in the mouth of hell\".\nAfghanistan's capital city, Kabul, was the last major territory to fall to the Taliban, with the collapse of the country's government.\nPresident Ashraf Ghani has also fled abroad.\nOn Monday, crowds descended on Kabul's international airport, which is under the control of US troops, in an attempt to leave Afghanistan.\nMrs Hale, a former DUP assembly member, said the events in Afghanistan coincided with the 12th anniversary of her husband's death and she watched the television pictures with a \"knot\" in her stomach and \"in a state of anxiety\".\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, Mrs Hale said the television pictures from Afghanistan are \"difficult to watch\" and the situation across the country is \"hard to comprehend\".\nMrs Hale claimed that Western governments have abandoned the Afghani people and left the country \"like a concentration camp and given the Nazis the key\".\nShe said her husband was a \"hugely compassionate and kind man\" and, whilst in Afghanistan, had worked hard to protect local residents from the Taliban.\nShe insisted that Capt Hale and his military colleagues really believed they were \"trying to build some sort of democracy in Afghanistan to help that country move forward\".\nMrs Hale added that after the Western Forces left the country, \"we have sent the devil in after them and that petrifies me for the people living in Afghanistan\".\nShe said that by leaving the country, the West was creating \"a dystopian playground for international terrorists to train and come and hit the West at any given time\".\nThe former politician also said having to negotiate with the Taliban would be \"a very bitter pill to swallow\".\nMPs are to debate the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan on Wednesday in the House of Commons.\nAlliance deputy leader Stephen Farry thinks the debate has come \"a little late in this process\".\nThe North Down MP said the government has \"dropped the ball on this\" and should have acted sooner.\nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said Northern Ireland has a duty to consider offering sanctuary to some refugees from Afghanistan.\nHe said people who worked with British forces and in particular Christian minority groups should be offered support.\nSir Jeffrey, who visited troops from Northern Ireland in the country a number of times, said it was evident the coalition-backed police and army \"weren't up to the task of taking on a much smaller, less well-equipped Taliban\".\nHe told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster he feared there would be \"terrible consequences from the Taliban\" for those citizens who \"very courageously worked alongside our military\".\nSDLP MP Claire Hanna told BBC News NI that Northern Ireland has \"a capacity to take a number of refugees and asylum seekers\".\nShe said they will be people who make \"a strong contribution to life here\".\nIreland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has said 15 Irish citizens are currently looking to leave Afghanistan.\nMr Coveney confirmed there were a total of 23 Irish citizens currently in Afghanistan, adding he was \"very concerned\" about the situation there.\n\"Some have expressed a preference to stay for now, because they are working with humanitarian organisations and doing very important work that is becoming even more important now,\" he told RT\u00c9's Morning Ireland.\nMr Coveney also said the Irish government had already made decisions about visa waivers for Afghan people.\n\"We've already approved 45 visa waivers - some of those people are trying to get out and some are in Pakistan having fled across the border and are flying into Ireland,\" he said.\n\"I have agreed we would certainly make available between 100 and 150 more places in terms of refugees, and we will be prioritising human rights organisations, media, women and girls, and other family members that are vulnerable.\"\nAn Irish woman currently in Kabul says she is hoping to be able to return home within the next 48 hours.\nAoife MacManus, from Ashbourne in County Meath, has been living in Kabul for two years, working in the primary education sector.\nShe said \"there is a sense of panic and fear all over the city - it's the fear of the worst expectations\".\nShe said that leaving her work compound on Sunday \"everybody was crying because of the expectations of what things are going to be like\".\n\"All the work we've put into education, that it might all be for nothing.\"\nUlster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie, who served three tours in Afghanistan with the Royal Irish Regiment, said he had \"a real sense of anger, a real sense of sadness, but most of all a real sense of fear\" about what has happened.\n\"Fear for the people of Afghanistan, especially women and young girls who will now be airbrushed out of that society and repressed once again,\" he continued.\nMr Beattie, who reached the rank of captain, said he believed there would be reprisals for Afghan citizens who worked with and worked for the coalition forces.\nThe Upper Bann assembly member said many women and young girls could face \"virtual enslavement\" with the potential for the \"horrific\" treatment of people in villages and rural areas under a Taliban regime.\nSinn F\u00e9in Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the international community needed to act to help the people of Afghanistan.\nShe added: \"Previously the Stormont Executive welcomed Syrian refugees as part of the British government relocation and resettlement scheme. \n\"Our party would certainly support such a scheme for Afghans to provide whatever measure of support we can.\"\u00a0"

      "text": "PCR tests for travel have become \"a predictable Covid rip-off\", says the former chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority, Lord Tyrie.\nLord Tyrie said the competition regulator had been \"too slow to react\" to complaints about testing providers.\nHolidaymakers have objected to high prices and poor service from many of the 400-plus test firms listed on the government's website.\nTests cost about \u00a375 on average, but prices can reach hundreds.\nLast week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid asked the CMA to investigate \"excessive\" pricing and \"exploitative practices\" among PCR Covid test firms.\nInitially, the CMA said it would take up to a month to report back. But after a chorus of objection from the travel industry, the CMA said it was reviewing the situation \"immediately\".\nLord Tyrie told the BBC that the CMA \"could and should have been better prepared\". \n\"It should either be acting already directly using existing powers. Or if deemed inadequate for the job, it should be advising the government on how to obtain a quick remedy, whether by legislation or by other means,\" he said.\n\"This advice should already be with the government.\"\nLord Tyrie left the competition watchdog last summer after two years in the post, suggesting the role prevented him leading a more aggressive campaign for change. \nHe added: \"The CMA acted much more quickly to quell price-gouging on hand sanitiser and other Covid-related products 18 months ago. Far from building on this success, boldness appears to have taken a back seat.\"\nLord Tyrie reflected that \"the CMA is full of able and highly motivated people, keen to tackle detriment like this\". \n\"Their energies need to be released from an excess of caution at the highest levels,\" he added.\nAt the weekend, the cost of NHS coronavirus tests for international arrivals to the UK was reduced. Test and Trace tests were cut from \u00a388 to \u00a368 for people arriving from green-listed countries, as well as for those coming from amber-listed countries who are fully vaccinated.\nMeanwhile, the price of two tests for amber arrivals who have not had both jabs has been cut from \u00a3170 to \u00a3136.\nIt is understood the price cut is an attempt to drive down the cost across the market, so other operators will follow. \nCriticism of the government's decision to implement PCR Covid testing for all UK arrivals has been significant from the travel sector. \nLast week, major airports including the Manchester Airport Group and Gatwick Airport, along with tour operator Tui, cited the testing policy as a major barrier to travel restarting and the industry recovering. \nThe government said its top priority was to protect public health and it continued to work with industry to help them navigate this difficult period.\nLord Tyrie said that the slow response of the CMA was likely to mean it was too late to offer a full remedy to the market before the peak holiday season comes to a close and people return to work and school in September.\nBut the CMA said: \"These comments are inaccurate.\" \nThe watchdog said it gave advice to Department of Health and Social Care officials about the PCR testing market in April and \"we gave further advice to the secretary of state last week\". \nA spokesperson for the CMA said: \"We continue to work closely with Department of Health and Social Care in reviewing the market and, as we have made clear, we will not hesitate to take enforcement action ourselves if there are breaches of consumer law. \n\"Since the start of the pandemic, the CMA has secured hundreds of millions of pounds in refunds for people who have been treated unfairly, in sectors including holiday accommodation and package travel.\""

      "text": "The rights of women in Afghanistan will be respected \"within the framework of Islamic law\", the Taliban say.\nIn the group's first news conference since taking control of the country on Sunday, a spokesman said women would be free to work but gave little detail about other rules and restrictions.\nZabihullah Mujahid repeated that all Afghans must live \"within the framework of Islam\".\nRights groups fear women's freedoms could be eroded under the Taliban.\nThe militant group introduced or supported punishments in line with their strict interpretation of Islam's legal system, Sharia law, when they controlled Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001.\nWomen had to wear the all-covering burka, and the Taliban also disapproved of girls aged 10 and over going to school. \nIn the news briefing on Tuesday, Mr Mujahid fielded several questions from the international media about what women's rights could look like under a Taliban government.\n\"We are going to allow women to work and study within our frameworks,\" he said. \"Women are going to be very active within our society.\"\nBut he did not expand when asked about dress codes and what roles women would be able to have within the country's workforce.\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Taliban declared a general amnesty across Afghanistan and said it wanted women to join its government.\nAnalysts say the group is running a sophisticated PR campaign in an effort to win the hearts and minds of both Afghans and the international community. \nThe message of the new rulers has been received with mixed feelings inside Afghanistan.\n\"I don't believe what they're saying,\" a woman in Kabul who watched Mujahid speak on television told the BBC. \n\"It's a ruse and we're being lured outside to be punished. I refuse to study or work under their laws,\" said another.\nYet some others saw some early promise. \n\"If we're able to work and get educated, that's the definition of freedom for me, that's my red line. That red line is not crossed by the Taliban yet,\" one Afghan woman said. \n\"As long as my right to study and work is protected, I don't mind wearing a hijab. I live in an Islamic country and I'm willing to accept the Islamic dress code - as long as it's not a burqa though because that's not an Islamic dress code.\" \nAlso Tuesday's news conference, Mr Mujahid also:\n\"All their rights within Islam\" - that's the phrase the Taliban have used countless times when it comes to the lives of Afghan women and girls. \nIn recent years, foreign envoys and Afghans have tried, without much success, to establish with Taliban leaders based in Doha exactly what that means. \nI've heard references to women's rights in conservative Arab societies including Saudi Arabia, or Qatar. A founding member of the Taliban once blurted out that university classes would have to be segregated, areas partitioned, with obligatory head coverings. \nMore telling are recent reports from rural and urban areas that women journalists have been told to go home, women in offices told their jobs would now go to men. Restrictions may vary by region. \nIt's always been said that the rules in Kabul and other more open cities may be a bit different; women will now be testing the limits as a new order emerges. \nThe Taliban's return to rule brings an end to almost 20 years of a US-led coalition's presence in the country.\nKabul was the last major city in Afghanistan to fall to a Taliban offensive that began months ago but accelerated in recent days as they gained control of territories, shocking many observers.\nOn Monday, thousands of civilians desperate to flee the country headed to the airport where chaotic scenes unfolded throughout the day.\nMany thronged the runway, running alongside a moving military transporter aircraft as it prepared for take-off.\nSome clung to the side of a plane, and at least two of them are reported to have perished when they fell from the aircraft after it had left the ground.\nAmerican troops also killed two armed Afghans who were part of the crowd that breached the airport perimeter. Seven people are reported to have died in total.\nMilitary flights evacuating diplomats and civilians were temporarily suspended due to the chaos, but they resumed on Tuesday."

      "tags": "British Armed Forces,Afghanistan",
      "text": "The UK's evacuation programme in Afghanistan is \"operating at full pace\" but the changing political situation means it \"can't afford to pause and wait\", a military commander has said. \nVice Adm Sir Ben Key, who is running the evacuation, said around 300 people had been flown out so far. \nBut Sir Ben said the operation was dependent on the security situation. \nBoris Johnson said any recognition of a Taliban government would \"be subject to them upholding\" human rights standards.\nIn total, the UK hopes to help 6,000 to 7,000 British nationals and eligible Afghan staff to leave, he said. \nHome Secretary Priti Patel said around 2,000 former Afghan staff and their families had been resettled in the UK since 22 June under an existing resettlement scheme.\nAnd more than 3,300 people have been resettled since 2013, she said. \nThe prime minister spoke to US President Joe Biden on Tuesday evening, Downing Street said - and the pair agreed to work \"closely together\" to evacuate people from Afghanistan.\n\"The prime minister and President Biden agreed on the need for the global community to come together to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan,\" a spokeswoman said.\nShe added that Mr Johnson outlined the UK's plans to increase humanitarian aid to the region and resettle refugees, and that the pair would discuss the situation at a virtual meeting of G7 leaders \"in the coming days\". \nThere were chaotic scenes at Kabul airport on Monday, as thousands tried to flee the country after the Taliban seized control of the capital. \nA number of people died and large crowds on the runway led to all flights being halted for several hours. \nHowever, Chief Joint Operations Vice Admiral Sir Ben said the situation was now \"much calmer\". \n\"I'm very confident that we now have a stable airfield in which we can get on with the business, alongside all of our allies and partners, that we need to do,\" he said. \nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I expect that we will increase our aid budget for development and humanitarian purposes - probably by 10%, is what I have in mind - on last year. We want to try and make sure it doesn't go through the Taliban.\"\nOne would assume by \"last year\" that Mr Raab was referring to aid spending in the 2020-21 financial year, when the UK gave \u00a3167.5m of aid to Afghanistan. \nThat was before the government cut the foreign aid budget earlier this year. Prior to today, aid to Afghanistan was set to fall to \u00a337.5m - an annual reduction of \u00a3130m. \nHowever, if, as Raab has implied, a further 10% were added to the aid given in 2020-21, it would bring the UK's spending in Afghanistan up to \u00a3184.25m. \nIf a 10% increase was applied to the post-cuts budget then it would represent a massive decrease on the 2020-21 budget. We have asked the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to clarify the position but they have yet to comment. \nHe said three flights had landed in Kabul so far on Tuesday and more were planned. \nMilitary aircraft are also flying from Afghanistan to airports across the region, where people can then be put on civilian charter flights, he added. \nThe UK has sent about 900 troops to Afghanistan to help evacuate British nationals and Afghans who are eligible to resettle in the UK. \nThis group includes Afghans who worked for the British government, as well as interpreters, cultural advisers and embassy staff. Others eligible are those deemed to be at high and imminent risk, according to the Ministry of Defence.\nSir Ben said the UK wanted to bring as many people back as quickly as possible. \n\"We will go for as long as it takes us to either meet the demand, or when the security situation means that we're no longer operating with consent,\" he added. \nHowever, he said it was up to eligible individuals to make their own way to the airport when they were called to do so and the Taliban were now controlling access points. \nSo far, he said the Taliban had \"seemed acquiescent and understanding of what we're trying to achieve\" - but \"we don't take it for granted\". \n\"We will try our utmost to bring back everybody we can but we do not own the finish point of this,\" he added. \n\"We can merely work day by day as hard as we possibly can.\" \nSir Ben's comments came as a spokesman for the Taliban said the UK and western allies had a \"moral obligation\" to \"help reconstruct Afghanistan\".\nSuhail Shaheen told Sky News that the prime minister and other world leaders should respect the \"aspiration and will of the people of Afghanistan, and help the people of Afghanistan in rebuilding the country and providing a prosperous life for the people and economic development\".\n\"This is their obligation because they were behind the destruction of Afghanistan during the 20 years,\" he added.\nIn a separate news conference, the Taliban claimed that interpreters and others who had helped allied forces would be pardoned.\nA Downing Street spokeswoman said Mr Johnson had spoken to Pakistan PM Imran Khan on Tuesday afternoon.\nPakistan and Afghanistan share a border, and Mr Johnson had stressed the importance of working with other countries \"to avoid a humanitarian disaster\" the spokeswoman said.\n\"The prime minister underlined that any recognition of the new government in Afghanistan is to happen on an international, not unilateral, basis,\" she added.\n\"He said that the legitimacy of any future Taliban government will be subject to them upholding internationally-agreed standards on human rights and inclusivity.\"\nThe UK government is planning to launch a new resettlement scheme for Afghan refugees, aimed at helping those most in need, including women and girls, to come to the UK. \nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab has said the UK is looking at a \"bespoke arrangement\", with full details to be set out in due course. \nHe did not confirm how many refugees would be allowed to come, but said the UK was \"a big-hearted nation\".\nLabour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would ask the prime minister on Wednesday how the UK planned to get refugees out of Afghanistan. \n\"I don't think a question of numbers at this stage is a helpful discussion,\" he said. \n\"The first discussion has to be: is there a plan; is there a strategy of safe and legal routes for refugees to come out of Afghanistan; and how quickly can that be put in place?\"\nThe former immigration minister Caroline Nokes MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the government needed to implement an \"unprecedented\" new resettlement scheme at \"alarming speed\".\n\"I think we have to be particularly scared for women and we know this is a regime that will oppress and suppress women as much as they possibly can,\" she said.\nThe BBC has been told the new resettlement scheme will be similar to that used to help Syrian refugees.\nAround 20,000 refugees who fled the conflict in Syria have been resettled in the UK under the scheme since it was launched in 2014.\n Have you or a loved one been evacuated from Afghanistan?

      "text": "Customers should think carefully about handing over personal data when ordering food and drink via their mobile phones, the UK's body overseeing data privacy suggests.\nApp and web-based ordering has become commonplace during the pandemic.\nBut the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC that customers should be aware they had a choice over whether to share information.\nVenues should only ask for data that is \"relevant and necessary\", the ICO said.\n\"I think it's too easy to upload an app and straight away put your name, email address, payment details in, without actually understanding fully where that information may be shared and why it's being used,\" said Suzanne Gordon, director of data protection at the ICO.\n\"Ultimately this is your data, it's your personal information and you need to be confident when you're handing it over and the reasons why.\" \nOnline ordering is popular with many customers, sparing them the crush at the bar and helping to reduce the risk from Covid. \nBut they're popular with businesses too, because they speed up the ordering process and provide an additional way to interact with customers. Apps now handle millions of pounds worth of transactions every day. \nAnd it looks as though they are here to stay. Apart from in Northern Ireland, where you still have to be served at the table, restaurants and bars across the UK can now return to pre-pandemic style service at the bar or from waiting staff. But most are keeping their online ordering too.\nOne group of friends, gathered for a drink in the sunshine at the Courtyard in Manchester, said they were happy either to use the app or to order at the bar, whichever would get their pint to them the fastest. But there were downsides to the apps, they admitted.\n\"You end up with 10 different passwords, I've got so many different apps,\" said Johnny. \"You give your postcode or your email, a lot of it seems irrelevant.\" \n\"It is irrelevant,\" added Matt. \"But it's a cost we kind of have to pay.\" \nBut the ICO said sharing personal data was far from obligatory. \n\"Customers need to understand they do have a choice. We're now coming out of the pandemic and there's the ability to order on the app or in the more traditional way,\" said Ms Gordon.\n\"I think it is very easy for people just to see the end product, and because they want that, they really don't question the amount of data that they are being asked for,\" she added.\nThe UK's four biggest pub chains, representing a quarter of the market - Wetherspoons, Greene King, Mitchells and Butlers and Stonegate - all now have their own in-house apps. The developers behind apps for independent venues say they have seen huge growth during the pandemic.  \nThey all say they follow the guidelines informing customers of their rights and how their data will be dealt with. But those terms and conditions are unlikely to be closely read by a lot of people.\nOver the last year, lots of businesses have suddenly got a mountain of information about their customers that they didn't have access to before. Your local knows your name, an email address, maybe your date of birth, maybe your home address. \nFor the bar or pub, that's incredibly valuable information, worth much more than the round you just bought. It tells them what you like drinking, what time you're likely to visit, who you were sitting with and how frequently you reorder. \nPerhaps you're not bothered about the offers and discounts sent by them, but you might be more annoyed by calls from other companies, which could be in the small print of the app. Car insurance companies would be very interested in how much and how frequently you drink, while any number of other businesses would love to get hold of your mobile number. \nThe law says you can always ask a company to stop sending you spam, but it's a lot easier to make sure you tick or untick the right boxes in the app to start with, or just put the phone down and order in person. \nMost apps work by charging a venue approximately 2% to 3% transaction charge per order. In return, the technology can help streamline the ordering process, but can also offer the chance to learn a little about customers' habits and profiles.\n\"Hospitality is struggling,\" says Luke Beavon, financial director at one of the independent app providers, GoodEats. \"But the app gives them the ability to follow up with a customer and get them back through the door again.\"\nOnce registered, ease of use makes it more likely that customers will have another drink or an additional item, according to Chris Dunkley, director of another independent app, Hopt.\n\"Hopt hugely increases spend-per-head for the operator,\" he said. \nHowever, hospitality firms that do use the new technology should respect some boundaries, said the ICO's Ms Gordon.\n\"If [firms] are asking for data, they need to understand why they are asking for it and they need to make sure it is relevant and necessary,\" she said. \n\"It's up to them to make sure it isn't excessive.\"\nThe app developers appear to be taking that advice on board.\nThe Courtyard, where Matt and Johnny are drinking, uses an app called Butlr, which accounts for about a third of the pub's orders, or more at weekends. \nBut the amount of data the app collects has been reduced since it was first launched in 2018, says Butlr co-founder Alex Mackenzie.\n\"When we had our first venues go live, it was quite a rigorous sign-up process, but the data we collect from individuals has gradually worn away now,\" said Mr Mackenzie. \"We want to make it as simple and easy as possible.\" \nPrask Sutton, chief executive of another app provider, Onvi, said the business kept ordering as simple as possible. \n\"We don't believe customers should have to hand over excessive personal information just to grab a pint at the pub. They're going for a drink, not applying for a mortgage.\" "

      "text": "A proposed code of practice covering police use of live facial recognition in England and Wales has been criticised by human rights groups.\nLive facial-recognition systems compare faces captured on closed-circuit television with those on a watch-list, alerting officers to a match.\nFormer CCTV watchdog Tony Porter said the new rules were \"bare bones\" and offered unclear guidance.\nAnd two campaign groups have called for the practice to be ended entirely. \nThe Home Office said the new guidelines, included in the first update to the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice in eight years, empowered police and maintained public trust.\nIn August 2020, Ed Bridges, of Cardiff, won a court case after twice being filmed by South Wales Police's automatic facial-recognition van.\nOn the final occasion, the former Lib Dem councillor was attending a peaceful protest.\n\"I take the view that in this country we have policing by consent and the police should be supporting our right to free protest, rather than trying to intimidate protesters,\" he told BBC News, after his court victory.\nIn its judgement, the Court of Appeal said more checks should have been made to ensure the live facial-recognition (LFR) algorithm used had no gender or racial bias - and tighter regulations were needed.\nThe new code, which covers CCTV use by local authorities and the police, says LFR deployments should:\nLiberty lawyer Megan Goulding, who worked on Mr Bridges's case, told BBC News: \"One year since our case led the court to agree that this technology violates our rights and threatens our liberty, these guidelines fail to properly account for either the court's findings or the dangers created by this dystopian surveillance tool. \n\"Facial recognition will not make us safer, it will turn public spaces into open-air prisons and entrench patterns of discrimination that already oppress entire communities\".\nThe campaign group Big Brother Watch also called for the technology to be banned and said the code legitimised the use of an invasive surveillance technology.\nHowever the Ada Lovelace Institute told the BBC, the updated camera code, \"provides important additional guidance around the use of biometric technologies such as LFR in surveillance cameras\".\nBut it said, \"far more still needs to be done to ensure that the rules concerning the use of a technology as powerful and controversial as live facial recognition are clear, comprehensive and provide adequate protections from potential harms\".  \nAfter the Bridges case, Mr Porter, the then Surveillance Camera Commissioner, produced 72 pages of guidance on the use of LFR, for police forces in England in Wales.\nHe said: \"It covered ethics, governance, leadership, the technical development of watch-lists - and I was somewhat surprised the redraft of the code was 'de minimis',\" a legal term describing something too small to merit consideration. \nHe says the proposed Home Office code as currently written is very \"bare bones\".\n\"I don't think it provides much guidance to law enforcement, I don't really it provides a great deal of guidance to the public as to how the technology will be deployed\", he added.\nMr Porter, now chief privacy officer for a facial-recognition supplier, added it was strange the new code would not cover organisations such as Transport For London, which owns thousands of cameras but would cover small councils.\nThe current surveillance-camera commissioner has also previously suggested expanding the code to cover CCTV operated by government departments.\nIn a statement the Home Office told the BBC, \"The Government is committed to empowering the police to use new technology to keep the public safe, whilst maintaining public trust, and we are currently consulting on the Surveillance Camera Code.\"\n\"In addition, College of Policing have consulted on new guidance for police use of LFR in accordance with the Court of Appeal judgment, which will also be reflected in the update to the code.\"\nIt added that all users of surveillance camera systems including LFR are required to comply with strict data protection legislation. \nIn 2019, Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said the police should slow down their adoption of LFR. \n\"Never before have we seen technologies with the potential for such widespread invasiveness,\" she blogged.\nAnd her office now says it will be responding to a consultation on the updated code.\n\"Data-protection law sets a high bar for police forces, public authorities and businesses to justify the use of live facial recognition (LFR) technology and its algorithms in public places,\" a representative said."

      "text": "There is an urgent call for action on ventilation in schools - to slow the spread of Covid-19 - when pupils return, in September.\nSix education unions have written to England's education secretary, warning of a steep rise in Covid and \"long Covid\" when pupils return to classes.\nRules on keeping pupils in \"bubble groups\" and face masks were relaxed by Gavin Williamson at the end of term.\nBetter airflow measures would limit disruption and sickness, unions say.\nAnd they are also demanding funding for:\nThe Department for Education said: \"We want to ensure schools are both safe and comfortable for students and staff - and good ventilation has consistently been part of government guidance. \n\"Areas where ventilation is poor should be proactively identified so that steps can be taken to improve fresh air flow if needed.\"\nAnd pointing to a \u00a31.75m pilot scheme in Bradford said it was working to identify cost-effective ways to reduce transmission in communities, and assess the most effective use of proven air purification technologies in school settings.\nBut a parliamentary answer revealed  no funding had been allocated specifically to school ventilation since January.\nThe main education unions - the National Education Union (NEU), NASUWT, Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), GMB, Unison and Unite - have backed the urgent call, along with Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Daisy Cooper.\nMany thousands of teachers are already suffering from long Covid, they say.\nASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said: \"Government action on ventilation in schools and colleges amounts to little more than recommending that windows are kept open, which is not sustainable in providing a comfortable learning environment in the depths of a British winter. \n\"If the government is serious about bringing to an end the educational disruption of the past 18 months then it must provide funding for high-quality ventilation systems as a matter of urgency.\" \nMs Cooper said the government \"must provide schools with all the required resources - both funding and support - to install high-quality ventilation systems without further delay\". \nThe unions point out many school windows are painted shut and cannot be opened.\nIn their letter, they say: \"The benefits of ventilation in the control of airborne diseases are already well understood and accepted. \n\"School staff, some of whom will not be double vaccinated, or are in a vulnerable group, are also in some cases still at risk of serious illness.  \n\"Staff who are fully vaccinated are also still at risk of catching the virus and potentially developing long Covid, which is already afflicting tens of thousands of school staff.\" \nNEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: \"It is shocking that, rather than taking concrete steps now to improve the situation, the Department for Education has only just announced a pilot scheme, involving 30 schools in Bradford, to trial the use of air purifiers, with results not due until the end of the year. \n\"Eighteen months into the pandemic, and given the accumulated knowledge about ventilation, kicking the issue into the long grass in this way is simply not good enough.\" "

Road haulage firms have been a particular pinch point because the industry was already short of qualified drivers.\nFrom this week, fully vaccinated staff no longer have to self-isolate, a rule-change the government hopes will ease the pressure on businesses running short of staff.\nAt the same time Nando's says it is exploring an alternative solution by offering its staff to help suppliers, although it didn't say whether any had accepted the offer, or what work they would be doing.\nThe South African chain, famous for its peri peri sauce, operates more than 400 restaurants across the UK.\nNando's said the shortages were not affecting any of their outlets in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nNote September 6 2021: This story was updated to include a broader context around staff shortages after Brexit and the pandemic.

      "tags": "UK government,Hydrogen vehicles,Climate change,Renewable energy,Carbon neutrality",
      "text": "Thousands of new jobs could be created by investing in low-carbon hydrogen fuel to power vehicles and heat homes, the government says.\nMinisters have unveiled a strategy for kick-starting a hydrogen industry, which they say could attract billions of pounds in investment.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the fuel was also essential for UK efforts to reach net zero emissions.\nHe said it had the potential to provide a third of UK energy in future.\nBecause of the current higher cost involved in producing hydrogen compared to existing fuels, subsidies have been proposed to overcome the gap. The government has launched a consultation on this plan.\nLabour also backs hydrogen's potential, but said the government had failed to invest as much as other countries.\nUsing hydrogen gas as a fuel produces no carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution. It can be used to power fuel cells - devices that generate electricity through an electrochemical reaction - used in a turbine for electricity or burned in a boiler and vehicle engine.\nAs such, it is a low-carbon, versatile fuel that can be used by cars, trucks and trains, heat our homes and generate the power needed for industrial processes such as steel production.\nThe government plans to deliver 5GW of hydrogen production capacity by 2030, estimating that the industry could be worth \u00a3900m and support more than 9,000 jobs by the same date. \n\"Today marks the start of the UK's hydrogen revolution. This home-grown clean energy source has the potential to transform the way we power our lives and will be essential to tackling climate change and reaching net zero,\" said Mr Kwarteng.\n\"Our strategy positions the UK as first in the global race to ramp up hydrogen technology and seize the thousands of jobs and private investment that come with it.\"\nReaching net zero by 2050 will involve cutting emissions as much as possible and then balancing out any remaining ones by planting trees or burying CO2 underground.\nThe potential role of hydrogen in achieving this target has been highlighted by a government analysis suggesting 20-35% of the UK's energy consumption by 2050 could be hydrogen-based.\nA low-carbon hydrogen economy could deliver emissions savings equivalent to the carbon captured by 700 million trees by 2032, the government claims. It would help decarbonise polluting industries such as chemical production and oil refining and heavy transport such as shipping and rail.\nAlan Whitehead MP, Labour's shadow minister for energy and the green new deal, said hydrogen power had a \"significant role\" to play in decarbonising the economy.\nBut he added: \"The belated publication of this hydrogen strategy needs to be followed up with urgent action. That is what we will judge the government on because too many of the Tories' warm words and targets on climate change have not been followed up with practical steps.\n\"It is regrettable that the Conservatives have failed to match the investment shown by other countries and key decisions have been delayed, such as mandating that all boilers must be hydrogen-ready.\"\nThe government is proposing subsidies for the hydrogen industry along the lines of those credited with driving down the cost of offshore wind power.\nIt will also review the infrastructure - thought by some to be very costly - needed to underpin hydrogen power in the UK.\nMinisters want a twin-track approach to hydrogen production. \nSo-called blue hydrogen is made using fossil fuels, but its environmental impact can be mitigated by capturing and storing greenhouse emissions underground. Green hydrogen, meanwhile, is made using renewable energy.\nThough blue hydrogen is not as clean as the green form, it is cheaper.\nEnvironmental campaigners say there is too much focus in the strategy on blue hydrogen. Jess Ralston, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the government should \"be alive to the risk of gas industry lobbying causing it to commit too heavily to blue hydrogen and so keeping the country locked into fossil fuel based technology\". This, she added, would make reaching net zero more difficult and costly.\nPhilip Dunne MP, chair of the environmental audit committee, commented: \"While the twin track approach proposed, supporting both green and blue hydrogen production, is positive, it is also important that substantial capacity for carbon capture is developed, so as to avert release of damaging emissions currently created in blue hydrogen production.\"\nIn fact, one study by researchers in the US has suggested that blue hydrogen could release more carbon than burning natural gas.\nDr Jan Rosenow, from the Regulatory Assistance Project, an organisation dedicated towards accelerating the transition to clean energy, said: \"As the strategy admits, there won't be significant quantities of low-carbon hydrogen for some time. We need to use it where there are few alternatives and not as a like-for-like replacement of gas.\nHe said the plan confirmed that \"hydrogen for heating our homes will not play a significant role before 2030. The government's strategy shows that less than 0.2% of all homes are expected to use hydrogen to keep warm in the next decade. This means that for reducing emissions this decade, hydrogen will play only a very marginal role. \n\"But we cannot wait until 2030 before bringing down emissions from heating. The urgency of the climate crisis requires bold policy action now.\"\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "text": "Customers should think carefully about handing over personal data when ordering food and drink via their mobile phones, the UK's body overseeing data privacy suggests.\nApp and web-based ordering has become commonplace during the pandemic.\nBut the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC that customers should be aware they had a choice over whether to share information.\nVenues should only ask for data that is \"relevant and necessary\", the ICO said.\n\"I think it's too easy to upload an app and straight away put your name, email address, payment details in, without actually understanding fully where that information may be shared and why it's being used,\" said Suzanne Gordon, director of data protection at the ICO.\n\"Ultimately this is your data, it's your personal information and you need to be confident when you're handing it over and the reasons why.\" \nOnline ordering is popular with many customers, sparing them the crush at the bar and helping to reduce the risk from Covid. \nBut they're popular with businesses too, because they speed up the ordering process and provide an additional way to interact with customers. Apps now handle millions of pounds worth of transactions every day. \nAnd it looks as though they are here to stay. Apart from in Northern Ireland, where you still have to be served at the table, restaurants and bars across the UK can now return to pre-pandemic style service at the bar or from waiting staff. But most are keeping their online ordering too.\nOne group of friends, gathered for a drink in the sunshine at the Courtyard in Manchester, said they were happy either to use the app or to order at the bar, whichever would get their pint to them the fastest. But there were downsides to the apps, they admitted.\n\"You end up with 10 different passwords, I've got so many different apps,\" said Johnny. \"You give your postcode or your email, a lot of it seems irrelevant.\" \n\"It is irrelevant,\" added Matt. \"But it's a cost we kind of have to pay.\" \nBut the ICO said sharing personal data was far from obligatory. \n\"Customers need to understand they do have a choice. We're now coming out of the pandemic and there's the ability to order on the app or in the more traditional way,\" said Ms Gordon.\n\"I think it is very easy for people just to see the end product, and because they want that, they really don't question the amount of data that they are being asked for,\" she added.\nThe UK's four biggest pub chains, representing a quarter of the market - Wetherspoons, Greene King, Mitchells and Butlers and Stonegate - all now have their own in-house apps. The developers behind apps for independent venues say they have seen huge growth during the pandemic.  \nThey all say they follow the guidelines informing customers of their rights and how their data will be dealt with. But those terms and conditions are unlikely to be closely read by a lot of people.\nOver the last year, lots of businesses have suddenly got a mountain of information about their customers that they didn't have access to before. Your local knows your name, an email address, maybe your date of birth, maybe your home address. \nFor the bar or pub, that's incredibly valuable information, worth much more than the round you just bought. It tells them what you like drinking, what time you're likely to visit, who you were sitting with and how frequently you reorder. \nPerhaps you're not bothered about the offers and discounts sent by them, but you might be more annoyed by calls from other companies, which could be in the small print of the app. Car insurance companies would be very interested in how much and how frequently you drink, while any number of other businesses would love to get hold of your mobile number. \nThe law says you can always ask a company to stop sending you spam, but it's a lot easier to make sure you tick or untick the right boxes in the app to start with, or just put the phone down and order in person. \nMost apps work by charging a venue approximately 2% to 3% transaction charge per order. In return, the technology can help streamline the ordering process, but can also offer the chance to learn a little about customers' habits and profiles.\n\"Hospitality is struggling,\" says Luke Beavon, financial director at one of the independent app providers, GoodEats. \"But the app gives them the ability to follow up with a customer and get them back through the door again.\"\nOnce registered, ease of use makes it more likely that customers will have another drink or an additional item, according to Chris Dunkley, director of another independent app, Hopt.\n\"Hopt hugely increases spend-per-head for the operator,\" he said. \nHowever, hospitality firms that do use the new technology should respect some boundaries, said the ICO's Ms Gordon.\n\"If [firms] are asking for data, they need to understand why they are asking for it and they need to make sure it is relevant and necessary,\" she said. \n\"It's up to them to make sure it isn't excessive.\"\nThe app developers appear to be taking that advice on board.\nThe Courtyard, where Matt and Johnny are drinking, uses an app called Butlr, which accounts for about a third of the pub's orders, or more at weekends. \nBut the amount of data the app collects has been reduced since it was first launched in 2018, says Butlr co-founder Alex Mackenzie.\n\"When we had our first venues go live, it was quite a rigorous sign-up process, but the data we collect from individuals has gradually worn away now,\" said Mr Mackenzie. \"We want to make it as simple and easy as possible.\" \nPrask Sutton, chief executive of another app provider, Onvi, said the business kept ordering as simple as possible. \n\"We don't believe customers should have to hand over excessive personal information just to grab a pint at the pub. They're going for a drink, not applying for a mortgage.\" "

He said the experience of the bereaved families must be at the heart of a public inquiry. "

      "text": "Plasma from blood donations in England will be used to make a vital medicine, following a rule change to reduce reliance on imported stocks. \nEach year about 17,000 people need immunoglobulin treatment and, until recently, there was a ban on using plasma from UK \u202fdonors to safeguard against vCJD or \"mad cow disease\". \nOfficials say this precaution is no longer necessary.\nA mother and son from the Wirral are among those to have had the treatment.\nKes Earl, now 24, whose son Trevor is two, said: \"Immunoglobulins saved my family.\" \nThe move will help secure NHS plasma stocks to make the antibody-based medicines, called immunoglobulins. \nRollout of the service will happen across England over the coming months, and NHS blood donor services elsewhere in the UK could opt to do the same. \nCurrently, the UK relies solely on plasma imports, which can be in short supply - a situation made worse by Covid.\nGerry Gogarty, from NHS Blood and Transplant, welcomed the decision, calling it a huge step forward. \n\"By recovering plasma from blood donations, we can improve long-term supplies of immunoglobulin medicine, and each generous blood donation will go even further in helping to save the lives.\"\nThe red blood cells from donations will continue to be used as normal, so there will be no impact on donor blood stocks. Plasma is the fluid and other cells and components of whole blood.  \n\"Your blood is mostly made up of plasma and it contains the antibodies which fight infections. Those antibodies can save the lives of people with faulty immune systems,\" he said. \nTrevor was born with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia - a dangerous condition caused by his mum's immune system attacking his blood. \nHe received the urgent treatment in neonatal intensive care. \nKes went on to have immunoglobulin herself during her second pregnancy, to prevent the same condition happening to her younger son Wyatt.\n\"Plasma is the reason I have two healthy little boys that keep me on my toes. I am so happy that plasma from blood donors is now being be used for immunoglobulins, to help make sure there's enough available,\" said Kes.\nThe treatment can be used to help patients who cannot make antibodies themselves, or in circumstances where their bodies are not making enough antibodies, or the ones they are making don't work properly, as well as for\u202fdisorders when the body's immune system is attacking\u202fitself."

      "text": "Two days after the Taliban took control of the Afghan capital, Kabul, female presenters have returned to at least some TV channels, after briefly going off air as the militants took over the country.\nTolo TV, the private channel which previously broadcast a mix of Western-style game shows, soap operas and talent contests, said there was a little bit of uncertainty at the time about what would unfold next and temporarily removed their female presenters.\nTolo News' Siyar Sirat said on Tuesday things looked like they were returning to normal, with \"normal resources at the office, we have women on screen and we are reporting from around the city\".\nOne of the big questions now is what will happen to Afghan women - they are still visible on TV screens so far, and the Taliban have given assurances that their rights will be respected.\nNot many women could be seen at Kabul airport on Monday where crowds thronged the tarmac of the runway in a desperate bid to get out of the country.\nOn Monday, Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai - who was shot aged 15 by the Taliban for campaigning for girls' education in Pakistan - expressed concern about the situation for and the safety of women and girls in the country.\n\"I had the opportunity to talk to a few activists in Afghanistan, including women's rights activists and they are sharing their concern that they are not sure what their life is going to be like,\" she told the BBC. \n\"A lot of them remember what was happening in 1996-2001 time and they are deeply worried about their safety, their rights their protection, they are worried about their access to school. \n\"And we have already seen news reports that many girls have been sent back from university. A lot of them have been asked to get married at age 15, 12.\"\nTaliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen says the group will respect the rights of women and minorities \"as per Afghan norms and Islamic values\".\nOn Tuesday, the group declared an amnesty across Afghanistan and said it wanted women to join its government.\nIndeed, some women have chosen to stay.\nPayvand Seyed Ali currently works as an education consultant in Kabul, where she has lived and worked for 10 years. She was senior adviser to the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan, and also led the UK government's largest education fund in Afghanistan, the GEC.\n\"I don't think it's useful to wonder or have expectations of what the Taliban will do when it comes to women's rights and education.  We have to work with what we have, and what we have include high-level Taliban promises that women will have access to education, and work. \n\"What makes sense is to treat these promises not as 'conciliatory noises', but as commitments, and work actively with Taliban leadership to craft solutions that keep girls in school and women working,\" she told the BBC News website. \nShe says accountability will be key: \"The ministry of education budget, including all staff salaries, is almost entirely donor-funded,  including a large portion facilitated and monitored by the World Bank. The objectives remain, the indicators remain, the accountability measures remain, and we should work with any new government towards compromises to meet development goals, and to keep our kids - all our kids - in school.\n\"So far, it seems that most, though not all, girls' schools  have remained open or are reopening, albeit with personnel changes and high absenteeism. District and provincial staff for the most part continue to work. \n\"In more rural areas, I have reliable reports that the largest NGO in the country, the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan, has reopened or kept open almost all of its girls' schools. So have most other leading NGOs supporting education in government and community schools. Many of these community schools have had some Taliban engagement since inception. Most have insisted on female or mullah teachers for years.\"\nShe will stay in Kabul and says women around her are still mostly at home, but cautiously planning visits and outings in the coming days.\nActivist Pashtana Durrani says that people must be wary.\n\"For starters, you have to understand that what they say and what they are putting in practice, they are two different things,\" she told the BBC on Monday.\n\"Girls in Herat, they were not able to go to their universities; girls in Kandahar, they were asked to go to their home and their male relatives were asked to fill in... their positions in the bank.\n\"So... they [the Taliban] are looking for legitimacy from all these different countries, to be accepted as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, but then at the same time, what are they doing in practice?\n\"Either a) they don't have control on their foot soldiers, or b) they really want the legitimacy but they're not willing to do the work. Those are two different things.\"\nMs Durrani also points out that when the Taliban talk about women's rights, they talk about them in vague terms: do they mean mobility rights, socialising rights, political rights, their representative rights and/or voting rights? It is not clear whether they mean all or only some of those rights, she says.\nAfghanistan's women and girls must now wait to see how life pans out under Taliban rule, as fears and uncertainties remain while there is no government in charge."

President Emmanuel Macron, who was on holiday in the area, visited firefighters who were trying to bring the fires under control.\nSouthern France is the latest area in Europe to be ravaged by wildfires this summer as temperatures soar to record levels around the Mediterranean.\nScientists say heatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of climate change driven by human-induced carbon emissions.\nGreece, Turkey, Spain and Portugal are among the countries that have been grappling with wildfires that have claimed lives and destroyed homes.\nThe blaze in southern France started near the village of Gonfaron, about 50km (30 miles) west of of Saint-Tropez.\nBy Tuesday morning, it had swept across more than 5,000 hectares of forest and scrubland, the local fire department said.\nFirefighting aircraft dumped water to help douse the flames. Var's local government said 900 firefighters and 120 police had been deployed.\nMost of the evacuations took place around the villages of La M\u00f4le and Grimaud. \nSeven campsites were cleared of tourists, a local official told BFMTV, and some were destroyed by the fire as the flames - fanned by strong winds - spread rapidly. \nGuru-Murthy described how she and her family had tried to escape with their car in Cogolin, just to the west of the Gulf of Saint-Tropez, but the flames became too intense. \n\"We tried to turn around and the car went into a ditch, so we had to run a mile in the only direction we could go to, with huge fires on both sides of the road,\" she said.\nTourists and residents in those areas have been sheltering in town halls, colleges and gyms. The owner of a local restaurant and equestrian centre in Grimaud, Gino Colanesi, said his horses had been saved but everything had been razed to the ground.\nMeanwhile, in southern Portugal, hundreds of firefighters were struggling to control a blaze that prompted the evacuation of around 60 people in the Algarve region.\nThe fires comes a week a major United Nations report warned of more extreme weather events because of global warming. \nElsewhere in Europe, flash floods have hit Austria, northern Italy and Germany.\nA woman died and a second person was missing after a surge of water struck a wooden bridge over the H\u00f6llental gorge in Bavaria, in south-east Germany. The bridge collapsed late on Monday but the woman's body was not found until Tuesday morning. \nAustrian emergency services rescued dozens of people trapped in cars and buildings after a storm triggered flash floods and mudslides in the Pongau and Pinzgau areas near Salzburg. A bus was destroyed by the flooding.\nSimilar rescue operations were necessary in parts of northern Italy, where flood water swept away cars and uprooted trees.\nSome of the worst flooding was in the village of Sonico in Lombardy where the river Oglio burst its banks. In South Tyrol, near the border with Austria, dozens of people had to be helped to safety while others were told to stay in their homes."

According to Clinton Heylin's Dylan chronology A Life in Stolen Moments, he was then in the UK, France and Portugal until the start of June.\nThe Nobel Prize-winning singer, now 80, is accused of assault, battery, false imprisonment and infliction of emotional distress.\nThe accuser said he had caused her \"severe psychological damage and emotional trauma\", and is seeking unspecified damages and a jury trial.\nAccording to JC, the star carried out \"predatory, sexual and unlawful acts\", which were allegedly \"done intentionally by him to her without her consent\".\nShe claimed to have suffered \"severe mental distress, anguish, humiliation and embarrassment, as well as economic losses\".\nThe legal documents were filed on Friday at the New York Supreme Court under the state's Child Victims Act. The claim was submitted a day before the closure of a temporary legal \"look back window\" in New York, which allowed historical abuse allegations to be filed.\nDylan - who was born Robert Allen Zimmerman - has sold more than 125 million albums around the world during a career spanning six decades. His best-known songs include Blowin' In The Wind and The Times They Are a-Changin'.\nIn 2016, the Grammy and Oscar-winner was given the Nobel Prize in Literature, becoming the first songwriter to win the prestigious award.

      "text": "The Taliban captured Afghanistan's capital Kabul on Sunday, 20 years after they were ousted from power. So what does it look and feel like the day after its fall? \nThe Taliban are everywhere, at the checkpoints which used to be official police or army barricades. \nThere is not much panic in the city today, as there was yesterday. The Taliban are controlling traffic, they are searching cars, and they are especially searching those vehicles which used to belong to police and the army, all of which they have confiscated.\nIf there are Taliban fighters themselves driving those vehicles now, they are stopped at checkpoints, too. They told us that they checked these vehicles to make sure they were not looters and thieves disguised as Taliban.\nThe scenes at the airport were catastrophic. On the road there were families, children, young, old, all walking along the 2km (1.2 miles) road. People are struggling to flee this country. Most are just waiting, on the green belt in the middle of the road. \nI'm talking about more than 10,000 people at the airport. At the approach to the main entrance gates, there were Taliban with heavy weapons trying to disperse people by shooting in the air. People who wanted to get in were climbing the walls, the gates, even the barbed wire. Every single person was pushing to get in. \nWe spoke to an eyewitness who was stuck at the airport on Sunday. He had a flight to go to Uzbekistan, but it didn't happen. Officials then abandoned the airport. People had arrived without any tickets or passports - they thought they could get on any plane and be able to fly to anywhere else in the world, the eyewitness said.\nThousands of people were stuck inside the airport, without food or water. There were many women and children - and disabled people, too. \nBut if you go into the city centre, life appears to be normal. There is a lot less traffic, most of the shops are closed. But people look much calmer than yesterday - yesterday, everybody was furious. There was a big traffic gridlock.  \nI've only seen a few women on the street - some single women as well, without escort. Some were wearing blue burkas, but I also saw some wearing surgical face masks and headscarves. And the Taliban seemed alright with them. \nThere is no music on the streets at all. They used to play background music at the hotel, but it has stopped. Staff are scared. \nThe city, however, is still carrying on. It is calm. I haven't spoken to many residents, but the local taxi driver I use was kind of alright with the takeover. Surprisingly, I've seen people greeting Taliban militants - saying \"hello, more power to you, best of luck\", that sort of thing. \nTaliban fighters seem happy, too - I've spoken to a couple of them, ground soldiers on patrol. We tried to get into the presidential palace but they didn't let us in. They said we needed permission from the high command. But the militants I saw were friendly to us. \nI was scared yesterday a bit, fearful there was going to be violence and things like that. But luckily nothing happened. It was so quiet and calm. I couldn't believe that the capital had changed hands after 20 years and it was all so quiet."

      "title": "Afghanistan: Mysterious Taliban spokesman finally shows his face",
      "tags": "Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "When the Taliban delivered their first news conference since seizing control of Afghanistan on Tuesday, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid was doing most of the talking. \nMr Mujahid fielded a wide-range of questions from reporters in the historic press conference, in which he claimed that the rights of women would be respected \"within the framework of Islamic law\".\nFor most journalists watching, something else was also significant: it was the first time they had seen his face. For years he has operated in the shadows, only a voice on the end of the phone.\nThe BBC's Yalda Hakim says she was \"shocked\" to see the face of a man she had been speaking to for more than a decade, answering the first question from a female journalist.\nThe spokesman sought to strike a tone of conciliation, telling another reporter: \"We don't want any internal or external enemies.\" \nBut Ms Hakim says this is a far cry from some of the messages she used to receive from him.\n\"Some of these texts were hardcore Islamist texts. Some of those you think: 'This guy is bloodthirsty for the Americans, he's bloodthirsty for anyone in the Afghan government.' Then today he sits there and says there will be no reprisals,\" she says. \n\"For years he has sent out these bloodthirsty statements and now he's suddenly peace loving? It's hard to reconcile.\"\nIn fact Mr Mujahid was sitting in the seat which until recently belonged to Dawa Khan Menapal, the director of Afghanistan's media and information centre, who was assassinated by Taliban militants earlier this month. \nMr Mujahid claimed responsibility at the time and said Mr Menapal \"was killed in a special attack\".\nMany other reporters have been tweeting about witnessing Mr Mujahid, including veteran BBC journalist, John Simpson, who called him \"a relatively moderate, pleasant man\".\nBut for years there has been speculation as to whether the faceless spokesman might actually be more than one person.\nLyse Doucet, the BBC's chief international correspondent, said these discussions were going on long before the days of social media, when reporters had to call him on a landline. Some have suggested that the man sitting in front of the cameras on Tuesday looked too young to be the same person fielding questions for all those years. \n\"There has been speculation for years that it was a made up name, that there were many \"Zabihullahs\" who took turns. Now of course we are all accepting this is THE Zabihullah Mujahid. Maybe he isn't?\" Ms Doucet says.  \nMs Hakim says the mystery is all part of the Taliban playbook. \n\"That's what the Taliban are, they're organised and ideological - nothing is done by accident. To create mystery around a single person, suddenly he appears on screen - you couldn't write the script better,\" she says. \nRegardless whether Mr Mujahid is one person or not, Ms Hakim says she was wary of his words on Tuesday despite his efforts to appear measured. \n\"The caveat was really the sharia law - that sent chills down my spine,\" she says. \"They still haven't laid out what that looks like.\"\n\"That's the thing with the Taliban - they're deceptive, they're charming, they know how to use the right language, but you're never quite sure whether you should believe them or not,\" she says. \n\"There is a lot of mystery ... but do we really know who they are?\""

      "title": "Will the Taliban take Afghanistan back to the past?",
      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan",
      "text": "\"Thanks to God you are come,\" shouted an old man as my colleagues and I marched into Kabul on 14 November 2001, battling our way through the joyful crowds.  \nThe anti-Taliban forces of Afghanistan's Northern Alliance, which had the backing of the US and other Western countries, had halted on the city outskirts, and the Taliban had simply run for it.  \nFive years of the most extreme religious dictatorship in recent times were over.\nUnder the Taliban, Afghanistan had become a black hole in which all sorts of extremism could thrive.  \nOnly two months earlier the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington had been planned and guided by Osama Bin Laden and his al-Qaeda movement.  It simply never occurred to me then that Taliban could make a comeback.\nNow of course everyone is looking for reasons.  \nThey aren't hard to find.  \nThe governments of Afghanistan's two post-Taliban presidents, Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, were democratically elected but never strong, and corruption was the system which worked best.  \nNevertheless President Ghani would still be in his palace and the army would be driving round in its expensive Western vehicles, if Donald Trump had not decided that he needed a foreign policy success before the 2020 election.  \nHe thought that bringing a long-running war to an end would achieve that.  \nSeveral Afghan politicians and journalists I know were horrified by the conclusion of the US talks with the Taliban political leadership in Doha in February 2020, and doubly so when President Joe Biden made it clear he was going to stick to it.\nI was warned that no matter how moderate and peaceable the leaders in Doha might promise to be, the Taliban fighters on the ground would feel no compulsion to observe the fine print.  \nAnd so it proved.  \nDirectly after the US, British and other Western troops began pulling out, the Taliban fighters across Afghanistan made their play for power. Reports of prisoners being executed brought an atmosphere of blind panic in one town after another, until Kabul itself succumbed and officials and soldiers were battling their way to the airport to get out.\nPerhaps the Taliban will stick to the terms of their soothing statement promising not to take revenge on anyone, and appealing to the police, the military and the civil service to stay in place.  \nThey may very well think it'll be safer not to provoke the West to intervene again.  \nBut what sort of country will Taliban-controlled Afghanistan be this time? \nThe only guide we have is the five-year period from 1996 when (again in a matter of a few days - that's how these things go in Afghanistan) the Taliban drove out the moderate mujahideen government controlled by the redoubtable Ahmad Shah Massoud.  \nI spent a good deal of time in Afghanistan during the Taliban's period of power, and found it deeply scary.  \nSharia law in its fiercest forms was in operation everywhere, with public executions, stonings and whippings commonplace.  \nGangs of vigilantes hung out on street corners, attacking men who showed their ankles or wore any form of Western clothing.  \nWomen only ventured out if they had written permission from men, and of course had to wear the all-encompassing burka.\nThe Taliban minister of health, Mullah Balouch, complained to me that the International Red Cross refused his request to provide surgeons to cut off the hands and feet of convicted thieves, so he had to do the job personally; though he seemed to quite enjoy it.   \nWorking for television was a nightmare, because taking the image of any living creature was expressly forbidden on religious grounds.  Bookshops were regularly ransacked for illustrations, and any guilty bookseller was whipped.  \nMost people fled the city if they could, and most shops were shut up.  \nThe Taliban couldn't pay for oil imports, so the brightest lights at night-time were the candles people put in their windows, and the loudest noise was the barking of packs of marauding dogs, abandoned by their owners.\nFor all the failings of successive Afghan governments and their Western backers, Kabul and other cities have burst with commercial life since the Taliban were chased out.  \nLiving standards have shot up. Cars pack the once empty streets. Schools have blossomed, especially for girls; under the Taliban the education of girls was expressly forbidden. Music, banned under the Taliban, blared out everywhere.  \nThere are new buildings everywhere. The last time I was there, I couldn't even find the place on the edge of the city where my BBC colleagues and I started our walk into town in 2001; the whole area had been built over.\nMost Afghans will regard the Taliban takeover as a catastrophe for themselves and their country.  \nThe main question now is, will the Taliban follow their instincts and take Afghanistan back to the past as radically as they did before liberation day 20 years ago - or have they learned a lesson?

      "tags": "Afghanistan,Refugees and asylum seekers",
      "text": "Women and girls and persecuted minorities will make up the bulk of the Afghan refugees resettled in the UK, the home secretary has said.\nWhile the Taliban said women's rights will be respected, Priti Patel told the BBC it was hard to believe \"the PR operation that we're currently seeing\".\nThe UK government will work with other nations and pledged to resettle 5,000 Afghans in the UK in the first year.\nHowever, some MPs have criticised the scheme for not going far enough.\nThousands of Afghans have been trying to flee the country after the Taliban seized control of the capital Kabul.\nThe government has committed to resettling up to 20,000 Afghan refugees in the UK in the long term - and Ms Patel said she wanted the majority of those to be women and girls and persecuted minorities. \nThe Taliban have promised the rights of women in Afghanistan will be respected \"within the framework of Islamic law\".\nBut the home secretary said the group had a history of oppressing women and \"that's not going to change overnight\".\n\"I genuinely do not think that we should be at all believing the spokespeople or the PR operation that we're currently seeing,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. \nAppearing on BBC Breakfast, Ms Patel refused to give a timescale for how long it would take for the 20,000 Afghans to be brought to the UK. \nHowever, she compared the new scheme to one introduced for Syrian refugees, which saw a similar number of people resettled over a period of seven years. \n\"We could end up bringing many more [than 20,000] but first of all we have to have the underpinning and the infrastructure and the support to do that,\" she said. \nShe said a target of 5,000 in the first year was \"deliverable\", adding: \"It would be terrible quite frankly to bring people and not be able to give them the support that they would need in terms of accommodation, resettlement and giving them the opportunity to build a new life in the UK.\"\nDowning Street also said the 5,000 figure was \"not a hard cap\" but based on expectations of how many people would be able to leave over that time period. \nAsked how the UK would get vulnerable people, who may not feel safe leaving their homes, out of Afghanistan, Ms Patel said ministers would work with third party agencies, humanitarian organisations and other governments, including the US and Canada. \nShe added that people could also be resettled from neighbouring countries, as well as Afghanistan itself. \nMeanwhile, Parliament has been recalled and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been updating MPs about the situation in Afghanistan.\nHe said the government would be doing everything it can to support those who have helped the UK mission in Afghanistan and to \"avert a humanitarian crisis\". \nMinisters have been rushing to put this scheme together in response to the situation in Afghanistan, with the final details signed off on Tuesday.\nInformation on how to apply is expected soon. \nThe scheme is loosely based on the one introduced during the Syrian war, which also saw 20,000 move to the UK from 2014 to 2021.\nBut ministers acknowledge the practicalities of getting people out of Afghanistan will be considerably more complicated because of the extent of Taliban control. \nGovernment insiders don't know the extent to which the new regime will allow people to flee if they so choose. \nThere will be funding for the resettlement programme - and the government will work with local councils and devolved governments on where to house Afghans who come to the UK.\nThe scheme has faced criticism from opposition parties and some Conservative MPs. \nTory MP Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Defence Select Committee, told the Daily Mirror it was a \"woefully inadequate response\", citing the government only aiming to help 5,000 refugees in the first year when \"the threat is at its greatest\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the target of resettling 20,000 Afghans was \"too small\" and had been \"plucked out of the air\". \nLib Dems foreign affairs spokeswoman Layla Moran agreed that \"20,000 should be the starting point of this scheme, not the target\".\nRefugee charities welcomed the announcement as a positive first step but said the timeframe was too slow and eligibility for asylum should be expanded. \nAmong those hoping they might get help to leave Afghanistan through the scheme is a former teacher in Kandahar. \nThe 21-year-old woman - who the BBC is not naming to protect her safety - fled for Kabul after the Taliban captured Kandahar but said she was now too afraid to leave the house. \n\"I was working with an educational organisation - the Taliban, they do not accept these things,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \n\"Now I do not feel safe at all... I'm just like a prisoner in the house now.\"\nShe said Afghans needed help to escape now - and if she had to wait years for help it may be too late. \n\"We are in the situation that we cannot guarantee our lives for tomorrow,\" she said. \n\"Will I be alive tomorrow? We cannot guarantee that.\"\nThe new plan is on top of an existing scheme for interpreters and other Afghans who have worked for the UK government - the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP). \nSome 5,000 Afghans and their family members will come to the UK via that scheme this year. Nearly 2,000 have arrived since 22 June.\nThe UK has already sent about 900 troops to Afghanistan to help evacuate British nationals and Afghans who are eligible to resettle in the UK.\nChief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter said seven more planes were being sent to Kabul and the UK hoped to fly out 1,000 more people on Wednesday. \nHe told the BBC that British forces were collaborating with the Taliban, who were providing security around Kabul's airport. \nSir Nick said the Taliban seemed prepared to allow people to leave the country at the moment but \"we need to be clear that this is only possible if they behave in a reasonable fashion\".

In a matter of weeks, we have just ripped them from them.\"\nHe said he was not hopeful the Taliban regime had changed for the better.\nFor now, the eyes of the world were watching the Taliban, he said. \nBut in two months' time, the international community would be gone, the US would have left the airport and no-one would be watching - and if they did go back to their ways, no-one was coming to interfere in Afghanistan again, he added.\nThe British and US servicemen and women who died in Afghanistan - including two of his marines - had died \"in vain\", he said.\n\"We have achieved nothing now - we have just thrown everything away.\"\nIt was while on deployment in Afghanistan in 2006 that Pen Farthing and his troops broke up a fight between two dogs in the town of Nawzad - and one of them followed him back. \nThe pair spent the next six months together and he was given the name Nowzad after the town. At the end of his deployment he sought to bring him back to the UK.\nIt was a move that inspired him to reunite other servicemen and women with dogs and cats they had befriended while serving - and so the charity Nowzad was born.\nThe charity says it currently looks after more than 140 dogs and 40 cats, and has reunited 1,600 soldiers with the dogs and cats they rescued and bonded with while serving in Afghanistan.\nPen Farthing's book, One Dog at a Time, helps promote and fund the sanctuary's work.\nIn an emotional appeal, he pleaded for the government to make an exception for his Afghan staff, who will not fall under the two existing schemes for interpreters and British government workers.\nA campaign is under way on social media but, at the time of his interview with the BBC, Mr Farthing said he had not received any communication from the British government.\nThe Foreign Office said in a statement on Tuesday evening: \"We are in contact with Mr Farthing to offer assistance. \n\"The government's top priority is to do all we can to deliver on our obligations to British nationals, and those who have helped us, and get them out as fast as we can.\"\nVice Adm Sir Ben Key, who is running the UK's evacuation programme in Afghanistan, said the UK hoped to help 6,000 to 7,000 British nationals and eligible Afghan staff to leave - but that figure was dependant on the security situation.\nAfghans considered eligible to resettle in the UK include workers for the British government, interpreters, cultural advisers and embassy staff. Others eligible are those deemed to be at high and imminent risk.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab earlier said the UK was looking at a \"bespoke arrangement\" for Afghan refugees, with full details to be set out in due course.\nA new resettlement scheme will be aimed at helping those most in need - including women and girls - to come to the UK, No 10 has said."

      "title": "Who are the Taliban?",
      "tags": "Pakistan,Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "The Taliban were removed from power in Afghanistan by US-led forces in 2001, but the group has seized control of the country once again following a rapid offensive.\nThe capital, Kabul, was the last major city to fall to the offensive that began months ago but accelerated as the hardline Islamists gained control of territories.\nThe group entered direct talks with the US back in 2018, and in February 2020 the two sides struck a peace deal that committed the US to withdrawal and the Taliban to preventing attacks on US forces. Other promises included not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks.\nBut in the year that followed, the Taliban continued to target Afghan security forces and civilians, advancing rapidly across the country.\nThe Taliban, or \"students\" in the Pashto language, emerged in the early 1990s in northern Pakistan following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. It is believed that the predominantly Pashtun movement first appeared in religious seminaries - mostly paid for by money from Saudi Arabia - which preached a hardline form of Sunni Islam.\nThe promise made by the Taliban - in Pashtun areas straddling Pakistan and Afghanistan - was to restore peace and security and enforce their own austere version of Sharia, or Islamic law, once in power.\nFrom south-western Afghanistan, the Taliban quickly extended their influence. In September 1995 they captured the province of Herat, bordering Iran, and exactly one year later they captured the Afghan capital, Kabul, overthrowing the regime of President Burhanuddin Rabbani - one of the founding fathers of the Afghan mujahideen that resisted the Soviet occupation. By 1998, the Taliban were in control of almost 90% of Afghanistan.\nAfghans, weary of the mujahideen's excesses and infighting after the Soviets were driven out, generally welcomed the Taliban when they first appeared on the scene. Their early popularity was largely due to their success in stamping out corruption, curbing lawlessness and making the roads and the areas under their control safe for commerce to flourish.\nBut the Taliban also introduced or supported punishments in line with their strict interpretation of Sharia law - such as public executions of convicted murderers and adulterers, and amputations for those found guilty of theft. Men were required to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka.\nThe Taliban also banned television, music and cinema, and disapproved of girls aged 10 and over going to school. They were accused of various human rights and cultural abuses. One notorious example was in 2001, when the Taliban went ahead with the destruction of the famous Bamiyan Buddha statues in central Afghanistan, despite international outrage.\nPakistan has repeatedly denied that it was the architect of the Taliban enterprise, but there is little doubt that many Afghans who initially joined the movement were educated in madrassas (religious schools) in Pakistan.\nPakistan was also one of only three countries, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which recognised the Taliban when they were in power in Afghanistan. It was also the last country to break diplomatic ties with the group.\nAt one point, the Taliban threatened to destabilise Pakistan from areas they controlled in the north-west. One of the most high-profile and internationally condemned of all Pakistani Taliban attacks took place in October 2012, when schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai was shot on her way home in the town of Mingora.\nA major military offensive two years later following the Peshawar school massacre greatly reduced the group's influence in Pakistan though. At least three key figures of the Pakistani Taliban had been killed in US drone strikes in 2013, including the group's leader, Hakimullah Mehsud.\nThe attention of the world was drawn to the Taliban in Afghanistan in the wake of the 11 September 2001 World Trade Center attacks in New York. The Taliban were accused of providing a sanctuary for the prime suspects - Osama Bin Laden and his al-Qaeda movement.\nOn October 7, 2001, a US-led military coalition launched attacks in Afghanistan, and by the first week of December the Taliban regime had collapsed. The group's then-leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and other senior figures, including Bin Laden, evaded capture despite one of the largest manhunts in the world. \nMany senior Taliban leaders reportedly took refuge in the Pakistani city of Quetta, from where they guided the Taliban. But the existence of what was dubbed the \"Quetta Shura\" was denied by Islamabad.\nDespite ever higher numbers of foreign troops, the Taliban gradually regained and then extended their influence in Afghanistan, rendering vast tracts of the country insecure, and violence in the country returned to levels not seen since 2001.\nThere were numerous Taliban attacks on Kabul and, in September 2012, the group carried out a high-profile raid on Nato's Camp Bastion base.\nHopes of a negotiated peace were raised in 2013, when the Taliban announced plans to open an office in Qatar. But mistrust on all sides remained high and the violence went on.\nIn August 2015, the Taliban admitted they had covered up Mullah Omar's death - reportedly of health problems at a hospital in Pakistan - for more than two years. The following month, the group said it had put aside weeks of infighting and rallied around a new leader in the form of Mullah Mansour, who had been the deputy of Mullah Omar.\nAt around the same time, the Taliban seized control of a provincial capital for the first time since their defeat in 2001, taking control of the strategically important city of Kunduz.\nMullah Mansour was killed in a US drone strike in May 2016 and replaced by his deputy Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada, who remains in control of the group.\nIn the year following the US-Taliban peace deal of February 2020 - which was the culmination of a long spell of direct talks - the Taliban appeared to shift their tactics from complex attacks in cities and on military outposts to a wave of targeted assassinations that terrorised Afghan civilians.\nThe targets - journalists, judges, peace activists, women in positions of power - suggested that the Taliban had not changed their extremist ideology, only their strategy. \nDespite grave concerns from Afghan officials over the government's vulnerability to the Taliban without international support, the new US president, Joe Biden, announced in April 2021 that all American forces would leave the country by 11 September - two decades to the day since the felling of the World Trade Center. \nHaving outlasted a superpower through two decades of war, the Taliban began seizing vast swathes of territory, before once again toppling a government in Kabul in the wake of a foreign power withdrawing.\nThey swept across Afghanistan in just 10 days, taking their first provincial capital on 6 August . By 15 August, they were at the gates of Kabul.\nTheir lightning advance prompted tens of thousands of people to flee their homes, many arriving in the Afghan capital, others heading for neighbouring countries.\nThe Taliban's return to rule brings an end to almost 20 years of a US-led coalition's presence in the country."

      "text": "It's one of the most striking images from the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban. Hundreds of Afghans packed into a US military cargo plane as they flee Kabul. \nThe faces, many male but with some women and children, look up towards the camera, their expressions a mixture of anxiety and possibly some relief. \nThe image was initially obtained by the US defence analysis website, Defense One, but was released by the US Air Mobility Command public affairs office on Tuesday.\nOn Sunday, panicked civilians had scrambled up the loading ramp, Defense One quoted a US official as saying, but the crew decided it was best to take off rather than force the Afghans off the plane. \nThe number onboard - 640 - is among the highest carried by that type of plane, a C-17 Globemaster. \nIt's approaching, though still some way off, the record for the number of people transported by any plane - an Israeli Boeing 747 carrying more than 1,000 Jewish migrants from Ethiopia in 1991.\nThe US defence official quoted by Defense One, says the flight from Kabul to Qatar was one of several which managed to extract hundreds of Afghans from Kabul. \nThe photo stands in contrast to the chaotic images which emerged from Kabul airport on Monday as it was overrun by Afghans terrified at the prospect of Taliban rule. US soldiers struggled to keep control. \nAn image of the same type of plane from Monday showed hundreds of Afghans running alongside the moving aircraft, some clinging to the side. Local media reports said at least two fell to their deaths once it took off. \nSome have questioned why it is predominantly men seen at the airport. \nOne explanation is that many women have been staying indoors, fearing how they will be treated by the Taliban. \nAnother is that many families would want their men to leave first so they can help from outside Afghanistan, financially, and eventually find a way to bring their loved ones out of the country. \nWhile the airlifts will be welcomed by many, the numbers could be a drop in the ocean of those who feel compelled to leave in fear of the Taliban. \nThe UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, has called on countries not to force the return of Afghans previously deemed not to need protection.  \nIt estimates 550,000 Afghans have been internally displaced by the conflict since the beginning of the year. \nBetween 20,000 and 30,000 are thought to be fleeing across borders every week, the UNHCR's Afghanistan representative, Caroline Van Buren, told CNN. And government figures suggest 120,000 moved to Kabul as Taliban forces closed in.\nMany of those in fear for their lives have worked with US-led forces, notably as translators or contractors. But the Taliban's treatment of women during its previous rule in the 1990s and its use of barbaric punishments is another major spur to leave. \nAt the beginning of August, the White House announced a plan to allow thousands of Afghans with links to the US to resettle there. On Monday, President Joe Biden announced $500m (\u00a3362m) in aid for Afghan refugees. \nThe US has relocated some 2,000 Afghans out of the country under its Special Immigrant Visa scheme, officials say, and plans to transport thousands more. \nOther countries are helping out too, including Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel told party leaders that Germany may need to evacuate some 10,000 people, including 2,500 support staff. \nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Breakfast that 150 British nationals were flown out on Sunday. \nLast week, the UK extracted 289 Afghans. Several hundred more will leave in the next 24 hours, he said. \nBut the turmoil in Afghanistan has raised fears in Europe of a new influx of migrants. A stark illustration is Turkey's decision to boost security at its lengthy border with Iran where Turkey is building a concrete wall. \n Have you or a loved one been evacuated from Afghanistan?

And it accused Home Depot of warning employees not to engage in \"activity regarding racial harassment\". \n\"Issues of racial harassment directly impact the working conditions of employees,\" said NRLB regional director Jennifer Hadsall.\n\"The National Labor Relations Act protects employees' rights to raise these issues with the goal of improving their working conditions. It is this important right we seek to protect in this case.\"   \nThe independent watchdog said it wanted Home Depot to post notice at all of its US stores advising employees of their rights. \nBut the retailer said the NRLB had mischaracterised the situation and that it looked forward to \"sharing the facts\" with the watchdog. \n\"Regardless of the outcome, we will continue to be fully committed to diversity and respect for all people,\" Ms Gorman added. \nLast year, workers at Whole Foods sued the US supermarket for punishing them for wearing Black Lives Matter masks.\nThe federal lawsuit said the firm discriminated against black staff by selectively enforcing its dress code. \nHowever, in February, a US District Judge threw out most of the lawsuit, saying Whole Foods and its parent, Amazon, had not engaged in racial discrimination or violated Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act - which specifically prohibits discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment.\nA number of the plaintiffs who were fired for not changing their dress code have appealed."

      "tags": "Unemployment,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "Job vacancies have hit a record high as the UK's labour market continues to \"rebound robustly\", according to the latest official figures.\nThe number of vacancies hit 953,000 in the three months to July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nThe unemployment rate fell to 4.7% in the three months to June, while the annual growth in average pay was 7.4%.\nHowever, the ONS urged caution in reading too much into the rise in wages. \nONS deputy statistician Jonathan Athow told the BBC that while the rise in average pay \"hasn't been that high for a long time\", it also compares to last year when millions of people were on furlough and were not being paid their full wage. \n\"This time last year we had millions of people on furlough many getting 80% of their wages, other people having their hours cut, and that pushed wages down,\" he said.\n\"So when we look at wages this year, when people have come back from furlough, it's really been boosted by the fact that last year wages were quite low. Some of this group was just wages returning to the level before the pandemic.\"\nThe ONS said payrolls rose by 182,000 between June and July, although at 28.9 million it is still 201,000 lower than before the pandemic struck.\nThe number of people on payroll has now grown over half a million in the past three months, regaining about four-fifths of the fall seen at the start of the pandemic.\nOllie Brightman, co-owner of a digital marketing agency in Bristol, says he has been struggling to recruit staff due to the competitive jobs market.\nThe 35-year-old told Radio 5 Live's Your Call programme hiring freelancers was a good short-term solution for his agency, but \"very expensive\" in the long term.\n\"We are absolutely desperate for all matter of digital marketing candidates at the moment. Pretty much anyone within those industries we are crying out for,\" he said.\nHowever, John Parmenter, a carpenter from Hertfordshire, has been benefitting from the demand for skilled workers. He has seen his hourly rate shoot up from \u00a319 on average, to between \u00a325 and \u00a330 in the past few months.\nThe 53-year-old said he was getting called \"every few hours\" by agencies.\n\"It's quite a nice feeling,\" he said. \"It's the first time it's ever happened in 30 years. They ask what you want, not what they're paying. It's a nice change.\n\"During the lockdown, with the pandemic, unfortunately I wasn't entitled to any payments so I'm just trying to reap some money back to try and pay off some existing bills that have escalated. I just don't know what's round the corner so we're just going to surf it and make the most of it.\"\nOverall, Mr Athow said the \"world of work continues to rebound robustly\" from the pandemic.\nHe said that early survey figures show that the number of job vacancies passed one million for the first time ever in July.\nArts, leisure and food service firms were among those making a big contribution to the surge in job openings.\n\"There was no sign of redundancies starting to pick up in our survey data ahead of the furlough scheme beginning to wind down, and Insolvency Service figures for July suggest the same,\" Mr Athow added.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"I know there could still be bumps in the road but the data is promising - there are now more employees on payrolls than at any point since March 2020 and the number of people on furlough is the lowest since the scheme launched.\" \nThe furlough scheme is set to finish at the end of September.\nRuth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the jobs data should calm fears that the ending of government support measures could send unemployment higher.\n\"The figures add weight to our view that there won't be a big shake-out in employment once the furlough scheme expires at the end of September. \n\"It was encouraging that PAYE employment in July rose by 182,000 month-on-month and the claimant count fell by 7,800 month-on-month leaving the claimant count rate unchanged at 5.7%,\" she said.\nThese figures show a jobs market in robust recovery as the economy reopens and the furlough scheme starts to be phased out. Employment is up on all measures, unemployment down and experimental numbers in the month of July showed there are over one million vacancies.\nThere are record numbers of unfilled jobs, in sectors such as entertainment, accommodation and food, underlining the concerns of industry on labour shortages. \nThe number of payroll jobs reported on the HMRC systems is now very close to its pre pandemic level at 28.9 million now compared with 29 million in March 2020. That number is up 576,000 over the past year and 182,000 up in July alone. \nThe growth in that varies considerably between regions, with holiday areas such as Cornwall and west Wales showing annual rates of growth of around 5%, far above the rates in major cities.\nThe chancellor welcomed the figures as \"promising\". Analysts warned that the unemployment figures would rise as the furlough scheme continued to be phased out. But the peak unemployment rate is on course to be significantly lower than had been expected last year.\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: \"The labour market outperformed expectations as the economy accelerated with the relaxation of Covid-related restrictions.\n\"Changes to the business environment, such as the fall in business travel and the rise in online commerce, increased the need for skills, from IT specialists to hauliers, while at the same time caused an unusually high level of mismatch in the UK's labour market.\" "

      "tags": "Asia,Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "The Taliban took many by surprise as they swept across Afghanistan in just 10 days in August, quickly taking control of towns and cities. \nThe militant group has announced an interim government, declaring the country an \"Islamic Emirate\". \nThe cabinet will be led by Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, one of the movement's founders.\nSo, here's what is known about who is leading the Taliban today. \nHibatullah Akhundzada became the supreme commander of the Taliban in May 2016, and is now leader of the so-called Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\nIn the 1980s, he participated in the Islamist resistance against the Soviet military campaign in Afghanistan, but his reputation is more that of a religious leader than a military commander.\nAkhundzada worked as head of the Sharia Courts in the 1990s.\nAfter first seizing power in the 1990s, the Taliban introduced and supported punishments according to their strict interpretation of Islamic law: they publicly executed murderers and adulterers and amputated thieves' limbs.\nUnder the leadership of the reclusive Mullah Mohammed Omar (who is thought to have died in 2013), the Taliban also banned television, music, movies, make-up, and stopped girls aged 10 and over from attending school.\nAkhundzada is believed to be in his 60s and has lived most of his life in Afghanistan. \nHowever, according to experts, he maintains close ties with the so-called \"Quetta Shura\" - the Afghan Taliban leaders said to be based in the Pakistani city of Quetta.\nAs the group's supreme commander, Akhundzada is in charge of political, military and religious affairs.\nMullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund is one of the four men who founded the Taliban in Afghanistan in 1994.\nHe is a longtime head the Taliban's powerful leadership council, or Rehbari Shura. \nHe served as foreign minister and deputy prime minister during the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan in 1996-2001. \nHe is under UN sanctions for his role in the government during that period.\nSirajuddin Haqqani is another of the group's top figures, who is on an FBI most wanted list.\nAfter the death of his father, Jalaluddin Haqqani, he became the new leader of the Haqqani network, which has been credited with some of the most violent attacks that have occurred in Afghanistan against Afghan forces and their Western allies in recent years.\nThe Haqqani network is currently one of the region's most powerful and feared militant groups. Some say it is even more influential than the Islamic State group in Afghanistan.\nThe group, designated by the US as a terrorist organisation, oversees the Taliban's financial and military assets along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.\nHaqqani is believed to be around 45.\nIn an opinion piece in the New York Times last year before the signing of the Doha agreement, Haqqani wrote: \"For more than four decades, precious Afghan lives have been lost every day. Everyone has lost somebody they loved. Everyone is tired of war. I am convinced that the killing and the maiming must stop.\"\nMullah Abdul Ghani Baradar is a Taliban co-founder.\nHe became a lynchpin of the insurgency after the militants were toppled by the US-led invasion in 2001.\nBut he was captured in a joint US-Pakistani operation in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi in February 2010.\nHe remained in prison for eight years, until he was released as part of a plan to facilitate the peace process. He has been the head of their political office in Qatar since January 2019.\nIn 2020, Baradar became the first Taliban leader to communicate directly with a US president after having a telephone conversation with Donald Trump. Before that, Baradar signed the Doha agreement on the withdrawal of US troops on behalf of the Taliban. \nMohammad Yaqoob is the son of the founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar.\nHe is believed to be little more than 30 years old and is currently the leader of the group's military operations.\nFollowing the death of former Taliban leader Akhtar Mansour in 2016, some militants wanted to appoint Yaqoob as the group's new supreme commander, but others felt that he was young and lacking in experience.\nAs the Taliban advanced through the country, Yaqoob urged Taliban fighters not to harm members of the Afghan military or government and to stay out of abandoned homes of government and security officials who had fled, according to the Associated Press news agency."

      "text": "The Taliban swept across Afghanistan in just 10 days, taking control of towns and cities across the country.\nTaliban fighters took their first provincial capital on 6 August - and by 15 August, they were at the gates of Kabul.\nTheir lightning advance prompted tens of thousands of people to flee their homes, many arriving in the Afghan capital, others heading for neighbouring countries.\nAnd there was chaos in Kabul, as President Ashraf Ghani fled the country and thousands of his countrymen and women tried to do likewise.\nEmboldened by the withdrawal of US and other international forces, in June, the Taliban already controlled large parts of the country.\nBut after 6 August, their advance accelerated with a new momentum. \nProvincial capitals toppled in quick succession.\nBy 8 August, the Taliban had taken control in Kunduz. \nHerat, Lashkar Gah and Kandahar followed within a few days.\nDespite 20 years of outside support, billions of dollars of funding, an extensive programme of training and US air support, the Afghan security forces largely collapsed.\nIn some areas, they did stand and fight.\nIn Lashkar Gah, Afghan troops were pinned back in key positions, as the Taliban attacked repeatedly.\nHundreds of commandos were sent in to restore order - but when the Taliban detonated a massive car bomb outside the police headquarters, on 11 August, the battle was largely over.\nIn many areas, Afghan units that found themselves running out of ammunition and other supplies simply fled. \nTroops armed and trained by the US to safeguard ordinary Afghans left them to largely fend for themselves.\nAnd in some places, the authorities agreed to allow the Taliban to take over, to avoid further bloodshed.\nIn Ghazni, reports suggest the police chief and governor were both allowed to leave the city in return for agreeing to a Taliban takeover. \nOn 14 August, Mazar-i-Sharif fell to the Taliban, with little resistance from Afghan troops, some of whom left the city and headed for the border with Uzbekistan at Haraitan.\nBy the 15 August, 17,600 people fleeing the Taliban had arrived in Kabul, with thousands more arriving all the time, according to the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\nWith very little support from the Afghan authorities, many were sleeping rough in parks and other public areas.\nSome said they had come from captured towns where the Taliban were killing male family members who had worked for the security forces, and reimposing restrictions on women.\nThe World Food Programme said the conflict had \"all the hallmarks of a humanitarian catastrophe\".\nAs President Ghani fled the country, US embassy staff were helicoptered out of their heavily fortified compound.\nAnd thousands of people were heading to Kabul airport.\nTaliban fighters initially paused outside the city, while emergency talks were held at the presidential palace.\nBut they then moved in to take full control.\nExactly how the Taliban intend to rule remains unclear - and may vary across the country.\nReports from inside Taliban-held territory so far give a mixed picture.\nIn Balkh, 20km (12 miles) from Mazar-i-Sharif, BBC News found women and girls allowed in public areas unaccompanied - but there were reports of a woman being murdered because of the way she had dressed.\nIn other places, including a rural northern district near the Tajik border, women have said they are now forced to cover themselves with a burka and cannot go out unaccompanied.\nThere are also reports of young women being offered to Taliban fighters for forced marriage.\nAlthough, Taliban representatives in Qatar insist this is \"a lie\".\nAdditional reporting by Matt Murphy"

You can check the latest case numbers where you live through the BBC's postcode search here.\nNew Zealand has announced a snap lockdown after a man tested positive for Covid - the first case in six months. The case was detected in Auckland, which will be in lockdown for a week, while the rest of the country has been locked down for three days. Authorities say they are working on the assumption that the new case was the Delta variant.\nThere is an urgent call for action on ventilation in schools - to slow the spread of Covid-19 - when pupils return in September. Six education unions have written to England's education secretary, warning of a steep rise in Covid and \"long Covid\" when pupils return to classes. Better airflow measures would limit disruption and sickness, the unions say.\nMeanwhile, and though it may be August, half a million children across England have still been in the classroom this summer.

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The Biden administration's rush for the exit in Afghanistan has been accompanied by a similar rush to judgement among pundits and commentators who, by and large, have castigated the US president for a decision that many see as unnecessary and a betrayal, both of those who served in Afghanistan and of the Afghan people themselves. \nThe heartbreaking images from the airport in Kabul only reinforce this message. And there is justifiably a good deal of emotion to go round. The West has invested a lot of blood, time and money in Afghanistan. The Afghan people, much, much, more. \nIt is hard to argue with the criticism of the Biden administration's precipitate departure. Afghanistan may indeed be un-salvageable, its governing structures too unrepresentative and corrupt. This though only underscores the argument that Afghanistan was not \"lost\" in the past two years but during the previous 20.\nNonetheless the decision to cut and run is being seen as a terrible blow to US credibility - to its reliability as a partner, and indeed to its moral standing in world affairs. How does this square with Mr Biden's clarion cry on taking office, that America was back?\nComparisons are being made with Vietnam - the similarities with helicopters shuttling US nationals away from a falling city being too much for the newspaper front-pages to resist. But in reality - despite the superficial similarities -there are some important differences, too. \nSouth Vietnam collapsed some two years after US troops left. Indeed it looks as though the Americans expected their Afghan allies to soldier on for a significant period without them. The US was humbled by Vietnam - its population deeply divided and its military morale damaged. But while Vietnam turned out to be a tragic side-show in the Cold War, the US still ultimately won that contest. Nato was not weakened. US allies around the globe did not shy away from expecting US support. The US remained the pre-eminent superpower. \nAfghanistan is altogether different. Internal divisions in the US over this conflict have in no way been comparable to Vietnam's. The Afghanistan mission was certainly unpopular at home but there were no mass rallies against it. \nCrucially though, today's international context is dramatically different from that of the 1970s. The US - indeed the West in general - is engaged in multiple contests, in few of which they are outright winners. The Afghan collapse is potentially a disaster in the so-called war on terror. But in the wider conflict between democracy and authoritarianism, Washington's failure can only be seen as a serious set-back. \nThere will be smiles in Moscow and Beijing, at least for now. The Western model of liberal interventionism - promoted as a means of spreading democracy and the rule of law - has perhaps been tested to destruction in Afghanistan. One cannot see much enthusiasm for similar undertakings in the future.\nThose of Washington's allies who joined in the Afghanistan project are smarting. They feel badly let down. Even British ministers, jealous of their oft touted \"special relationship\" with Washington, have been openly critical of President Biden's decision. \nAnd for America's European allies in general, it underscores how dependent they are upon the US and how little their views count once the White House decides to go in one particular direction.\nSo bad news for the West. But how long-lasting will be the smiles in Beijing, Moscow and even Islamabad? It was Pakistan that nurtured and gave safe haven to the Taliban for its own geo-strategic purposes. But if renewed Taliban rule produces a simple turning back of the clock - if international terrorism finds a renewed haven - then Pakistan may find that the growing turbulence in the region has decidedly negative consequences.\nChina is happy to see the US failure. Indeed, if Mr Biden's reason to pull out from Afghanistan was due to his desire to re-focus US national power to rival a rising China, then this step has simply given China an opportunity to expand its own influence in Afghanistan and beyond.\nChina, though, must have concern, too. Its shares a short border with Afghanistan. It is actively persecuting its own Muslim minority and must be concerned at the possibility that anti-Beijing Islamist terrorists might seek to use Afghanistan as a base. No wonder then that Chinese diplomacy over recent weeks has been so eager to court the Taliban. \nRussia, too, must have worries about the return of instability and terrorism. Maybe it feels a little better about itself now that the US has similarly been humbled by Afghan tribal fighters, just as the Soviet Union was in the late-1980s.\nBut its chief interest is the security of a large part of Central Asia, many of whose states are allies of Moscow. This summer Russia moved tanks to the Tajikistan-Afghan frontier for exercises intended to demonstrate its determination to prevent any spill-over from an Afghan collapse. \nSo in the short-term, the Afghan debacle certainly benefits the West's opponents. But their attitudes were not going to change anyway. \nWhat really matters are the ramifications among Washington's allies. What will they take away from the Afghan experience? Beyond the immediate crisis, will the NATO countries, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea or Japan see the US as a less reliable partner? If they do, then Mr Biden's decision to quit Afghanistan will prove fateful, indeed."

      "tags": "Bromyard,Broadwas",
      "text": "An \"obsessed\" man has been jailed for at least 22 years for murdering his former long-term girlfriend's new partner, leaving him in a burning car.\nMark Chilman, 52, killed Neil Parkinson in Cotheridge, Worcestershire, on 12 December.\nA trial at Worcester Crown Court heard he lay in wait for his victim, hit him and set his car alight to try and make it look like suicide.\nJudge James Burbidge QC said Chilman had treated his ex as his \"property\".\nThe judge said Chilman had immediately \"harboured a desire to do Mr Parkinson harm,\" after discovering Julie Adcock had moved on with her life.\nThe court heard Chilman prepared by \"scoping\" his ex partner's farm, stealing two petrol jerry cans, buying disposable mobile phones and leaving his own phone elsewhere, while asking a friend to give him a false alibi.\nHe then waited for Mr Parkinson, 66, to drive away from the farm in Broadwas, to care for his 94-year-old mother, who had dementia.\nWhen the victim got out to lock the gate, Chilman attacked him, hitting him so hard with a weapon, possibly a hammer, he fractured the base of his skull and left him unconscious.\nThe trial heard he then drove Mr Parkinson to a lay-by, poured petrol over him and the vehicle, and set it alight.\nJudge Burbidge said, as the fire took hold, Chilman sent a long text message \"in despicable and defamatory terms\" to try and suggest it was Mr Parkinson attempting to take his own life.\nThe death had left Mr Parkinson's family and his ex-partner Ms Adcock \"shattered and grieving\", the judge added.\nIn a statement, Mr Parkinson's family described Chilman as an \"evil, calculated individual\".\n\"Neil was a loving, caring, happy person who enjoyed life to the full,\" they said. \"As a family it's been a very difficult eight months and our lives have been changed forever. \n\"Neil will be sorely missed by all his family and the memories of him as a loving father, grandfather, brother and son and will be remembered dearly for all the happy times.\"\nJurors heard Chilman, from Pencombe in Herefordshire, told police \"whatever, he is out of the way now\" when detectives suggested to him the blaze looked suspicious.\nThe judge accepted the death of the defendant's father some years before hit him hard and the loss of his relationship with Ms Adcock sent his world \"crashing down\".\nBut he said his love and affection became \"misplaced\" and he \"could not bear for her to be happy with anyone else\".\nIt emerged during the hearing Chilman had been attempting correspondence with Ms Adcock from his jail cell.\nDet Ch Insp Dean Jones, from West Mercia Police, welcomed Chilman's \"significant sentence\", describing the murder as \"brutal\" and \"senseless\".\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Colleges,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Colleges and sixth forms in England need an extra \u00a3570m to keep pace with the rising number of students, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).\nThe rise in numbers of older teenagers, and higher GCSE grades, is set to push up college numbers.\nThe IFS says funding for 16-to-18 learning fell in real terms by 11% in colleges and 25% in schools since 2010.\nThe government says it has announced an extra \u00a3291m for 2021-22 in addition to a \u00a3400m increase in the previous year.  \nThe IFS research says further education colleges and sixth forms in England have seen the largest falls in funding in the education sector over the past decade.\nImran Tahir, research economist and co-author, said: \"These institutions now also face a plethora of additional challenges created by fast rises in student numbers and the need to help pupils catch up on lost learning.\"\nThe government gave the sector an extra \u00a3400m in 2020-21, a sum it described as \"the single biggest annual uplift since 2010\".\nBut the IFS says with student numbers growing by 5% in 2020 alone, this restores funding back to 2018-19 levels, at best.\nThe IFS calculates that an extra \u00a3570m will be needed in the 2022-23 academic year, just to keep funding per student at the level it was the previous year.  \nColleges and sixth forms will need even more money if they are to respond to the major long-term challenges they face, it says.\nThese include helping students catch up on months of learning lost during the pandemic, and a projected rise in the number of 16 and 17-year-olds of 17% or 200,000 in England between 2019 and 2024. \nThe researchers point out that the rate of 16 and 17-year-olds in full-time education had already risen to an historical high of 85% in 2020. \nThis includes especially large rises in 2020 due to \"abnormally\" high GCSE results and reduced opportunities outside education during the pandemic, they say. \nGiven that GCSE results were higher again in 2021, the researchers suggest there is likely to be a further jump in students.\nAt the same time, the number of 16 and 17-year-olds doing apprenticeships fell to an all-time low of 3% in 2020 - with a 30% fall in numbers in 2020 alone. This reflects both the effects of the pandemic and a gradual reduction in take-up over the long term, according to the research.\nThe chief executive of the Association of Colleges, David Hughes, said: \"There is an urgent need for the Department for Education to guarantee full funding for every student recruited by schools and colleges this autumn, much the same way they do for universities as well as seek a commitment in the Spending Review to a longer-term revenue and capital budget that anticipates demographic trends.\"\nA Department for Education spokesman said:\"Further education is playing a vital role in delivering the skills young people need to get ahead. So we can meet the needs of all 16-19-year-olds we've announced an extra \u00a3291m for 2021-22, in addition to the \u00a3400m increase in 2020-21. \n\"Funding for future years beyond 2021-22, including anticipated increases in the 16-19 population will be considered as part of the upcoming Spending Review.\""

      "title": "What next for Afghanistan's economy?",
      "tags": "Afghanistan,Global economy,Taliban",
      "text": "Afghanistan's economy is \"shaped by fragility and aid dependence\". \nThat is the troubling overview set out by the World Bank several months before the Taliban takeover. \nEconomic prospects look even more precarious now, as future financial assistance is under a cloud of uncertainty. \nAfghanistan does have substantial mineral resources, but the political situation has impeded their exploitation.   \nThe aid dependency is striking. In 2019, World Bank figures show development aid was equivalent to 22% of gross national income (which is not the same as GDP, but close to it). \nThat is a high figure, but it is down a long way from the 49% the World Bank reported 10 years earlier. \nNow those aid flows are under a cloud of profound uncertainty. German Foreign Minister Heike Maas told the broadcaster ZDF last week: \"We will not give another cent if the Taliban takes over the country and introduces Sharia law.\"\nOther aid donors are sure to be watching developments closely.   \nThe fragility the World Bank refers to is illustrated by the very high levels of spending on security before the Taliban takeover: 29% of GDP, compared with an average of 3% for low-income countries. \nSecurity and severe problems with corruption are behind another persistent problem in Afghanistan: very weak foreign business investment.  \nAccording to United Nations data, there were no announcements in the last two years of new \"greenfield\" investments, which involve a foreign business setting up an operation from scratch. Since 2014, there have been a total of four. \nTo take two other countries from the South Asia region, both with somewhat smaller populations, Nepal has managed 10 times as many and Sri Lanka 50 times more over the same period.  \nThe World Bank describes Afghanistan's private sector as narrow. Employment is concentrated in low-productivity agriculture: 60% of households get some income from farming.  \nThe country also has a large illicit economy. There is illegal mining and, of course, opium production and related activities such as smuggling. The drugs trade has been an important source of revenue for the Taliban. \nAll that said, the Afghan economy has grown since the US invasion in 2001. \nThe figures for Afghanistan are not reliable, but what they show, according to the World Bank, is average annual growth of more than 9% in the 10 years from 2003. \nAfter that, it slowed (which may well reflect the lower levels of aid) to an average rate of 2.5% between 2015 and 2020.  \nThe country does have significant natural resources, which would, in the context of better security and less corruption, be attractive to international business.  \nThere are several types of mineral available in substantial quantities, including copper, cobalt, coal and iron ore. There is also oil and gas and precious stones. \nOne with particularly striking potential is lithium, a metal that is used in batteries for mobile devices and electric cars. The latter application is going to be especially important as the motor industry makes the transition to zero-carbon forms of transport.  \nBack in 2010, a top US general told the New York Times that Afghanistan's mineral potential was \"stunning\" - with \"a lot of ifs, of course\".  \nThe paper also reported that an internal US Defence Department memo had said the country could become \"the Saudi Arabia of lithium\".  \nYet this undoubted potential is nowhere near being exploited - and the Afghan people have seen very little, if any, benefit from it.  \nThere have been many reports that China is keen to be involved. It seems to have better relations with the Taliban than Western powers do, so may have an advantage if the new regime does hold on to power. \nHowever, Chinese firms did win contracts to develop operations in copper and oil. But little happened.  \nIt is to be expected that China would be interested. The opportunities appear to be very substantial and the two countries do share a short border.  \nBut any Chinese agency - official or a business - would want to be confident of succeeding. They will be reluctant to commit unless they feel the security and corruption problems will be well enough contained to enable them to extract worthwhile quantities of these industrial commodities. \nA key question for any hard-nosed potential investors - from China or anywhere else - will be whether the Taliban is likely to be any more able than the previous Afghan government to create the kind of environment they need.  \nAnother factor likely to affect the economy is women's employment. In the past decade the percentage of the female population over 15 years of age in employment has risen dramatically, though at 22% in 2019 it was still low by international standards. Under the Taliban the change is likely to be reversed, further damaging economic prospects.  \nIn the immediate future, there is also a great deal of uncertainty about financial stability. Crowds of people have been trying to withdraw their money from the banks. \nThe Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press reported a Taliban spokesman as offering assurances to bank owners, money changers, traders and shopkeepers that their lives and property would be protected.  \nThat there are even questions about the physical safety of financial operators is shocking. They do need to be confident if Afghanistan's financial system is to function.  But it also needs customers to feel their money is safe. That won't happen quickly.     "

      "text": "Trials of shared banking hubs in two communities where all the branches have closed down are to be extended.\nThe premises, managed by the Post Office, include counter services, ATMs and, crucially, the opportunity for local businesses to deposit cash.\nThe trials, in Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, and Rochford, Essex, were due to finish in October, but have been extended to April 2023.\nThe government is consulting on plans to protect community banking services.\nThe trials allow a member of staff from a different bank to come into the hub once a week to help with trickier transactions.\nThroughout the week, the counter service and machines allow individuals and small business owners to access accounts, and to withdraw and deposit notes and coins.\nShortly after the service opened in Rochford, the BBC was told it had been \"a lifeline\" for people living in the area.\n\"One lady came in to say 'thank you, you have changed my life', and that's not an understatement,\" said Richard Fleetwood, postmaster at the Rochford Bank Hub - a converted carpet shop.\nAn estimated 12,000 people have used the hubs for basic banking needs.\n\"It is really clear that the hubs have been hugely popular and it would be a bad decision to close them. The banks have therefore taken the view that they want to keep them open, and keep innovating in them so we can refine the model further,\" said Natalie Ceeney, who oversees the trials.\nThe trials are part of a wider project aiming to test ways to ensure people and businesses have access to cash. It also addresses the issue of bank branch closures, which are showing signs of accelerating as the UK emerges from the Covid crisis.\nAnother element of the project to be extended is the prevalence of cashback without having to make a purchase in local stores. So far, an average of \u00a328 has been withdrawn from tills, with shoppers often taking out non-round amounts unavailable from ATMs.\nHundreds more shops should be offering the service by early next year.\nBanks are in discussion over many of these projects, including shared hubs, as the government plans to legislate on access to community banking as bank branches close.\nIn their proposals, ministers said that people should not have to travel beyond a reasonable distance to withdraw or deposit money, even if they are in low population areas.\nInitially, the Treasury suggests that people should not have to travel more than 1km, but that distance could be extended over time if cash becomes less popular. The distance proposal is open to views during consultation.\nOther considerations include whether the facilities are appropriate for vulnerable people, are accessible for people with disabilities, have adequate opening hours, and are suitably secure for high-value cash deposits."

      "text": "The BBC has spoken to a woman in Kabul who worked for the Afghan government for almost two years, until last week. She spoke about her experience when the Taliban took the city and her fears for the future. \nSunday was the most horrible day in my entire life. \nI went to my office in the morning. The only woman I saw was a security guard at the gate. There were very few people there - it was not normal. The Taliban were at the gates of the city, people were scared, but I didn't believe the militants would be able to enter.\nAt around noon I left the office. I took my mobile phone charger and some personal documents. I went to the bank to withdraw some money as everyone was trying to take out as much money as they could. But the queue was very long. The situation was intense. \nWhen I entered the bank, I noticed missed calls from my mother, sister and brother. It scared me, as something might have happened. I called my mother and she asked, in a very anxious way, where I was and what I was doing. She told me to hurry and run home as the Taliban were in the west of the city. \nI was shocked, terrified, scared. \nEveryone was running. Shopkeepers were closing the doors and everybody was trying to get home. My brother called to say he'd pick me up. But the roads were blocked by traffic. \nI started to walk, and even tried to find a taxi. On the way, I saw a flood of people running. My fear was if the Taliban caught me on my way, they would kill me as I was in my office clothes. \nAfter almost two hours, I finally reached my home. I was so shaken I could not speak to my family. It was a day that I will never forget. I spent all night with fears running around my mind and I thought someone may knock on our door.\nSince then everyone has been looking for where they can hide. I want to escape to a relative's home, but I don't dare in case I'm caught on the way. \nI feel safe at home now. If they come to our home, no one would know that I worked for the government. The Taliban said their fighters will not enter people's homes. But we can't trust them. I'm afraid when I see them on TV - it makes me feel very sad.\nWe have seen their brutalities, how we can trust them? I can't sleep now during the night due to fear. \nI am waiting for a visa to leave the country but that is uncertain. If I stay in Afghanistan, will they allow me to work? I don't think so. I don't see my future in Afghanistan as being safe. I think for us, everything is finished. \nI've lost my hope for the future."

      "tags": "September 11 attacks,War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "If you like neat lines, tidiness and admire symmetry, what's not to like about the decision of Joe Biden to pull American combat troops out of Afghanistan by 11 September 2021 - exactly 20 years on from 9/11?\nIn modern day America it often feels that all roads lead back to 9/11; the single most defining - and scarring - event since Pearl Harbor: the surprise attack by the Japanese on America's Pacific fleet, which would ultimately bring America into World War Two.\nAnd so it was that 9/11 led to this country's longest military encounter. The attack on the Twin Towers, the plane that flew into the Pentagon, and the one that crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, were initially the spur for a surge of US nationalism. Young people - in fact people of all ages - were going along to armed forces recruitment offices wanting to sign up. America had come under attack; these patriots wanted to fight to defend the country the \"land of the free\", and seek revenge on those who would do the US harm.\nAnd don't mistake this for some kind of kneejerk jingoism. It wasn't that. I knew many people - not just Americans - who were of a liberal bent and had been no great fans of all the doings of the US of A but who have a visceral sense this was a moment where you had to pick your team. \nWere you on the side of the rule of law, free and fair elections, due process, sexual equality, universal education? Or were you on the side of those who would fly planes into buildings, or would stone people to death, or throw homosexuals off of buildings, or deny girls schooling? If that seems a massive over-simplification, maybe it is - but in the devastating aftermath of 9/11, that is how it seemed to many.\nBut by 2016 it was one of the factors that led to Donald Trump's election: the weariness of the \"endless wars\" as candidate Trump would refer to the quagmires of Afghanistan and Iraq; the wariness of America being able to act as the world's policeman. \nAmericans understandably wanted to pull up the drawbridge, bring the troops home, leave it to the people in those countries to sort out their own problems, and finally give up on the idea that a US model of liberal democracy was an exportable commodity that could be imposed. The liberal interventionist crusade was over.\nTrump, if he had won last November, would have pulled out US troops, probably quicker. Although Joe Biden inherited Trump's promise to withdraw, in policy terms the easiest thing would have been to continue to sign the cheques to pay for American servicemen and women to stay in Afghanistan for another year. And then another. And another after that. \nThe political pressure was by no means overwhelming. If anything, the reverse. The defence top brass, the foreign policy establishment, America's allies abroad thought anything other than the status quo would be reckless. But one question was gnawing at the new president, and it was the one posed by Hillel the Elder back in biblical times: \"If not now, then when?\"\nBiden - who advised President Barack Obama not to send more troops in 2009 but lost the argument - went with now, in what could be the most consequential single decision of his presidency.\nWhen 9/11 happened I was the BBC's Paris correspondent, reporting on Eurotunnel's attempt to force the closure of a Red Cross refugee centre called Sangatte  - where many of the world's storm-tossed refugees and migrants congregated before making the final leg of the journey to the UK.\nI was driving to Calais when I got a call from a colleague telling me to stop at the nearest service station to watch TV, and see what was unfolding.\nWe didn't know what would happen next - or where we would end up. One year into the optimism of a new millennium, there was a narrative and it wasn't a happy one - the war on terror, a clash of civilisations, call it what you will. At the time the two stories could not have been more different, but a lot of the bedraggled people we met on the roads around Calais were from Afghanistan fleeing Taliban rule. \nIt's worth remembering why the US, UK and others went into Afghanistan. The Taliban had - in effect - become a finishing school for Islamist terrorists wanting to wage jihad against the west. Al-Qaeda wannabes were going into the country to train for holy war. The 9/11 terrorists had honed their skills and hatched their plot there. Removing the Taliban and tackling al-Qaeda became critical for global security.\nWithin a few weeks of 9/11, I was in northern Afghanistan, travelling via Delhi and then Dushanbe in Tajikistan to get there. We were moving with the US and UK-backed Northern Alliance troops as they pushed the Taliban out. \nOur first day was spent travelling from Khoja Bahauddin, then the Northern Alliance HQ along a road where the Taliban had killed a number of journalists in an ambush two days earlier. After one night we ended up in a town called Taleqan. It had fallen the night before we arrived. One of the iconic shots was of a girls-school classroom that had become a weapons dump for Taliban rockets that in their hasty retreat they had left behind.\nThe stubborn last stronghold was Kunduz - a vital communication corridor sitting between Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif and then further north to the border with Uzbekistan.\nNow both Taleqan and Kunduz have come back under Taliban control, with a third of the country's regional capitals now under their control.\nAnd that raises a super-uncomfortable question for Joe Biden and his \"if not now, then when\" policy.  \nTwenty years on and so many lives lost, and so many billions of dollars spent, what was it for? What's been achieved? What do you say to the families of all those servicemen killed by the Taliban now that the US is giving up? What's to stop terror groups from re-establishing their jihad training camps? At the UN Security Council hearing last Friday it was reported that up to 20 different terror groups, involving thousands of foreign fighters were already fighting with Taliban forces.\nI'm sure as I am writing this more families will be packing up their possessions fearful of what Taliban control will mean, perhaps heading to Calais and then the UK. Will the girls' schools return to become weapons storage facilities again?   \nThe scars of 9/11 are clear everywhere - thousands of servicemen have come back with prosthetic limbs and disturbed minds. Suicide rates have been rising. Families have lost loved ones. On America's streets are men with red plastic beer cups begging for loose change, many of them with signs saying they are veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan.\nUS-led forces toppled the Taliban: In 2001 US-led forces overthrew Afghanistan's Taliban rulers after the 9/11 attacks masterminded by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was based there.\nTwenty years of occupation and military operations followed: The US and allies oversaw elections and built up Afghan security forces, but the Taliban continued to launch attacks.\nEventually the US made a deal with the Taliban: They would pull out if the militants agreed not to host terrorist groups. But talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government failed. US-led forces withdrew this year and the Taliban have now retaken most of the country.\nThe desire to stay at home and shut yourself away from a troubling world is completely understandable. There is no surprise that \"America First\" as a slogan had such resonance. George W Bush was not advocating that back in 2001 - but there were no US troops in Afghanistan or Iraq then. And that didn't keep America safe when early that morning, across those gin-clear blue skies passenger aeroplanes were hijacked and became al-Qaeda-guided missiles, flying into their targets killing thousands of people doing nothing more provocative than going about their daily lives.\nThere's also a difference between enforcing your will as the world's policeman, and being a peacekeeper. Thousands of American troops are still stationed in South Korea - even though the Korean war was 70 years ago. The calculation of successive US presidents has been that a tense peace is better than a hot war or a destabilised region.\nJoe Biden was hoping his decision would result in headlines like \"Afghan War Ends\" or \"America's longest war is over\". But 20 years on, and the Taliban now re-establishing control with all that could flow from that, might historians in future judge that the 20th anniversary marked the start of the second Afghan war?"

She studied at Oxford University, and has become a leading human rights campaigner.\nIn an exclusive interview with Newsnight on the plight of Afghanistan, Yousafzai said: \"My request to all countries, especially the US, UK, and western countries, is that they must protect all those human and women's rights activists right now. \n\"And you know what has happened, you know, we can definitely debate about that. But we also need to talk about the immediate next steps that we need to take. We need to talk more about the solutions right now.\"\nShe accused America of making irresponsible statements in the light of the Taliban takeover. \n\"I think the way the US described this war and how it was declared as a victory, I think this sends a very wrong impression,\" she said. \"The Taliban waited for twenty years and they [US] are claiming their so-called victory after that.\"\nThe US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, recently said that the US-led mission in Afghanistan had been a successful one. \nYousafzai said she has talked to other world leaders and members of the US and UK governments.\n\"I have been trying to reach out to many global leaders. I think every country has a role and responsibility right now. Countries need to open their borders to Afghan refugees, to the displaced people,\" she said.\nYousafzai has been an avid campaigner of women's rights, often emphasising the need for girls in developing countries to have a proper education.\nShe said she was \"raising her voice for the women\" in Afghanistan who are fearful about their future under a Taliban regime. \nWhen the Taliban previously controlled the country, women were stoned for adultery while their limbs were cut off for theft. Girls were prevented from going to school.\nYousafzai said: \"The women are brave, they're strong, and they keep raising their voices. And we must give more opportunities and time to them to tell us what it is that needs to be done for them, for the peace in Afghanistan.\"\nWhen asked about the rapid pull-out of the coalition forces from Afghanistan, she said the focus during their time there had sometimes been wrong.  \n\"There had been very little interest in focusing on the humanitarian aid and the humanitarian work. \n\"There had been very little focus on strengthening the democracy there, there has been very little focus on eradicating extremist ideologies. I think every country, every group, is finding their own interest in it, and they're finding their own benefits.\""

      "text": "Afghans are going back to work and there are more cars on the streets, but people's behaviour is starting to change in Kabul two days after the Taliban takeover. \nLast night, a group of 28 Taliban men came into my hotel, armed with guns, and asked for food. The staff were nervous.\n\"Look. We need to secure this place,\" the hotel's security manager said. \"Anybody could come with a gun and claim to be a Taliban, it could be a looter or a thief. So, why don't you just let us know who's with you, so we know who's Taliban and who is not. You know better than us.\" \nOf course, all the men got fed. Later on I tried to order something from room service, but the staff said the Taliban had finished it all.\nA couple of days ago, they were the enemy. There were uniformed guards in and around the hotel who were supposed to protect us from the Taliban. \nNow the Taliban are here: standing outside with guns, opening the doors of cars.\nFrom what I can see, the male staff at the hotel haven't shaved in the last three days. And all the female staff have gone. At the reception, room service, the cleaners - women are no longer here.\nThe background music at the hotel has also stopped. I asked one of the staff, who replied: \"Friends are here, so no more music.\"\nIt's much busier in the city than yesterday. There is much more traffic, a few more shops are open, and people are doing their usual jobs. \nThere have been no reports of violence in the city - no sound of gunfire or helicopters. I can hear a few military jets flying high over the city.\nI can see the Taliban presence has increased. Fighters have come from different areas of Afghanistan, the majority of them from Logar province south of the capital. They say they are here to keep order.\nThe ones I have seen are behaving nicely with people. Sometimes they even ask if you are alright, or if you need help with anything. \nI spoke with two street vendors in the centre on Tuesday. As poor Afghans, they said it didn't make any difference to them whether it was the Taliban or Americans in charge.\nAn unverified Facebook video went viral on Tuesday, showing women with heads covered protesting on a street in the city. They have placards in their hands, demanding a share in politics, education, human rights, and to be treated like equal citizens. I haven't heard any reports that they were arrested."

      "tags": "Unemployment,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "Job vacancies have hit a record high as the UK's labour market continues to \"rebound robustly\", according to the latest official figures.\nThe number of vacancies hit 953,000 in the three months to July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nThe unemployment rate fell to 4.7% in the three months to June, while the annual growth in average pay was 7.4%.\nHowever, the ONS urged caution in reading too much into the rise in wages. \nONS deputy statistician Jonathan Athow told the BBC that while the rise in average pay \"hasn't been that high for a long time\", it also compares to last year when millions of people were on furlough and were not being paid their full wage. \n\"This time last year we had millions of people on furlough many getting 80% of their wages, other people having their hours cut, and that pushed wages down,\" he said.\n\"So when we look at wages this year, when people have come back from furlough, it's really been boosted by the fact that last year wages were quite low. Some of this group was just wages returning to the level before the pandemic.\"\nThe ONS said payrolls rose by 182,000 between June and July, although at 28.9 million it is still 201,000 lower than before the pandemic struck.\nThe number of people on payroll has now grown over half a million in the past three months, regaining about four-fifths of the fall seen at the start of the pandemic.\nOllie Brightman, co-owner of a digital marketing agency in Bristol, says he has been struggling to recruit staff due to the competitive jobs market.\nThe 35-year-old told Radio 5 Live's Your Call programme hiring freelancers was a good short-term solution for his agency, but \"very expensive\" in the long term.\n\"We are absolutely desperate for all matter of digital marketing candidates at the moment. Pretty much anyone within those industries we are crying out for,\" he said.\nHowever, John Parmenter, a carpenter from Hertfordshire, has been benefitting from the demand for skilled workers. He has seen his hourly rate shoot up from \u00a319 on average, to between \u00a325 and \u00a330 in the past few months.\nThe 53-year-old said he was getting called \"every few hours\" by agencies.\n\"It's quite a nice feeling,\" he said. \"It's the first time it's ever happened in 30 years. They ask what you want, not what they're paying. It's a nice change.\n\"During the lockdown, with the pandemic, unfortunately I wasn't entitled to any payments so I'm just trying to reap some money back to try and pay off some existing bills that have escalated. I just don't know what's round the corner so we're just going to surf it and make the most of it.\"\nOverall, Mr Athow said the \"world of work continues to rebound robustly\" from the pandemic.\nHe said that early survey figures show that the number of job vacancies passed one million for the first time ever in July.\nArts, leisure and food service firms were among those making a big contribution to the surge in job openings.\n\"There was no sign of redundancies starting to pick up in our survey data ahead of the furlough scheme beginning to wind down, and Insolvency Service figures for July suggest the same,\" Mr Athow added.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"I know there could still be bumps in the road but the data is promising - there are now more employees on payrolls than at any point since March 2020 and the number of people on furlough is the lowest since the scheme launched.\" \nThe furlough scheme is set to finish at the end of September.\nRuth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the jobs data should calm fears that the ending of government support measures could send unemployment higher.\n\"The figures add weight to our view that there won't be a big shake-out in employment once the furlough scheme expires at the end of September. \n\"It was encouraging that PAYE employment in July rose by 182,000 month-on-month and the claimant count fell by 7,800 month-on-month leaving the claimant count rate unchanged at 5.7%,\" she said.\nThese figures show a jobs market in robust recovery as the economy reopens and the furlough scheme starts to be phased out. Employment is up on all measures, unemployment down and experimental numbers in the month of July showed there are over one million vacancies.\nThere are record numbers of unfilled jobs, in sectors such as entertainment, accommodation and food, underlining the concerns of industry on labour shortages. \nThe number of payroll jobs reported on the HMRC systems is now very close to its pre pandemic level at 28.9 million now compared with 29 million in March 2020. That number is up 576,000 over the past year and 182,000 up in July alone. \nThe growth in that varies considerably between regions, with holiday areas such as Cornwall and west Wales showing annual rates of growth of around 5%, far above the rates in major cities.\nThe chancellor welcomed the figures as \"promising\". Analysts warned that the unemployment figures would rise as the furlough scheme continued to be phased out. But the peak unemployment rate is on course to be significantly lower than had been expected last year.\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: \"The labour market outperformed expectations as the economy accelerated with the relaxation of Covid-related restrictions.\n\"Changes to the business environment, such as the fall in business travel and the rise in online commerce, increased the need for skills, from IT specialists to hauliers, while at the same time caused an unusually high level of mismatch in the UK's labour market.\" "

      "tags": "Painkillers,Breast cancer,Cancer",
      "text": "Aspirin may help fight aggressive breast cancer by making hard-to-treat tumours more responsive to anti-cancer drugs, doctors say.\nA team at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, in Manchester, are beginning a trial with triple-negative breast-cancer patients. \nThey suspect it is aspirin's anti-inflammatory properties rather than its analgesic effect that gives the boost.\nAnimal studies have already shown encouraging results. \nThere is some evidence aspirin might help prevent certain other cancers and lower the risk of it spreading. \nBut it is too early to recommend people start taking it. More research is needed. \nAbout 8,000 women are diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer in the UK each year - a less common but often more aggressive type of breast cancer that disproportionately affects younger women and black women.\nThese tumours lack receptors some other breast cancers have, meaning certain treatments, such as herceptin, will not work. Although, other medicines and treatments can help. \nIn the trial, funded by a research programme run by the charity Breast Cancer Now, some patients will be given aspirin as well as immunotherapy drug avelumab before they receive surgery and chemotherapy treatment. \nIf it is successful, there could be further clinical trials of aspirin and avelumab for incurable secondary triple-negative breast cancer, when cancer cells that started in the breast spread to other parts of the body.\nBeth Bramall, 44, from Hampshire was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer in 2019.  \nShe said: \"There's no easy cancer but triple negative is particularly gruelling, with few treatment options and a long and debilitating treatment plan.\n\"It floored me, with side-effects of hair loss, nausea, joint and muscle pain, diarrhoea and constipation, burning palms and feet, migraines, night sweats and fatigue like I've never known before.\n\"I'm blessed that I've had a pathological complete response to treatment.\n\"But it's been the hardest 18 months for me and my family.\n\"And I have over two more years of treatments and scans ahead.\"\nTrial lead Dr Anne Armstrong said: \"Not all breast cancers respond well to immunotherapy. \n\"Trialling the use of a drug like aspirin is exciting because it is so widely available and inexpensive to produce. \n\"We hope our trial will show that, when combined with immunotherapy, aspirin can enhance its effects and may ultimately provide a safe new way to treat breast cancer.\"\nCo-researcher Dr Rebecca Lee said their lab findings suggested that aspirin can make certain types of immunotherapy more effective by preventing the cancer from making substances that weaken the immune response. \n\"We hope aspirin can dampen down bad inflammation so the immune system can get on with the job of killing cancer cells,\" she said.

This leads to many customers being under-insured or worse having no insurance cover at all.\"\nMany storage unit operators offer insurance, but customers may shop around for cheaper deals, and some may have cover included through their home insurance policy."

Others eligible are those deemed to be at high and imminent risk, according to the Ministry of Defence.\nMr Rabb said the government expected 350 more British nationals and Afghan staff to leave the country in the next 24 hours - and that numbers should increase \"quite significantly\" if the situation stabilises.

      "text": "As the US continues its withdrawal from the Afghan capital, social media has been flooded with pictures of a helicopter evacuating people from the American embassy in Kabul.\nIt's a familiar image to some.\nBack in 1975, photographer Hubert van Es snapped a now-iconic picture of people scrambling into a helicopter on a rooftop in Saigon, at the close of the Vietnam War.\nAnalysts and US lawmakers - both Republican and Democrat - have been comparing the so-called fall of Saigon with the Taliban takeover of Kabul. \nThe Vietnam War was a conflict between the communist government of North Vietnam, and South Vietnam and its principal ally, the US.\nAgainst the backdrop of the Cold War, the North was supported by the Soviet Union and other communist allies, while the South was backed by Western forces - including hundreds of thousands of US troops.\nIt was costly and lengthy war for the US - lasting almost 20 years - and extremely divisive among Americans.\nThe phrase \"the fall of Saigon\" refers to the capture of Saigon, the South Vietnamese capital, on 30 April 1975 by communist forces of the People's Army of Vietnam and the Viet Cong. \nAmerica withdrew its military from South Vietnam in 1973, and two years later the country announced its surrender after Northern forces took Saigon - later renaming it Ho Chi Minh City, after the late North Vietnamese leader.\nLike Kabul, the city's capture came much quicker than the US had expected. \nIn response, the US abandoned its embassy in Saigon and evacuated over 7,000 American citizens, South Vietnamese and other foreign nationals by helicopter - a scramble known as Operation Frequent Wind.\nBy its end, the Vietnam War had become increasingly unpopular back in the US, and had cost not only billions of dollars but over 58,000 American lives.\nFor some, the fall of Saigon was a blow to America's standing on the world stage.\nIn the decades since, the term Vietnam Syndrome has emerged - denoting a reluctance by American voters to commit military power abroad.\nMany US policymakers have drawn parallels between Saigon and Kabul.\n\"This is Joe Biden's Saigon,\" tweeted Elise Stefanik, chair of the Republican House Conference. \"A disastrous failure on the international stage that will never be forgotten.\"\nLast month Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, dismissed the comparison.\n\"I do not see that unfolding,\" Gen Milley told reporters. \"I may be wrong, who knows, you can't predict the future, but... the Taliban just aren't the North Vietnamese army. It's not that kind of situation.\"\nSymbolism aside, there are major differences between the two. \nThe fall of Saigon took place two years after US forces were withdrawn from Vietnam. America's evacuation from Kabul, meanwhile, is happening while the US was already preparing to leave Afghanistan.\nBut while the political fallout for President Gerald Ford was limited in 1975, it's unclear what impact will be felt by President Biden, despite the war's unpopularity at home.\n\"I have little doubt that it's going to hurt Biden,\" says Christopher Phelps, an associate professor of American Studies at the University of Nottingham. \"It's going to be viewed as a loss, and possibly as a disgrace... it really was his call, fairly or not.\""

      "text": "President Joe Biden has said he stands \"squarely\" behind the US exit from Afghanistan as he faces withering criticism over the Taliban's lightning conquest of the war-torn country.\n\"How many more American lives is it worth?\" asked the Democratic president.\nHe said that despite the \"messy\" pull-out, \"there was never a good time to withdraw US forces\".\nOn Sunday, the Taliban declared victory after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled and his government collapsed.\nThe militants' return to rule brings an end to almost 20 years of a US-led coalition's presence in the country.\nKabul was the last major city in Afghanistan to fall to a Taliban offensive that began months ago but accelerated in recent days as they gained control of territories, shocking many observers.\nMr Biden's address followed a dramatic day at Kabul's international airport, where hundreds of civilians desperate to flee the country forced their way inside on Monday.  \nMany thronged the runway, running alongside a moving military transporter aircraft as it prepared for take-off. \nSome clung to the side of a plane, and at least two of them are reported to have perished when they fell from the aircraft after it had left the ground. \nAmerican troops killed two armed Afghans who were part of the crowd that breached the airport perimeter. Seven people reportedly died in total. \nThe US suspended its evacuation from Kabul but it has now resumed.\nA remarkable picture from Sunday appears to show 640 Afghans packed onboard a US military cargo plane leaving Kabul for Qatar. \nThe image, not verified by the BBC, was obtained by the US defence analysis website, Defense One. \nPanicked civilians had scrambled up the loading ramp, the website quoted US officials as saying, but the crew decided it was best to take off rather than force the Afghans off. \nIn a separate development, the Taliban have announced what they are calling a general amnesty for government officials, and have urged them to return to work.\nA statement said officials should \"continue their duties without any fear\". \nMr Biden returned on Monday to the White House from the Camp David presidential retreat to make his first public remarks on Afghanistan in nearly a week.\n\"If anything, the developments of the past week reinforce that ending US military involvement in Afghanistan now was the right decision,\" said Mr Biden.\n\"American troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves.\"\nMr Biden is facing an intense political backlash over the turmoil in Kabul following his April decision to order all American troops out of Afghanistan by 11 September - the 20 year anniversary of the terror attacks that triggered the US invasion.\nMitch McConnell, Republican Senate Minority Leader, tweeted: \"What we are seeing in Afghanistan is an unmitigated disaster. The Biden Administration's retreat will leave a stain on the reputation of the United States.\"\nFormer US President George W Bush, who authorised the military intervention in 2001, said he was \"watching the tragic events unfolding in Afghanistan with deep sadness\".\n\"The Afghans now at greatest risk are the same ones who have been on the forefront of progress inside their nation,\" Mr Bush said, stressing that the US had \"the legal authority to cut the red tape for refugees during urgent humanitarian crises\".\nIn his speech, Mr Biden said the US mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been about nation-building.\nHe said that when he was vice-president he had opposed the 2009 deployment of thousands more troops into the country by former President Barack Obama.\nMr Biden also noted he had inherited a deal negotiated with the Taliban under former President Donald Trump for the US to withdraw from Afghanistan by May of this year. \nHe said he was now the fourth US president to preside over America's longest war, and would not pass the responsibility on to a fifth.\n\"I will not mislead the American people by claiming that just a little more time in Afghanistan will make all the difference.\"\nMr Biden campaigned as a seasoned expert in foreign policy and declared after assuming office this year that \"America is back\".\nLast month he assured reporters it was \"highly unlikely\" the Taliban would overrun the entire country.\nBut he conceded on Monday that \"this did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated\".\nOn Tuesday Mr Biden's assessment was echoed by the chief of the Nato alliance, which had a leading role in combat operations and training government security forces in Afghanistan.\nNato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said while Nato forces \"never intended to stay in Afghanistan forever,\" the speed at which the Taliban took control surprised them.\nMr Stoltenberg described this rapid takeover as a \"failure of Afghan political leadership\", but said Nato also had lessons to learn.\nOpinion polls suggest most Americans support the US exiting Afghanistan.\nBut Mr Biden is facing a barrage of criticism over the manner of the departure, after he withdrew US troops then sent thousands back in to help the evacuation.\nImages emerged on Sunday showing US helicopters circling the US embassy in Kabul.\nFor many, the pictures evoked America's humiliating departure from Saigon, Vietnam, in 1975 when Mr Biden was a junior senator.\nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

      "tags": "Kabul,War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "In remote, pine-clad valleys of Afghanistan's Kunar province and in online jihadist chat forums there is jubilation at what al-Qaeda supporters see as \"a historic victory\" by the Taliban. \nThe humiliating departure of the very forces that temporarily expelled both the Taliban and al-Qaeda 20 years ago has come as a massive morale boost to anti-Western jihadists all over the world. \nThe potential hiding places for them now opening up in the country's ungoverned spaces are a tempting prize, especially for Islamic State (IS) group militants looking to find a new base after the defeat of their self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria. \nWestern generals and politicians are warning that the return of al-Qaeda to Afghanistan, in strength, is \"inevitable\". \nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, speaking after an emergency crisis meeting, warned that Western nations needed to unite to prevent Afghanistan lapsing back into becoming a haven for international terrorist groups. \nAnd on Monday UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on the UN Security Council to \"use all tools at its disposal to suppress the global terrorist threat in Afghanistan\".\nBut does a Taliban return automatically translate into a return of al-Qaeda's bases and a subsequent platform for transnational terror attacks targeting Western countries, amongst others? \nNot necessarily, no.\nThe last time the Taliban governed the whole country, from 1996-2001, Afghanistan was practically a pariah state. \nOnly three countries, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, recognised their legitimacy. \nAs well as brutalising their own population, the Taliban provided safe sanctuary for Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda organisation which orchestrated the 9/11 attacks on the US in 2001, killing nearly 3,000 people. \nAn estimated 20,000 recruits from all over the world passed through al-Qaeda's training camps, learning lethal skills and creating what became known as \"a university of terror\" as they dispersed back to their own countries.\nToday the Taliban still see themselves as the rightful - if unelected - rulers of \"the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan\" and they will want some degree of international recognition. \nThey already appear keen to project the idea that they have come to restore order, calm and authority, after the corruption, infighting and waste that has characterised much of government over the last 20 years.\nDuring the failed peace talks that took place in Doha, it was made clear to Taliban negotiators that this desired recognition could only come if they disassociated themselves completely from al-Qaeda. \nWe have done already, said the Taliban. No they haven't, says a recent UN report which pointed out the close tribal and marital links between the two groups. \nDuring the Taliban's recent dramatic takeover of the whole country, there have been numerous reported sightings of \"foreigners\" in their ranks, ie non-Afghan fighters. \nIt's also clear that there is a disconnect between the more moderate, pragmatic words spoken by the Taliban's front men - the negotiators and the spokesmen on the one hand - and some of the barbarous acts of revenge taking place on the ground.\nOn 12 August, as the Taliban were still advancing on the capital, the US charge d'affaires in Kabul tweeted: \"The Taliban's statements in Doha do not resemble their actions in Badakhshan, Ghazni, Helmand & Kandahar. Attempts to monopolise power through violence, fear and war will only lead to international isolation.\"\nThe Taliban's focus is on ruling Afghanistan according to their strict interpretation of Sharia, Islamic law, and not beyond its borders. \nBut other jihadists in al-Qaeda and IS may have different ambitions beyond those borders. It is quite possible that while the new Taliban government may even want to restrain them, there are pockets of the country where their activities could go unnoticed. \nDr Sajjan Gohel from the Asia Pacific Foundation is expecting that the current 200-500 al-Qaeda members currently thought to be in Kunar will increase.\n\"The Taliban capture of Kunar province is of enormous strategic value as it has some of the most challenging terrain with densely forested valleys. Already, al-Qaeda has a presence there which it will seek to expand.\"\nIf that happens, then it will clearly be far harder for the West to contain it. \nFor the last 20 years it has relied heavily on the NDS, the Afghan intelligence service, with its network of human informants combined with quick reaction teams of US, UK and Afghan Special Forces. \nAll that has now gone, making Afghanistan a \"hard target\" in intelligence terms. \nIf terror training camps are identified and located, then the options for Washington may well come down to distant stand-off drone strikes or cruise missile attacks, like the ones that missed Osama Bin Laden in 1998. \nMuch, says Dr Gohel, will depend on whether the Pakistani authorities either deter or enable the travel of foreign fighters through their territory to Afghanistan."

We'll have another update for you this evening.\nUnder current travel rules, people must take coronavirus tests - but the cost has drawn criticism from many quarters. Now the ex-chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority, Lord Tyrie, says PCR tests for travel - which cost about \u00a375 on average but in some cases can be in the hundreds - have become \"a predictable Covid rip-off\". Health Secretary Sajid Javid has asked for an investigation and the competition regulator, which describes the cost of PCR testing as a pressing issue, is reviewing the situation.\nUK job vacancies hit a record 953,000 in the three months to July, according to official figures. Unemployment fell to 4.7% in the three months to June, down slightly on the previous quarter, while average pay rose 7.4%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Deputy statistician Jonathan Athow said the \"world of work continues to rebound robustly\" from the pandemic.\nOrdering food and drink online or via apps is popular and has become commonplace during the pandemic, but do you think about what personal information you're handing over and why it's being requested? The Information Commissioner's Office, which oversees data privacy, says people should think about the data they are giving out and that sharing those details is a choice.\nWith nowhere to sleep, Jo and her five-year-old daughter found themselves riding around on the night bus until morning. After that night, she borrowed money from a friend. \"She would text me but I could not pay - the relationship soured,\" says Jo, which is not her real name. She is one of the millions of people who borrow money from family and friends - a scenario that has increased during the pandemic.

      "text": "UK scientists behind the AstraZeneca Covid jab have given the first trial volunteers a new plague vaccine.  \nOne of them, Larissa, 26, hopes she can help save lives by volunteering for the research, at the University of Oxford, where she studies genetics.\nThe phase-one trial will see at least 40 healthy 18- to 55-year-olds test the vaccine, which uses the same technology as the coronavirus jab. \nIts target is a centuries-old bacterial threat, not the new pandemic virus. \nFor much of the world plague is a history lesson - the most infamous plague pandemic, the Black Death that swept through Europe in the 1300s, killed as much as half of the population. \nBut there are still cases in some rural areas of Africa, Asia and America. \nAnd in 2017, an outbreak killed 171 people in Madagascar.\nAntibiotics can now be used to treat plague, if given early, \nBut many of the regions at risk of outbreaks are very remote. \nAn effective vaccine could offer a new way to protect lives. \nAnd the trial will check how well the body recognises and learns to fight the plague after vaccination. \nLarissa said: \"I'm lucky enough to live in a time where vaccines are being developed.\n\"And so, when I saw that there was a study aiming at developing a vaccine against a disease that's been around for 2000 years and has killed millions and millions of people, I didn't hesitate, I just wanted to do my bit.\"\nAsked if she was worried about side-effects, Larissa said: \"I'm not too concerned.\n\"The vaccine that's being assessed today is using the same platform as the Covid vaccine, which has literally been administered to millions of people around the world.\"\nLike the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, the jab uses a weakened version of a common-cold virus - adenovirus - from chimpanzees that has been genetically altered so it cannot cause an infection in people. \nThis vaccine does not contain plague bacterium and so cannot cause plague. \nBut it does include added genes that make proteins from the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis. \nAnd this should teach the body's immune system how to fend off the real infection, should it ever need to. \nThe same approach could be used for other diseases too, the investigators say.\n\"We've already done clinical trials using similar technology against a bacterium, meningitis B, and a virus, Zika,\" Oxford Vaccine Group senior clinical researcher Dr Maheshi Ramasamy said.\n\"But we're also looking to develop vaccines against new and emerging diseases such as Lassa fever or the Marburg virus\nThe trial, which will run for at least a year, is funded by Innovate UK, part of UK Research and Innovation, the national funding agency investing in science and research in the UK."

      "tags": "Taliban,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "There's a quote in To Kill A Mockingbird where Jem is told by Miss Maudie that \"things are never as bad as they seem.\" For Joe Biden, right now, things do look pretty dark. \nBut if I'm digging into my quotations book, who can better Kipling's If - and that line about treating triumph and failure as the impostors that they are? Politicians have been told down the ages that there is no coming back from this or that catastrophe, and - yet - back they come. \nThe shambolic unravelling of America's withdrawal from Afghanistan comes from a yet to be written textbook of \"how to lose at everything\". Warnings hadn't been heeded, intelligence was clearly totally inadequate, planning was lamentable, execution woeful. \nLet's just focus in on one thing - although there are any number that are worthy of examination. \nThe withdrawal came during the \"fighting season\" - a phrase I have to say I have always found rather odd. But in Afghanistan there is a fighting season which starts in spring - and then in winter, when the country freezes over, there is a time when the Taliban go home to their tribal homelands. Did no-one think that it might have been better to have ordered the withdrawal for the dead of winter when Taliban forces weren't there, poised to fill the vacuum? \nThe end result might have been the same - a Taliban takeover - but it would have almost certainly led to a more orderly drawdown. Yet the Biden administration wanted an eye-catching date. They wanted the withdrawal completed by 11 September. Twenty years on from 9/11 - an artificial, self-imposed deadline. \nOne more quote. After the catastrophic Bay of Pigs invasion, when Cuban emigres backed by the CIA tried to overthrow Fidel Castro, John F Kennedy - the president at the time of that debacle - noted sorrowfully that victory has a hundred fathers, but failure is an orphan.\nJoe Biden is an orphan right now. And that could have consequences for his presidency; and far more importantly how the rest of the world sees America. \nBiden's election campaign could be boiled down to three messages to distinguish himself from Donald Trump. First, he would be more empathetic. He would be more competent. And instead of \"America First\", it would be replaced by the mantra \"America is back\". \nBut in his address yesterday, there wasn't a whole lot of empathy towards the thousands of Afghans who've helped Americans these past 20 years. On competence, even his biggest cheerleaders would struggle to say the withdrawal of American troops has been anything other than shambolic. \nAnd after the bewildering events of the past few days, how exactly is America back? Many see what has unfolded on President Biden's watch in Afghanistan as a linear continuation of Donald Trump's America First policies - and, as some have joked cruelly, not as well organised. \nThat is potentially deeply damaging.\nBut on the policy itself, Joe Biden is utterly defiant. He summoned up his inner Harry Truman and made clear in his speech that the buck stops with him. He was, however, happy to distribute blame in much the same way that a muck spreader disperses manure in all directions. The Afghan leadership weren't up to it, the Afghan armed forces had no fight in them; Donald Trump had negotiated a bad deal. \nThere can be an endearing chirpiness to Joe Biden, but there's also a chippiness. He doesn't like being questioned, and on many foreign policy questions he is convinced of his own rightness. \nJoe Biden has never been a \"liberal interventionist\", thinking that liberal democracy is something that can be shipped out of Baltimore Harbour in 40ft containers and exported around the world. He thinks the US military should only be overseas to defend vital US interests. And with al-Qaeda largely beaten, Osama Bin Laden dead, it was job done. Time to come home.\nThat is a view, I should add, shared by millions of Americans. But approving of the policy is very different from the dysfunctional implementation. And what if terror groups, feeling emboldened by the Taliban victory, decide to launch their own attacks on Americans abroad - or Americans at home? Then it could be politically catastrophic. \nWhich brings us to how Western leaders see America now. A fascinating nugget from a briefing that's just been given by Joe Biden's National Security Adviser. Since the fall of Kabul, Jake Sullivan revealed, Biden hadn't spoken to another world leader. Wasn't that just a bit surprising, given that there were a lot of other nations - including Britain - who'd committed vast resources to Afghanistan? Following Sullivan's briefing, the White House announced that Biden had spoken with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\nWhen the G7 gathered in Cornwall and the Nato nations met in Brussels the sense of relief was palpable among the prime ministers and presidents that a more outward looking American president was in charge. But given what has unfolded - how America has been humiliated, how Joe Biden embarked on a policy he was cautioned against by these leaders - there is now a good deal more wariness.\nAnd who will feel they have gained most from America's departure - apart from the Taliban, of course? Why, three countries near Afghanistan - Russia, Iran and China. I'm not sure that is what Joe Biden had in mind when he said after his inauguration that \"America is back\". "

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban,Nato,United States",
      "text": "The speed of the Taliban advance in Afghanistan appears to have taken many by surprise - regional capitals seem to be falling like dominoes.   \nThe momentum is clearly with the insurgents, while the Afghan government struggles to keep its grip on power.\nThis week, one leaked US intelligence report estimated that Kabul could come under attack within weeks, and the government could collapse within 90 days. \nSo how did it unravel so quickly?\nThe US and its Nato allies - including the UK - have spent the best part of the last 20 years training and equipping the Afghan security forces. \nCountless American and British generals have claimed to have created a more powerful and capable Afghan army. Promises that today appear pretty empty.\nThe Afghan government should, in theory, still hold the upper hand with a larger force at its disposal. \nThe Afghan security forces number more than 300,000, on paper at least. That includes the Afghan army, Air Force and police.\nBut in reality the country has always struggled to meet its recruitment targets.\nThe Afghan army and police has a troubled history of high casualties, desertions and corruption - with some unscrupulous commanders claiming the salaries of troops who simply didn't exist - so called \"ghost soldiers\". \nIn its latest report to the US Congress, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan (SIGAR) expressed \"serious concerns about the corrosive effects of corruption... and the questionable accuracy of data on the actual strength of the force\". \nJack Watling, of the Royal United Services Institute, says even the Afghan army has never been sure of how many troops it actually has. \nAdded to that, he says there have been problems with maintaining equipment and morale. Soldiers are often sent to areas where they have no tribal or family connections. One reason why some may have been so quick to abandon their posts without putting up a fight.\nThe Taliban's strength is even harder to measure. \nAccording to the US Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, estimates suggest a core strength of 60,000 fighters. With the addition of other militia groups and supporters, that number could exceed 200,000.\nBut Dr Mike Martin, a Pashto-speaking former British army officer who tracked the history of the conflict in Helmand in his book An Intimate War, warns of the dangers of defining the Taliban as a single monolithic group. \nInstead he says \"the Taliban is closer to a coalition of independent franchise holders loosely - and most probably temporarily - affiliated with one another\". \nHe notes the Afghan government, too, is as riven by local factional motivations. Afghanistan's shape changing history illustrates how families, tribes and even government officials have switched sides - often to ensure their own survival.\nAgain, the Afghan government should have the advantage in terms of both funding and weapons.\nIt has received billions of dollars to pay for soldiers' salaries and equipment - mostly by the US. In its July 2021 report, SIGAR said more than $88bn (\u00a364bn) had been spent on Afghanistan's security. \nBut it ominously added: \"The question of whether that money was well spent will ultimately be answered by the outcome of the fighting on the ground.\" \nAfghanistan's Air Force should provide it with a critical edge on the battlefield. \nBut it has consistently struggled to maintain and crew its 211 aircraft (a problem that's becoming more acute with the Taliban deliberately targeting pilots). Nor is it able to meet the demands from commanders on the ground. \nHence the involvement recently of the US Air Force over cities like Lashkar Gah, which have come under Taliban attack. It's still not clear for how much longer the US is willing to provide that support. \nThe Taliban have often relied on revenue from the drugs trade, but they have also had support from outside - most notably Pakistan. \nMore recently the Taliban have seized weapons and equipment from the Afghan security forces - some of it provided by the US - including Humvees, night sights, machine guns, mortars and artillery. \nAfghanistan was already awash with weapons after the Soviet invasion, and the Taliban have shown that even the crudest can defeat a much more sophisticated force. \nThink of the deadly effect of the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) on US and British forces. That and local knowledge and an understanding of the terrain have been their advantage. \nDespite the disparate nature of the Taliban, some still see evidence of a co-ordinated plan in their recent advance. \nBen Barry, a former British army brigadier and now a senior fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies, acknowledges the Taliban gains may be opportunistic, but adds: \"If you were to write a campaign plan I would be hard pressed to come up with something better than this.\" \nHe points to the focus of the Taliban attacks in the north and west, not their traditional southern strongholds, with successive regional capitals falling into their hands.  \nThe Taliban have also captured key border crossings and checkpoints, funnelling off much needed customs revenue away from the cash-strapped government.   \nThey've also stepped up targeted killings of key officials, human rights activists, and journalists. Slowly but surely wiping out some of the small gains made over the last 20 years. \nAs for the Afghan government's strategy - that's proving harder to define. \nPromises of taking back all the territory captured by the Taliban sound increasingly hollow. \nMr Barry says there appears to be a plan to keep hold of the larger cities. Afghan commandos have already been deployed to prevent Lashkar Gah in Helmand from falling. \nBut for how much longer? \nAfghan special forces are relatively small in number, around 10,000 strong, and they're already stretched. \nThe Taliban also appear to be winning the propaganda war and the battle of the narrative. \nMr Barry says their momentum on the battlefield has boosted morale and given them a sense of unity. \nIn contrast, the Afghan government has been on the backfoot, bickering and sacking generals. \nThe situation certainly looks bleak for the Afghan government. \nBut Jack Watling of RUSI says that while it looks increasingly pessimistic for the Afghan military, \"the situation could still be saved by politics\". \nIf the government can win over tribal leaders, he says, there is still the chance of a stalemate. \nThis is a view echoed by Mike Martin, who points to the return of former warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum to Mazar-i-Sharif as a significant moment. He's already cutting deals. \nThe summer fighting season will soon be over as the Afghan winter sets in - making manoeuvre more difficult for forces on the ground. \nIt is still possible that there'll be a stalemate by the end of the year, and the Afghan government will cling on to Kabul and a string of larger cities. \nThe tide could even turn if the Taliban fracture. \nBut at present it appears that the US and Nato's efforts to bring peace, security and stability to Afghanistan have been as futile as the Soviets before them.

      "tags": "Tourism,Competition and Markets Authority,Coronavirus testing,UK economy,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "PCR tests for travel have become \"a predictable Covid rip-off\", says the former chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority, Lord Tyrie.\nLord Tyrie said the competition regulator had been \"too slow to react\" to complaints about testing providers.\nHolidaymakers have objected to high prices and poor service from many of the 400-plus test firms listed on the government's website.\nTests cost about \u00a375 on average, but prices can reach hundreds.\nLast week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid asked the CMA to investigate \"excessive\" pricing and \"exploitative practices\" among PCR Covid test firms.\nInitially, the CMA said it would take up to a month to report back. But after a chorus of objection from the travel industry, the CMA said it was reviewing the situation \"immediately\".\nLord Tyrie told the BBC that the CMA \"could and should have been better prepared\". \n\"It should either be acting already directly using existing powers. Or if deemed inadequate for the job, it should be advising the government on how to obtain a quick remedy, whether by legislation or by other means,\" he said.\n\"This advice should already be with the government.\"\nLord Tyrie left the competition watchdog last summer after two years in the post, suggesting the role prevented him leading a more aggressive campaign for change. \nHe added: \"The CMA acted much more quickly to quell price-gouging on hand sanitiser and other Covid-related products 18 months ago. Far from building on this success, boldness appears to have taken a back seat.\"\nLord Tyrie reflected that \"the CMA is full of able and highly motivated people, keen to tackle detriment like this\". \n\"Their energies need to be released from an excess of caution at the highest levels,\" he added.\nAt the weekend, the cost of NHS coronavirus tests for international arrivals to the UK was reduced. Test and Trace tests were cut from \u00a388 to \u00a368 for people arriving from green-listed countries, as well as for those coming from amber-listed countries who are fully vaccinated.\nMeanwhile, the price of two tests for amber arrivals who have not had both jabs has been cut from \u00a3170 to \u00a3136.\nIt is understood the price cut is an attempt to drive down the cost across the market, so other operators will follow. \nCriticism of the government's decision to implement PCR Covid testing for all UK arrivals has been significant from the travel sector. \nLast week, major airports including the Manchester Airport Group and Gatwick Airport, along with tour operator Tui, cited the testing policy as a major barrier to travel restarting and the industry recovering. \nThe government said its top priority was to protect public health and it continued to work with industry to help them navigate this difficult period.\nLord Tyrie said that the slow response of the CMA was likely to mean it was too late to offer a full remedy to the market before the peak holiday season comes to a close and people return to work and school in September.\nBut the CMA said: \"These comments are inaccurate.\" \nThe watchdog said it gave advice to Department of Health and Social Care officials about the PCR testing market in April and \"we gave further advice to the secretary of state last week\". \nA spokesperson for the CMA said: \"We continue to work closely with Department of Health and Social Care in reviewing the market and, as we have made clear, we will not hesitate to take enforcement action ourselves if there are breaches of consumer law. \n\"Since the start of the pandemic, the CMA has secured hundreds of millions of pounds in refunds for people who have been treated unfairly, in sectors including holiday accommodation and package travel.\""

      "text": "New Zealand has announced a snap lockdown after a man tested positive for Covid, the first case in six months.\nThe case was detected in Auckland, which will be in lockdown for a week, while the rest of the country will be in lockdown for three days.\nAuthorities say they are working on the assumption that the new case was the Delta variant.\nJust around 20% of its population has been fully vaccinated.\nCoromandel, a coastal town where the infected person had visited, will be in lockdown for seven days too.\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the toughest \"level 4\" rules were required - closing schools, offices and all businesses with only essential services remaining operational.\n\"I want to assure New Zealand that we have planned for this eventuality. Going hard and early has worked for us before,\" she said.\nThe patient is a 58-year-old man, who is believed to have been infectious since last Thursday.  \nThere are at least 23 potential sites of transmission. \nThere was reportedly a rush at supermarkets in Auckland, as locals anticipated a snap lockdown.\nOfficials said there was a need for strong response because of the fear of the Delta variant, and because there was no clear link between the new case and the border or quarantine facilities.\nData released by New Zealand's Ministry of Health on Monday showed that all Covid-19 cases detected at the country's border in recent weeks had been Delta.\n\"We have seen what can happen elsewhere if we fail to get on top of it. We only get one chance,\" Ms Ardern said in a televised national address, calling the Delta strain \"a game changer\".\nNew Zealand has been successful in eliminating the virus from within its borders, although its international borders remain largely closed.\nHowever, its vaccination programme has rolled out at a slow pace, with only around 20% of people fully vaccinated and 33% of people having received one dose, according to Our World in Data.
