      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's reshuffle continues as he plans to \"build back better from the pandemic and deliver on your priorities\". He will be rebuilding his ministerial team following a cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday which saw Gavin Williamson - who was criticised over his handling of schools and exams during the pandemic - sacked. He was replaced by vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Johnson is due to rejig junior and middle-ranking ministers.\nWhat happens to home working when we move into a post pandemic world? Most office workers will never return full-time, according to a survey for the BBC, with the majority saying they would prefer to work from home either full-time or at least some of the time. And a total of 70% of 1,684 people polled predicted that workers would \"never return to offices at the same rate\". However, there are concerns from managers creativity in the workplace would be affected.\nHeavy and delayed periods and unexpected bleeding after having the Covid vaccine has been not only been talked about, but reported to the UK's regulator. After reviewing more than 30,000 reports, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says it \"does not support a link\" between the jab and the symptoms. But leading immunologist specialising in fertility, Dr Victoria Male says the link should be investigated to reassure women. She says the body's immune response was the likely cause, not something in the vaccines.\nIt's usually used to treat parasitic infections in animals such as horses, but in the US a drug called Ivermectin is being touted as a way of treating or preventing for Covid-19. It's not been approved use in that way but people still take it. Ros Atkins looks into why.\nThis one might strike a chord with you. It turns out about 1m people in the UK\u00a0learnt an instrument and others took music lessons during the pandemic. Jaz Ampaw-Farr is one of them. She missed out on learning an instrument as a child but lockdown gave her the chance to change that.

      "tags": "Edinburgh,Burntisland,Kirkcaldy",
      "text": "A former athletics coach has been jailed for rape and serious sexual offences against teenage girls in Fife. \nEric Simpson raped one girl and subjected four other victims to indecent assaults and lewd behaviour between 1981 and 1999. \nAt the High Court in Paisley the 73-year-old from Kirkcaldy was jailed for eight years over the \"monstrous\" abuse. \nHe denied the offences but was found guilty of seven charges at the High Court in Edinburgh last month. \nThe offences occurred in Kirkcaldy and Burntisland as well as at an Edinburgh school.\nSimpson was finally brought to justice when one victim - now in her 50s - went to police in 2018, sparking a large scale abuse probe.\nShe had seen a photograph which featured him still involved in athletics posing with a young girl.\nSentencing Simpson, Lord Arthurson said: \"In light of the jury's verdict, you come across as a Jekyll and Hyde character.\n\"Your crimes against your victims in this case was nothing short of monstrous. You have displayed limited regret and lack victim empathy.\"\nJurors heard that the victim who initially went to police had wanted to protect other young girls from potential abuse.\nThe court was told Simpson previously boasted that it was difficult working with girls when they all fancied him.\nOne victim was initially molested by Simpson during massages before he ended up raping her.\nShe told the trial: \"He used to put music on and say it made him think of me.\n\"It was 'Young Girl'.\"\nAnother said he also played the Gary Puckett and The Union Gap hit when he preyed on her.\nThis woman added she can no longer listen to the song. She was only 13 when Simpson made inappropriate remarks.\nRecalling the ordeal at his hands, the witness added: \"I was frozen. I was too scared to do anything.\"\nThree other girls were also targeted including one who he pulled on to his knee and kissed.\nAfter police were alerted, detectives contacted various people who had been coached by Simpson in a career which spanned from the 1970s until his suspension in 2018.\nSimpson was also put on the sex offenders list indefinitely.\nHis lawyer Krista Johnston said he was \"devoted\" to athletics, and now his reputation as a coach was in \"jeopardy\". \n\"He coached 15 British and two Paralympic champions,\" she said.\n\"He does not agree with the conviction, but has to accept the punishment.\""

      "tags": "Commercial space travel,SpaceX,Human spaceflight,Astronauts,Space exploration,United States",
      "text": "Four amateur astronauts have blasted off from Florida on their private mission to orbit.\nThe Inspiration4 crew, comprising one billionaire and three \"ordinary citizens\", rode out of the Kennedy Space Center in a Dragon capsule provided by the SpaceX rocket company.  \nThe quartet will spend the next three days circling the Earth.\nIt's another milestone in the space tourism market, which is experiencing a resurgence after a decade's hiatus.\nEarlier this summer, billionaire businessmen Sir Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos went above Earth's atmosphere in their own space vehicles.\nAnd following this latest mission, there'll be three privateer visits to the International Space Station (ISS) - one in October, carrying a Russian movie director and an actress, and two either side of the New Year.\nThe Inspiration4 crew of Jared Issacman, Hayley Arceneaux, Sian Proctor and Chris Sembroski have had six months of intensive training with SpaceX. However, onboard computer systems will be in control of their Dragon capsule, overseen by SpaceX teams on the ground. \nThe Dragon is not going anywhere near the ISS. It's on a \"free flight\" to a target altitude of 575km (360 miles). That's about 150km above the orbiting laboratory, and roughly the height from where the Hubble Space Telescope views the cosmos.\nEven if they don't have a destination as such, the foursome will have plenty to keep them occupied. They've taken up scientific experiments to be conducted inside their Dragon capsule, and SpaceX has modified their temporary home to include a big window, which the crew is sure to be using during downtime to wonder at the Earth below.\nThe Inspiration4 venture was purchased from SpaceX by Mr Isaacman, 38, who made his fortune developing systems to process credit card payments. But rather than go on an \"outing with fishing buddies\", he decided, as he saw it, to inject real purpose into the flight.\nSo, he gifted the three adjacent seats to people with inspirational stories.\nThis is perhaps best illustrated in 29-year-old Hayley Arceneaux. She overcame bone cancer as a child and as an adult has gone back to work for the medical facility that cured her - the St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Mr Isaacman wants to raise $200m for St Jude's work.\nDr Sian Proctor, 51, is a geoscientist and science communicator. She actually came close to being a Nasa astronaut in 2009 but missed out in the final round of selection. Dr Proctor won her seat through her role as an artist and by demonstrating her entrepreneurial skills. She plans to paint while looking out the Dragon's domed window.\nChris Sembroski, 42, is a US Air Force veteran and works as an engineer with aerospace company Lockheed Martin. He'd made a donation to St Jude that also entered him into a lottery draw for the fourth position in the crew.\nMr Sembroski didn't win the lottery - but a friend did, and asked him to take the place.\nSpaceX and Inspiration4 have described Wednesday's launch as the first \"all-civilian mission to orbit\". That depends very much on your definition of \"civilian\". The first man to walk on the Moon, Neil Armstrong, was technically a civilian, having resigned his Navy commission in 1960, nine years before Apollo 11.\nBut there's no doubting the Dragon flight commanded by Mr Isaacman has significance.\nSpace activity - even human spaceflight - is becoming ever more commercial, and the idea that people can go to orbit outside of the purview of the major national space agencies will increasingly look normal.\nThe 2000s saw several super-wealthy individuals spend a fortnight on the ISS. That particular era of space tourism ended in 2009 when spare seats on Russian rockets were bought up for the exclusive use of Nasa astronauts. But this second era looks as though it will be more resilient, simply because there are many more private space companies chasing the business, and this should bring down prices for a wider pool of customers.\nElon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, is intent on making humans \"a multi-planet species\".\nAnd Mr Isaacman regards Inspiration4 as a signpost of where things are going. He was very keen that his Dragon go higher than astronauts usually go. And not since the final shuttle servicing mission of Hubble in 2009 have people been to an altitude above 570km.\n\"We've been going to the space station (420km) for some time, and there's just unbelievable science and research and great contributions that are coming out of there. But if we're going to go to the Moon again, and we're going to go to Mars and beyond, we've got to get a little outside of our comfort zone and take that next step in that direction,\" he said before launch. \"So that was really the rationale (for our choice of altitude).\"\nSome commentators have voiced concern about the collective impact on the Earth's climate of spaceflights like this one.\nSpaceX's Falcon-9 rocket uses highly refined kerosene fuel which produces the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), along with nitrogen oxides, which also contribute to warming. Emissions from rocket launches remain tiny compared with the aviation industry, though they are projected to grow."

      "tags": "Social care,Welsh government,Llangollen,Care homes,Penarth,Insurance,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Care home owners have said they are struggling to find insurance against Covid-19 claims, which could lead to closures.\nThey want the Welsh government to provide an indemnity similar to the one which protects the NHS.\nAnd they have also called the UK government's backing of insurance indemnity for live events a \"slap in the face\" for the care sector. \nThe Welsh government said it is a UK-wide issue.\nIt added it was working with other governments to find a solution.\nPublic liability insurance is a legal requirement for care home registration but owners have reported the cost has doubled or trebled in some cases.\nBut the insurance does not protect from claims relating to Covid-19, leaving homes vulnerable to potentially high pay-outs - unlike within the NHS, where the government provides this indemnity, or protection.\nThe risk, along with other challenges the sector has faced during the pandemic, could lead to more homes closing.\nMary Wimbury, chief executive of Care Forum Wales, said those in the sector were \"very let down\" because they feel the care they have provided for vulnerable people was treated as less important than the music and live events industry.\nLast month, the UK government announced a \u00a3750m scheme which protects music festivals and live events if they have to cancel because of Covid-19.\nMs Wimbury called on the Welsh government to introduce an indemnity scheme similar to that and the one which protects the NHS from claims.\n\"If a care home was to be sued, they might not be covered at all and potentially would have to close,\" she said.\n\"The care sector has kept caring for really vulnerable people and it's had to do that under really difficult conditions and it does feel like a slap in the face that the UK government has given an indemnity to the music industry but not to the care sector.\"\nOwners also said it makes them more risk averse when it comes to visitors. \nBethan Mascarenhas, manager of The Old Vicarage in Llangollen, Denbighshire, said while they had not had any cases of Covid, it was still one of the biggest risks and legal action could lead to the home closing.\n\"This isn't us over-worrying - these are things that could potentially happen,\" she said.\nShe said there was an injustice, adding older people were often \"forgotten and pushed to the bottom of the priority list\".\n\"Everybody else is able to get back to partying and having a great time but we're asking for insurance cover so they can see their loved ones and be connected again. There's a huge disparity,\" she said.\nJustin Otto-Jones, who helps run Parkside House in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, called the situation \"plainly unsatisfactory\".\nShe added: \"It's frustrating as we have been raising this for more than a year with Welsh government.\n\"It is a major worry and adds to the perfect storm that care homes have been facing which includes staffing issues and fatigue.\"\nResident at the Old Vicarage Audrey Dunbebin said: \"To be able to feel in contact with your friends and family is very nice, it makes you feel very at home.\n\"It is very important, it connects you with your old life.\"\nFellow resident Bill Bosson added: \"It's important to keep the connection all the time because if you don't I think you'd go into a recluse in as much as I'd fall out of everything, whereas they [friends and family] keep me going.\" \nThe Welsh government said more than \u00a3185m had been given to the adult social care sector with more coming until the end of the financial year. \nA spokesman added: \"Our policy on care home visiting has evolved throughout the pandemic, informed by public health advice.\"\nThe Association of British Insurers recognised the market for care homes was challenging and said insurers were working with care homes on managing risks to increase the chances of getting cover. \nA spokesman said: \"Premise managers and local authorities should speak to their insurance adviser or broker to explore their options.\""

      "title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth: Why is a UK aircraft carrier going on a world tour?",
      "tags": "Royal Navy,UK defence spending,HMS Queen Elizabeth",
      "text": "Britain is about to embark on a world tour - in the shape of the Royal Navy's aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by a fleet of warships. \nThe Royal Navy says it will be the most powerful UK naval deployment in a generation.\nThe government sees the fleet, named the Carrier Strike Group, as a potent symbol of \"Global Britain\" - and as proof of Boris Johnson's promise to restore the Royal Navy as Europe's foremost naval power and end what he called an \"era of retreat\".\nThe prime minister spent this morning on board HMS Queen Elizabeth in Portsmouth naval base, ahead of its maiden operational deployment.\nBut is this world tour more than a symbol of national virility or a flag-waving exercise?\nAnd what's the point of sailing halfway across the world?\nOver the next 28 weeks the Carrier Strike Group will cover 26,000 miles - further than the distance around the world at the equator.\nHMS Queen Elizabeth will first sail into the Mediterranean. From there, she is planning to launch her F-35 jets to conduct airstrikes over Iraq against the group known as Islamic State.\nIt would be the carrier's first combat operation - even though the RAF has been doing the same mission for the past seven years from its land base on Cyprus. \nPerhaps more controversial is the decision to then go east. The strike group will sail through the Suez Canal, out to the Indian Ocean and on to the Philippine Sea.\nHMS Queen Elizabeth is scheduled to make a number of port stops along way - including Oman, Singapore, South Korea and Japan.\nLike the US, Britain is responding to the rise of China. But unlike America, Britain has less influence and fewer resources to match.\nFor UK foreign policy it means a more modest \"tilt\" to Asia rather than the US \"pivot\".\nHMS Queen Elizabeth will be accompanied by two Royal Navy Frigates, two Destroyers, two supply ships and -  beneath the surface - an Astute Class Submarine.\nAn American Navy Destroyer and a Dutch Frigate will be part of the strike group.\nThere'll also be more American jets on board the carrier: 10 US Marine Corps F-35s compared to the Britain's eight.\nThe government insists the addition of allies is a sign of strength rather than weakness. But it is also an indication that Britain's Armed Forces are now smaller and can do less on their own. \nThe strike group will sail through the South China Sea where China has been expanding its claim to territorial waters.\nBut Defence Secretary Ben Wallace insists Britain is not looking for a \"confrontation\". Instead, he says the carrier group will exercise its right to freedom of navigation.\nSo do not expect a repeat of what happened in 2018 when another Royal Navy Warship, HMS Albion, deliberately sailed close to the disputed Paracel Islands, prompting an angry response from Beijing. \nThese sensitivities highlight ambiguities in Britain's policy towards China. The British government says it still wants a constructive relationship - not least on trade.\nTwo former defence chiefs have questioned the decision to send the strike group east.\nLord Nicholas Houghton recently told MPs that \"it was not necessarily the best way of seeking an accommodation\" with Beijing, while Lord David Richards said Britain should be focusing its attention closer to home \"on Nato and the Euro-Atlantic area\". \nBut the deployment has as much to do with boosting trade and strengthening diplomatic ties in the region.\nAt sea it'll be conducting military exercises with allies, including Japan, Australia and the US. During her port visits, HMS Queen Elizabeth will become a giant floating trade and diplomatic mission.\nIn the words of the head of the Royal Navy, Admiral Tony Radakin: \"Navies follow trade and trade follows navies.\"\nHe says this deployment shows the Navy is \"flying the flag for Britain and carrying forward the prime minister's vision\" of a \"Global Britain\".\nSome argue there might have been better ways of sending a strong message to China.\nDr Peter Roberts, director of military sciences at RUSI, a defence and security think tank, says that instead of what he calls \"a predictable, long and slow deployment\", the Royal Navy could have dispatched two of its hunter-killer submarines.\nIf they set off north, under the Arctic ice, and then popped up in the Pacific, he suggests, that would have had a greater impact on challenging both Russian and Chinese behaviour.\nThe former national security adviser, Lord Peter Ricketts, believes it still makes sense to send the carrier east as a \"symbol of working closely with allies\".\nThis is not least to get a return on the significant investment in the Royal Navy's two new aircraft carriers. But, he adds, \"this is a piece of diplomatic theatre, not a military strategy\". "

      "text": "An 86-year-old woman had to wait eight hours for an ambulance after falling and breaking her hip at home.\nLillian Briggs, who has Parkinson's, skin cancer and has had two heart attacks, was left lying on her kitchen floor in agony after blacking out.\nHer son, Robert Ewing, and his sister rang for an ambulance a number of times only to be told their mother was in the system but was not a priority.\nMr Ewing told BBC Scotland: \"I thought she was going to die in front of us.\"\nThe Scottish Ambulance Service apologised for the delay and confirmed it was investigating the circumstances.\nChief executive Pauline Howie told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"These waits are appalling and they are not something we aspire to as an ambulance service.\"\nAfter receiving a call from his sister following his mother's fall in Edinburgh on Monday, the 60-year-old found his mother semi-conscious in a confused state.\nHis sister kept calling for an ambulance but after seven hours he called them himself and was told they knew about his mother, she was on the system and could he stop calling.\n\"I said hopefully you'll be here before my mother dies because my mum's in a bad way now,\" he said.\n\"I just held my mum's hand. She had a couple of bruises and a bashed face so I wiped her face and reassured her, put a cover over her to try to keep her warm as best I could - I couldn't move her because she was in a lot of pain - really bad pain. \n\"We aren't medically trained, we just did our best. My sister was getting more and more agitated and upset. My mum was getting worse, she was turning blue, her jaw was going, her breathing was getting shallower - she was in a bad state.\n\"I actually thought she was going to die in the house in front of us. Even now I can feel myself getting upset about it.\"\nMr Ewing added: \"I'd heard stories about them having trouble emptying the ambulances at the Royal Infirmary but I thought after seven, eight hours, 'goodness, it can't take that long - surely she must be a priority by now'.\"\nMrs Briggs is now in hospital in a stable condition following surgery but is on oxygen after developing a chest infection.\nHer case was raised during First Minister's Questions earlier on Thursday.\n\"Nicola Sturgeon says it's going to be fully investigated but what does that mean?,\" Mr Ewing said. \"Is she going to get in touch with us and tell us why my poor mother had to lie there for eight hours?\n\"I just want a reason as to why she had to lie there for that amount of time in a critical condition because, as far as I'm concerned, a broken hip is a critical condition and she was in an awful lot of pain.\n\"I just don't want others to go through what we had to suffer and what my mum is still suffering.\"\nThe Scottish government has now asked the MoD for military assistance for the country's ambulance service.\nNicola Sturgeon said health services were dealing with the most challenging combination of circumstances in their history due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nOpposition politicians have highlighted a series of serious ambulance delays, including one where a man died after a 40-hour wait.\nMr Ewing said getting military help could have happened sooner once the government knew Covid cases were rising and hospitals were getting busier again.\n\"Why didn't Nicola Sturgeon put in place a plan of action two or three weeks ago?,\" he said. \"I don't think she would like her mother lying there in agony.\"\nHe said the first minister's apology to all those who had to wait for an ambulance was \"just words\".\nScottish Ambulance Service chief executive Pauline Howie was asked on Good Morning Scotland if the two cases highlighted in the media were \"anomalies\".\nShe said: \"The vast majority of patients, for immediately life-threatening patients, will receive a response under 10 minutes and for other emergency patients, under 40 minutes.\"\nThe chief executive confirmed the service would apologise directly to the families and share the findings of its reviews into the circumstances.\nMs Howie also described the current pressures on the NHS as \"unprecedented\" and added staff face an \"extremely challenging\" winter."

      "text": "Former BBC presenter Andrew Neil says he left GB News over the direction the channel was taking, saying he became a \"minority of one\" within management. \nThe journalist told BBC Question Time he would let people \"make up their own minds\" over whether his exit was because the channel was too right wing.\nHe also described the launch of the new station as not a \"startling success\".\nNeil resigned on Monday as lead presenter and chairman just three months after the channel went to air.\nIn a statement at the time, he said he had decided to \"reduce [his] commitments on a number of fronts\" - something he repeated on BBC One - and wished it well for the future. \nIn response, GB News said: \"Andrew is without doubt one of the finest journalists and interviewers in this country.\n\"GB News thanks him for his 12 months of leadership, wisdom and advice, and we wish him well.\"\nThe TV channel launched in June, promising to \"change the face of news and debate in the UK\".\nIt recruited a number of big names alongside Neil, including former BBC News presenter Simon McCoy, ITV veteran Alastair Stewart and ex-Sun journalist Dan Wootton.\nBut it has been troubled by low viewing figures and resignations from other staff members, including the former advisor to Boris Johnson and ex-BBC correspondent Guto Harri. \nNeil, 72, was on air for less than two weeks before announcing he was taking a break. amid reports that relations between him and chief executive Angelos Frangopoulos had broken down over the direction of the company.\nIn his first appearance since leaving the channel, Neil was asked by a Question Time audience member whether the recent resignations would lead GB News to become \"a new British Fox News\" - the US news channel popular with right-wing viewers. \nThe journalist said he had \"always made it clear it wouldn't be a British Fox News\", claiming the US channel \"deals in untruths, it deals in conspiracy theories, and it deals in fake news\".\nHe added: \"That is not my kind of journalism and I would never have set out to do that.\"\nBut pressed on whether the comparison was why he left, Neil said: \"I will let you draw your own conclusions as to why I am here tonight and not with GB News.\"\nHe added: \"In the run-up to the launch, through the launch and in the aftermath of the launch and I think most of you who know anything about it will know you couldn't file the launch under startling success, more and more differences emerged between myself and the other senior managers and the board of GB News.\n\"And rather than these differences narrowing, they got wider and wider and I felt it was best that if that's the route they wanted to take then that's up to them, it's their money.\"\nPushed again by presenter Fiona Bruce on whether the channel had gone \"too far to the right\", Neil said: \"People should make up their own minds on that. \n\"What I have told you is the differences were such, the direction they were going in was not the direction that I had outlined, it was not the direction that I had envisaged for the channel and I was in the minority of one. \n\"So it is doing what it is doing and it is up to them, good luck to them if that is what they want to do, but it wasn't going to be with me.\""

      "text": "A mother has won a High Court battle over the regulation of a landfill site accused of emitting noxious gases that risk shortening her son's life. \nLawyers representing Mathew Richards say hydrogen sulphide (H2S) gas from Walleys Quarry, in Staffordshire, has worsened his underlying health issues.\nThe Environment Agency (EA) must now take more action to control emissions.\nMr Justice Fordham said he was not satisfied the EA had complied with its legal duties.\nIn delivering the court's 55-page judgement, Mr Justice Fordham said he was \"satisfied that there is a direct effect on Mathew's home, family life and private life from adverse effects of severe environmental pollution\".\nMathew's mother Rebecca Currie, who lives approximately 400m (1,312 ft) away from the landfill, said she was \"overwhelmed\" and felt a sense of \"weird relief that my son is now going to breathe fresh air\".\n\"It really has not been nice but I am hoping now Mathew is going to be able to go out and play in the garden, go to the local park and not be poisoned,\" she said.\n\"The thought that a government body, the Environment Agency, was letting this happen and basically it was killing my son... I was really, really, angry and just glad now they've got to do something about it.\"\nThe family's solicitor Rebekah Carrier said it had been a \"David and Goliath case, where a mother has faced up to the government agency which is supposed to protect public health and yet has failed so badly to do so\".\nShe said if the EA failed to take the action set out by the court then further legal action might be taken.\nIn response, the Environment Agency said: \"We have every sympathy with the local community, who should not have to live with the distress caused by landfill gas being released from Walleys Quarry.\n\"We will continue to use our regulatory powers to require Walleys Quarry Ltd to bring hydrogen sulphide emissions under control.\"\nThe landfill's operator, Walleys Quarry Ltd, said it noted the judgement and would take advice on what it means in practice \"given significant changes have been in progress for some time\".\nCEO Nigel Bowen said: \"We will work with the Environment Agency and other local stakeholders to continue our work to mitigate local concerns and update the community as appropriate.\"\nLawyers representing the mother told a two-day High Court hearing in August there was a \"public health emergency\" and argued H2S emissions were affecting \"hundreds and probably thousands of local people\" near the site in Silverdale, near Newcastle-under-Lyme.\nThey asked for a court order requiring the EA to take \"effective measures\" to remove the risk to Mathew's life and his family's home posed by the noxious gas, which has a pungent eggy odour.\nMathew was born prematurely at 26 weeks with a chronic lung disease and needed oxygen support for 19 months. His doctor told the hearing the emissions were preventing his recovery and he risked developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the future.\nMrs Currie said it had been horrendous seeing her son cough, choke and vomit, adding: \"You are going in his bedroom in the morning and you are just like hit by a brick wall of this toxic gas.\"\nIn response, the EA had argued there was not a real and immediate risk to the five-year-old's life and it had already taken measures to monitor and control air quality levels.\nAfter considering the evidence, Mr Justice Fordham ruled \"real and significant change\" was required \"as a matter of urgency\".\nWhile he said he would not rule if there was a current breach by the watchdog, he said he was \"not satisfied, on the evidence, that the EA has yet addressed its legal duties in the way that it must\".\nThe judge called on the EA to ensure off-site odours are reduced and that daily H2S levels are cut to a safe level by January 2022, to meet standards set out by authorities in the United States and by Public Health England.\nThat would mean reducing concentrations of hydrogen sulphide in the area to one part per billion, less than an eighth of the current levels.\nHe said the measures should \"make a very real difference so far as the air which Mathew (and his community) breathes\". \nOne of the Environment Agency's duties is to tell polluters what they must do to clean up the mess they have created. \nAt the same time its decisions and actions must take into account basic protections that everybody has under the Human Rights Act.   \nIn this unprecedented case, Mathew's lawyers argued that the EA had failed to protect his right to life because it had not come up with a plan, given the real and immediate risk that he faced.   \nThe judge's ruling is highly significant because it forces the agency to make sure the action plan it must now come up with takes into account the little boy's long-term health prospects.  \nThe judgment could play a role in future environment cases where someone else can similarly show that there is a real risk that their life will be shortened later by a failure to act against pollution now.  \nThe EA said it would \"seek to appeal some aspects of the judgment\", but it \"in no way affects or changes our determination to tackle the problems at this site in the interests of the claimant, the community and the environment\".\nThe EA was refused leave to appeal by the High Court, but could take the case to the Court of Appeal.\nMs Carrier said she hoped the regulator would \"put these complex legal proceedings behind it and get on and do its job and protect the people of Silverdale\". \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Michael D Higgins,Republic of Ireland",
      "text": "The leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has called for Irish President Michael D Higgins to reconsider his decision to turn down an invite to a church service to mark Northern Ireland's centenary.\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson said \"politics are at play\" in the decision.\nEarlier, the Alliance Party also said President Higgins should reconsider.\nThe Queen has been invited to the service, which has been organised by Christian church leaders.\nIt will take place at the Church of Ireland cathedral in Armagh city on 21 October.\nThe inter-denominational service is part of a programme of events to mark the centenary of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921.\nOn Wednesday, a spokesperson for President Higgins said he was \"not in a position to attend the ceremony and this has been communicated to the organisers\".\nIt is understood he had been expected to attend. He did not offer any further explanation of his decision.\nRT\u00c9 reports that the Irish government said it did not advise President Higgins to decline an invitation to attend the church service.\nBut the Irish government told BBC News NI that \"the president's diary is a matter for the president and it would not be appropriate to comment\".\n\"Any invitation for a government representative to attend the ceremony will be considered,\" it added.\nSir Jeffrey, who has written to President Higgins about the matter, said it was a \"disappointing and retrograde step\" by the president.\n\"We hope he will rethink this decision - it is not conducive to the kind of respectful relationship with the head of state of our neighbouring jurisdiction,\" he said.\n\"In the absence of clarity around the reason for him not attending many may reach a conclusion that it is a decision based on politics.\"\nSir Jeffrey said the service was about \"marking the centenary\", which he added was a \"fairly neutral term\".\nFormer Presbyterian Moderator Dr John Dunlop said he was disappointed by the decision.\n\"This is a time when I think you have to consolidate bridges especially in a time like this when things between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland or between Ireland and Northern Ireland are a bit fraught and a bit fragile,\" he said.\nAlliance Party MP Stephen Farry also said President Higgins should reconsider his position.\n\"This event is very much in keeping with the reconciliation efforts of successive Irish presidents and the Queen over recent years and the inclusive approach to marking the decade of centenaries,\" he said.\nHowever independent assembly member Trevor Lunn, formerly of the Alliance Party, tweeted in support of the president's decision.\n\"I don't see it as a discourtesy to Her Majesty, just a correct if difficult decision,\" he wrote.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said people should take President Higgins \"at his word when he says he can not be there\". \nMr Eastwood said President Higgins had a track record of reconciliation.\nHe said: \"President Higgins' term has been marked by diversity and reaching out to all traditions across our island. \n\"He has been an advocate of bringing people together and I think people should not read too much into this given all that he has done for community relations and reconciliation across Ireland.\"\nUlster Unionist Party assembly member Mike Nesbitt described the move as \"surprising and uncharacteristic from someone who has shown a consistent willingness to reach out and promote reconciliation\".\n\"The reciprocal state visits were a high watermark in Anglo-Irish relations and until we know the reason why he is not in a position to attend, we cannot be critical,\" he said.\nThe leader of Aont\u00fa, Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn, said President Higgins had made \"the right decision not to attend the event\".\n\"There isn't a president in the world that would attend an event to mark, commemorate or celebrate the partition of his or her country,\" he said.\nThe Independent Group of Senators in the Republic of Ireland has expressed its concern at President Higgins' decision.\nSenator Gerard Craughwell, who is a member of the group, said he was \"deeply disappointed\".\n\"It is a commemoration service, not a celebration service, so there should be no political connotations whatsoever to the event,\" he told BBC News NI.\nSo far the church leaders have made no comment about the issue.\nPresident Higgins is in Italy and has not yet responded to calls for him to reconsider his decision or give his reasons."

      "title": "Five Eyes: Is the alliance in trouble over China?",
      "tags": "GCHQ,CIA,China,MI6,Jacinda Ardern,New Zealand,Australia",
      "text": "The Five Eyes alliance is an intelligence-sharing arrangement between five English-speaking democracies: the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It evolved during the Cold War as a mechanism for monitoring the Soviet Union and sharing classified intelligence. It is often described as the world's most successful intelligence alliance. But recently it has suffered an embarrassing setback. \nFour of the members have jointly condemned China's treatment of its Uyghur population in Xinjiang province. They have also expressed concern over China's de facto military takeover of the South China Sea, its suppression of democracy in Hong Kong and its threatening moves towards Taiwan, which China has vowed to \"take back\" by 2049. One country, though, has opted out of confronting China: New Zealand. \nSurprisingly, perhaps, for a nation that prides itself on respect for human rights, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta declined to join in this Western condemnation of Beijing, saying \"it felt uncomfortable\" with expanding the alliance's role by putting pressure on China in this way. Although New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern admitted on Monday that its differences with China are becoming \"harder to reconcile\", the country still prefers to pursue its own bilateral relations with Beijing.\nChina's state media has made much of this, talking of a wedge been driven between the two neighbours and allies, Australia and New Zealand.\nChina is New Zealand's largest export market; New Zealand depends on China for close to 30% of its exports, mostly dairy products. So does Australia, but the two Antipodean neighbours clearly view China's policies in a very different light. \nAustralia's federal government in Canberra has vetoed a major Chinese investment in the state of Victoria which was to be part of Beijing's \"Belt and Road\" initiative, its growing acquisition of economic assets around the world. \nMeanwhile, China has imposed a series of damaging trade sanctions on Australia over the past year.\nAs the trade war between the two countries worsens, Australia's wine exports to China have reportedly dropped by 96% from the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of this year, from A$325m (\u00a3181m) to just A$12m (\u00a36.6m). New Zealand, on the other hand, has been rewarded by Beijing with ever-closer trade relations.\nSo what exactly has all this got to do with intelligence-sharing? Very little, is the answer. \nIt was assumed last year by officials in the Five Eyes alliance that since all five nations broadly shared the same world view, then that view would also apply to China. In May 2020 the alliance agreed to expand its role away from just security and intelligence to a more public stance on respect for human rights and democracy. \nIn November the alliance criticised the Chinese government for stifling democracy in Hong Kong when Beijing introduced new laws that disqualified elected legislators in the former British colony. A Chinese government spokesman reacted angrily, mocking the Five Eyes alliance by declaring that \"those who dared to harm China's sovereignty would find their own eyes poked out\".\nNow, six months later, New Zealand's departure from the party line on China has meant that the Five Eyes' newly expanded role appears to have ground to a halt, prompting some to question whether the alliance is in trouble. \nBut that would be an exaggeration. This was about politics, not intelligence. New Zealand is not leaving the alliance, it is only drawing a distinction between the two. In retrospect it was an overstretch of what Five Eyes was meant for: sharing secrets. \nThere will almost certainly be some in New Zealand's intelligence community who feel embarrassment at this playing out so publicly. By far the majority of intelligence shared within the alliance comes from Washington. The next biggest contributor is the UK, with input from GCHQ, MI6 and MI5. Considerably smaller contributions are made by Canada and Australia. \nWhen it comes to New Zealand, an intelligence review conducted in 2017 found that for every 99 pieces of intelligence NZ received through the alliance, it contributed just one. So New Zealand would clearly have much to lose if it left. \nIn conclusion, then, is the alliance going to transcend into a unified diplomatic or political pressure group? Unlikely at this stage. Is its existence as an alliance for intelligence-sharing between allies in trouble? No."

      "text": "A woman left with \"life-changing injuries\" after botched surgery will receive \u00a32.8m in damages. \nCarolyn Almond-Roots was a patient of Sam Eljamel, a former head of neurosurgery at NHS Tayside, in 2013. \nA BBC Scotland investigation in 2018 revealed that dozens of people claimed to have been harmed by Mr Eljamel.  \nSome of his former patients are suing NHS Tayside, claiming Mr Eljamel has harmed them. Several have already secured compensation. \nJonathan Howat, of Thompsons Solicitors who handled Ms Almond-Roots' case, said her treatment was \"appalling\". \n\"The disgraceful conduct of Eljamel has left my client with very serious and life-changing injuries that affect every aspect of her daily life,\" he said. \n\"The level of compensation Ms Almond-Roots has received highlights the seriousness of what has been inflicted upon her.\"\nHe said the damages took into account \"the fact that my client will need to pay for additional care for the rest of her life\". \n\"The injuries caused by this rogue surgeon are appalling and we are glad that his negligent practices have been brought to light,\" Mr Howat added. \nMr Eljamel was head of neurosurgery at NHS Tayside, and also worked at Fernbrae private hospital in Dundee as well as being an adviser to the Scottish government. \nHe began treating Ms Almond-Roots in 2013 after she experienced a pain in her thighs that was radiating upwards. \nShe saw Mr Eljamel at both Ninewells NHS hospital in Dundee and the private Fernbrae hospital.\nThompsons Solicitors said Ms Almond-Roots reached a settlement of \u00a32,810,118 at the Court of Session. \nIt has not yet been determined what share of the damages will be paid by the private hospital and NHS Tayside, as Ms Almond-Roots was treated by Mr Eljamel at both. \nHe was suspended from his post at NHS Tayside following internal and external reviews in 2013.\nHe was placed under interim conditions by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) in 2014 and then removed himself from the General Medical Council (GMC) register, which means he can no longer practice in the UK. \nBBC Scotland's Disclosure found in 2018 that Mr Eljamel had harmed patients for years at NHS Tayside. \nHe was allowed to continue operating even after an external investigation found he was injuring patients.\nLast year, the BBC found he was working as a surgeon in Libya. \nNHS Tayside said it could not comment because it was an ongoing case.

      "tags": "France,Retailing,Brexit,Marks & Spencer",
      "text": "Marks & Spencer has said it is closing 11 of its French stores because of problems supplying them with fresh and chilled foods since Brexit.\nThe UK retail giant said all 11 franchise stores it operated with partner SFH in France would shut by the end of this year.\nM&S said supply chain problems since Brexit had made it \"near impossible\" to maintain standards of food supply.\nNine M&S stores run at French travel hubs will continue to operate.\n\"M&S has a long history of serving customers in France and this is not a decision we or our partner SFH have taken lightly,\" said Paul Friston, M&S managing director of international.\n\"However, as things stand today, the supply chain complexities in place following the UK's exit from the European Union now make it near impossible for us to serve fresh and chilled products to customers to the high standards they expect, resulting in an ongoing impact to the performance of our business.\n\"With no workable alternative for the High Street stores, we have agreed with SFH to close all 11 franchised stores.\"\nIts French online operation, which sells mainly clothing and home products, will not be affected by the closures.\nOne of the main problems Marks & Spencer was facing in France was post-Brexit bureaucracy, a spokesman said.\nIts partner, SFH, mainly operated shops on Paris High Streets, selling fresh food products such as sandwiches, he said.\nDue to hold-ups caused by red tape at the UK/French border, it was impractical to get the products to the shops.\nThe retailer's other French partner, Lagardere Travel Retail, runs M&S stores in French airports, railway and Metro stations.\nThose stores are unaffected by this decision, in part because of their location.\nMarks & Spencer opened its first French stores in 1975, with branches in Paris and Lyon.\nAfter leaving France and the rest of mainland Europe in 2001 to focus on its UK business, it then reopened in Paris in 2011.\nM&S said its discussions with Lagardere on a sustainable future business model continued to make good progress. \n\"Today's announcement is the latest change to the structure of our European businesses following the UK's exit from the European Union,\" the retailer said. \n\"In April earlier this year, we announced the reconfiguration of our food business in Czech Republic, removing the sale of all fresh and chilled products from stores, and instead doubling our ranges of frozen and ambient products. \n\"This removed the ongoing supply chain risks to our business and the knock-on impact on limiting availability for customers in our stores.\"\nThe export of fresh processed food from the UK to the EU is a classic example of precisely the sort of trade, built up under the single market, that was bound to be challenged by the new post-Brexit arrangements. \nSpecialist exporters say hundreds of pages of documents including health certificates are now required.\nAlthough catastrophic port delays were avoided in the immediate aftermath of Brexit earlier this year, the trade data and surveys of small businesses reveal a hit to exports to the EU.\nGiants such as M&S were able to muddle through, but no longer.\nSome exporters have also complained that imports coming the other way from the EU will be waved through now until July at least.\nThere had been some hope that imposing UK import controls would provide an incentive for France, the Netherlands and Germany to ease controls on their side.\nThat discussion is not now happening. Nor is there any move towards a veterinary agreement, of the sort the EU already enjoys with Switzerland or New Zealand, that might have eased some of the new export red tape burden.\nInstead, there is a private acceptance that after this Brexit deal, fewer sandwiches will be exported to France, and that is the price for the regulatory and trade freedom to export more elsewhere.\nSteve Dresser, managing director of Grocery Insight, said that while all retailers' sales had been affected by Covid, Marks & Spencer in France was \"another casualty of Brexit\".\n\"Once you add inefficiency in to any supply chain, be it trade barriers or bureaucracy, plus the need for extra manpower, there is cost that needs to be absorbed somewhere along the line. \n\"It's likely for the minimal returns, the numbers simply no longer made sense to M&S,\" Mr Dresser said.\n\"It's clear that a huge amount of management resource has been taken up getting stock in the right place for European stores,\" he added.\nThis include the Republic of Ireland, where Marks & Spencer has had stock shortages, \"due to the way that product is accounted for coming via Northern Ireland\". Products entering either Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland from Britain are subject to EU border processes.\nRetailers have been dealing with stock shortages and stock being held up at borders post-Brexit, as well as a chronic shortage of drivers, which hauliers have said is in part due to Brexit.\nBusinesses are faced with costs, either through having to pay for warehouses in EU countries and having cash tied up in stock, through wastage if products with a short shelf life are held up at borders, or through gaps on shelves due to supply chain problems.\n\"The outlook remains bleak on this front, with the deal signed by UK government tying this country to checks and delays at the borders,\" Mr Dresser said, adding that this was \"baffling\" as \"we have voted to take back control\"."

      "text": "The UK, US and Australia have announced a historic security pact in the Asia-Pacific, in what's seen as an effort to counter China.\nIt will let Australia build nuclear-powered submarines for the first time, using technology provided by the US.\nThe Aukus pact, which will also cover AI and other technologies, is one of the countries' biggest defence partnerships in decades, analysts say.\nChina has condemned the agreement as \"extremely irresponsible\".\nForeign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it \"seriously undermines regional peace and stability and intensifies the arms race\".\nChina's embassy in Washington accused the countries of a \"Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice\".\nThe pact also created a row with France, which has now lost a deal with Australia to build 12 submarines.\n\"It's really a stab in the back,\" France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Info radio. \nThe new partnership was announced in a joint virtual press conference between US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday.\nAnd while China was not mentioned directly, the three leaders referred repeatedly to regional security concerns which they said had \"grown significantly\".\nSpeaking to the BBC, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said China was \"embarking on one of the biggest military spends in history\".\n\"It is growing its navy [and] air force at a huge rate. Obviously it is engaged in some disputed areas,\" he said. \"Our partners in those regions want to be able to stand their own ground.\"\nIn recent years, Beijing has been accused of raising tensions in disputed territories such as the South China Sea.\nOn Thursday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the pact would \"preserve security and stability around the world\" and generate \"hundreds of high-skilled jobs\".\nHe also said the relationship with France was \"rock solid\".\nThe Aukus alliance is probably the most significant security arrangement between the three nations since World War Two, analysts say.\nThe pact will focus on military capability, separating it from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance which also includes New Zealand and Canada.\nWhile Australia's submarines is the big-ticket item, Aukus will also involve the sharing of cyber capabilities and other undersea technologies.\n\"This is an historic opportunity for the three nations, with like-minded allies and partners, to protect shared values and promote security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,\" the joint statement read.\n\"This really shows that all three nations are drawing a line in the sand to start and counter [China's] aggressive moves in the Indo-Pacific,\" said Guy Boekenstein from the Asia Society Australia.\nWestern nations have been wary of China's infrastructure investment on Pacific islands, and have also criticised China's trade sanctions against countries like Australia.\nAustralia had in the past maintained good relations with China, its biggest trading partner. But the relationship has broken down in recent years amid political tensions.\nBut there is tension now too with France, after Australia tore up the A$50bn (\u20ac31bn; \u00a327bn) deal to build 12 submarines.  \n\"We had established a relationship of trust with Australia, this trust has been betrayed,\" Mr Le Drian said.\nThese submarines are much faster and harder to detect than conventionally powered fleets. They can stay submerged for months, shoot missiles longer distances and also carry more.\nHaving them stationed in Australia is critical to US influence in the region, analysts say.\nThe US is sharing its submarine technology for the first time in 50 years. It had previously only shared technology with the UK. \nAustralia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines, after the US, UK, France, China, India and Russia.\nAustralia has reaffirmed it has no intention of obtaining nuclear weapons.\nMeanwhile New Zealand said it would ban Australia's submarines from its waters, in line with an existing policy on the presence of nuclear-powered submarines.\nNew Zealand, although a Five Eyes member, has been more cautious in aligning with either the US or China in the Pacific.\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her nation had not been approached to join the pact."

      "tags": "France,Inflation,Natural gas,Electricity,National Grid",
      "text": "The UK government should cut rising energy bills by getting rid of levies that subsidise renewable energy, the boss of E.On UK has said.\nSpeaking to the Financial Times, Michael Lewis said green subsidies should be funded through tax instead.\nRegulators have warned that consumer energy bills will be hit by soaring prices of fossil fuels globally.\nWholesale energy prices rose on Thursday after a key electricity cable between Britain and France shut down.\nMr Lewis said: \"This is going to be a very challenging winter for customers and for suppliers and there is a real short-term imperative to do what we can to help consumers.\"\nGreen levies account for around a quarter of energy bills, he said.\nMr Lewis recommended removing green levies and paying for subsidies through general taxation, \"so these costs are funded more progressively and we level the playing field on the cost of cleaner heating.\"\n\"Then we can also start to apply something like a carbon tax on gas on a 'polluter pays' principle,\" he added.\nA government spokesperson said: \"Our energy price cap will protect millions of customers this winter from sudden increases in global gas prices.\n\"Millions of low-income households will also benefit from a \u00a3140 discount on their bills, with added support offered to pensioners and the most vulnerable over the colder months.\"\nA jump in prices after a UK electricity interconnector was taken offline after a fire has been fuelling concerns about inflation and the potential impact on businesses just as the country's economy starts to recover from the worst effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\nNational Grid said the fire and planned maintenance at a site near Ashford in Kent meant the cable will be totally offline until 25 September.\nHalf of its capacity, or one gigawatt (GW) of power, is expected to remain unavailable until late March 2022.\nOn Wednesday, British electricity prices for the following day jumped by 19% to \u00a3475 per megawatt hour (MWh).\nThe energy regulator told the BBC that increasing prices, for gas in particular, \"will feed into all customer energy bills in the UK\".\nThe price cap, which limits the price firms can charge customers who have not recently changed their energy tariff, will increase in October in order to cover rising wholesale costs.\nThe fire at the Interconnexion France-Angleterre (IFA) site broke out in the early hours of Wednesday. The site was evacuated and there were no reports of casualties.\nAfter the fire an electricity interconnector running under the English Channel was \"not operating\", the National Grid said in a statement.\nElectricity interconnectors are high-voltage cables that connect the electricity systems of neighbouring countries, and allow them to share excess power.\nA spokesperson for National Grid's electricity system operator, which balances power supplies in the UK, said it expects to \"continue supplying electricity safely and securely\" despite the incident.\nThe link can carry up to 2GW of power, and had been importing electricity from France in recent days, after UK prices hit a record high of \u00a3540 per MWh on the wholesale energy market.\nAnalysts are now closely watching National Grid's efforts to get the facility fully back online as winter approaches and with it higher energy demand.\nGlenn Rickson, head of European power analysis at S&P Global Platts Analytics, told Reuters: \"The outage is going to lift the potential for price volatility as long as it's offline... and of course demand will get higher as we move further into winter.\"\nUK Steel director general Gareth Stace pointed out that the \"extortionate\" electricity prices had already forced some steelmakers to suspend operations.\n\"Even with the global steel market as buoyant as it is, these eye-watering prices are making it impossible to profitably make steel at certain times of the day and night,\" he said.\nOther analysts have suggested that as a result, the UK may have to rely more heavily on gas-fired power stations in the coming months. \nWholesale gas prices are already elevated for several reasons, such as low winds meaning less renewable energy is generated, outages at some nuclear stations and lower flows into the UK of the gas from Norway.\nOn Wednesday, fertilizer producer CF Industries Holdings said it was suspending operations at both its Billingham and Ince manufacturing complexes due to high gas costs.\nNational Grid said its investigation into the fire at the IFA site was continuing and it would \"update the market with any changes as necessary\".\nBritain is a net importer of electricity and near neighbour France is its biggest supplier of power through the interconnectors that run under the English Channel. \nThe IFA2 interconnector, a second link between Britain and France, is currently operating at its full capacity and not affected by the problem.\nThe 1GW connection is a \u00a3700m shared investment with French power firm RTE and the UK's fourth power exchange with continental Europe."

The last one took place in February 2020.\nSome of the big moves included Liz Truss to foreign secretary, the Tories' first woman in that role; Nadhim Zahawi moved from leading the vaccine rollout to education - at the expense of Mr Williamson; and Nadine Dorries stepped up from health minister to culture secretary.\nWho's in the other posts?

Liz Truss, who has been promoted to foreign secretary from international trade secretary, was the most popular.\nThe make-up of the cabinet has also changed with all the comings and goings. \nThere are two more women then there had been before the reshuffle, but the proportion has stayed about the same because the overall number of people attending cabinet has also increased slightly. \nAs for the education of those now in cabinet, about 63% of them went to private schools, down slightly when compared to Mr Johnson's previous reshuffle last year - but still a stark contrast to his predecessor's.\nJust 30% of Theresa May's first cabinet in 2016 attended independent schools, which was fewer than both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's original cabinets. \nAccording to the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, every prime minister since 1937 who attended university was educated at Oxford - except for Mr Brown.\nAt 43%, Mr Johnson's new cabinet has slightly fewer members who were educated at Oxford or Cambridge compared to his last reshuffle - but it's still more than double what is was in Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1997.

      "text": "At Afghanistan's border with Uzbekistan a cargo train rolls over a bridge and into the newly created \"Islamic Emirate\". The Taliban's white and black flag flutters next to the Uzbek one. Some traders have welcomed the group's return to power. The driver of a truck being loaded with wheat tells me in the past he was regularly forced to pay bribes to corrupt police officials whenever passing their checkpoints. \"Now, it's not like that,\" he says. \"I could drive all the way to Kabul and not pay a penny.\" \nIt's been exactly one month since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan. Now cash is in short supply, and the country is facing a mounting economic crisis. \nOne source in the business community tells us trade levels have dropped significantly, as Afghan importers aren't able to pay for new goods. The Taliban's head of customs at Hairatan port, Maulvi Saeed, tells us the group is cutting duty rates to promote trade, and wants to encourage wealthy traders to return to the country. \"It will create jobs for the people, and the businessmen will be rewarded in the afterlife,\" he says.\nAround an hour's drive away is Mazar-i-Sharif, the country's fourth largest city. On the surface life appears to be continuing as normal, though many are suffering financially. \nI head to the intricately tiled Blue Mosque, the cultural heart of the city. I was last here in August, shortly before the Taliban takeover. Back then, the grounds were teeming with young men and women posing for selfies. \nNow the Taliban have allocated separate visiting times according to gender: women can come in the mornings, men the rest of the day. When we visit, there are plenty of women strolling around, but there seem to be significantly fewer than before. \"Things are alright, but maybe people still need more time to get used to the new government,\" one woman suggests timidly. \nI'm meeting Haji Hekmat, an influential local Taliban leader. \"You might have brought security,\" I put to him, \"but your critics say you're killing the culture here.\" \n\"No,\" he replies emphatically, \"Western influences have been here for the past 20 years\u2026 Control of Afghanistan has passed from one foreign hand to another for 40 years, we have lost our own traditions and values. We are bringing our culture back to life.\" \nAccording to his understanding of Islam, the mixing of men and women is prohibited. \nHaji Hekmat seems genuinely convinced the Taliban enjoy the support of the people. Out of his earshot, however, one female visitor whispered to a colleague, \"These are not good people.\" \nWhilst the Taliban's interpretation of Islam might clash less with the values of those in more rural, socially conservative villages - in bigger Afghan cities, many remain deeply suspicious of the group. Haji Hekmat puts this down to years of \"propaganda\" but a history of suicide bombings and targeted assassinations in urban areas is clearly also responsible. \nAs we leave the Blue Mosque, we spot a large and excited crowd by the main road, and elbow our way to the centre. Four dead bodies with bullet wounds are laid out on display. One has a small handwritten note on top of it describing the men as kidnappers, warning other criminals their punishment will be the same. \nDespite the smell of the bodies under the hot sun, the crowd snap photos and try to push past each other for a better look. Violent crime has long been a major problem in Afghanistan's big cities, and even their critics credit the Taliban with improving security. One onlooker tells us, \"If they are kidnappers it's a good thing. It will be a lesson for others.\"  \nBut lots of others in the city don't feel safe. Law student Farzana, tells us, \"Every time I step out of my house and I see the Taliban, I shiver with fear.\" \nPrivate universities like hers are open, but those run by the government remain shut for now. Under the new Taliban rule, male and female students who are studying in the same classroom must be separated by a curtain. \nFor Farzana, that's not the priority though. She's concerned that the Taliban may not let women work - something the group has denied. For the moment, though, women in Afghanistan are being told to stay at home for their own safety, unless they are teachers or medics. \n\"Right now I feel hopeless,\" Farzana says, \"but I'm doing my best to stay optimistic for the future.\" \nThe last time the Taliban were in power, they introduced far more restrictive measures than they have so far on this occasion, banning women from leaving home without a male companion for example. Much of the fear in Afghan cities today is that similar laws could eventually be introduced again. \nWhilst the Taliban are in firm control of the country, they're yet to win the hearts and minds of many residents. Haji Hekmat acknowledges, \"Taking over the country militarily was hard, implementing the rule of law and protecting it is even harder.\" \nAdditional reporting by Malik Mudasir and Shams Ahmadzai."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Women,Periods,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Changes to periods and unexpected vaginal bleeding after having a Covid vaccine should be investigated to reassure women, says a leading immunologist specialising in fertility.\nWriting in the BMJ, Dr Victoria Male, from Imperial College London, said the body's immune response was the likely cause, not something in the vaccines.\nThere is no evidence they have any impact on pregnancy or fertility.\nThe UK's regulator has received more than 30,000 reports of period problems.\nThese suspected side-effects include heavier than usual periods, delayed periods and unexpected bleeding after all three Covid vaccines, out of more than 47 million doses given to women in the UK to date.\nAfter reviewing the reports, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it \"does not support a link\" between Covid vaccines and the symptoms.\nMenstrual disorders are extremely common, can be caused by many different things, and the numbers of women affected are low, it says.\nPeriod changes have also been reported by some women after infection with the virus itself, and with long Covid.\nHowever, writing in an opinion piece in the BMJ, Dr Male says \"robust research\" into reports of period problems would help to counter misinformation around the vaccines.\n\"Vaccine hesitancy among young women is largely driven by false claims that Covid-19 vaccines could harm their chances of future pregnancy.\n\"Failing to thoroughly investigate reports of menstrual changes after vaccination is likely to fuel these fears. \n\"If a link between vaccination and menstrual changes is confirmed, this information will allow people to plan for potentially altered cycles,\" she said.\nDr Male, a lecturer in reproductive immunology, said \"clear and trusted information\" was important for women who rely on being able to predict their cycles. \nAnd she said the effects of any medical intervention on menstruation should not be \"an afterthought\" in future research.\nScientists don't yet understand exactly how vaccines could cause period changes. They may be linked to the impact of the immune system - which is stimulated by the vaccine - on hormones driving the menstrual cycle, but they could also be caused by immune cells acting differently in the lining of the uterus.\nOther vaccines, such as HPV or human papillomavirus, have also been linked to similar menstrual changes - but there has been little research carried out on how and why it happens.\nScientists agree that women's ability to have a baby is not affected by the vaccines. Trials show that vaccination did not change women's chances of becoming pregnant naturally or during fertility treatment. Research into male fertility after vaccines also shows no impact on sperm quality.\nDr Jo Mountfield, vice-president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), said changes to periods could be concerning, but generally lasted only one or two cycles.\nShe encouraged anyone who experiences heavy bleeding which is unusual, especially after the menopause, to speak to a healthcare professional for advice, but she emphasised there was no risk of long-term harm.\n\"There is no evidence to suggest that these temporary changes will have any impact on a person's future fertility, or their ability to have children,\" Dr Mountfield said. \nThe RCOG said vaccination was the \"best protection\" against coronavirus, especially if planning a pregnancy, because unvaccinated pregnant women are at higher risk of becoming seriously ill from Covid than other women of the same age.\nIt also called for more research into why women may experience changes to their menstrual cycle after the vaccine."

      "title": "What's Boris Johnson's reshuffle really all about?",
      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Cabinet reshuffles",
      "text": "\"This is a mad way to run the country,\" confessed a member of the government.\nWhether prime ministers wield sharp knives or attack with blunt spoons, reshuffle days like this are indeed a strange mixture of bravado and farce.\nBravado when, earlier, one cabinet minister told me, \"I think I'm OK,\" as, ashen-faced, looking nauseous and clammy, they were en route to see the prime minister before promptly being sacked.\nAnd farce when, as legend has it, on several occasions, would-be ministers end up jobless, because the post-it notes with their name on fell off the board. Forgotten, their career plunged to the floor too. \nThe way the most senior government politicians are recruited and removed is bizarre and brutal. For weeks ministers have nervously inquired of journalists: \"Is it on?\" And inhabitants of the Westminster village who claim real knowledge of the plan are rarely those who truly know. \nBut, whatever the curious British traditions of how it's done, it is what is done that makes the difference. Prime ministers rarely wield as much power as on the day of the big hirings and firings. \nAnd Boris Johnson has used this occasion to make big changes to the cabinet. The most significant switch came in one of the chunkiest jobs of all.\nRemoving the foreign secretary is a big deal. Dominic Raab's always happy to let it be known that he holds a black belt in karate. And his conversation with the prime minister this reshuffle day took longer than expected, suggesting he fought his move pretty hard. Sources suggest he managed to wangle the ill-defined title of deputy prime minister out of Mr Johnson.\nBeing justice secretary, running prisons, courts, and the legal system, is of course a huge job. Downing Street insists it's not a demotion, and that it doesn't want this move to be seen as punishment after what looked, to many people, like a debacle in Afghanistan.\nBut even with the DPM bauble, Mr Raab, the now former foreign secretary, is a less senior figure in the government.\nThere are some other slightly puzzling aspects. Steve Barclay was, until the reshuffle, chief secretary to the Treasury, wielding the calculator on what is a hugely important Spending Review, when cash for departments for the next few years is fixed. That review is coming in just a few weeks' time, so you might wonder at the wisdom of moving Mr Barclay right now.\nHe's being replaced by Simon Clarke, a previous inhabitant of a Treasury role, a strong supporter of Mr Johnson and North East MP. He's also, at 6ft 7ins, around a foot taller than his new boss in Number 11 - cue the inevitable jokes about Number 10 wanting to make the chancellor feel small.\nIn a similar vein Anne-Marie Trevelyan, also a strong Johnson backer, returns to cabinet as trade secretary. Irrespective of the merit of her move to that department, Ms Trevelyan had been part of the government's team preparing for COP26, a major international event that starts in about 50 days. If it's a true priority, unpicking a part of the team right now may raise a few eyebrows. \nThere are many more jobs to be allocated, more intrigue to come when middle-ranking and junior ministers get their P45s or offers. But the shape of the cabinet itself is clear.\nWhat's harder to divine is any one strong political ideology, or any radical guiding idea. Certainly, politicians popular with the Tory party like Truss seem to have prospered. Loyalty to the prime minister himself seems to have been rewarded.\nBut it's not a Brexit cabinet, or a small-state cabinet, or to use Tory verbiage, a \"one-nation\" cabinet for those more in the middle.\nIt's a Johnson cabinet, with no particular bent towards any one faction or tribe. For some of his backers, that is one of Mr Johnson's attributes - he's not wedded to principle, but staying on top. For other Tories, that's rather the problem - with no one strong ideology other than a desire to win, it begs the question of what it's all really for.\nFor Downing Street, though, this is a day for the doers. After the early traumas of Brexit, then the emergency and horror of the pandemic, the moves represent, they hope, a refreshed team that can get things done.\nWhether it's building houses without upsetting the Tory shires, sorting out school exams, pushing through tougher prison sentences, with new faces it's a government that Downing Street hopes will be more able to push reform forward, and make its case.\nNearly two years after the election, it's perhaps the start of Mr Johnson's third act as prime minister. And while the shuffling of his cabinet pack has passed, so far largely without incident, there is no doubt about the scale of the challenge, individual and collective, that they face. "

The minimum value for an order is \u00a315 and a \u00a33.99 delivery charge applies to all orders below \u00a340.\nTwo towns in England - Milton Keynes and Northampton - are already receiving Co-op grocery deliveries from autonomous robot vehicles made by Starship Technologies, a firm set up by the founders of Skype. \nThe supermarket chain plans to increase the number of robots operating and delivering Co-op groceries from 200 to 500 by the end of this year, extending them from Milton Keynes and Northampton to Cambridgeshire and then into northern England.\nCo-op group chief executive Steve Murrells said: \"The pandemic has accelerated changes in consumer shopping trends and we're driving forward with exciting plans to provide rapid kerb-to-kitchen grocery delivery services.\n\"We are delighted to be working with Amazon. Its reach and leading technology and innovative approach means greater convenience for people in their communities.\"\nBut GMB national officer Andy Prendergast criticised the move: \"It's really disappointing to see a company with a proud ethical heritage like Co-op teaming up with Amazon: a tax-evading multinational with a horrifying health and safety record.\n\"Workers in Amazon warehouses are treated like robots. They are knocked unconscious, suffer broken bones and are taken away in ambulances in their desperate pursuit of unrealistic targets.\"\nThe union added that it had concerns about the amount of tax Amazon pays in the UK, as well as the fact that bosses had failed to recognise a union to protect Amazon workers' rights. \nAmazon said it offered \"excellent pay, benefits and opportunities for career growth, all while working in a safe, modern work environment\". \nThe online retailer also said it had invested \u00a332bn in the UK since 2010, paying \u00a31.5bn in tax last year.\nAndy Brian, partner at retail specialist law firm Gordons, says the Co-op-Amazon partnership is \"really where the future lies\". \n\"Who can successfully - and profitably - get products ordered on mobile devices to customers in the shortest possible time, so they don't even have to bother with shops at all,\" he said.\n\"Demand for this type of fast, no-hassle service will only increase in line with the ability for consumers to order products easily, with one-click, directly from social media or through QR codes.\""

      "text": "The first Covid-19 booster vaccinations have been administered in Wales, as data showed the number of young people with antibodies has risen.\nOrthopaedic nurse Ewa Syczuk, 50, was the first in Wales to get a third dose of the jab at a clinic in Denbighshire.\nA total of 91.2% of the population of Wales, including 87% of 16 to 24-year-olds, have Covid antibodies, according to the Office for National Statistics. \nDaily data showed Wales' case rate fell for the fifth consecutive day. \nMs Syczuk became one of the first people in the UK to receive her booster dose of the vaccine in St Asaph, in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area, at about 11:00 BST on Thursday.\nIt came two days after the Joint Centre for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) announced the plans for extra jabs for several groups, including over 50s and front-line healthcare workers. \nShe said she was pleased to get another dose after she became \"very, very ill\" with coronavirus in April 2020. \n\"There are two weeks I can't remember - my partner said he had to remind me to breathe,\" she said. \n\"A month after I got better from being ill, I could still only manage about 500 steps then I'd have to spend the rest of the day in bed. \n\"The vaccine is like a godsend - I couldn't wait to get mine. Everybody should have the vaccine to prevent that experience, because 19 months after having Covid I still can suffer from shortness of breath and fatigue.\"\nOf Wales' other health boards, Cwm Taf Morgannwg said it would start giving booster jabs to care home residents on Saturday, while the remaining five health boards will administer their first booster jabs from Monday. \n\"Our vaccination programme is moving into the next phase, which see the launch of the booster vaccination (by invitation), following the JCVI priority groups as before,\" it said in a statement.\nBooster vaccination for other adults will be considered by the JCVI at a later date.\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said: \"I would urge all those who are eligible for a booster to take up the offer when they are called for an appointment, as there is the possibility of reduced immunity from their earlier doses of the vaccine as time passes.\"\nDr Gill Richardson, deputy chief medical officer for vaccines, added: \"We have already seen the benefits that come from having as many people as possible vaccinated and have been preparing for this throughout the summer.\n\"Vaccines remain our strongest defence from the virus and to maintain the levels of immunity that people have achieved.\" \nThe latest Covid infection survey from the ONS showed an increase in the number of people with antibodies - especially among young people - although there was a fall among the oldest age group. \nThere was a slight week-on-week fall in the number of over-80s with antibodies, with this figure standing at 82% ahead of the start of the booster programme. \nMore than 95% of 35 to 49-year-olds had antibodies, while 87% of 16 to 24-year-olds also had them - up from 56% three months ago. \nMore than half of 16 and 17-year-olds now also have Covid antibodies.\nWales' case rate fell for the fifth consecutive day to 494.3 new infections per 100,000 people over the most recent seven-day period - down from its most recent peak of 558.6 \nThere were 2,891 new cases reported by Public Health Wales on Thursday, as well as four new deaths, taking the total death toll to 5,774 people. \nNeath Port Talbot has the highest case rate of any council area in Wales - with 711 - while Monmouthshire has the lowest at 211.4. \nCarmarthenshire has Wales' second highest number of infections and the West Wales Regional Incident Management Team, which also covers Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, said the case rates in the area was \"a concern and is impacting on our public services across the Hywel Dda Health Board area\".\nAcross Wales, there was an average of 42 Covid hospital admissions per day - slightly higher than the previous week - but less than half of the average of 89 per day at the same point of the second wave. The number of Covid patients in hospital was 520 on Wednesday.\nFor the first time we can accurately see how the number of Covid cases and hospital admissions compare with scientific modelling for the Welsh government, which came out earlier this summer. \nCases are higher than thought most likely - but it appears deaths are within the expected range, while hospital admissions have only recently started moving ahead of the most likely scenario. \nThe modelling, which was not a prediction, was based on a series of scenarios involving vaccinations efficacy, the spread of the Delta variant and people's behaviour around relaxation of Covid rules.  \nCases were modelled to be higher earlier in the summer under the \"most likely\" scenario than the actual number, but the number of actual cases has surpassed both the most likely and worst-case scenarios modelled for this time of year. \nHowever, the worst-case scenario for daily cases was modelled at 6,300 cases per day on average at the peak, but the latest figures showed cases are showing signs of falling back and measured at about 2,500 per day on average. \nThe modelling for hospital admissions shows since late August these have run ahead of the \"most likely\" scenario although they are still well below what we saw in the second wave.\nThe modelling for deaths remains well within the range of the most likely scenario."

      "tags": "Telecommunication,European Space Agency,The Moon,Space exploration",
      "text": "The contract has been signed that will see the first UK satellite go to the Moon in 2024.\nLunar Pathfinder is a relay platform for telecommunications. It will feed the telemetry and data from other spacecraft at the Moon back to Earth.\nThis will make those other missions simpler and cheaper to operate.\nThe contract was signed in London between the European Space Agency and Pathfinder's manufacturer, Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL). \nIt is a service agreement. Esa is not funding Pathfinder's build; it's merely purchasing a proportion of its relay capacity.\nThis will be used by the agency's future missions, and also ventures run by its American counterpart, Nasa.\nThe quid pro quo is that Pathfinder will hitch a ride on a US rocket.\nThere is an armada of missions - public and private - going to the Moon this decade, including ones that will take astronauts back to the lunar surface for the first time since Apollo.\nPathfinder will be in a position to service all these ventures, selling its bandwidth to anyone who needs it.\nWith Esa as its \"anchor customer\", SSTL will have confidence it can get a decent return on its self-investment.\nThis is a key moment then for all parties, not least Esa which is now following a procurement model routinely practised by Nasa.\nThe space agency sets the requirements, offers perhaps seed money to industry to develop the product solution, and then agrees to purchase the service.\nCalifornia's SpaceX is the classic example of this model in action, producing novel rockets and crew-carrying capsules for use by Nasa at a fraction of the cost of more traditional contracting.\nJosef Aschbacher, the new director general of Esa, is determined to push Europe down this same route, and Lunar Pathfinder is his poster child.\nHe's come into the job with the ambition - he calls it his Agenda 2025 - to shake up the way space is done across the continent of Europe.\nIf Europe doesn't become more fleet-of-foot in the space domain, it will fall behind geopolitically, he believes.\n\"Europe has to realise that first of all, space is extremely important for the development of a country or a region,\" he told me. \n\"I would claim that if you're not a space power, you cannot be a superpower. We see this best demonstrated in China, which is really using space as a tool to become a major superpower. \n\"The US, of course, is doing it since a long time. So Europe has to wake up.\"\nUnder Dr Aschbacher's leadership, there will be more projects where Esa acts as the first buyer, or anchor customer. \nThe agency will do more consulting to enable venture capital to have the confidence to back innovative ideas in Europe. There'll also be prizes and grants to stimulate this innovation. And the whole contracting process inside Esa will be re-assessed to speed things up.\n\"Time is crucial for the new space world,\" Dr Aschbacher said.\n\"Our procedures are too slow - time to contact, reviews, the various interactions with these fast-moving companies. This is about internal procedure where I need to work on Esa to be much faster.\"\nLunar Pathfinder will operate in a wide elliptical orbit at the Moon for at least eight years.\nIt will talk to other lunar missions - be they other satellites in orbit or rovers down on the surface - using S-band and UHF frequencies. Communications will be relayed back to Earth ground stations in X-band.\nAdditionally, there'll be a demonstration of technology that could one day lead to a sat-nav service at the Moon.\n\"Pathfinder will be hosting a weak signal detection receiver from Esa. Effectively, the idea is to test how signals from GPS or Galileo at Earth can be detected from lunar orbit and then used for navigation of lunar assets,\" explained Nelly Offord, the exploration business manager at SSTL.\nElodie Viau, the director of telecoms at Esa, said she expected Britain to play a leading role in the agency's new direction under Dr Aschbacher.\n\"What is great about the UK is its commercial mindset; it is very business-minded,\" she noted.

      "text": "Elite US gymnast Simone Biles has testified before the Senate about abuse she suffered at the hands of disgraced former team doctor, Larry Nassar. \nFormer teammates Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney also appeared before the committee, along with FBI Director Christopher Wray.\nThe committee is examining shortcomings in the FBI's investigation into Nassar, later convicted of sexually abusing girls.\nHe is serving a life sentence in jail.\n\"I blame Larry Nasser, and I also blame an entire system that enabled and perpetrated [sic] his abuse,\" said Ms Biles, the most decorated Olympic gymnast of all-time.\n\"If you allow a predator to harm children, the consequences will be swift and severe,\" she added.\nGymnast Maggie Nichols - the first victim to report her abuse to USA Gymnastics - also testified. \nIn emotional testimony on Wednesday, the four women told the Senate Judiciary Committee they had \"suffered and continue to suffer\" from the abuse they experienced and its bungled handling.\nFour-time Olympic gold medallist Simone Biles - one of the most famous figures in world sports - called for the agents involved to be federally prosecuted.\n\"How much is a little girl worth?\" she asked. \nAly Raisman, who served as captain of the 2012 and 2016 US Olympic gymnastics teams, expressed disgust that she was \"still fighting for the most basic answers and accountability\" more than six years after first reporting her abuse.\n\"Over the past few years it has become painfully clear how a survivor's healing is affected by the handling of their abuse,\" she testified. \nShe criticised the FBI investigation as being \"like guesswork\", warning that not addressing its serious flaws would result in a recurring \"nightmare\" for many more women.\nMcKayla Maroney, who won gold at the London 2012 Olympic Games, described the experience of being interviewed by the FBI as replete with \"silence and disregard for my trauma\".\n\"They chose to fabricate, to lie about what I said and protect a serial child molester,\" she told senators.\n\"What is the point of reporting abuse if our own FBI agents are going to take it upon themselves to bury that report in a drawer?\"\nThe four athletes were among more than 200 women who gave powerful impact statements to a court in 2018, detailing Larry Nassar's abuse as the sports doctor of the United States women's national gymnastics team.\nIn total, Nassar was accused of sexual abuse by more than 330 women and girls at USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University.\nA long-awaited report into the FBI's investigation, which was published in July, found numerous missteps, delays and cover-ups by FBI agents, which allowed Nassar's abuse to continue for several more months after the case was first opened.\nThe 119-page report by the Department of Justice Inspector General found that, despite the seriousness of the allegations against Nassar, the FBI field office in Indianapolis had been slow to respond.\nThe agency initially interviewed only Ms Maroney while declining to interview other young women who had come forward with their stories.\nConfronted by their mistakes, two FBI officials lied during interviews to cover up their errors, the report said. According to the FBI, one of those officials was fired last week.\nFBI Director Christopher Wray apologised profusely to those present for the \"reprehensible conduct\" and \"fundamental errors\" detailed in the July report.\nMr Wray only took the agency's top job in 2017, but pledged to prevent a repeat of the mishandled case under his leadership.\nHe pointed to last week's removal of the supervising official involved, while noting the other official - who led the field office in Indianapolis - had retired long before he could be disciplined.\nHe acknowledged the work of both agents had \"violated the FBI's long-standing code of conduct\" but was \"inconsistent\" with the vast majority of his team.\nAt a news conference later on Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the president \"supports\" the recommended steps outlined for the FBI in the Department of Justice report.\nBut both lawmakers and witnesses called out the department for being a \"no-show\" at the hearing despite being invited. Speaking after the hearing, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal noted the department must still answer more questions."

      "tags": "Shamima Begum case,Islamic State group",
      "text": "Shamima Begum, who left the UK for Syria as a teenager, says she will regret joining the Islamic State group for the rest of her life and has offered to help the UK fight terrorism.\nShe told the BBC she could be \"useful to society\" and it would be a waste to let her \"rot\" in a Syrian camp.\nThe 22-year-old is accused of playing an active role in IS - she denies that.\nSajid Javid is standing by his decision to revoke her citizenship. \nShamima Begum was 15 when she and two other east London schoolgirls travelled to Syria to join IS. \nThere, she married a Dutch recruit and lived under IS rule for more than three years. In 2019, she was found, nine months pregnant, in a Syrian refugee camp. Her baby later died of pneumonia and Ms Begum said she had previously lost two other children.\nThe then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped Ms Begum of her UK citizenship on national security grounds. \nMs Begum has previously said the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, in which 22 people - some of them children - were killed in a bombing claimed by IS, was similar to military strikes on IS strongholds and called the terror attack \"retaliation\".\nAsked by BBC reporter Josh Baker how it made her feel to think back to being part of a group that committed genocide and murder around the world, she said: \"It makes me sick to my stomach really. It makes me hate myself.\"\nIn the interview for BBC Sounds and BBC 5 live, Ms Begum also said she only now felt comfortable talking about her true feelings. \nOur reporter asked whether she had changed her opinion on IS because it had not created a caliphate.\n\"I have had these opinions for a very long time but only now I feel comfortable to express my real opinion,\" she replied.\nShe said if allowed back into the UK, she could advise on the tactics used by IS to persuade people to go to Syria and could share ways to speak to people who are at risk of being radicalised.\nShe said she felt \"an obligation\" to do so, adding that she did not want any other young girls to destroy their lives like she had.\nOn Wednesday, Ms Begum spoke to ITV's Good Morning Britain and made a direct offer to Boris Johnson to become \"an asset\" in the fight against terror.\nSpeaking from a Syrian refugee camp, she said there was \"no evidence\" she was a key player in preparing terrorist acts and was prepared to prove her innocence in court.\n\"I know there are some people, no matter what I say or what I do, they will not believe that I have changed, believe that I want to help,\" she said.\n\"But for those who have even a drop of mercy and compassion and empathy in their hearts, I tell you from the bottom of my heart that I regret every, every decision I've made since I stepped into Syria and I will live with it for the rest of my life.\n\"No one can hate me more than I hate myself for what I've done and all I can say is 'I'm sorry' and just give me a second chance.\"\nShe said she would \"rather die than go back to IS\" and added: \"The only crime I committed was being dumb enough to join IS.\"\nMs Begum says she wants a trial, saying she is \"willing to go to court and face the people who made these claims and refute these claims, because I know I did nothing in IS but be a mother and a wife\".\nBut Sajid Javid, now health secretary, suggested there was no likelihood Ms Begum would be allowed to return and fight her citizenship case.\nHe told GMB that the decision to strip her of her UK citizenship was \"both morally right, absolutely right, but also legally correct and the right one to protect the British people\".\n\"I won't go into details of the case, but what I will say is that you certainly haven't seen what I saw,\" he added.\n\"If you did know what I knew, because you are sensible, responsible people, you would have made exactly the same decision - of that I have no doubt.\"\nA Home Office spokesman said: \"The government's top priority remains maintaining our national security and keeping the public safe.\"\nLiberty, a human rights group, previously called the decision to revoke Ms Begum's citizenship \"an extremely dangerous precedent\" and said the right to a fair trial was not something democratic governments should take away on a whim.\nOne of the other girls who travelled with Ms Begum, Kadiza Sultana, was reportedly killed in a bombing raid, but the fate of the third - Amira Abase - is unknown.\nMs Begum has previously said her husband had been held in a prison where men were tortured and had surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters.\nJosh Baker from the I'm Not A Monster podcast spoke to Shamima Begum for a forthcoming BBC Sounds and BBC Radio 5 Live podcast series."

      "title": "Aukus: UK, US and Australia pact signals Asia-Pacific power shift",
      "text": "A new security partnership in the Asia-Pacific will see the UK and US provide Australia with the technology and capability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines. American officials have said the move was not aimed at countering Beijing. However experts say the Aukus agreement signals a paradigm shift in strategy and policy across the region.\nThe timing of the new deal is particularly significant. It comes just a month after the US exit from Afghanistan, when doubts have been raised in multiple quarters about US commitment in the region.  \nBritain too is eager to be more involved in the Asia-Pacific especially after its exit from the European Union and Australia is increasingly concerned about China's influence.\n\"It is a 'big deal' because this really shows that all three nations are drawing a line in the sand to start and counter the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) aggressive moves in the Indo-Pacific,\" Guy Boekenstein, senior director of defence and national security at Australia's Northern Territory government, told the BBC.\n\"It also publicly demonstrates our combined stance on this and commitment to a stable and secure Indo-Pacific region - one that for the past 70 years has led to the prosperity of all in the region, including China's economic growth.\"\nThe agreement involves the sharing of information and technology in a number of areas including intelligence and quantum technology as well as the acquisition of cruise missiles.\nBut the nuclear submarines are key.  They are to be built in Adelaide in South Australia and will involve the US and the UK providing consultation on technology for their production. \n\"A nuclear submarine has enormous defence capabilities and therefore ramifications for the region. Only six countries in the world have nuclear submarines. They are a really powerful deterrent capability without giving them nuclear weapons,\" Michael Shoebridge, director of defence, strategy and national security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said. \nNuclear submarines are much more stealthy than conventional ones - they operate quietly, are able to move easily and are harder to detect. \nAt least eight submarines will be supported, although it's not clear when they will be deployed. The process will take longer due to a lack of nuclear infrastructure in Australia. \nThey will not be nuclear armed, only powered with nuclear reactors.\n\"Let me be clear: Australia is not seeking to acquire nuclear weapons or establish a civil nuclear capability,\" Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.\nPresident Biden added that there would be an initial 18-month consultation period with teams from the three countries to decide how it would work and to ensure compliance with non-proliferation commitments.\nHowever, the move does show that the US and UK are willing to take the big step of exporting nuclear technology to a non-nuclear powered nation, according to Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia Programme at the Stimson Center.\nAnd that is what makes the partnership so unique.\n\"This technology is extremely sensitive. This is frankly an exception to our policy in many respects, I do not anticipate that this will be undertaken in other circumstances going forward. We view this as a one-off,\" a US official told Reuters, adding that Washington had shared nuclear propulsion technology only once before - with Britain in 1958.\nIn recent years, China has demonstrated increasing power and influence in the region.\n\"We hear words about co-operation and then we see the threats against Taiwan and events in Hong Kong and the rapid militarisation of the South China Sea. So really when it comes to strategic issues, deterrents seem to be the only thing that makes sense against China,\" Mr Shoebridge said.\nThe US has been investing heavily in other partnerships in the region too with Japan, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, as well as India and Vietnam.\nThis deal could benefit all of them, according to Mr Shoebridge, in the face of concerns about China's growing power.\n\"The region will appreciate that. This is part of a geopolitical shift which is driven by one big thing. And that is the direction that Xi Jinping is taking. This announcement fits with the growing participation of the world's biggest democracies to deter China from using its power\" Mr Shoebridge added.\nThe response has reportedly been positive, even if it has been a quiet recognition.\nBonnie Glaser, director of the Asia programme at policy think tank the German Marshall Fund said: \"My understanding from people in the administration - having talked to allies and partners who have an interest in peace and security in the Indo-Pacific - is that there was nothing negative. There is support in the region for deterrence and for having US presence and military presence in the region.\"\nOne relationship that will undoubtedly change as a result of the agreement is the one between China and Australia.\nThe two nations have been strong trade partners in the past with a large number of Chinese students choosing to study in Australia. \nHowever, political relations deteriorated after Australia backed a global inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus.\nThe pact shows Australia is aligning itself with the US and UK but also signals a vote of confidence in Australia which is looking to play a more active role in Asian security.\n\"Just because Australia has nuclear submarines doesn't mean it is more powerful than China. It does change the balance of power in the region. If China does face a security situation in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, it will affect the military preparedness or response that China will have to prepare for. It does change the power equilibrium in the region,\" Ms Sun told the BBC. \nIn response to the deal, China's embassy in Washington said the governments involved \"should shake off their Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice\".\nHowever, the reaction on the mainland might be even stronger.\n\"What's Chinese for apoplectic? One can expect a fiery-hot reaction from Beijing\u2026 This gives Australia and the US another tool in the toolbox to deter China,\" William Choong, senior fellow in regional strategic and political studies at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said.

Sales for the group rose by 6%, aided by strong demand for homeware, fashion, nursery furnishing and Waitrose online grocery sales.\nJohn Lewis has 34 department stores and 331 Waitrose supermarket stores alongside its online operation.\n\"We're acting hard and we're acting fast to make sure we can still deliver a fantastic sparkly Christmas to our customers,\" Ms  White told the BBC. \nShe added that the department store chain had introduced a host of measures to help manage labour shortages: \"We've raised wages for heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers and we're really beginning to see the results of that.\"\nThere is now a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000, a Road Haulage Association survey of its members estimates.\nThis has led to a chronic lack of materials for the construction sector, such as cement and timber, as well as problems for the manufacturing sector.\nChristmas is when many retailers make most of their profits, including John Lewis. \nAnd it's throwing everything at it to make sure its stock arrives on time. The pandemic has wreaked havoc for the flow of goods around the world.  \nThere's still a shortage of containers and it's also tough getting a space on the vast ships that carry them from China. \nFreight costs have also rocketed. And if your stock does turn up as planned, you've got to make sure you have drivers to get the goods to distribution centres and on to stores. \nAdd in the uncertainty over Covid and no wonder retailers are even more nervous than usual about the all important festive season. \nMs White said the John Lewis Christmas campaign in stores would be delayed by two weeks.\nJohn Lewis said it was focusing on expanding its products and offerings for the holiday season, including 10 new Christmas emporiums in John Lewis and expanding areas related to the department store within Waitrose supermarkets. \nHowever, Ms White sought to temper expectations: \"We're not through Covid and there's more uncertainty than we would like.\"\nShe said there were still containers stuck in various parts of the world.\n\"We're acting at every single part in the supply chain to ensure that Christmas is saved this year,\" she said.\n\"Our customers hopefully won't see anything,\" she added. \"We're on track. But so far, we don't see any significant problems.\"\nOn Wednesday, the retailer announced plans to recruit more than 7,000 temporary workers for the winter. \nThe partnership is hiring people for its supermarkets, department stores and warehouses, including delivery drivers for its online grocery division.\nIt is also looking to fill 550 permanent, full-time, driver and warehouse jobs.\nNew joiners will be offered free food and drink to \"help ensure we can attract the help we need\", it said."

It was the first time a serving royal had spoken so frankly about life in the Royal Family. \nMillions of viewers heard her speak about an unhappy marriage to the Prince of Wales, their affairs and her bulimia.\nIn a statement, Scotland Yard said: \"In March 2021, the Metropolitan Police Service determined it was not appropriate to begin a criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful activity in connection with a documentary broadcast in 1995.\n\"Following the publication of Lord Dyson's report in May, specialist detectives assessed its contents and looked carefully at the law - once again obtaining independent legal advice from Treasury Counsel as well as consulting the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\"As a result, the MPS has not identified evidence of activity that constituted a criminal offence and will therefore be taking no further action.\"\nThe BBC has issued what it described as a \"full and unconditional apology\" for the way the interview was obtained.\nTim Davie, the BBC director general, said in May: \"While today's BBC has significantly better processes and procedures, those that existed at the time should have prevented the interview being secured in this way.\""

      "text": "Queen's University Belfast (QUB) has said it is \"unlikely\" to offer a room to any student living less than 40 miles from the university.\nThey have told students living within that radius to make \"alternative travel and accommodation arrangements\".\nBut students living more than 40 miles away have also been told they may not get a room until mid-October.\nIt was laid out in an email sent to some students who had applied for rooms in halls of residence.\nQUB had previously offered students a \u00a31,500 deal to withdraw from its accommodation.\nIt said due to \"unprecedented\" demand, accommodation in its halls was oversubscribed.\nAbout 3,500 students each year live in halls of residence run by the university.\nOn Wednesday night, some students who had applied for QUB's rooms for the 2021/22 academic year received a further update by email.\nThe university apologised \"for the upset caused by the uncertainty of the past few weeks\" and said it was doing all it could \"to find solutions\".\nQueen's said the financial package to withdraw from accommodation had been accepted by \"several hundred students\" and they were still working to secure additional rooms, including at Ulster University's Jordanstown campus.\n\"In prior years, the 3,400 rooms provided by the university has been enough to meet all our requirements,\" QUB said.\n\"This year, despite securing an additional 770 rooms, we are still unable to meet demand which hopefully gives you some idea of the size of the challenge we have faced.\n\"We continue to work tirelessly to secure other options but it may be mid to late October before some of these become available.\n\"We will be allocating all available accommodation by distance lived from Queen's.\n\"Presently, it is unlikely we will be able to offer a room to anyone who lives within a 40 mile radius of the university.\"\nHowever, students living more than 40 miles from QUB were not guaranteed a room for the start of term.\n\"We strongly advise students who have not yet received an accommodation offer and who live outside the 40-mile radius, to make travel arrangements for the first three to four weeks of term as it is unlikely you will be able to move into your accommodation before mid-October,\" the university email said.\nOne QUB student from Londonderry who contacted BBC News NI said the move would mean they would have to take a bus to Belfast and back every day until then.\nThe university said it would start to make room offers by email from Monday 20 September.\nHowever, if students did not accept within 24 hours their room would be offered to another student.\nQUB also said, however, they were \"working with a range of local hotels\" to enable students to book rooms \"for one or two nights per week\" if necessary."

      "title": "Covid: First booster jabs for NHS staff and calls for military help",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you on Friday morning.\nNHS staff in England and Wales have begun receiving booster jabs as part of plans to increase protection for millions of people this winter. Over-50s, care workers and younger adults with certain health conditions across the UK will also be offered a third vaccine dose, at least six months after their second jab. People will be contacted when it's their turn to received one dose of Pfizer or a half dose of Moderna. Catherine Cargill, a maternity support worker and student at Croydon University Hospital, said she was excited to get the booster. \"So far I haven't caught Covid and I want to keep it that way,\" she said.\nAfter a series of serious ambulance delays caused by the pressures of a surge in Covid cases, Scotland is drawing up a request for \"targeted military assistance\" for the ambulance service. Nicola Sturgeon said health services were dealing with \"probably the most challenging combination of circumstances\" in their history. Opposition politicians highlighted cases such as one man who died after a 40-hour wait. Ms Sturgeon said the incident was \"unacceptable\" and the Scottish Ambulance Service said it would apologise to the man's family as it launches an investigation. The Ministry of Defence is also considering a request for up to 100 armed services medics to be sent to Northern Ireland during October. In August, the Army also worked alongside NHS staff at four ambulance trusts in England due to staff shortages and high demand.\nScotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said he believed the nation's high infection rates may have peaked, with \"no sign\" major events such as Glasgow's TRNSMT festival had caused large numbers of infections. About 50,000 people attended the three-day festival on Glasgow Green last weekend, with attendees having to provide proof of a negative lateral flow test. Meanwhile, the Isle of Wight festival kicks off in Newport, with headliners including Liam Gallagher and Duran Duran. Organiser John Giddings said measures such as requiring vaccination, a negative lateral flow test or natural immunity through a recent infection meant it was \"safer to come here than your local supermarket\".\nA doctor using Tiktok to combat Covid vaccine myths has called for trainee medics to get social media training as part of their degrees. Dr Bnar Talabani is part of Team Halo, a UN-backed group of doctors and scientists using social media to counter misinformation, and said the medical profession needs to do more to engage with young people. \"We should get training for this at medical school and when we're doing our scientific degrees to teach us how we can do it safely, professionally, appropriately - but in a way that's quite engaging,\" she says. A former refugee from Iraq, Dr Talabini has been targeted by anti-vaxxers who told her she will \"hang at the Nuremberg trials\". But she says she does not tolerate rudeness - and the trolls only boost the visibility of her posts.\nParts of central London have agreed to make the al fresco dining areas established during the pandemic a permanent feature. More than 80% of people living in Covent Garden and St John's Wood supported the outdoor dining spaces in the streets, Westminster City Council said. Residents in Soho will also be consulted now, after the council previously said the roads would reopen to traffic in October. Pavements were widened, roads closed or parking bays suspended in around 60 streets Westminster during the pandemic to allow for extra restaurant seating, creating a total of 16,000 covers.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nEngland now has two plans for winter, a plan A and a contingency plan B if things get worse.

      "text": "The Scottish government has asked the MoD for military assistance for the country's ambulance service. \nNicola Sturgeon said health services were dealing with the most challenging combination of circumstances in their history due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nOpposition politicians have highlighted a series of serious ambulance delays, including one where a man died after a 40-hour wait. \nThey said this should not be happening in Scotland in 2021.\nMs Sturgeon said her government was looking at a range of plans to deal with the significant challenges facing the health services, with the detail of a request for military assistance being considered.\nShe told the Scottish Parliament: \"I'll be going back to my office to finalise the detail of the request for military assistance so we can submit that as quickly as possible.\"\nThe first minister added: \"Such military assistance is already being provided to ambulance services in England and of course we have had military assistance for other aspects of the pandemic over the past 18 months.\"\nA Scottish government spokesperson later confirmed it was seeking military assistance to address acute services, and a separate request had been made to support mobile testing units. \nThe Ministry of Defence confirmed it had received a request from the Scottish government, which it said related to support for Scottish Ambulance Service mobile testing units.\nA spokeswoman said the MoD was \"working hard to identify where we can most effectively assist other government departments and civil authorities.\"\nInvestigations are ongoing into several cases reported in the media on Thursday, including one where a Glasgow pensioner died after a 40-hour wait for an ambulance.\nThe Herald newspaper reported that the family of 65-year-old Gerard Brown were told that he could have survived had help arrived sooner.\nMr Brown's GP - who is said to have repeatedly warned 999 call handlers that the patient's status was critical - was quoted as describing the crisis engulfing the Scottish Ambulance Service as being like \"third world medicine\".\nThe Scottish Ambulance Service is investigating the circumstances of the case, and said it will be \"in contact with Mr Brown's family directly to apologise for the delay\".\nMr Brown's death has been reported to the procurator fiscal, who said an investigation was \"ongoing\".\nPressed on the case at her weekly question session at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon offered her condolences to Mr Brown's family, and said what had been reported was \"unacceptable\".\nShe said Scotland was \"experiencing probably the most challenging combination of circumstances that our health service has faced since its establishment\" due to the pandemic.\nEvelyn from Kilwinning told BBC Radio Scotland's Mornings with Stephen Jardine that her husband had been rushed to hospital three times in the last last few weeks due to concerns about his kidney function.\nTheir longest wait for an ambulance was 23 hours - and on an occasion where it had been called by their GP.\n\"He's an amputee and I wanted to take him in the car,\" said Evelyn. \"The doctor said no, it had to be an ambulance in case he deteriorated. \n\"Twenty-three hours was the longest wait, the time before was 11 and a half hours and the quickest was six hours. Both of us were very distressed. He's a very unwell man so this is going to be reoccurring - but one of these days our luck is just going to run out.\n\"The ambulance crew were absolutely amazing, but they were run ragged. When I went to the hospital there were nine ambulances outside the hospital waiting to admit people - that's nine crews that are off the road for hours.\"\nBrian from Troon said he was proud of his daughter who is an emergency call handler - but often hears of frustrated people becoming \"abusive\" to staff when they are told their cases are not high priority.\n\"It's reducing them to tears,\" said Brian. \"The staff are coming home looking for someone to talk to about it. \n\"Luckily the ambulance service have got it covered - supervisors listen in to the calls and say that's not acceptable and will cut them off and take the call themselves. They also look at the welfare side of things, they are such a good service. Abuse is totally not acceptable.\n\"It's their professionalism that gets them through this - they have sympathy with their callers, they try to calm them and in some cases they save people's lives until the ambulance arrives, whether it be someone having a stroke or having a baby.\"\nThe head of the Scottish Ambulance Service has previously apologised to patients over increased waiting times, saying staff were working under \"unprecedented pressure\" due to a \"huge increase\" in both Covid and non-Covid cases.\nPauline Howie said the service was \"at full capacity\" and hospitals were too, meaning it takes longer to hand over patients at emergency departments - creating delays in responding to other calls.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the ambulance service was \"in crisis\", and said cases like that of Mr Brown \"shouldn't be happening in Scotland in 2021\".\nHe also called for Health Secretary Humza Yousaf to withdraw comments he made on BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday, when he said people should \"think twice\" about whether they really needed an ambulance before calling for one. \nMs Sturgeon said the ambulance service was already \"operating at its highest level of escalation\" in response to current pressures, and said Mr Yousaf's comments reflected others made by services \"in every part of the UK\".\nLabour leader Anas Sarwar raised the same case, describing it as an \"avoidable human tragedy\".\nHe said Ms Sturgeon should not use the pandemic as an excuse, adding: \"There is a simple truth - nobody should be left to die on the floor while waiting 40 hours for an ambulance.\"\nMs Sturgeon said governments across the world were dealing with similar problems at the moment, and that her administration was \"absolutely focused\" on providing solutions.\nMeanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton called for the military assistance to be deployed swiftly, saying the government had \"done too little, too late\"."

      "text": "Students in England pay some of the highest tuition fees in the world - but that will not be sustainable if much of the teaching stays online, says an international education report.\nStudents will also expect the \"social life of campus\", says a report from the OECD group of industrialised countries.\nThe report also warned of huge regional differences in graduate numbers.\nThe proportion of graduates in London's working-age population is 79% higher than the north-east of England.\nRecord numbers of UK students are going to start at university this term - and the annual report from the OECD says those in England will pay higher tuition fees for public universities - \u00a39,250 per year - than any other developed country.\nThis doesn't include some of the prestigious private universities, such as in the United States, but OECD education expert Andreas Schleicher suggested that students at English universities will expect to have much more than online lessons for such high fees.\n\"I think this is going to be a real challenge,\" said Mr Schleicher.\n\"Students go to university to meet great professors, to watch with colleagues, to experience a social life,\" he told an event launching the report, which compares education systems around the industrialised world.\nIf too much of university life remained online, he said, it would fundamentally challenge the \"value proposition\" of tuition fees.\nUniversities had to put much teaching online during the pandemic - and last week the former education secretary Gavin Williamson warned universities that they needed to return to face-to-face tuition this term as much as possible.\nUniversities UK says the \"vast majority\" of teaching and socialising will be in person, but some large lectures might remain online for \"public health reasons\".\nAmong the decisions facing Mr Williamson's successor, Nadhim Zahawi, will be whether to go ahead with a tuition fee cut recommended by a government-commissioned review, which called for fees of \u00a37,500.\nThe new education secretary will also be promoting the \"levelling up\" agenda - and the OECD report showed that there were much wider regional differences in the spread of graduates in England than in most developed countries.\nIn London's local economy, the proportion of the adult working-age population with a higher education qualification was 79% higher than in the north-east of England - one of the biggest regional divides anywhere in a leading economy.\nThis regional gap is going to get wider, according to Ucas admission figures for this autumn's intake. The number of young people going to university has continued to climb in London and the south of England, but is going down in the north.\nThe numbers going to university this autumn from the north-east are lower than in 2012, according to Ucas figures.\nMr Schleicher, OECD education director, said the gap reflected the differences in the availability of graduate jobs across the country - but said it was a \"dangerous\" problem which was a barrier to social mobility.\n\"Why would you study hard when there's no high-skilled employer around you?\n\"It means that there's a lot of unused talent, a lot of people who have actually great potential, but do not invest in their education because they don't see the purpose of it,\" he said.\nThe OECD education report also highlighted a need for more support in the UK for vocational education and the early years of education.\nHe linked these by saying that expectations about careers and future pathways had often already been shaped before children left primary school.\nA spokeswoman for Universities UK defended the value of tuition fees.\n\"UK universities are world-leading, with the benefits of obtaining a degree here wide-ranging. Graduates in England earn on average \u00a310,000 more per year than non-graduates, and this is only one measure of success.\n\"The structure of the system in England means that no student pays fees up front and repayments are made based on a graduate's ability to pay over their working life.\""

      "text": "At the age of 46, Liz Truss has become the UK's second female foreign secretary - following a trail blazed previously only by Labour's Margaret Beckett 15 years ago.\nIn a relatively short time in Parliament, she has held a wide variety of posts, dealing with high-profile domestic and international issues.\nBut her new role will bring a new level of scrutiny, as her predecessor Dominic Raab found when he faced widespread criticism for remaining on holiday during the Afghanistan crisis.\nMs Truss, who has a husband and two daughters, has plenty of big issues in her Foreign Office in-tray, her promotion coming at a time when China, Russia, the UK's place in a post-Brexit world and Iran's nuclear programme are provoking many questions in diplomatic circles.\nBorn in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss describes her parents, a mathematics professor and a nurse, as \"left-wing\". \nIt was not a characteristic inherited by their daughter.\nShe moved to Paisley, in Scotland, aged four, and, in 1983 - in a hint of her future political proclivities - played the part of Margaret Thatcher in a school dramatic production.\nThe family then decamped to Leeds, where she attended a state secondary school.\nMrs Truss went on to Oxford University, where she read philosophy, politics and economics and was active in student politics, initially for the Liberal Democrats and later for the Conservatives.\nAfterwards she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, but her heart was set on Westminster.\nShe was the Tory candidate for Hemsworth and Calder Valley in the 2001 and 2005 general elections, failing to win either seat. But she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, from 2008 also working as deputy director of the right-of-centre Reform think tank.\nPart of Conservative leader David Cameron's \"A-list\" of priority candidates, Ms Truss was finally elected MP for for the safe Tory seat of South West Norfolk in 2010, with a 13,140-vote majority.\nWhile in Parliament she co-authored a book called Britannia Unchained, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches.\nIn 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister.\nShe clashed with Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg over schools reform, but Mr Cameron promoted her to the cabinet in 2014, as environment secretary.\nAt the 2015 Conservative conference, Ms Truss was mocked for giving a speech including an impassioned section on UK cheese imports, but this did not impede her progress.\nIn 2016, she became justice secretary under Theresa May, the following year moving on to become chief secretary to the Treasury, a position at the heart of the government's economic programme.\nAfter Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which means meeting political and business leaders to promote UK PLC.\nAs foreign secretary she will rack up just as many, if not more, air miles, with an awful lot more people watching her every move."

      "text": "Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has survived a confidence vote in the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) following a controversial appointment.\nFor weeks, he has been criticised for his handling of the appointment of former government minister Katherine Zappone as a UN special envoy.\nHe denied he was lobbied to appoint her but apologised for not informing members of the cabinet.\nHe won a confidence motion by 92 votes to 59.\nAhead of the vote, Mr Coveney said he regretted the \"preventable controversy\" over Ms Zappone's appointment, admitting he should have taken the issue more seriously when he was first questioned about it in the summer.\nHowever, he insisted the appointment was \"in no way corrupt or dishonest\".\nMs Zappone later turned down the job, saying the controversy had undermined the legitimacy of the envoy role. \nMr Coveney's party, Fine Gael, is in a coalition government with both Fianna F\u00e1il and the Green Party.\nOn 27 July 2021 he informed cabinet ministers that Ms Zappone would become the new \"Special Envoy to the UN for Freedom of Opinion and Expression\".\nHowever, the job had not been advertised and it later emerged that neither Fianna F\u00e1il nor Green Party ministers knew about her appointment, including the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin.\nThe Republic's biggest opposition party, Sinn F\u00e9in, tabled a motion of no confidence in Mr Coveney on Wednesday - the first day the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) returned from its summer recess.\nBut the government put down a counter confidence motion to be voted on by TDs (members of parliament).\nThe taoiseach has described Mr Coveney's failure to inform his government colleagues before the appointment as an \"oversight\".\nMr Martin warned Fianna F\u00e1il TDs that they faced a six-month suspension from the parliamentary party if they did not support Mr Coveney in Wednesday's vote. \nThe taoiseach's response caused internal divisions within his own party. \nBefore the vote on Wednesday evening, Fianna F\u00e1il TD Marc MacSharry resigned from the parliamentary party and insisted he would be voting no confidence in Mr Coveney.\nMr MacSharry, who is a long-time critic of Mr Martin, claimed Fianna F\u00e1il policy was currently being \"determined in a fashion consistent with an undemocratic totalitarian regime\". \nEarlier in the controversy, it emerged Mr Coveney's party leader Leo Varadkar had not been aware of the special envoy appointment until a week before cabinet, when Ms Zappone texted him about it. \nIn messages released by Mr Varadkar in September, he showed that he subsequently asked Mr Coveney about the role before the cabinet meeting in July.\nMs Zappone replied her contract was soon to be finalised.\nOn 4 August, Ms Zappone announced she would not take on the special envoy position as she believed \"it is clear that criticism of the appointment process has impacted the legitimacy of the role itself\".\nSinn F\u00e9in President Mary Lou McDonald has called for Mr Coveney to be sacked, branding his actions as not being \"of the standard expected of a minister\".\nThe Labour Party indicated it did not have confidence in the government but leader Alan Kelly said there were \"bigger issues\" than the row.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Coveney told a party conference he was \"embarrassed\" the appointment had led to a \"fiasco\".\n\"It's not been my finest month in politics,\" he said.

      "tags": "Grenfell Tower fire,Construction industry,Grenfell Tower Inquiry,UK fire safety",
      "text": "Leaked test results suggest the government and construction industry had early evidence of the dangers posed by cladding, 13 years before the Grenfell Tower fire. \nPanels, commonly used on buildings in the UK, failed fire tests carried out in 2004. \nThe results, marked \"Commercial in confidence\", were circulated within an industry advisory group. \nThey were recently passed to the BBC and, until now, never made public. \nHundreds of thousands of flat owners are now threatened with large bills because of construction materials which pose a risk in fires. \nThe 2004 results were among the first from a British test of full-scale building systems, developed in the late 1990s when there were growing concerns in Parliament about the risks of cladding. \nThe tests were part of research commissioned by the then Labour government to determine what standards building systems should have to meet. \nFive cladding systems were tested, including one with aluminium panels, although the primary aim was not to assess the risk of particular designs\nThe aluminium and plastic cladding at Grenfell has been blamed for spreading the fire. \nTwo were constructed from high pressure laminate (HPL) boards, formed from wood, or paper fibre, widely used on modern apartment blocks in the UK.\nIn the tests, all five cladding systems were judged to have failed against \"proposed performance criteria\".\nMost of the tests were carried out without using \"fire breaks\" - extra components which should be fitted to block the spread of flames. \nHowever, fire breaks were used in one high pressure laminate panel system, but it still failed. \nZoe Bartley bought a three-room flat in Chelmsford four years ago, and with her partner Ash, now has a baby.  \nThey are desperate to move to a bigger home, but the cladding crisis means they cannot sell the flat. \nIt has HPL panels, as well as wooden balconies and missing fire breaks, \nZoe finds it \"disgusting\" that the test results were not circulated more widely. \nThe couple are anticipating a bill of tens of thousands of pounds to remove the dangerous materials, which could bankrupt them. \n\"There's no finish line, and it's all-consuming at times,\" Zoe says. \n\"We are very angry that we've been put in this situation. \n\"We've done everything right. Everything by the book: 'Buy a property and set yourself up for the future.'\n\"I might end up bankrupt by the time I'm in my 30s.\"\nHer building is lower than 18 metres, so does not qualify for government funding. \nThe UK Cladding Action Group called the test results \"staggering new evidence which shows the government and its advisers knew these materials were dangerous, but simply stood back and allowed them to be installed on hundreds of thousands of buildings.\n\"The British state knew from this moment on that it was gambling with a disaster in a high-rise, but it chose not to act.\"\nJonathan Evans, director of Ash and Lacy, a major UK supplier of cladding systems, said he had never seen the results, and described them as \"really vital bits of information\" which would have helped assess fire risks after Grenfell. \nHe said that when poor test data is not made public, it creates a bias towards tests with successful outcomes.\n\"We all proceed along the route of thinking these systems are safer than they are, until there's a disaster.\"\nHe said a lack of public information about cladding systems in the 2000s may have resulted in governments not abandoning a controversial British standard for building materials, known as Class 0.  \nThe Grenfell Tower inquiry has heard evidence that this standard was much easier to meet than a stricter European classification, and that keeping it as an option in England and Wales allowed combustible materials to be installed on thousands of buildings.\nIf Class 0 had been abandoned and a ban on combustible materials introduced, Grenfell might not have happened, Dr Evans said.\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) described the 2004 tests as \"experimental... for a different purpose\" than the rounds of testing ordered in the wake of the Grenfell disaster. \nThey were carried out to \"to check the criteria for testing\" rather than to assess the \"intrinsic safety of building materials\", officials said.\nThe findings fed into a review of technical standards used by building designers to assess the safety of cladding. \nAn MHCLG spokesman said: \"We are taking action to improve building safety where successive governments have failed, through our Building Safety Bill, which marks the biggest improvements to building safety in 40 years, with more rights and protections for residents and a \u00a35bn investment to remove unsafe cladding.\n\"The new Building Safety Regulator will enforce a more stringent regulatory regime for buildings over 18m and oversee the safety and performance of all buildings, ensuring products are removed from the market if they do not meet regulation.\"\nThe Building Research Establishment, which carried out the tests and circulated them to the industry advisory group, refused to comment.\nNext month the Grenfell Tower public inquiry will begin examining evidence of what governments knew about the risks of cladding fires before the 2017 disaster, and what they did about it.

This is about all child killers that you are releasing, because if you're making mistakes on Stephen Chafer, Stephen Leonard, whatever you want to call him, you're making mistakes elsewhere because people just don't learn.\"\nHe said he believed the authorities were \"scared to death I'm going to sue\".\nBut he added: \"I don't want the money - no amount of money can bring my daughter back. \n\"I just don't want the same mistakes made again with other criminals.\"\nMr Holt had been offered a meeting and said: \"I'm prepared to meet them but I'm gutted that they say one thing and then do another - that's not fair.\"\nThe Ministry of Justice has since said that, in general, SFO reviews were provided to victims of later offences to share with them the actions being taken to address any failings in the supervision of offenders.\nIt said the confidential information in them was not routinely available to victims of the initial offences.\nA spokesman said: \"The details of this review have already been shared with the victims of this crime and we are also meeting with Mr Holt to do the same.\n\"We are committed to ensuring victims get the information they need to understand what happened, which is why we disclose SFO reviews to victims of the offence where they request to receive them.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Dominic Raab,Boris Johnson,Cabinet reshuffles,Robert Buckland,Gavin Williamson",
      "text": "Boris Johnson is overseeing a reshuffle of his cabinet. \nBBC editors and correspondents look back at the performances of the politicians leaving their job - and the challenges facing those who are taking over.\nDominic Raab is always happy to let it be known that he holds a black belt in karate. \nAnd given that his conversation with the prime minister this reshuffle day took longer than expected suggests that he fought his move pretty hard. \nBeing justice secretary, running prisons, courts and the legal system, is of course a huge job. And it matches his legal experience too. \nBut there's no doubt that it is a demotion, losing out on one of the most prestigious jobs in government as foreign secretary. \nDowning Street doesn't want this to be seen as punishment after what looked, to many people, as a debacle in Afghanistan, Mr Raab even taking his family holiday during the crisis. \nBut even with the bauble of deputy prime minister as part of his title (you wonder if title was a product of the tetchy conversations), Mr Raab, the now former foreign secretary, is a less senior figure in the government.\nThe new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is only the second woman - after Labour's Margaret Beckett - to hold the post.\nAs a former trade minister, she is a known figure on the international diplomatic circuit, having travelled the world negotiating trade deals that had to be replaced after Brexit.\nShe will bring some character to a job that often requires a bit of human diplomacy.\nLike the prime minister, she is no stranger to the photo-opportunity. But the risk is that her willingness to speak freely might get her into trouble, as she admitted to the BBC's Nick Robinson a few years ago, telling him: \"I don't think anyone would describe me as diplomatic.\"\nNext week, Ms Truss will accompany the PM to the United Nations general assembly in New York.\nShe will play a key role in the government's efforts to secure a successful COP26 climate summit in November, and there are many bilateral relationships in need of some repair.\nFor the new foreign secretary, the learning curve will be steep and unrelenting.\nGavin Williamson found himself in the hot seat when schools closed their classrooms, and moved to on-and-off remote learning. It put him in the firing line for criticism from overstretched and exasperated head teachers and parents, as government policy led to sudden changes in direction. \nAs schools in England geared up to support the poorest families through hard times, they faced delays, first with food vouchers, then with devices. Confusing England footballer Marcus Rashford with another black sportsman added to the perception of being prone to gaffes.\nBut it was in the days before and after A-level results of 2020 in England when the chaos peaked. The education secretary defended the system, before a massive U-turn that felt inevitable. \nMr Williamson has said he is most proud of his contribution to giving skills a higher profile. The cost of implementing an eye-catching promise of a life-long learning loan will be in his successor's in-tray, as will looming decisions about future university funding.\nFor a government committed to levelling up, the long-term impact of the pandemic on the poorest children's education is the other big challenge. The \u00a33bn promised for catch-up fell so far short that the government's own adviser resigned earlier this year. \nThere have been eight justice secretaries since the Conservatives came to power in 2010 - and Robert Buckland's two years, one month and 22 days makes him the third-longest holder of a post that the entire legal establishment regards as having being treated as an afterthought. \nMr Buckland, a respected lawyer and former judge, leaves office with 58,000 serious criminal cases waiting to come to a Crown Court. \nThat's 4,000 more than in January, when official watchdogs warned that the backlog was already of grave concern. \nThe upshot is that some victims will be waiting four years for justice. Incoming Justice Secretary Dominic Raab may not have actually been appointed to deal with this problem - but to take on an ideological challenge. \nMr Raab has credentials for speaking up on some human rights legal issues, yet he is also one of the most vocal critics of the Human Rights Act, one of the cornerstones of the modern British constitution. \nHe's long called for it to be replaced or repealed - and the government's long-promised review of human rights law is now in his hands. We'll soon find out where Mr Raab ultimately stands on one of the most important but misunderstood legal issues of our times.\nShe's the 10th culture secretary in 10 years.\nNadine Dorries, a successful novelist, a former contestant on I'm a Celebrity (which led to a brief suspension of the Conservative whip) and a strong advocate of gender equality on the BBC certainly has a track record in taking an interest in cultural matters.\nIn 2017 she tweeted: \"Left-wing snowflakes are killing comedy, tearing down historic statues, removing books from universities, dumbing down panto.\"\nHer move to the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) came on the day her predecessor, Oliver Dowden, was due to deliver his opinions on the future of Channel 4. That speech was instead made by media minister John Whittingdale.\nSport, gambling, the future of the BBC, broadband services: the DCMS has a broad remit that covers everything from dealing with the tech giants to helping to alleviate loneliness.\nAnd over recent months Mr Dowden has increasingly entered debates about so-called \"woke culture\", statues and removing \"contested heritage\". \nThis is political territory on which the new culture secretary has already expressed strong views."

Ms Petito's parents reported her missing 10 days later.\nBut police say although Mr Laundrie is refusing to speak to them about her disappearance, he has not been charged with any crime.\n\"We are pleading with anyone, including Brian, to share information with us on her whereabouts in the past few weeks,\" said North Port police chief Todd Garrison. \n\"The lack of information from Brian is hindering this investigation. The answers will eventually come out.\"\nBut Mr Laundrie's lawyer, Steve Bertolino, defended his silence.\n\"In my experience, intimate partners are often the first person law enforcement focuses their attention on in cases like this and the warning that 'any statement made will be used against you' is true, regardless of whether my client had anything to do with Ms Petito's disappearance. \n\"As such, on the advice of counsel Mr Laundrie is not speaking on this matter,\" Mr Bertolino said.\nMs Petito's family have called on Mr Laundrie to give answers, including when he last saw her and \"why he left Gabby all alone and drove her van to Florida\". \n\"These are critical questions that require immediate answers,\" they said in a statement.\nSpeaking at a news conference on Thursday, Ms Petito's father urged the public to provide information that could help in the case.\nThe couple set off on a nomadic nationwide road trip in a white Ford Transit van in July, posting updates on social media. \nThey filmed themselves smiling, kissing, and running on beaches in a YouTube video, \"Beginning Our Van Life Journey\", which has been viewed over 600,000 times.\nTwo weeks before Ms Petito went missing, on 12 August, police in the southern Utah town of Moab were called to a possible domestic violence incident involving the couple. \nPolice released bodycam footage which showed Ms Petito crying and complaining about her mental health to officers. She also said the couple had been arguing more frequently.\nThe officers recommended they spend the night apart but did not file any charges. It is not yet known what happened next.\nPolice have now seized the van and are examining it for clues."

His family moved to the UK in 1976 when he was aged nine, attending independent schools in London and then studying chemical engineering at University College London.\nHe will now be responsible for schools, colleges and universities in England, as they recover from the disruption of the pandemic.\n\"Education is a crucial part of our levelling up agenda so it's an honour to be back at the Department for Education as secretary of state,\" said Mr Zahawi.\n\"Children and young people have had a tough time during this pandemic and I'll be listening to them and their families as we accelerate our work to build back better and fairer.\"\nMary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union with Mr Courtney, urged the incoming education secretary to push for extra funding in next month's public spending review. \n\"The money promised to schools to date is a small fraction of the amount judged to be needed by the government's former education recovery tsar,\" said Ms Bousted.\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"One of the most pressing tasks facing Mr Zahawi will be to ensure that the government now fulfils its promise to deliver a properly funded recovery package so that every pupil in the country receives the support they need and deserve. \n\"With the comprehensive spending review only weeks away, there really is no time to waste.\"\n\"The Department for Education may now be under new management but the same challenges remain,\" said Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. \n\"More ambition is needed on post-Covid education recovery, investment in schools and colleges, support for children with special educational needs, and closing the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers,\" he said.\nMr Williamson's departing message said it had been a privilege to serve as education secretary \"despite the challenges of the global pandemic\". And he highlighted his efforts to raise the status of further education and skills.\n\"I'm particularly proud of the transformational reforms I've led in Post-16 education: in further education colleges, our skills agenda, apprenticeships and more,\" tweeted Mr Williamson.\nMr Williamson - the first big casualty of the reshuffle - had faced much criticism during the pandemic, with particular problems around last summer's exams, which saw protests and U-turns over how grades were decided.\n\"He failed to engage with our suggestions on how to make schools safer during Covid - and thereby kept them closed longer,\" said Mr Courtney.\nBut David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, commended Mr Williamson's support for further education, despite the disruption of the pandemic.\n\"It was always going to be a bumpy ride for Gavin Williamson. Despite that, he helped convince the prime minister and chancellor that post-16 education and skills should be a priority,\" said Mr Hughes.\nJo Grady, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, described his time in office as \"disastrous\".\n\"Rather than responding to the challenges of a global pandemic, he led the charge in a completely pointless culture war against university staff and students. \n\"A culture war that was entirely fabricated and led to no positive change in the sector,\" said Dr Grady.\nLabour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said: \"Two years of exams chaos and staff abandoned, unsupported and demoralised. That is Gavin Williamson's legacy.\n\"The prime minister has allowed this to happen, keeping a failing education secretary in post for months and refusing to fight for children's futures.\""

      "tags": "Flexible working,Employment,UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Most people do not believe workers will return to the office full-time after the coronavirus pandemic, an exclusive survey for the BBC suggests.\nA total of 70% of 1,684 people polled predicted that workers would \"never return to offices at the same rate\".\nThe majority of workers said that they would prefer to work from home either full-time or at least some of the time.\nBut managers raised concerns that creativity in the workplace would be affected.\nHalf of 530 senior leaders also surveyed by polling organisation YouGov for the BBC said that workers staying at home would adversely affect both creativity and collaboration - against just 38% of the general public.\nBosses at big firms such as investment bank Goldman Sachs and tech giant Apple have rejected calls for more flexibility, with the former even calling working from home an \"aberration\".\nManagers and members of the public surveyed for the BBC agreed, however, that neither productivity nor the economy would be harmed by continuing work-from-home policies.\nBT's chief executive Philip Jansen, for example, told the BBC that it is planning to let most of its office workers work on-site three or four days of the week in future - although thousands of its engineers won't be offered the same flexibility.\n\"We are a people business so collaboration, dynamism, teamwork, creativity... is really important to us,\" he said.\nAccording to the research, more than three-quarters of people believe their boss will allow them to continue working from home some of the time.\nAccording to the latest official figures, the proportion of workers who did at least some work from home in 2020 increased to 37%, up from 27% the previous year.\nMaisie Lawrinson joined TalkTalk through the government's Kickstart jobs scheme in July. Under the scheme, Jobcentre work coaches match young people aged between 16 and 24 who are on Universal Credit to new, temporary, roles.\nWhile Maisie is grateful for the six-month contract, she's keen to be in the office as much as possible so she can make a good impression.\n\"I've never had a job where I'm speaking to people online or emailing,\" she says, referring to her past experience in retail.\nShe adds: \"I'm more productive when I am in the office because it's more of a professional environment and you get to see people.\"\nHaving started the role remotely, she only got to meet her colleagues for the first time in-person recently.\n\"We recently had team drinks and I finally got to meet everyone. It was really nice, I got to see everyone in person and get an idea of who they are, rather than just what their email is.\" \nShe says she will still take the opportunity to work from home some days, though, perhaps towards the end of the week.\nMore than 60% of those surveyed thought young people would struggle to progress without face-to-face contact or in-person mentoring.\nAs experts have pointed out, under-25s in particular were hit hard by job losses or reduced hours at the onset of the pandemic.\nThe bespoke research for the BBC suggests that some inequalities may be exacerbated by the pandemic, while others might have improved.\nHalf of the workers surveyed thought that women's careers might be boosted by home-working, with childcare duties being less of a hindrance. \nOne enthusiastic home-worker is Antony Howard, who works in procurement for a large defence company in Manchester.\nHe's found big benefits to logging on remotely for the last 16 months, from avoiding expensive coffee shops to cutting down on travel time.\n\"My health and carbon footprint have never been better. I'm no longer commuting 92 miles a day and I'm more productive,\" he says.\n While he's also been saving money by shopping more locally, he does worry about those newer to the company.\n\"We've had 17-year-old apprentices starting in September who have never been on-site,\" he says.\n\"For me as a 57-year-old, hybrid working is a great scenario, but for the younger ones starting out, they need that workplace experience, that structure.\"\nEven so, he hopes that the pandemic will \"recalibrate\" the workplace. Rather than being a novelty, he says, \"I think this is the new now.\"\nRecruiters are finding it tricky to navigate the expectations of candidates demanding hybrid and remote working, and companies who want people back in the office for at least some of the time.\nKam Vara, a consultant at Katie Bard recruitment, says it has been a very challenging few months.\n\"It used to be that people would fit their lives around their work. Covid is teaching people that it doesn't work that way any more\", she says. \n\"People are turning down opportunities because they don't offer remote working, and they would rather sit tight and wait for the right job to become available\".\nShe adds: \"It feels quite messy right now. What an employer is looking for is some sort of order. To get people into the office and have some structure. But what employees are looking for is something very different. It's going to be like this for a while until the jigsaw fits together.\"\nIn England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson recommended a \"gradual return to work\" over the summer as coronavirus restrictions eased. Across the rest of the UK, people are still being advised to keep clocking on remotely where possible.\nAnd working remotely full-time for office staff could well become the norm again.\nOn Tuesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs that advising people in England should work from home again would be part of the government's contingency plans if there was considerable pressure on the NHS this winter.\nProf Andrew Hayward, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, added that the policy could make \"a significant difference to transmission if we get into trouble\".\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday: \"The most important and effective way of reducing spread of the virus is not to be in contact with other people.\" \nThe BBC commissioned polling organisation YouGov to survey 1,684 working adults and 530 senior leaders in business about their predictions and opinions on working from home. YouGov also re-ran a previous survey of 4,041 British adults, first conducted in March 2021, about their current working from home situation.\nHave your working arrangements changed?

      "text": "A 30-year-old man has been found guilty of the murder of Brian Phelan on the outskirts of Newry in July 2018.\nMr Phelan was stabbed three times in the neck and twice in the body during an attack on a remote Carrivekeeney Road, near to the village of Camlough.\nHe had gone there with Daniel Martin James Carroll, of Edward Street in Portadown, but originally from Newry.\nCarroll was found guilty of Mr Phelan's murder at Newry Crown Court on Wednesday.\nDuring a two-week trial, the court heard that on the day of his death Mr Phelan had met Carroll in Bessbrook before travelling to the road with the intention of buying quad bikes.\nThe road, which runs up the side of Camlough mountain, effectively comes to a dead end for vehicles, however a path does lead across the mountain.\nIt was the defence's case that three men with paramilitary links had appeared from a nearby field, attacked Mr Phelan, threatened him and then made off in the direction of the mountain. \nAlthough he said he knew them, Carroll would not name the men stating that his life and that of his family was at risk.\nThe defence said that the mountain path could have been accessed by small vehicles such as quadbikes.\nHowever, the prosecution said this version of events, which Carroll put forward 15 months after Brian Phelan's death, was complete nonsense. \nIt said the defendant had attacked the victim and then fled the scene, changing his T-shirt before being arrested nearly two hours later at a family member's home in Newry.\nAlthough no definite motive was identified, the jury had been told of Carroll's previous record, which included unprovoked violence.\nGiving evidence, a police officer had also suggested there could have been a financial disagreement between the two men.\nA jury of six men and five women took less than 90 minutes to reach a unanimous guilty verdict.\nSocial distancing meant that only a small number of Brian Phelan's friends and family were permitted inside the courtroom. \nThere were emotional scenes from those in the public gallery with a loud cheer from the adjoining foyer.\nBefore being sent down, the judge told Carroll that he would be sentenced to life imprisonment. \nA tariff hearing to determine the minimum amount of time he will spend in prison before being considered for parole will be set in November."

      "text": "A British woman who reported being gang-raped in Cyprus has appealed against her conviction for lying about the attack.\nHer legal team told the Cypriot Supreme Court that her statement retracting the gang rape allegation was unreliable because of how it was obtained.\nShe was detained for more than six hours, they said, with no access to a lawyer or translator, and placed under extreme pressure.\nPolice deny violating her rights.\nThe woman, who is 21 and from Derbyshire, originally told Cypriot police she had been raped by a group of 12 Israeli men and boys in Ayia Napa in July 2019.\nAfter retracting the allegation she was then tried and convicted of causing public mischief.\nShe was given a four-month suspended sentence in January 2020, which meant she could return to the UK.\nShe did not attend the two-hour appeal hearing, which was conducted in Greek in front of a panel of three judges.\nThere was no ruling on the appeal today, and it could take as long as six months.\nSpeaking after the hearing, the woman's English barrister, Lewis Power QC, said: \"This is the biggest case here in the last decade beyond a shadow of a doubt and the world is watching.\n\"It is so important for young women across the world. This case is a beacon.\"\nMr Power said he had spoken to the woman and her mother, who were \"back in the UK watching from afar\".\n\"She's bearing up really well. She is getting on with her life at university,\" he said.\n\"She is very anxious about the result but she is fairly upbeat and determined that this won't ruin her life.\"\nHer case has attracted widespread publicity and dozens of protesters gathered outside the court building for the appeal hearing.\nAs they banged drums, chanted and clapped their hands, some held up banners reading \"End rape culture\" and \"I believe her\".\nAdamos Demosthenous, representing the Cyprus attorney general, had argued the appeal should not be heard because the woman had criticised the trial judge in an ITV documentary, but the court ruled against the submission and heard the arguments.\nThe woman's lawyers said the retraction statement, which formed the basis of the prosecution case, should never have been admitted into evidence.\nThey said as well as being placed under pressure with no lawyer or translator, she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder at the time as a result of the rape.\nThey also argued the retraction statement was not written by a native English speaker.\nHer Cypriot lawyer, Nicoletta Charalambidou, said the lower court started from the position that there was no rape and had misunderstood the offence of public mischief, which requires a false statement of a make-believe crime.\nShe said the trial judge, Michalis Papathanasiou, also did not allow the defendant to talk about the alleged rape, repeatedly saying: \"This is not a rape trial.\"\nIf the conviction is not overturned her legal team intends to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights.\nAfter the hearing, Mr Power said: \"I think it was a very fruitful hearing where the court asked very poignant questions, considered the legal arguments and identified the points which will ultimately decide this appeal.\n\"We cannot pre-empt the decision of the court, but we were glad to see the court had given much thought and considerable consideration to a very, very difficult case.\"\nMichael Polak from Justice Abroad, which has been helping the woman, added: \"Without wanting to pre-judge the decision of the Supreme Court, we feel we were happy with the way proceedings went today and the way the judges engaged with our arguments.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "About 3,000 health workers in France have been suspended because they have not been vaccinated against Covid-19.\nA new rule, which came into force on Wednesday, made vaccination mandatory for the country's 2.7 million health, care home and fire service staff.\nBut French Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said on Thursday that \"most of the suspensions are only temporary\".\nMany are now agreeing to get jabbed because \"they see that the vaccination mandate is a reality\", he said.\nThe rule applies to all doctors, nurses, office staff and volunteers.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron first gave workers notice of the rule change on 12 July, warning them that they needed to get at least one jab by 15 September or resign from their jobs.\n\"I am aware of what I am asking of you, and I know that you are ready for this commitment, this is part, in a way, of your sense of duty,\" he said at the time.\nAfter the president's announcement, Doctolib, the website people use to book their jabs, crashed as so many people tried secure appointments.\nBut with the mandate now in place, and thousands still refusing to get the vaccine, there are fears of a disruption to healthcare services.\nIn just one hospital in Nice in southern France, for example, almost 450 workers have been suspended - sparking protests outside the building.\nAnd in another southern city, Mont\u00e9limar, one hospital confirmed that it had already begun cancelling non-urgent operations because of a shortage of vaccinated anaesthetists, AFP news agency reports.\n\"We have to keep these people on the job until they have been replaced,\" Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency doctor and left-wing MP, said.\nBut Mr V\u00e9ran told French RTL radio on Thursday that \"the continuity of care and the security of care and quality of care were assured yesterday in all hospitals and medico-social facilities\", although a few services, such as MRI scans, were impacted for a few hours.\nHe added that the suspensions mainly affected support staff, and \"few white coats\". There have also been \"a few dozen resignations\" across the country, he said.\nWhen the vaccines were first rolled out globally, France was one of the most vaccine-sceptical countries in the world. \nThen, about 40% of eligible people said they planned to get immunised, according to a survey by Ipsos. At the same time research from BBC Monitoring found that the number of followers of French-language pages sharing anti-vaccine content grew in 2020, from 3.2m to almost 4.1m likes.\nBut since the introduction of a Covid \"health pass\" in July, France has become one of the world's most vaccinated countries. \nAlmost 90% of all adults have now had at least one jab. France has also started vaccinating children aged 12 and over, and is administering booster jabs to vulnerable people.\nFrance is not the only country to introduce a vaccine mandate. \nItaly is also making an anti-Covid \"green pass\" mandatory for all employees from 15 October, meaning that workers who can't show proof of vaccination or a recent negative Covid test will be penalised.\n\"The government is ready to speed up on the 'green pass'... (for) not just the public sector, but private too,\" regional affairs minister Mariastella Gelmini said on Wednesday.\nThe green pass is already required for anyone in Italy who wants to eat indoors at restaurants, go to cinemas and sports stadiums, and take certain public transport or flights. It is also already mandatory for teachers.\nIn Greece, unvaccinated public and private sector employees have to have Covid tests once or twice a week, at their own expense. The rule came into force on 13 September.\nAnd last week, the US made vaccines mandatory for federal government workers and contractors, and for all businesses with more than 100 employees. The rule affects covers about 100 million workers.\nUS President Joe Biden warned that if people didn't get vaccinated, they should be prepared to undergo weekly testing for Covid-19.\n\"This is not about freedom, or personal choice, it's about protecting yourself and those around you,\" he said as he unveiled the plan."

      "tags": "Swansea",
      "text": "A man has been jailed for more than eight years after a CCTV operator saw him raping a woman. \nTurkey Al-Turkey, 26, of Cwm Level Road in Brynhyfryd, Swansea, attacked the woman outside the city's Civic Centre on 18 July. \nSwansea Crown Court heard the victim had no recollection of the incident and a date rape drug may have been used. \nAl-Turkey, an asylum seeker from Iraq, was sentenced to eight years and eight months after pleading guilty to rape.\nThe court heard Al-Turkey had been drinking limoncello and vodka with his victim on Swansea's promenade on the night of the attack. \nThe CCTV operator said he had seen the victim was intoxicated and unable to stand by herself, before he saw the attack take place as she lay motionless. \nHe used the council's loading bay public address system to shout: \"Get off her. She's drunk. I'm calling the police.\" \nOfficers arrived at 01:40 BST and were not able to rouse the victim. Al-Turkey told officers she was asleep. \nAt the police station, she told officers she had no recollection of the events, but was told what the CCTV operator had witnessed after that interview. \nCarina Hughes, prosecuting, told the court drugs had not been found in the victim's urine, but some substances, such as Gamma Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) are eliminated from the body more quickly, and their presence could not be excluded. \n\"Due to to her level of unconsciousness on CCTV, the prosecution felt it went over and above what we expected and anticipated from intoxication,\" she said. \u00a0\nAn alcohol sample measured 62mg of alcohol per 100ml of the victim's blood. \nA victim impact statement from the woman, who cannot be identified, was read out in court. It said: \"What's happened to me cannot be erased and will remain with me for the rest of my life.\n\"He has killed the spontaneous, joyful, carefree version of myself and only time will tell whether these traits return in full.\n\"The only positive element all of this is that he has been caught and is now going to be dealt with so that he cannot hurt anyone else.\" \nAnother statement, from the CCTV operator, said he was struggling and kept replaying events in his mind. \nMs Hughes said it was \"extremely rare\" for attacks like this to be captured on CCTV or witnessed. \nJudge Paul Thomas told Al-Turkey he had  \"serious misgivings\" about whether the victim's condition was due to alcohol alone.\n\"She made it perfectly clear to you that she did not want a sexual relationship that evening but you plied her with drink so she became less and less able to stand or even to move unaided\" he said.\n\"You took full advantage of the situation, putting your own sexual needs before any consideration of the impact upon her.\"\nAl-Turkey was sentenced to eight years and eight months in prison and will be on the sex offenders' register for the rest of his life. \nHe will serve two-thirds of the sentence, for which he had been given a one-third credit for his guilty plea. \nThe court was told Al-Turkey presented himself to the asylum unit in Croydon on the 19 November 2018 when he claimed to have just arrived in the United Kingdom.\nMr Thomas added: \"Importantly I fully expect that you will be deported from this country immediately upon your release.\""

      "tags": "Conservative Party,UK government,Boris Johnson,Elizabeth Truss",
      "text": "Boris Johnson is putting the finishing touches to his reshuffle after making significant changes to his top team. \nOn Wednesday, the PM fired both Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, before replacing Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab with Liz Truss. \nHe has now moved on to confirming which junior ministers are in or out of jobs.\nBut one ousted minister, John Whittingdale, told BBC's Newscast that the new team could lack experience.\nIn some of the latest manoeuvres, Conor Burns, who resigned as a trade minister in 2020 after a report found he used \"veiled threats\" to aid his father in a financial dispute, returned to the front bench as a Northern Ireland minister. \nOthers moved to more high-profile ministerial roles on Thursday included Alex Chalk, who was appointed Solicitor General, and Skills Minister Gillian Keegan, who now joins the Department for Health and Social Care.\nBut Justin Tomlinson lost his job as minister for disabled people in the same department, while Matt Warman was sacked as minister of digital infrastructure. \nFormer Brexit and Northern Ireland Minister, Robin Walker, has gone to the Department for Education, where he will work with the new Secretary of State, Nadhim Zahawi.\nAnd Helen Whately, who was the minister for social care, has been moved to the Treasury, but Jesse Norman joined the list of sackings.  \nEarlier on Thursday, Penny Mordaunt left her post as paymaster general at the Cabinet Office to become a minister at the trade department.\nMr Whittingdale - who lost his job as data minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport - said his post had been one he \"loved\" and was \"sad to give up\". \nHe also revealed some of the PM's appointments \"came out of the blue\".\nThe former minister told Newscast: \"I understand that every prime minister has to make room to allow people to be brought forward. I quite recognise the prime minister is keen to have a front-facing cabinet that reflects modern Britain. \n\"Equally it's no bad thing to have a bit of experience around that table and people who have got a good grasp of the detail of the jobs they are being asked to do.\"\nThere were big winners from the reshuffle too, included Nadine Dorries, who was promoted from being a junior health minister into her first cabinet-level job as culture secretary.\nThe Mid Bedfordshire MP is probably best known outside Westminster for her 2012 appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.\nMs Truss, who is the Tory party's first female foreign secretary - and only the second woman to hold the role, following Labour's Margaret Beckett - said she was delighted by the appointment and would use the role to \"promote a positive, outward vision of global Britain\".\nOther changes made on Wednesday included:\nFormer Justice Secretary Mr Buckland's sacking was greeted with some surprise, with a number of Labour MPs tweeting praise for him and senior Conservative Sir Bob Neill - who chairs the Commons Justice Committee - saying he \"deserved better\". \nIn a letter to the prime minister after his dismissal, Mr Buckland called for more investment in the justice system, adding that \"years of underfunding\" had made it harder for it to recover from the effects of the pandemic.\nNew Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Mr Gove will also get the added responsibility of the government's \"levelling up\" agenda - which it claimed would spread wealth and opportunity around the country - while continuing to handle demands for another Scottish independence referendum.\nThe Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Dowden, following his appointment as the Tory party's new co-chairman, had told staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters to start preparing for a general election which could be in 20 months' time.\nAfter the early traumas of Brexit, then the emergency and horror of the pandemic, the moves represent, they hope, a refreshed team that can get things done.\nWhether it's building houses without upsetting the Tory shires, sorting out school exams, pushing through tougher prison sentences, with new faces it's a government that Downing Street hopes will be more able to push reform forward, and make its case.\nNearly two years after the election, it's perhaps the start of Mr Johnson's third act as prime minister.\nRead more from Laura\nMr Johnson continued making changes late into the night on Wednesday as he got the reshuffle of more junior ministers under way, ahead of the further changes on Thursday.\nLong-serving Nick Gibb was sacked from his role at the Department for Education, while Caroline Dinenage lost her job as a culture minister, and Luke Hall was fired as a local government minister.\nAmanda Milling, who was removed as Conservative Party co-chairwoman, has become a Foreign Office minister.\nJulia Lopez has been moved from the Cabinet Office to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, while Greg Hands left the Department of International Trade for a new brief as business minister."

      "tags": "Department for Education,Universities,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children",
      "text": "Gavin Williamson has been the highest-profile education secretary for England since Michael Gove - but probably not for the right reasons.\nIf the pandemic had a political fall guy, it was always likely to be Mr Williamson - often the lightning rod for irritation and exasperation from families facing disruption and U-turns on schools and exams.\nNow he has become one of the big casualties of the prime minister's reshuffle - tweeting on his departure that it had been a privilege to serve \"despite the challenges of the global pandemic\".\nIt might seem a long time ago now, but before the pandemic Mr Williamson was seen as the bringer of good news. \nHis predecessors as education secretary had faced constant maulings over school funding shortages - but Mr Williamson arrived with the promise of a \u00a37bn increase. It was big bucks and big ambitions.\nThe trouble only really began when his department collided with the giant iceberg of Covid.\nThe first dent was a major U-turn on getting all primary school pupils back to school, and then there were self-defeating battles with Marcus Rashford over free meals in the holidays.\nOnline learning at home tested parents' patience and fed into worries about lost learning and annoyance at the hokey-cokey of going in and out of school, with hundreds of thousands of pupils regularly having to isolate.\nBut the biggest disaster was the chaos of last year's exams, with multiple U-turns and late-night lurches in policy that saw grades go through the roof and his department's most senior civil servant and the head of the exams watchdog both go out the door.\nThat such senior staff had to step down while he stayed put didn't add to the lustre of his reputation.\nThere has never been a full independent inquiry into what went wrong with the 2020 exams - so it's hard to know who was really to blame. But it did serious harm to Mr Williamson's credibility - and there was no shortage of people on his own side who were privately ready to point the finger.\nAnd his poll ratings among Conservative supporters remained resolutely negative.\nAs a former chief whip, it was said his survival chances were boosted by knowing where the bodies were buried. But he also made political enemies ready to come back to haunt him.\nMr Williamson, who has never appeared to complain about the criticism directed at him, could also feel aggrieved that he was taking the blame for decisions that were never down to an individual minister.\nThat was encapsulated in the plans to get schools back in January 2021, when his determination to open classrooms was reversed almost immediately by another lockdown. \nExams, which he'd wanted to go ahead, were again cancelled and the long-awaited catch-up plans turned to dust when the catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins walked out over a lack of funding.\nThe education secretary doesn't write the cheques but he was left holding a punctured balloon of a policy.\nThis year's replacement exam results, with much responsibility outsourced to teachers and schools, didn't have any of the major problems of last year. There would have been cause for quiet celebration that it had all gone relatively smoothly - not an easy achievement in what remain unprecedented circumstances.\nBut after a successful re-opening of schools this autumn, there was another tripwire moment when in an interview with the London Evening Standard he seemed to confuse two black sportsmen, Marcus Rashford and Maro Itoje. It was another gift for his critics on social media.\nIt's hard to know what the legacy will be of his education plans, because he never really got a chance to start them, beyond pushing for a greater emphasis on skills and further education. The pandemic overshadowed everything else.\nWill he bounce back to a big post in government again? At 45 he is still young by political standards, and has the northern, state-school, non-Oxbridge credentials for the government's levelling up plans. \nHe certainly seems ready to fight on, describing himself as having the hide of a rhino.\nBut there were times when he looked distinctly weary - such as an online talk with head teachers where he extolled the virtues of getting a dog who would always be there for you.\n\"Not every day has been brilliant,\" he told them."

      "tags": "France,Inflation,Natural gas,Electricity,National Grid",
      "text": "The UK government should cut rising energy bills by getting rid of levies that subsidise renewable energy, the boss of E.On UK has said.\nSpeaking to the Financial Times, Michael Lewis said green subsidies should be funded through tax instead.\nRegulators have warned that consumer energy bills will be hit by soaring prices of fossil fuels globally.\nWholesale energy prices rose on Thursday after a key electricity cable between Britain and France shut down.\nMr Lewis said: \"This is going to be a very challenging winter for customers and for suppliers and there is a real short-term imperative to do what we can to help consumers.\"\nGreen levies account for around a quarter of energy bills, he said.\nMr Lewis recommended removing green levies and paying for subsidies through general taxation, \"so these costs are funded more progressively and we level the playing field on the cost of cleaner heating.\"\n\"Then we can also start to apply something like a carbon tax on gas on a 'polluter pays' principle,\" he added.\nA government spokesperson said: \"Our energy price cap will protect millions of customers this winter from sudden increases in global gas prices.\n\"Millions of low-income households will also benefit from a \u00a3140 discount on their bills, with added support offered to pensioners and the most vulnerable over the colder months.\"\nA jump in prices after a UK electricity interconnector was taken offline after a fire has been fuelling concerns about inflation and the potential impact on businesses just as the country's economy starts to recover from the worst effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\nNational Grid said the fire and planned maintenance at a site near Ashford in Kent meant the cable will be totally offline until 25 September.\nHalf of its capacity, or one gigawatt (GW) of power, is expected to remain unavailable until late March 2022.\nOn Wednesday, British electricity prices for the following day jumped by 19% to \u00a3475 per megawatt hour (MWh).\nThe energy regulator told the BBC that increasing prices, for gas in particular, \"will feed into all customer energy bills in the UK\".\nThe price cap, which limits the price firms can charge customers who have not recently changed their energy tariff, will increase in October in order to cover rising wholesale costs.\nThe fire at the Interconnexion France-Angleterre (IFA) site broke out in the early hours of Wednesday. The site was evacuated and there were no reports of casualties.\nAfter the fire an electricity interconnector running under the English Channel was \"not operating\", the National Grid said in a statement.\nElectricity interconnectors are high-voltage cables that connect the electricity systems of neighbouring countries, and allow them to share excess power.\nA spokesperson for National Grid's electricity system operator, which balances power supplies in the UK, said it expects to \"continue supplying electricity safely and securely\" despite the incident.\nThe link can carry up to 2GW of power, and had been importing electricity from France in recent days, after UK prices hit a record high of \u00a3540 per MWh on the wholesale energy market.\nAnalysts are now closely watching National Grid's efforts to get the facility fully back online as winter approaches and with it higher energy demand.\nGlenn Rickson, head of European power analysis at S&P Global Platts Analytics, told Reuters: \"The outage is going to lift the potential for price volatility as long as it's offline... and of course demand will get higher as we move further into winter.\"\nUK Steel director general Gareth Stace pointed out that the \"extortionate\" electricity prices had already forced some steelmakers to suspend operations.\n\"Even with the global steel market as buoyant as it is, these eye-watering prices are making it impossible to profitably make steel at certain times of the day and night,\" he said.\nOther analysts have suggested that as a result, the UK may have to rely more heavily on gas-fired power stations in the coming months. \nWholesale gas prices are already elevated for several reasons, such as low winds meaning less renewable energy is generated, outages at some nuclear stations and lower flows into the UK of the gas from Norway.\nOn Wednesday, fertilizer producer CF Industries Holdings said it was suspending operations at both its Billingham and Ince manufacturing complexes due to high gas costs.\nNational Grid said its investigation into the fire at the IFA site was continuing and it would \"update the market with any changes as necessary\".\nBritain is a net importer of electricity and near neighbour France is its biggest supplier of power through the interconnectors that run under the English Channel. \nThe IFA2 interconnector, a second link between Britain and France, is currently operating at its full capacity and not affected by the problem.\nThe 1GW connection is a \u00a3700m shared investment with French power firm RTE and the UK's fourth power exchange with continental Europe."

      "tags": "China,United States,Australia",
      "text": "China has criticised a historic security pact between the US, UK and Australia, describing it as \"extremely irresponsible\" and \"narrow-minded\".\nThe deal will see the US and UK give Australia the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines for the first time.\nIt is being widely viewed as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea.\nThe region has been a flashpoint for years and tensions there remain high.\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the alliance risked \"severely damaging regional peace... and intensifying the arms race\".\nHe criticised what he called \"the obsolete Cold War... mentality\" and warned the three countries were \"hurting their own interests\".\nChinese state media carried similar editorials denouncing the pact, and one in the Global Times newspaper said Australia had now \"turned itself into an adversary of China\".\nThe US is sharing its submarine technology for the first time in 60 years, having previously only shared it with the UK.\nIt means Australia will be able to build nuclear-powered submarines that are faster and harder to detect than conventionally powered fleets. They can stay submerged for months and shoot missiles longer distances - although Australia says it has no intention of putting nuclear weapons on them.\nThe new partnership, under the name Aukus, was announced in a joint virtual press conference between US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning.\nAnd while China was not mentioned directly, the three leaders referred repeatedly to regional security concerns which they said had \"grown significantly\".\n\"This is an historic opportunity for the three nations, with like-minded allies and partners, to protect shared values and promote security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,\" a joint statement read.\nThe Aukus alliance is probably the most significant security arrangement between the three nations since World War Two, analysts say.\nIt means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines.\nWhile they are the big-ticket item in the deal, cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies will also be shared.\nAustralia will also acquire long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, and allow more US troops to be stationed in the country's north.\n\"This really shows that all three nations are drawing a line in the sand to start and counter [China's] aggressive moves,\" said Guy Boekenstein from the Asia Society Australia.\nBoris Johnson later said the pact would \"preserve security and stability around the world\" and generate \"hundreds of high-skilled jobs\".\nUK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the BBC that China was \"embarking on one of the biggest military spends in history... Our partners in those regions want to be able to stand their own ground.\"\nIn recent years, Beijing has been accused of raising tensions in disputed territories such as the South China Sea.\nIt has been increasingly assertive over what it says are centuries-old rights to the contested region, and has been rapidly building up its military presence to back up those claims.\nThe US has bolstered its military presence too, and has been investing heavily in other partnerships in the region such as with Japan and South Korea.\nHaving the submarines stationed in Australia is critical to US influence in the region, analysts say.\nThe Western powers have also been wary of China's infrastructure investment on Pacific islands, although it remains below US and Australian spending there.\nChina is Australia's biggest trading partner, and in the past, the two have maintained good relations. But in recent years that has broken down. \nAustralia has accused Beijing of interfering in its domestic politics, blocked Chinese investment, and banned Chinese telecom giant Huawei from building Australian tech infrastructure.\nCanberra also echoed a call by the US last year for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus.\nBeijing's response was to deliver a series of trade punishments - sanctioning over a dozen Australian goods. It has slapped Australian wine with taxes of up to 200%.\nAustralia hopes the new alliance will also help cushion the economic blowback.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday: \"Beijing has seen over the past months that Australia will not back down and the threats of economic retaliation and pressure simply will not work.\"\nBut France has also reacted angrily to the new pact, because it means Australia will now abandon a $50bn (\u20ac31bn; \u00a327bn) deal with it to build 12 submarines.\n\"It's really a stab in the back,\" France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Info radio. \"We had established a relationship of trust with Australia, this trust has been betrayed.\"\nThe European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell said he understood why France was disappointed by the deal, adding that the EU was not consulted about the new alliance.\n\"This forces us once again... to reflect on the need to make the issue of European strategic autonomy a priority. This shows that we must survive on our own,\" he said on Thursday.\nSecretary Blinken said the US cooperated \"incredibly closely\" with France and would continue to do so, adding that \"we place fundamental value on that relationship, on that partnership\".

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Thousands of travellers who might have breached quarantine restrictions were never investigated by Police Scotland due to a lack of accurate data.\nNearly two-thirds of 6,780 referrals from Public Health Scotland (PHS) were \"weeded out\" by the force.\nThe police's data also revealed that more than 80% of referrals were discarded in one week in February.\nThe health body said all referrals had contained a Scottish address and a phone number. \nThe system of spot checks on people requiring to self-isolate got under way in Scotland  in July last year in an effort to slow the spread of Covid, and stop new variants arriving in the country.\nPassenger arrivals into Scotland are provided by the Home Office to PHS, which in turn passes a sample of the data to NHS National Services Scotland, the organisation which runs the National Contact Tracing Centre.\nIf the Test and Protect team are unable to reach new arrivals who should be quarantining after three phone calls, PHS then passes on their contact details to Police Scotland to investigate further.\nSince quarantine regulations came into force, Police Scotland has received 6,780 referrals from PHS relating to potential breaches of quarantine, as of 1 September.\nThe number of people involved could well be higher as a single referral could include several individuals.\nAnalysis of data collated from weekly Police Scotland bulletins reveals that to date 4,198 (62%) of all PHS referrals were \"weeded out\" by the force before any initial investigation took place. These cases were not examined further because there was not enough information provided to track down the individual.\nPolice Scotland confirmed these thousands of cases were closed, and never revisited.\nData from a separate freedom of information response also shows that in some cases the two-week quarantine window had already expired before they were referred to police.\nA more granular analysis reveals that as many as 81% of new referrals in early February were discarded, largely due to insufficient data.\nThis \"weeding out\" rate remained high in June - around the time the highly contagious Delta variant of coronavirus was spreading rapidly through the country.\nWhile the proportion of weekly discarded cases has since decreased to 30%, an average of 61 referrals were still screened out by police investigators in August.\nAccording to PHS figures there were 36,375 people who arrived in Scotland from outside the UK in the last week of August, of which 5,442 were required to quarantine.\nOf the 116 cases referred to police that week, almost a third were never investigated due to a lack of data.\nA PHS spokesperson said: \"In Scotland, the onus of responsibility to comply with travel regulations lies with the individual. \n\"Information that is passed to Police Scotland includes the traveller's name, date of birth, travel dates, contact details and which country they have arrived from. \n\"Information is also included on why the traveller was unable to be contacted by the Test and Protect team, either as a result of an incorrect or no phone number, or if the traveller did not answer the phone.\"\nPHS said all referrals sent to Police Scotland contain an address in Scotland and at least one phone number.\nWhile the health body did not address specific questions related to the accuracy of the contact data, one police document reported that a number of passenger locator forms contained incorrect details.\nOnce the PHS referrals have been vetted, members of a Police Scotland resolution team begin their own investigation.\nIf the people in question cannot be reached by telephone, police officers in the vicinity are dispatched to attend the given address in person.\nTo date almost half of all these referred cases did not respond to phone calls, which led to the subsequent callouts of local officers.\nA police report submitted to the Scottish police watchdog in June reported that \"in respect of resolved referrals, 80% of the foreign travellers were found to be complying with quarantine restrictions.\"\nA force spokesperson said a person's statement of compliance was taken on trust.\nThe remaining 20% of referrals meant approximately 400 cases were never traced.\nThe latest police data also shows that 18 fixed penalty notices, and six standard prosecution reports have been issued by police as of 1 September.\nAssistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs said: \"Our approach throughout the pandemic has not changed. \n\"Officers support people to follow the regulations by explaining, engaging and encouraging them to take personal responsibility.\n\"Officers have found that the majority of those we have spoken to after a referral from Public Health Scotland are following the rules. \n\"However, on occasion where people are not adhering to the regulations, enforcement has been necessary as a last resort.\""

      "text": "The High Court in London will formally contact the Duke of York about allegations of sexual assault filed in a US court.\nLawyers for Virginia Giuffre, who has accused Prince Andrew, requested the High Court contact the prince about the civil case launched in New York.\nThe prince's lawyers have argued he has not been properly served notice of the case. \nPrince Andrew has consistently denied Ms Giuffre's allegations. \nHis spokeswoman has declined to comment on the latest development.\nThe Hague Service Convention, a treaty that governs requests between countries for evidence in civil or commercial matters, allows Ms Giuffre's legal team to ask the High Court in London to formally notify Prince Andrew about her civil action.\nThe High Court had initially rejected their request, citing an issue with the application, but later said: \"The lawyers acting for Ms Giuffre have now provided further information to the High Court, and the High Court has accepted the request for service under the Hague Service Convention.\n\"The legal process has not yet been served but the High Court will now take steps to serve under the convention, unless service is arranged by agreement between the parties.\"\nAt the first pre-trial hearing in New York, on Monday, the prince's lawyer, Andrew Brettler, argued he had not been properly served under either UK or international law. \nMs Giuffre's lawyers had claimed papers had been left with a police officer at the gates of Prince Andrew's Windsor home last month - and so successfully \"served\".\nThe prince does not face the prospect of an extradition hearing, as this applies only to criminal charges and not civil cases.\nIt is now becoming very, very hard for the Duke of York to avoid being served with documents and having to file a response to the courthouse in New York.\nAn international agreement between British and US courts means the High Court is now under an obligation to find the most practical way to serve the Giuffre case on Prince Andrew. \nEnglish law sets out clear but flexible rules on how that should happen - and the court will ultimately decide how best to proceed. \nIt could order an officer of the court to take the documents once more to Windsor, where Prince Andrew lives. \nBut the US lawyers could ask the High Court to approve an alternative method, such as posting or emailing them, or leaving them with one of his known lawyers. \nIn practice, many defendants presented with this situation ultimately accept they have to be served and consent to it, so they can focus on how they will respond and attempt to have the case dismissed.\nDuring the hearing, held via telephone conference, Mr Brettler also described the civil case against the prince as \"baseless, non-viable [and] potentially unlawful\". \nAnd he said a 2009 settlement between Ms Giuffre and billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had released the prince from \"any and all liability\".\nMs Giuffre, now 38, was an accuser of Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, and claims she was sexually assaulted by the prince at three locations, including New York City.\nMs Giuffre - then known as Virginia Roberts - says she was assaulted at the London home of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Little Saint James, in the US Virgin Islands.\nHer case claims Prince Andrew, 61, engaged in sexual acts without Ms Giuffre's consent, including when she was 17, knowing how old she was, and \"that she was a sex-trafficking victim\".\nThe Queen's second son has consistently denied the claims and, in 2019, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme: \"It didn't happen.\n\"I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened. \n\"I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\""

Sales for the group rose by 6%, aided by strong demand for homeware, fashion, nursery furnishing and Waitrose online grocery sales.\nJohn Lewis has 34 department stores and 331 Waitrose supermarket stores alongside its online operation.\n\"We're acting hard and we're acting fast to make sure we can still deliver a fantastic sparkly Christmas to our customers,\" Ms  White told the BBC. \nShe added that the department store chain had introduced a host of measures to help manage labour shortages: \"We've raised wages for heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers and we're really beginning to see the results of that.\"\nThere is now a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000, a Road Haulage Association survey of its members estimates.\nThis has led to a chronic lack of materials for the construction sector, such as cement and timber, as well as problems for the manufacturing sector.\nChristmas is when many retailers make most of their profits, including John Lewis. \nAnd it's throwing everything at it to make sure its stock arrives on time. The pandemic has wreaked havoc for the flow of goods around the world.  \nThere's still a shortage of containers and it's also tough getting a space on the vast ships that carry them from China. \nFreight costs have also rocketed. And if your stock does turn up as planned, you've got to make sure you have drivers to get the goods to distribution centres and on to stores. \nAdd in the uncertainty over Covid and no wonder retailers are even more nervous than usual about the all important festive season. \nMs White said the John Lewis Christmas campaign in stores would be delayed by two weeks.\nJohn Lewis said it was focusing on expanding its products and offerings for the holiday season, including 10 new Christmas emporiums in John Lewis and expanding areas related to the department store within Waitrose supermarkets. \nHowever, Ms White sought to temper expectations: \"We're not through Covid and there's more uncertainty than we would like.\"\nShe said there were still containers stuck in various parts of the world.\n\"We're acting at every single part in the supply chain to ensure that Christmas is saved this year,\" she said.\n\"Our customers hopefully won't see anything,\" she added. \"We're on track. But so far, we don't see any significant problems.\"\nOn Wednesday, the retailer announced plans to recruit more than 7,000 temporary workers for the winter. \nThe partnership is hiring people for its supermarkets, department stores and warehouses, including delivery drivers for its online grocery division.\nIt is also looking to fill 550 permanent, full-time, driver and warehouse jobs.\nNew joiners will be offered free food and drink to \"help ensure we can attract the help we need\", it said."

A classmate had used scissors to cut Jurnee's long curly hair on a school bus, he said.\nTwo days later, Jurnee returned home from school with the hair on the other side of her head cut - even though she had been taken to a hairdresser who had given her an asymmetrical cut to make the different lengths less obvious.\nMr Hoffmeyer said he thought another child had done it but Jurnee told him it was a teacher. \"The teacher cut her hair to even it out,\" he told the AP. \nThe lawsuit was filed in a federal court in west Michigan against Mount Pleasant Public Schools and two teaching staff, MLive.com reports.\nAs well as violating the child's constitutional rights, the lawsuit also alleges racial discrimination, ethnic intimidation, intentional infliction of emotional distress and assault and battery.\nThe district \"failed to properly train, monitor, direct, discipline, and supervise their employees and knew or should have known that the employees would engage in the complained of behavior given the improper training, customs, procedures, and policies, and the lack of discipline that existed for employees,\" the lawsuit says.\nNo formal response has yet been filed by the defendants and there has been no public comment from the school district.

      "tags": "Long Covid,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "One in 40 people with coronavirus has symptoms lasting at least three months, Office for National Statistics figures suggest.\nIn April, an ONS report put the proportion at about one in every 10.\nThe latest, large and comprehensive analysis suggests long Covid may be less common than previously thought. \nBut the condition is not fully understood and still has no universally agreed definition, leading to different studies producing different figures.\nThe latest ONS analysis asked two groups of people - those who had tested positive for coronavirus and those who had not - whether they had:\nWhat are the symptoms of long Covid?\nAbout 3% of people in the study who had tested positive had at least one of the symptoms for at least three months after infection.  \nAmong those who had not tested positive, that proportion was 0.5%, meaning one in every 40 infected people had their coronavirus symptoms last for three months or longer.\nAnd like many other reports, the analysis suggests women, 50- to 69-year-olds and people with other long-term health conditions are the most likely to have some of these symptoms 12 weeks after a Covid infection.\nPeople with high levels of virus in their body when testing positive are also more likely to have long Covid, the analysis suggests.\nThe ONS study is big, detailed and very carefully put together.\nThey looked at data from more than 50,000 people, half of whom had tested positive for coronavirus. \nAnd they were testing people at random, so we can be pretty certain that we're comparing a group of people who had Covid with another group who didn't. That's not true for all analyses.\nThey asked people about specific symptoms, as well as asking people to self-diagnose in another analysis.\nThey say their estimates are closer to the truth than the higher estimates they gave in April, because they have long-term follow-up on a lot of people and they've improved their statistical analysis. \nNo analysis of long Covid is perfect, and this analysis does omit some classic long Covid symptoms.\nBut this is a big addition to research on the condition and one that suggests that this illness is, thankfully, less common than we may have feared.\nONS statisticians point out studies from other organisations have their own definitions of long Covid with more symptoms, focus on different people (for example some include people with suspected Covid infections alongside those confirmed by a test) and a different way of collecting data. \nTheir own list of symptoms didn't include \"brain fog\", something commonly reported by people with long Covid. \nSo they also asked people whether they had long Covid - rather than about the 12 symptoms on the list. \nThis analysis shows around one in nine people infected with the virus said they had experienced the condition. \nKevin McConway, emeritus professor of statistics at the Open University, said the report shows that what counts as long Covid is far from clear. \nHe added: \"It does not concern me that, at this stage in the pandemic, numerical estimates about something as new and complicated as long Covid differ quite a lot - what is important is that those involved should discuss openly what needs to be done to clarify the position.\n\"But the need to do that should not hold up the establishment and improvement of services to help people with these conditions, however they are defined and counted.\""

      "tags": "Conservative Party,UK government,Boris Johnson,Elizabeth Truss",
      "text": "Boris Johnson is putting the finishing touches to his reshuffle after making significant changes to his top team. \nOn Wednesday, the PM fired both Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, before replacing Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab with Liz Truss. \nHe has now moved on to confirming which junior ministers are in or out of jobs.\nBut one ousted minister, John Whittingdale, told BBC's Newscast that the new team could lack experience.\nIn some of the latest manoeuvres, Conor Burns, who resigned as a trade minister in 2020 after a report found he used \"veiled threats\" to aid his father in a financial dispute, returned to the front bench as a Northern Ireland minister. \nOthers moved to more high-profile ministerial roles on Thursday included Alex Chalk, who was appointed Solicitor General, and Skills Minister Gillian Keegan, who now joins the Department for Health and Social Care.\nBut Justin Tomlinson lost his job as minister for disabled people in the same department, while Matt Warman was sacked as minister of digital infrastructure. \nFormer Brexit and Northern Ireland Minister, Robin Walker, has gone to the Department for Education, where he will work with the new Secretary of State, Nadhim Zahawi.\nAnd Helen Whately, who was the minister for social care, has been moved to the Treasury, but Jesse Norman joined the list of sackings.  \nEarlier on Thursday, Penny Mordaunt left her post as paymaster general at the Cabinet Office to become a minister at the trade department.\nMr Whittingdale - who lost his job as data minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport - said his post had been one he \"loved\" and was \"sad to give up\". \nHe also revealed some of the PM's appointments \"came out of the blue\".\nThe former minister told Newscast: \"I understand that every prime minister has to make room to allow people to be brought forward. I quite recognise the prime minister is keen to have a front-facing cabinet that reflects modern Britain. \n\"Equally it's no bad thing to have a bit of experience around that table and people who have got a good grasp of the detail of the jobs they are being asked to do.\"\nThere were big winners from the reshuffle too, included Nadine Dorries, who was promoted from being a junior health minister into her first cabinet-level job as culture secretary.\nThe Mid Bedfordshire MP is probably best known outside Westminster for her 2012 appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.\nMs Truss, who is the Tory party's first female foreign secretary - and only the second woman to hold the role, following Labour's Margaret Beckett - said she was delighted by the appointment and would use the role to \"promote a positive, outward vision of global Britain\".\nOther changes made on Wednesday included:\nFormer Justice Secretary Mr Buckland's sacking was greeted with some surprise, with a number of Labour MPs tweeting praise for him and senior Conservative Sir Bob Neill - who chairs the Commons Justice Committee - saying he \"deserved better\". \nIn a letter to the prime minister after his dismissal, Mr Buckland called for more investment in the justice system, adding that \"years of underfunding\" had made it harder for it to recover from the effects of the pandemic.\nNew Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Mr Gove will also get the added responsibility of the government's \"levelling up\" agenda - which it claimed would spread wealth and opportunity around the country - while continuing to handle demands for another Scottish independence referendum.\nThe Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Dowden, following his appointment as the Tory party's new co-chairman, had told staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters to start preparing for a general election which could be in 20 months' time.\nAfter the early traumas of Brexit, then the emergency and horror of the pandemic, the moves represent, they hope, a refreshed team that can get things done.\nWhether it's building houses without upsetting the Tory shires, sorting out school exams, pushing through tougher prison sentences, with new faces it's a government that Downing Street hopes will be more able to push reform forward, and make its case.\nNearly two years after the election, it's perhaps the start of Mr Johnson's third act as prime minister.\nRead more from Laura\nMr Johnson continued making changes late into the night on Wednesday as he got the reshuffle of more junior ministers under way, ahead of the further changes on Thursday.\nLong-serving Nick Gibb was sacked from his role at the Department for Education, while Caroline Dinenage lost her job as a culture minister, and Luke Hall was fired as a local government minister.\nAmanda Milling, who was removed as Conservative Party co-chairwoman, has become a Foreign Office minister.\nJulia Lopez has been moved from the Cabinet Office to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, while Greg Hands left the Department of International Trade for a new brief as business minister."

Ministers attended in 2015 and 2017.\nRather than have its own stand at this year's four day event, the government has paid for Aerospace Forum Wales to \"lead Wales' presence\".\nThe forum describes itself as the \"trade association for all companies operating in the aerospace, defence and space sectors in Wales\" and will have its own stand.\nThe Welsh government said a \"small number\" of officials have also been sent to support companies \"with a presence in Wales such as Airbus, Thales, General Dynamics, Jacobs and Qinetiq\".\nThe spokesman added: \"These companies are a major part of Wales aerospace, cyber security and defence sectors which has a collective value of at least \u00a34bn and employs more than 18,000 people in Wales. \n\"Welsh government officials will also be engaging with companies looking to invest in Wales and will be meeting a number of SMEs regarding investment, innovation and job creation opportunities.\"\nJohn Walley, chief executive of Aerospace Wales, said: \"We believe it's important for the UK and Wales from a national security point of view, I don't think it's for us to abrogate responsibility for defending the country.\"\nA UK government spokeswoman said: \"Defence and security exports support 250,000 jobs across the UK and contribute over \u00a31.8 billion to the economy.\n\"We always undertake strict checks before inviting foreign governments to export summits, including DSEI 2021.\"\nSix companies were supported to join the Welsh government at the 2019 event.\nSpeaking at the time, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would review his government's presence at future events, but said officials were present \"to support important Welsh companies that operate, not directly in the arms area, but in other issues, such as cyber security\".\nThe Welsh government has since confirmed that Radnor Range, a weapons and explosives testing range, was one of the companies on its stand.\nIn a Freedom of Information response to the Declassified UK website, the Welsh government said it spent \u00a385,350 on the DSEI 2019 event itself and \u00a39,851.28 on expenses for 12 officials.\nA Welsh Conservative spokesman said: \"This vitally important sector is worth more than \u00a319 billion to the UK economy and Wales gets to reap the benefits from the jobs that the sector provides.\"\n\"It's right the Welsh government are in attendance to support Welsh businesses at the event, and we hope that any future cooperation agreements with Plaid Cymru does not mean leaving Welsh business in the sector high and dry.\"\nPlaid Cymru's spokesperson on international affairs, Heledd Fychan, said: \"Plaid Cymru condemns any action that supports the development and sale of weapons of mass destruction.\n\"The Welsh government should be working to prevent such action, but instead are putting public money towards the continued support of this contemptible event.\""

      "text": "The Scottish government has asked the MoD for military assistance for the country's ambulance service. \nNicola Sturgeon said health services were dealing with the most challenging combination of circumstances in their history due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nOpposition politicians have highlighted a series of serious ambulance delays, including one where a man died after a 40-hour wait. \nThey said this should not be happening in Scotland in 2021.\nMs Sturgeon said her government was looking at a range of plans to deal with the significant challenges facing the health services, with the detail of a request for military assistance being considered.\nShe told the Scottish Parliament: \"I'll be going back to my office to finalise the detail of the request for military assistance so we can submit that as quickly as possible.\"\nThe first minister added: \"Such military assistance is already being provided to ambulance services in England and of course we have had military assistance for other aspects of the pandemic over the past 18 months.\"\nA Scottish government spokesperson later confirmed it was seeking military assistance to address acute services, and a separate request had been made to support mobile testing units. \nThe Ministry of Defence confirmed it had received a request from the Scottish government, which it said related to support for Scottish Ambulance Service mobile testing units.\nA spokeswoman said the MoD was \"working hard to identify where we can most effectively assist other government departments and civil authorities.\"\nInvestigations are ongoing into several cases reported in the media on Thursday, including one where a Glasgow pensioner died after a 40-hour wait for an ambulance.\nThe Herald newspaper reported that the family of 65-year-old Gerard Brown were told that he could have survived had help arrived sooner.\nMr Brown's GP - who is said to have repeatedly warned 999 call handlers that the patient's status was critical - was quoted as describing the crisis engulfing the Scottish Ambulance Service as being like \"third world medicine\".\nThe Scottish Ambulance Service is investigating the circumstances of the case, and said it will be \"in contact with Mr Brown's family directly to apologise for the delay\".\nMr Brown's death has been reported to the procurator fiscal, who said an investigation was \"ongoing\".\nPressed on the case at her weekly question session at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon offered her condolences to Mr Brown's family, and said what had been reported was \"unacceptable\".\nShe said Scotland was \"experiencing probably the most challenging combination of circumstances that our health service has faced since its establishment\" due to the pandemic.\nEvelyn from Kilwinning told BBC Radio Scotland's Mornings with Stephen Jardine that her husband had been rushed to hospital three times in the last last few weeks due to concerns about his kidney function.\nTheir longest wait for an ambulance was 23 hours - and on an occasion where it had been called by their GP.\n\"He's an amputee and I wanted to take him in the car,\" said Evelyn. \"The doctor said no, it had to be an ambulance in case he deteriorated. \n\"Twenty-three hours was the longest wait, the time before was 11 and a half hours and the quickest was six hours. Both of us were very distressed. He's a very unwell man so this is going to be reoccurring - but one of these days our luck is just going to run out.\n\"The ambulance crew were absolutely amazing, but they were run ragged. When I went to the hospital there were nine ambulances outside the hospital waiting to admit people - that's nine crews that are off the road for hours.\"\nBrian from Troon said he was proud of his daughter who is an emergency call handler - but often hears of frustrated people becoming \"abusive\" to staff when they are told their cases are not high priority.\n\"It's reducing them to tears,\" said Brian. \"The staff are coming home looking for someone to talk to about it. \n\"Luckily the ambulance service have got it covered - supervisors listen in to the calls and say that's not acceptable and will cut them off and take the call themselves. They also look at the welfare side of things, they are such a good service. Abuse is totally not acceptable.\n\"It's their professionalism that gets them through this - they have sympathy with their callers, they try to calm them and in some cases they save people's lives until the ambulance arrives, whether it be someone having a stroke or having a baby.\"\nThe head of the Scottish Ambulance Service has previously apologised to patients over increased waiting times, saying staff were working under \"unprecedented pressure\" due to a \"huge increase\" in both Covid and non-Covid cases.\nPauline Howie said the service was \"at full capacity\" and hospitals were too, meaning it takes longer to hand over patients at emergency departments - creating delays in responding to other calls.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the ambulance service was \"in crisis\", and said cases like that of Mr Brown \"shouldn't be happening in Scotland in 2021\".\nHe also called for Health Secretary Humza Yousaf to withdraw comments he made on BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday, when he said people should \"think twice\" about whether they really needed an ambulance before calling for one. \nMs Sturgeon said the ambulance service was already \"operating at its highest level of escalation\" in response to current pressures, and said Mr Yousaf's comments reflected others made by services \"in every part of the UK\".\nLabour leader Anas Sarwar raised the same case, describing it as an \"avoidable human tragedy\".\nHe said Ms Sturgeon should not use the pandemic as an excuse, adding: \"There is a simple truth - nobody should be left to die on the floor while waiting 40 hours for an ambulance.\"\nMs Sturgeon said governments across the world were dealing with similar problems at the moment, and that her administration was \"absolutely focused\" on providing solutions.\nMeanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton called for the military assistance to be deployed swiftly, saying the government had \"done too little, too late\"."

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Queen Elizabeth II",
      "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh's will is to remain secret for at least 90 years to protect the \"dignity and standing\" of the Queen, the High Court has ruled.\nIt has been convention for over a century that, after the death of a senior member of the Royal Family, the courts are asked to seal their wills.\nIt means that, unlike most wills granted probate, it will not be open to public inspection.\nThere will be a private process in 90 years to decide if it can be unsealed. \nThe hearing into the application to seal the will was also held in private in July by Sir Andrew McFarlane, the most senior judge in the family courts.\nHe heard arguments from lawyers representing the duke's estate and the attorney general, the government's chief legal adviser, and published his ruling on Thursday.\nSir Andrew said that as president of the Family Division of the High Court, he is the custodian of a safe containing more than 30 envelopes, each containing the sealed will of a dead member of the Royal Family.\nAnd for the first time in more than 100 years, he set out a process by which those wills could be made public.\nSir Andrew said: \"I have held that, because of the constitutional position of the Sovereign, it is appropriate to have a special practice in relation to royal wills.\n\"There is a need to enhance the protection afforded to truly private aspects of the lives of this limited group of individuals in order to maintain the dignity of the Sovereign and close members of her family.\"\nThe judge said he had not seen Prince Philip's will or been told anything of its contents, other than the date of its execution and the identity of the appointed executor.\nHe said he decided to hold the hearing in private because it would be likely to generate \"very significant publicity and conjecture\" that would \"defeat the purpose of the application\".\n\"I accepted the submission that, whilst there may be public curiosity as to the private arrangements that a member of the Royal Family may choose to make in their will, there is no true public interest in the public knowing this wholly private information,\" he said.\nHe said there was no legal reason for any representations from media organisations because the public interest was represented by the attorney general.\nLawyers for Philip's estate argued that news of the hearing and the application \"might generate wholly unfounded conjecture\" which would be \"deeply intrusive\" for the Queen and the Royal Family.\nDetailing the history of previous decisions, Sir Andrew said the first family member whose will was sealed by the court was Prince Francis of Teck, the younger brother of Queen Mary, who died in 1910.\nAccording to the legal and royal expert Michael L Nash, author of Royal Wills in Britain from 1509 to 2008, the new legal mechanism was devised after Prince Francis left valuable emeralds prized by Queen Mary to his mistress, the Countess of Kilmorey.\nAn envelope containing Prince Francis's will resides in the safe held by Sir Andrew, with the most recent additions being those of the late Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, the Queen's sister, who died in 2002.\nIn 2007, a man claiming to be the illegitimate child of Princess Margaret, Robert Andrew Brown, applied to unseal the wills of the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret but his claim was struck out as \"vexatious and an abuse of process\".\nHowever, Sir Andrew amended previous orders, which had sealed royal wills indefinitely, so that they can be inspected privately 90 years after probate was granted.\nThe \"grant of probate\" is an order that allows someone to distribute a deceased person's assets according to their wishes, and normally marks the point where person's will becomes a public document.\nSir Andrew said after 90 years each royal will would be opened and examined by the monarch's private solicitor, the keeper of the Royal Archives, the attorney general and by any personal representatives of the dead person who may still be available.\nThey will decide whether the will may be made public at that stage, but Sir Andrew said some royal wills may never be published, even in part.\nThe unsealing should be conducted by a professional archivist to ensure the documents and seals are properly preserved. Further details of the process will be decided by the court before it begins to unseal the first of the wills.\nThe Queen's solicitor and the attorney general argued that the wills should be sealed for 125 years, but Sir Andrew said that 90 years was \"proportionate and sufficient\" and would mean the risk of publication intruding on the private lives of royals would be substantially reduced.\nSir Andrew said he intends to publish an annex listing the names on the 30 envelopes in his safe, but added that he will not do so until any potential appeal against his judgement has been able to run its course.\nOne name which will not feature is that of Diana, Princess of Wales. Unlike other members of the Royal Family, her will was published after her death in 1997, revealing that the majority of her fortune was being held in trust for her sons until they reached the age of 25."

      "text": "The main defendant in the November 2015 Paris attacks trial has sought to justify the murder of 130 people as retaliation for French military action against Islamic State (IS) jihadists.\nProsecutors say Salah Abdeslam, 32, is the only surviving member of the IS cell that targeted Paris that night.\n\"We attacked France, targeted its population, civilians, but there was nothing personal,\" he told the trial.\nHis remarks shocked and upset survivors and victims' relatives in court.\nLast week, he disrupted the trial with two outbursts, but this time the judge had given the defendants permission to make a brief statement and reporters said his conduct was more measured.\nLater this month, some of the survivors of the 13 November bomb and gun attacks will start giving evidence, which is expected to take five weeks.\nAlthough there are 20 defendants on trial, Salah Abdeslam is the chief suspect and only 13 others are in court. Most of the others are presumed dead.\nHe singled out former President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, saying that when he had authorised air strikes on IS militants in Syria he knew that French citizens would meet their deaths.\nFrench warplanes had not distinguished between men, women and children, he said, and \"we wanted France to go through the same pain\". While he knew his words might upset \"sensitive souls\", he said his aim was to be sincere and not lie.\nRelatives and survivors in the courtroom cried and hugged as the main defendant spoke for four to five minutes. Rejecting the terms \"terrorists\" and \"radicalism\", he told the court that theirs was an \"authentic Islam\".\nReporters described shock and gasps of breath in the courtroom. Among those who heard him was David, a survivor of the Paris attacks.\n\"I get the impression he's managed to dissociate himself from what he did six years ago - wearing an explosive belt and killing people,\" David told news channel BFMTV.\n\"It's odd because, as victims, we went through this. We were targeted and personally affected, then suddenly he comes out and says openly it wasn't your fault but you were there, so tough luck. The disgrace of it. It just shows a lack of respect to what all the victims went through.\"\nEighteen hundred civil plaintiffs are taking part in the trial.\nThe 10-man squad of heavily armed jihadists first targeted the Stade de France stadium, then attacked cafe-terraces and restaurants in the central 10th and 11th arrondissements before bursting into the packed Bataclan concert hall.\nNine of the attackers either blew themselves up or were shot dead. Salah Abdeslam threw away his bomb belt and fled to Belgium. He was captured months later after a shootout in the Molenbeek area of Brussels.\nMany of the other defendants also have a Belgian connection:"

      "text": "The first Covid booster vaccines have been given to NHS staff in England and Wales as part of plans to extend protection for millions this winter.\nJabs will be offered to the over 50s, health and care workers and younger adults with certain health conditions.\nThose eligible should receive a booster at least six months after their second dose.\nOne dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna is recommended and people will be contacted when it's their turn.\nBut many people with severely weakened immune systems, who have been told they need a third dose to top up their primary protection, are still waiting to be invited.\nNHS England said all those eligible, including people with blood cancer or organ donor recipients, would be contacted soon and stressed that the timing of the third dose was crucial.\nHospital hubs in England and Wales can now start vaccinating frontline healthcare workers with boosters, although most will not be ready to do so until next week. \nSome care homes are starting the rollout on Thursday in England, this weekend in Wales and in Scotland on Monday. Northern Ireland begins its booster programme later this month.\nCatherine Cargill, a maternity support worker and student at Croydon University Hospital, was one of the first to receive a booster jab.\n\"I'm excited, I've been waiting for this,\" she said.\n\"So far I haven't caught Covid and I want to keep it that way. But also with the vaccine, if I was to get Covid, I wouldn't be seriously ill.\"\nDr Chris Blakeley, an A&E consultant, says he's seeing rising numbers of Covid patients and it's likely his immunity is waning after receiving his first vaccine dose back in December.\n\"The booster gives us increasing confidence on a daily basis,\" he said.\nThe government's vaccine advisors said protection from the first two doses of all Covid vaccines showed early signs of dipping, and that the most vulnerable groups were particularly at risk.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said a booster programme, to run alongside a flu vaccine rollout, was a precautionary approach to ensure these groups maintained high levels of protection.\nGroups covered by the programme include: \nCare home residents, who are one of the groups most vulnerable to the virus, will be offered a vaccine before the start of November in England.\nAround 4.5 million people in priority groups will be eligible for a booster over the coming weeks, NHS England says, with a further 25 million to be contacted in due course. Pharmacies, GP practices and local vaccination centres will start offering boosters in the coming days.\nPeople will get a call or text from their local GP-led site to get the jab, or will be invited by the National Booking Service, which will start issuing invitations from early next week. \nSome people who were in the original nine priority groups will not be invited for a booster until the new year.\nMeanwhile, care home providers say they are concerned that a deadline for all care home staff in England to have their first vaccine against Covid by 11 November could force care homes to close if staff decide not to comply.\nOn Monday, the UK's four chief medical officers recommended a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine should be offered to all healthy 12-15 year olds, and the rollout is planned to start in schools next week."

Seven were rescued but five died.\nThe region was then placed on an orange alert for thunderstorms, rains and floods.\n\"I cannot understand how people got into the water when the seas were rough,\" Jordan Dartier, the mayor of Vias, told French broadcaster LCI. One man drowned there after reportedly falling from rocks. \n\"It's a dramatic day for our region,\" he added.\nH\u00e9rault's fire and rescue service had urged people to avoid swimming. \n\"Choppy seas are making water activities dangerous,\" the service tweeted in the afternoon, with a video of waves crashing into the shoreline.\nThe two swimmers who died in Cassis and La Ciotat in the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne area drowned after being dragged out to sea, local media report. \nRescue officials speculated that the warm temperature of the water had tempted people to swim, even though conditions were not ideal.\nGr\u00e9gory Coutarel, head of search and rescue in Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, said: \"On weekdays, enjoying the sea at 24C is quite exceptional, and can tempt tourists.\"\nHe added that, as the weather now stays warm for longer, lifeguards should be kept in place \"until the end of September or even until mid-October\".\nPeople do not fully understand how dangerous choppy seas can be, local fire chief Aur\u00e9lien Manenc told broadcaster TF1.\n\"The water is warm, you think you are going to have fun - and quickly you are pulled towards the open sea and towards the bottom, and you get exhausted trying to come back.

      "tags": "Dominic Raab,Boris Johnson,Brexit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Dominic Raab has become deputy prime minister, justice secretary and Lord Chancellor, leaving behind his job as foreign secretary. \nOver the summer, Mr Raab was at the centre of speculation about his future, when he was heavily criticised for his handling of the aftermath of the fall of Afghanistan.\nThe then-foreign secretary was criticised for remaining on holiday in Crete while the Taliban marched back to power. \nHe insisted he'd been across the detail throughout and in touch with the key players.\nHe rejected opposition calls for him to quit after it emerged that neither he, nor any other minister, had called the Afghan government to discuss the evacuation of translators stranded in the country.\nThe Conservative MP, who was a leading member of the campaign to get the UK out of the EU, is no stranger to controversy, having hit the headlines for his statements on topics as diverse as poverty and \"taking the knee\".\nHe even quit the cabinet once, over former Prime Minister Theresa May's policies on Brexit.\nDate of birth: 25 February 1974 (age 47)\nJob: Justice secretary, deputy prime minister, lord chancellor, Conservative MP for Esher and Walton\nEducation: Dr Challoner's Grammar School, Amersham, Oxford and Cambridge universities\nFamily: Married to Erika Ray, a Brazilian marketing executive. Two sons\nBefore politics: Foreign Office lawyer. He was the lead on a team focusing on bringing war criminals to justice at The Hague\nMr Raab was born in 1974, the son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938.\nHe was was brought up in Buckinghamshire and attended Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham, before studying law at Oxford University and switching to Cambridge for his masters degree.\nHe worked as a lawyer in the commercial sector and the Foreign Office before entering politics in 2006 as an aide to Brexit-supporting Conservative MP David Davis, and then Remain-backing Dominic Grieve.\nFirst elected to Parliament in 2010, the following year Mr Raab angered then-Home Secretary Theresa May by describing some feminists as \"obnoxious bigots\" in an online article also claiming men were getting \"a raw deal\".\nMrs May accused him of fuelling \"gender warfare\".\nMr Raab remained on the back benches for five years after becoming an MP.\nBut the karate black-belt became a junior justice minister following David Cameron's general election victory in 2015.\nHe played a prominent role in the successful Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, but was sacked by Mrs May when she took over as prime minister.\nIn 2017, Mr Raab was branded \"offensive\" by then-Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after saying \"the typical user of a food bank is not someone that's languishing in poverty; it's someone who has a cash flow problem\".\nBut in June that year he returned to government, as a justice minister, this time middle-ranking rather than junior.\nIn Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle he became housing minister - one of the highest-profile non-cabinet roles in government.\nAnd in July that year, when David Davis quit, the prime minister promoted Mr Raab to Brexit secretary, a cabinet post.\nYet his improved relationship with Mrs May did not last long. In November 2018, he quit, arguing that he could not \"in good conscience\" support the \"backstop\" arrangement designed to avoid a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.\nAs an influential Brexiteer, his comments were seen as significant in increasing opposition to Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU, which MPs repeatedly rejected.\nAfter Mrs May announced she was standing down, Mr Raab entered the contest to become Conservative leader, and prime minister.\nIn a crowded field, he failed to get the 33 MPs' votes he needed to progress to the third round. Fellow Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove outlasted him.\nMr Johnson, to whom Mr Raab gave his support after his elimination from the the race, promoted him to foreign secretary and first secretary of state - effectively deputy prime minister.\nBut he only narrowly managed to hold on to his Esher and Walton seat at the 2019 general election, seeing off a strong Liberal Democrat challenge by 2,743 votes.\nThe overall Conservative landslide, however, on a promise to \"get Brexit done\", meant he saw his dream of leaving the EU come true on 31 January 2020.\nAs foreign secretary and first secretary of state, he was the UK government's de-facto second-in-command.\nHe was left in charge of running much of the government when the prime minister was hospitalised with Covid-19 in April last year.\nColleagues, including Mr Johnson's arch-critic and former aide Dominic Cummings, have praised Mr Raab's performance under extreme pressure.\nBut he has continued to anger opponents with some of his comments, in 2020 telling talkRadio's Julia Hartley-Brewer he would only \"take the knee\" - go down on bended knee - for \"the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me\".\nHe later qualified his remarks - following opposition criticism of his \"insulting\" and \"flippant\" tone - saying he \"fully\" supports Black Lives Matter campaign."

      "tags": "Microsoft,Cyber-security",
      "text": "Microsoft has announced users can now delete all passwords from their accounts and instead login using an authenticator app or other solution.\nThe technology giant made passwordless accounts available for business users of its products in March. \nAnd that system is now being made available to all Microsoft or Windows users. \nIt said \"nearly 100% of our employees\" were already using the new, more secure system for their corporate accounts.\nIf passwordless login is enabled, users re-logging in to a Microsoft account will be asked to give their fingerprint, or other secure unlock, on their mobile phone.\nAnd this is far more secure than using passwords, which can be guessed or stolen, according to Microsoft.\n\"Only you can provide fingerprint authentication or provide the right response on your mobile at the right time,\" it said. \nWindows users will still be able to use quick-login features such as a Pin code, though.\nSome rare exceptions will still need passwords, such as Office 2010, Xbox 360 consoles, and Windows 8.1 or earlier machines. \nAnd if access to the authenticator app is lost - for example, if the phone it is installed on is lost or stolen or a user forgets when upgrading - backup options can be used, including: \nBut SMS and email are two of the most common channels for cyber-criminals targeting specific individuals\nAnd Microsoft says security-conscious users who have two-factor authentication set up will need to have access to two different recovery methods. \nProf Alan Woodward, part of a research team investigating passwordless authentication, at the University of Surrey, called it \"quite a bold step from Microsoft\". \n\"This isn't just logging into PCs, it's logging into online services as well\" - including important ones such as cloud storage, he said.\nMicrosoft laid out its reasons for the new system in a series of blog posts. \nSecurity vice-president Vasu Jakkal wrote: \"Passwords are incredibly inconvenient to create, remember, and manage across all the accounts in our lives.\n\"We are expected to create complex and unique passwords, remember them, and change them frequently - but nobody likes doing that.\"\nInstead, people tended to create insecure passwords that technically cleared the bar for using symbols, numbers or case sensitivity - but in order to remember them, used a repeated formula or the same password on multiple websites. \nAnd that led to hackers guessing them or revealing them in a data breach and reusing them. \n\"Hackers don't break in, they log in,\" the blog post read. \nThe new passwordless feature greets users with a box saying: \"A passwordless account reduces the risk of phishing and password attacks.\" \nAnd once the feature is set up, a confirmation tells users: \"You have increased the security of your account and improved your sign-in experience by removing your password\". \nMicrosoft's claims about poor password use were largely true, Prof Woodward said.\n\"The message has been pummelled home about what good password hygiene looks like - but it's easier said than done,\" he said. \nPasswords were a decades-old concept \"and maybe the time is now right to start looking for something different\". \nBut there were no currently agreed standards.  \n\"There are a number of different ways this could be done - and it would be good if everybody moved on, really, and tried to find a way of doing this,\" Prof Woodward said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,TRNSMT,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There has been no evidence that recent major events including the TRNSMT festival have sparked a spike in Covid cases, the national clinical director has said.\nAbout 50,000 music fans descended on Glasgow Green for each of the three days of TRNSMT last weekend.\nEveryone attending had to provide proof of a negative lateral flow test.\nHealth boards had expressed concern in the run-up to the event about the impact on the NHS.\nBut Prof Jason Leitch has said early data suggested worries it would become a \"superspreader\" event were so far unfounded.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, he said he believed recent high infection rates may have peaked.\nHe said: \"I am more hopeful that this number is going to stabilise and fall. We've got no sign of TRNSMT causing us big levels of infection and I would have expected that to start to come through by now. But it is early days.\"\nProf Leitch added: \"Further education has been back for a few weeks now and again, no big spike from them.\"\nScotland registered 4,917 new cases on Wednesday. \nA pandemic-high daily figure of 7,113 new infections was recorded on 29 August but this week numbers appeared to be falling, with daily case numbers remaining below 6,000.\nProf Leitch said he had been helping to prepare advice for Scottish government ministers on the introduction of vaccine passports.\nHe said it was \"up to politicians what they did with the information\" but that \"vaccinated crowds are safer than unvaccinated crowds\".\nScotland has recently seen the biggest surge in confirmed cases since the pandemic began.\nDaily cases began rising at the beginning of August and reached an all-time high on 29 August, when 7,113 infections were recorded. However, average daily cases have now been falling for several days.\nGiven that the TRANSMT festival was only a few days ago, it's perhaps too early to say for sure that it isn't contributing significantly to infection levels.\nBut any jump in cases caused by the event could be difficult to detect using the daily confirmed cases data.\nInfections may be declining, but there's still a lot of noise with more than 5,000 cases being recorded a day on average.\nA local increase in cases in the Glasgow area will also not necessarily be an indication infections were spreading at the festival.\nCases are assigned to a region from the address of the infected person, not where they were infected, and music fans will have travelled from all over Scotland to go to TRANSMT.\nReacting to claims from SPFL chief Neil Doncaster that it would be very difficult to check that all football fans attending games have a vaccine passport, Prof Leitch said the case for spot checks was a valid one.\nHe also highlighted the use of staggered arrival times, already a feature at some football and rugby fixtures.\nProf Leitch said: \"60,000 people at Hampden all arriving at once does create some logistical difficulties, so we have had conversations with those sectors pretty much every day and we are working on what the final recommendations will be for ministers to decide.\n\"Spot checks is not a ridiculous idea but we just need to get the balance right between checking 60,000 and checking six, so somewhere in there is a sweet spot.\n\"We don't want to make football or rugby a chore, so there are a variety of options available. Staggered entry is one of them. Spot checks is another.\"\nThe national clinical director said he still hoped that a requirement to show vaccine status to attend certain events would encourage young people to take up the offer of a jab.\nHe said other countries around the world which had introduced similar schemes had seen it incentivise vaccination, particularly in younger people.\n\"The reality is when you look at vaccination numbers they go up,\" he said. \"I can't tell you if that's going to happen here. But I am hopeful.\"\nProf Leitch said that, whatever the Scottish government decided to implement, the public was likely to face continued restrictions.\n\"Let's remember the fundamental principle of this,\" he said. \"We have got more than 4,000 cases a day, 30 deaths yesterday. \n\"Inconvenience is something we've had for the past 18 months, and inconvenience is going to continue until we can get on top of this wave.\""

      "tags": "France,Retailing,Brexit,Marks & Spencer",
      "text": "Marks & Spencer has said it is closing 11 of its French stores because of problems supplying them with fresh and chilled foods since Brexit.\nThe UK retail giant said all 11 franchise stores it operated with partner SFH in France would shut by the end of this year.\nM&S said supply chain problems since Brexit had made it \"near impossible\" to maintain standards of food supply.\nNine M&S stores run at French travel hubs will continue to operate.\n\"M&S has a long history of serving customers in France and this is not a decision we or our partner SFH have taken lightly,\" said Paul Friston, M&S managing director of international.\n\"However, as things stand today, the supply chain complexities in place following the UK's exit from the European Union now make it near impossible for us to serve fresh and chilled products to customers to the high standards they expect, resulting in an ongoing impact to the performance of our business.\n\"With no workable alternative for the High Street stores, we have agreed with SFH to close all 11 franchised stores.\"\nIts French online operation, which sells mainly clothing and home products, will not be affected by the closures.\nOne of the main problems Marks & Spencer was facing in France was post-Brexit bureaucracy, a spokesman said.\nIts partner, SFH, mainly operated shops on Paris High Streets, selling fresh food products such as sandwiches, he said.\nDue to hold-ups caused by red tape at the UK/French border, it was impractical to get the products to the shops.\nThe retailer's other French partner, Lagardere Travel Retail, runs M&S stores in French airports, railway and Metro stations.\nThose stores are unaffected by this decision, in part because of their location.\nMarks & Spencer opened its first French stores in 1975, with branches in Paris and Lyon.\nAfter leaving France and the rest of mainland Europe in 2001 to focus on its UK business, it then reopened in Paris in 2011.\nM&S said its discussions with Lagardere on a sustainable future business model continued to make good progress. \n\"Today's announcement is the latest change to the structure of our European businesses following the UK's exit from the European Union,\" the retailer said. \n\"In April earlier this year, we announced the reconfiguration of our food business in Czech Republic, removing the sale of all fresh and chilled products from stores, and instead doubling our ranges of frozen and ambient products. \n\"This removed the ongoing supply chain risks to our business and the knock-on impact on limiting availability for customers in our stores.\"\nThe export of fresh processed food from the UK to the EU is a classic example of precisely the sort of trade, built up under the single market, that was bound to be challenged by the new post-Brexit arrangements. \nSpecialist exporters say hundreds of pages of documents including health certificates are now required.\nAlthough catastrophic port delays were avoided in the immediate aftermath of Brexit earlier this year, the trade data and surveys of small businesses reveal a hit to exports to the EU.\nGiants such as M&S were able to muddle through, but no longer.\nSome exporters have also complained that imports coming the other way from the EU will be waved through now until July at least.\nThere had been some hope that imposing UK import controls would provide an incentive for France, the Netherlands and Germany to ease controls on their side.\nThat discussion is not now happening. Nor is there any move towards a veterinary agreement, of the sort the EU already enjoys with Switzerland or New Zealand, that might have eased some of the new export red tape burden.\nInstead, there is a private acceptance that after this Brexit deal, fewer sandwiches will be exported to France, and that is the price for the regulatory and trade freedom to export more elsewhere.\nSteve Dresser, managing director of Grocery Insight, said that while all retailers' sales had been affected by Covid, Marks & Spencer in France was \"another casualty of Brexit\".\n\"Once you add inefficiency in to any supply chain, be it trade barriers or bureaucracy, plus the need for extra manpower, there is cost that needs to be absorbed somewhere along the line. \n\"It's likely for the minimal returns, the numbers simply no longer made sense to M&S,\" Mr Dresser said.\n\"It's clear that a huge amount of management resource has been taken up getting stock in the right place for European stores,\" he added.\nThis include the Republic of Ireland, where Marks & Spencer has had stock shortages, \"due to the way that product is accounted for coming via Northern Ireland\". Products entering either Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland from Britain are subject to EU border processes.\nRetailers have been dealing with stock shortages and stock being held up at borders post-Brexit, as well as a chronic shortage of drivers, which hauliers have said is in part due to Brexit.\nBusinesses are faced with costs, either through having to pay for warehouses in EU countries and having cash tied up in stock, through wastage if products with a short shelf life are held up at borders, or through gaps on shelves due to supply chain problems.\n\"The outlook remains bleak on this front, with the deal signed by UK government tying this country to checks and delays at the borders,\" Mr Dresser said, adding that this was \"baffling\" as \"we have voted to take back control\"."

      "tags": "Microsoft,Cyber-security",
      "text": "Microsoft has announced users can now delete all passwords from their accounts and instead login using an authenticator app or other solution.\nThe technology giant made passwordless accounts available for business users of its products in March. \nAnd that system is now being made available to all Microsoft or Windows users. \nIt said \"nearly 100% of our employees\" were already using the new, more secure system for their corporate accounts.\nIf passwordless login is enabled, users re-logging in to a Microsoft account will be asked to give their fingerprint, or other secure unlock, on their mobile phone.\nAnd this is far more secure than using passwords, which can be guessed or stolen, according to Microsoft.\n\"Only you can provide fingerprint authentication or provide the right response on your mobile at the right time,\" it said. \nWindows users will still be able to use quick-login features such as a Pin code, though.\nSome rare exceptions will still need passwords, such as Office 2010, Xbox 360 consoles, and Windows 8.1 or earlier machines. \nAnd if access to the authenticator app is lost - for example, if the phone it is installed on is lost or stolen or a user forgets when upgrading - backup options can be used, including: \nBut SMS and email are two of the most common channels for cyber-criminals targeting specific individuals\nAnd Microsoft says security-conscious users who have two-factor authentication set up will need to have access to two different recovery methods. \nProf Alan Woodward, part of a research team investigating passwordless authentication, at the University of Surrey, called it \"quite a bold step from Microsoft\". \n\"This isn't just logging into PCs, it's logging into online services as well\" - including important ones such as cloud storage, he said.\nMicrosoft laid out its reasons for the new system in a series of blog posts. \nSecurity vice-president Vasu Jakkal wrote: \"Passwords are incredibly inconvenient to create, remember, and manage across all the accounts in our lives.\n\"We are expected to create complex and unique passwords, remember them, and change them frequently - but nobody likes doing that.\"\nInstead, people tended to create insecure passwords that technically cleared the bar for using symbols, numbers or case sensitivity - but in order to remember them, used a repeated formula or the same password on multiple websites. \nAnd that led to hackers guessing them or revealing them in a data breach and reusing them. \n\"Hackers don't break in, they log in,\" the blog post read. \nThe new passwordless feature greets users with a box saying: \"A passwordless account reduces the risk of phishing and password attacks.\" \nAnd once the feature is set up, a confirmation tells users: \"You have increased the security of your account and improved your sign-in experience by removing your password\". \nMicrosoft's claims about poor password use were largely true, Prof Woodward said.\n\"The message has been pummelled home about what good password hygiene looks like - but it's easier said than done,\" he said. \nPasswords were a decades-old concept \"and maybe the time is now right to start looking for something different\". \nBut there were no currently agreed standards.  \n\"There are a number of different ways this could be done - and it would be good if everybody moved on, really, and tried to find a way of doing this,\" Prof Woodward said."

      "tags": "Art,Drawing",
      "text": "A previously unseen Vincent van Gogh drawing of an exhausted old man has been discovered, a museum dedicated to the artist has confirmed.\nStudy for Worn Out was drawn early in the artist's career in 1882, the Van Gogh Museum said on Thursday.\nThe sketch has been been sitting in a Dutch family's private collection for more than a century.\nBut on Thursday, it went on display at the Amsterdam museum for the first time.\nThe public will be able to see it until 2 January, before it is returned to the private collection.\nThe small pencil drawing, signed \"Vincent\", depicts an elderly labourer dressed in a waistcoat, trousers and boots, sitting on a wooden chair with his head in his hands.\n\"This one has never been seen before anywhere. It's the first time that this drawing is out in the open,\" said Teio Meedendorp, senior researcher at the Van Gogh Museum.\nHe told the BBC it was \"absolutely impossible\" to say how much it was worth.\nVan Gogh appeared to have used  the drawing as the basis for a slightly different version of the drawing shortly afterwards, which he preferred, and which is currently in the museum's collection under the title Worn Out.\nThe artist made Study for Worn Out when he was living in the Hague and still learning to draw at around the age of 29. Experts say it offers an exceptional insight into Van Gogh's working process at the time.\nThe museum's director, Emilie Gordenker, said the team were \"delighted with this discovery\".\n\"We are very happy to have made a contribution to our specialist field,\" she added. \"It's quite rare for a new work to be attributed to Van Gogh. We're proud to be able to share this early drawing and its story with our visitors.\"\nThe owner of the work, who wants to remain anonymous, asked the museum to determine whether the drawing could be attributed to Van Gogh.\nIn a statement, Meedendorp said: \"In stylistic terms, it fits perfectly with the many figure studies we know from Van Gogh's time in The Hague and the connection with Worn Out is obvious. \n\"The artist began by drawing a grid on the paper, which tells us that he worked with a perspective frame to help him capture a figure quickly with the correct proportions. He then worked the sheet up in his characteristically expressive drawing style: not refined, but with energetic scratches and strokes and laying down contours, in search of a pithy image with special attention to effects of light and shade.\n\"In terms of the materials, you also find everything you'd expect in a Van Gogh drawing from this period: a thick carpenter's pencil as medium, coarse watercolour paper as support, and fixing with a solution of water and milk. \n\"There are traces of damage in the corners on the back of the drawing, which we can link to the way Van Gogh customarily attached sheets of paper to his drawing board using wads of starch.'\"\nThe announcement comes six months after a Van Gogh painting of a Paris street went on display for the first time after spending more than 100 years behind closed doors.\nA Street Scene In Montmartre has been owned by a French family for most of the time since it was painted in 1887.\nThe painting went on to fetch 13.09 million euros (\u00a311.2m) at auction in March."
