      "text": "Environment Secretary George Eustice has defended a controversial decision to put down an alpaca that has tested positive for bovine tuberculosis twice.\nGeronimo was condemned to death by a High Court judge last month.\nBut his owner disputes the test results - and more than 90,000 people have signed a petition to save him.\nWriting in the Mail on Sunday, Mr Eustice - a former farmer - said he knew it was \"soul-destroying\" having to put animals down, but it was necessary.\nHe said bovine TB was an \"insidious disease\" that the UK has been wrestling with over the past decade.\n\"There has been a great deal of focus on the case of Geronimo the alpaca last week,\" he said. \"However, each week, on average, we have to remove more than 500 cattle from herds due to infection in England alone. \n\"Behind every one of those cases is a farmer who has suffered loss and tragedy.\n\"Farmers understand that infected animals are a risk to the remainder of their herd, so while the loss of individual animals is always a tragedy, the farming communities have worked with our government vets in this arduous but necessary endeavour.\"\nMr Eustice gave an example from his family who own a herd of South Devon cattle, and recalled how one of his father's cows, Rose, had to be put down. \"It was soul-destroying,\" he said.\nGeronimo's owner, veterinary nurse Helen Macdonald who breeds alpacas at her farm in Wickwar, south Gloucestershire, claims the tests used were inaccurate. She pointed out that Geronimo had tested negative on four occasions in New Zealand.\nBut Mr Eustice said the tests used were more than 99% accurate when detecting positive tests - and that the tests in New Zealand were \"far less reliable\".\nEarlier this week, Ms Macdonald described her four-year legal battle with Defra as an \"abject hell\".\n\"I don't want Geronimo's last moments to be of being caught by a man who will put a gun to his head before he's shot,\" she said.\nA second warrant to execute the alpaca came into effect on Thursday. \nDefra has 30 days to visit Ms Macdonald's farm and put him down, which means a contractor could legally force entry to her property and shoot Geronimo, she said.\nSource: UK Government and  TB Hub\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Dennis Thomas, one of the founder members of 1970s and 80s soul-funk band Kool & the Gang, has died aged 70.\nHe died \"peacefully in his sleep\" in New Jersey on Saturday, the band said in a Facebook statement.\nDescribed as the \"cool cat\" in the group, he was its sax player, flutist, percussionist as well as master of ceremonies at shows. \nThe band became one of the era's most popular and influential with hits such as Celebration and Get Down On It.\nTheir music also featured in several films including Saturday Night Fever, for which they received a Grammy in 1978, and Pulp Fiction.\nThomas was one of the original founders of the group, which started in 1964 along with Robert \"Kool\" Bell, his brother Ronald - who died last year - and four other schoolfriends: Robert Mickens, Charles Smith, George Brown and Ricky Westfield. \nTheir career was split into two distinct halves. In the early 70s, they scored US hits with the foot-stomping funk of songs like Jungle Boogie and Hollywood Swinging. \nThen, with the addition of vocalist  James \"JT\" Taylor in 1979, they morphed into a hit-making R&B band, scoring the biggest commercial success of their career as they reached their 20th anniversary.\nThey thrived in the 1980s, scoring huge hits with sentimental ballads like Joanna and Cherish, as well as the party anthems Steppin' Out, Get Down On It, which is now their most-streamed song on Spotify, and Celebration.\nThe group received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2015 for their contribution to the world of entertainment, and were inducted into the Songwriters' Hall Of Fame in 2018."

      "text": "Towns and cities in Wales are getting busy, with a \"big party\" predicted after the end of most Covid regulations.\nWales has moved to Covid alert level zero, meaning social distancing rules and most other restrictions have ended.\nNick Newman of the Cardiff Licensees Forum said bars started filling up from 11:00 BST. \nMasks are still needed in shops, and First Minister Mark Drakeford has urged people to be sensible.\nThe UK government said on Saturday a further 103 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, with 28,612 cases confirmed.\nCase rates in Wales are the lowest of the four nations, but chief medical officer Frank Atherton has said the country remains in a \"third wave of coronavirus infection\".\nMr Newman said customers had been \"fantastic\" and \"voted with their feet\" throughout the pandemic when restrictions allowed. \n\"A lot of people were pinning their hopes on midnight last night [for the end of restrictions] but that got cancelled,\" said Mr Newman, who is part of the Croeso Pubs chain.\n\"So what you will see tonight is an even bigger party in Cardiff central, which is what we are famous for.\"\n\"At 11am, we saw the bars start to fill up, with it the first day of the football season and then the Lions after.\"\nHowever, he said some measures remained in place.\nAt one of his pubs, The Philharmonic, thermal imagining cameras will determine who is allowed in, and there will be hand sanitisers. \nThe first minister said on Friday he was confident Wales was on the \"final lap\" of emerging from the pandemic, providing there were no \"further unexpected turns in the course of the virus\".\nHowever, he warned against a \"free-for-all\" after most restrictions ended.\nIn England, most rules were relaxed on 19 July, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson postponed so-called \"Freedom Day\" by a month when cases of the Delta variant surged.\nThe 103 additional coronavirus deaths reported in the UK on Saturday brings the total to 130,281 since the start of the pandemic.\nAcross the UK, 86,207,851 Covid jabs were administered on Friday, with 46,997,495 first doses and 39,210,356 second doses.\nBosses at Galeri theatre and cinema in Caernarfon said a questionnaire among customers showed some wanted to keep social distancing in place.\n\"We feel we need time to talk with staff and our customers and make sure that everyone feels safe moving forwards,\" said team leader Naomi Saunders.\n\"For the time being we are keeping with social distancing due to the fact that the announcement has come so last minute.\"\nThe Three Horseshoes pub in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf, will see live acts, pool and darts return on Saturday for the first time since before the pandemic. \nLandlord Martin Barron said: \"I think people will look forward to it, you can watch an act, grab a beer and it gives people a reason to come out.\"\nHe said it would be operating at about 80% capacity because \"we are trying to get to normal but the risk is still there\".\nThe Welsh Beer and Pub Association has welcomed the end of restrictions and said it meant more than 150 pubs in Wales which had yet to reopen could now do so on Saturday. \nEmma McClarkin, chief executive, said: \"This is the good news our brewers and pubs in Wales have been waiting for.\n\"A pint on Saturday is going to taste all the sweeter.\"\nStaff at a cafe in Newport have also welcomed the relaxation of mask rules, calling it a \"huge relief\". \nLaura Leach, who owns the Restpoint Cafe, said: \"A lot of our customers come in for the social aspect, so trying to have a conversation while wearing a mask makes it impossible.\"\nShe also said it would ease pressures on her and staff to \"challenge non-mask wearers\", after \"hardly anyone was complying\" with the rules after the first lockdown.\nMs Leach said staff would be thrilled to remove their masks while in the kitchen but would still wear masks when serving and continue social distancing. \nPhilip Bottrill, of The Pen & Paper Stationery Co in Cardiff, said everyone needed to move \"steadily\" and \"gently\" toward normality. \n\"It isn't going to happen overnight,\" he said. \n\"But we do need to build our trade up because, since we've reopened, we are only taking about 60% of what we took in 2019.\"\nWhile some are excited to see restrictions eased, for others it is a more daunting prospect. \nSasha Robbins, a wheelchair user with cerebral palsy from Pontypridd said she felt \"excited\" about rules relaxing but was \"really cautious\" about the future after shielding throughout the pandemic. \nShielding advice was paused on 1 April this year, with no expectation that people would need to shield again in the future, chief medical officer Frank Atherton said.\n\"Prior to it [the pandemic] I had a really active social life but now I've noticed there's things out there that I can't control,\" she said.\nThat became more of a realisation for Ms Robbins, 32, when her father contracted Covid-19 when visiting the hospital for a routine check-up.\nHe ended up in intensive care and lost his leg. \nShe said she was worried about people's attitudes now that almost all social restrictions are being relaxed and has faced some unpleasant experiences during the pandemic. \n\"Some venomous things have been said to me just because I'm me and I don't understand it,\" she said. \nShe urged people not to \"forget\" disabled people.\nRhian Davies, chief executive of Disability Wales said she feared disabled people would be locked out of society.\nMs Davies said the unlocking of restrictions could \"exacerbate a two-tier system of people feeling like a second-class citizen\" without \"strong messaging from public bodies\". \n\"Just because someone isn't a wheelchair user, hasn't got a white cane or a guide dog, doesn't mean they're not at risk,\" she said.\nJessica Leigh, from disability charity Scope, said many disabled people would be anxious about the changes. \n\"The government's decision to lift restrictions leaves some clinically extremely vulnerable people or those not yet vaccinated at the mercy of others' goodwill,\" she said.\nCrickhowell Rugby Club will play its first competitive community match since February 2020.\nBleddyn Carrington, team manager and full-back, said \"everyone is like a coiled spring ready to go\".\n\"Players are excited, the chats on the WhatsApp group are getting a bit intense,\" he said. \n\"You get nervous thinking 'am I good enough after 18 months?'\"\nSix weeks ago the team were not able to do contact drills, train for more than one hour and use showers, but Saturday marks a return to competitive action. \nThe team played its first friendly match on 19 July against Brecon Seconds but Mr Carrington said it would not compare to being in the competitive environment.\n\"It's an electric feeling having crowds watching you, hearing your name called when you catch a ball or make a tackle\u2026 you forget what it's like.\""

      "text": "A record-breaking bat that flew more than 1,200 miles (2,018 km) from London to Russia died after being attacked by a cat.\nThe female Nathusius' pipistrelle bat, the size of a human thumb, was discovered in Russia's Pskov region.\nThe bat, whose wing had a \"London Zoo\" marking, was rescued by a bat rehabilitation group but later died.\nIt is the furthest recorded journey by a bat from Britain across Europe, beating all known British records.\nThe pipistrelle bat, which weighed 8g (0.3 oz), was discovered by Russian resident Svetlana Lapina in the small village of Molgino and the finding was reported to the Bat Conservation Trust in the UK.\nLisa Worledge, head of conservation services at the Bat Conservation Trust, said: \"This is a remarkable journey and the longest one we know of any bat from Britain across Europe. What an Olympian.\n\"Her journey is an exciting scientific finding and another piece in the puzzle of bat migration. The movements of Nathusius' pipistrelles around the UK and between the UK and the continent remain largely mysterious.\"\nHer wing had a marking after being ringed in 2016 in London by bat recorder Brian Briggs.\nMr Briggs said: \"This is very exciting. It's great to be able to contribute to the international conservation work to protect these extraordinary animals and learn more about their fascinating lives.\"\nThis record is topped by only one other known bat journey in Europe - that of a Nathusius' pipistrelle that migrated from Latvia to Spain in 2019, a record-setting 1,382 miles (2,224km).\nThe expanding range of the Nathusius' pipistrelle's migration is linked to climate change, with future climate change predicted to further impact on the species.\nThere have been more than 2,600 Nathusius' pipistrelles recorded in the UK since the national Nathusius' pipistrelle project launched in 2014 to shed light on their breeding, distribution and migration behaviours. \nMaternity colonies are known in Kent, Northumberland, Surrey and Greater London."

      "text": "For Dr Maya Shahsavari, the last year working on the NHS frontline during the Covid pandemic has been tough. \nThe 37-year-old, who sought asylum in the UK from Iran when she was 13, works in Scotland as an ear, nose and throat surgical registrar.\nBased at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, she has experienced the effects of Covid first-hand.\nBut despite those challenges, she finally feels at home for the first time in more than 20 years. \nWhen Covid arrived in Scotland last year, Dr Shahsavari said she felt unprepared for what working in a pandemic would be like. \n\"They prepare you for a global pandemic in medical school for like a week,\" she said.\n\"I remember being sat in this class and thinking: 'What's the point of this? When will I ever be in a global pandemic?'\n\"Then when the pandemic did hit, I couldn't believe it. It was like a horrible nightmare.\"\nDr Shahsavari sometimes had to examine patients in their cars when there was not enough space in the hospital.\n\"What we found quite difficult was that information was given to us every hour, and that information could change every hour,\" she said.\n\"It was hard to keep up with the change and knowing if you were doing the right thing for patients. It was a lot of pressure.\"\nBut she said she was proud of how her team dealt with the pandemic.\n\"That's what the NHS does best, we came through,\" she added.\nDr Shahsavari's journey to becoming an NHS surgeon was far from conventional.\nWhen they were teenagers, her parents were political activists in Iran, campaigning for free speech. \nBecause they had been arrested a few times, Dr Shahsavari said their names were included on a database used to keep tabs on campaigners. \nWhen her parents were arrested again in the 1990s, years after they had stopped campaigning, they believed their lives were in danger.\nThe family decided that they had to flee Iran.\n\"We gave all of our things away, sold what we could and moved to the UK with absolutely nothing apart from the clothes we were wearing,\" she said. \n\"I was feeling very depressed and confused at the time, but I remember my dad saying that even though I'd lost my home and luxuries in life, I had gained something that they couldn't give me before - freedom.\n\"So he said that I should make sure that whatever it is that I do, I don't look back at my life and think that I've wasted that opportunity.\n\"He told me to think about how I wanted to give back to the community I'd entered.\"\nShe set her sights on becoming a surgeon. But there were more hurdles to overcome.\nWhen she arrived, she did not speak a word of English.\n\"I went from being top of my class in Iran to being at the bottom,\" she added.\nHer university applications were initially rejected for medicine, so she studied biomedical science, followed by a masters in genetics.\nHowever, she never gave up her dreams of becoming a surgeon.\nShe was finally accepted into medical school, qualifying from St George's University of London.\nHer job eventually brought her to Scotland, where she has found a \"magical\" country that feels like home.\n\"I never really felt at home since leaving Iran,\" she said.\n\"I liked my life down south, but something was always massively missing.\"\nWhen she was offered a job in Dundee, Dr Shahsavari said she didn't even know where it was.\nBut the moment she travelled across the Tay Bridge, she saw the scenery and \"felt different\". \n\"The first weekend I was here I started exploring. It was absolutely amazing and it just felt like home,\" she said.\n\"The nature of Scotland has just drawn me in. And the people - they are just on a different level.\n\"They are honest, kind and supportive. There has never been a time where I have asked somebody for directions up here and they have not walked me halfway there.\"\nReflecting on her journey from Iran to her life now in Scotland, Dr Shahsavari says her story is proof that \"horrible struggles can end well\".

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,Humza Yousaf",
      "text": "Scotland's health secretary has warned that coronavirus cases will rise as a result of Monday's easing of restrictions.\nHumza Yousaf said people should remember the pandemic \"is not over\".\nFrom 9 August, social distancing will be dropped in most settings and children under 12 will no longer have to wear masks. Nightclubs will also be allowed to reopen.\nThe MSP said people should enjoy the new rules but remain careful.\nHe also said he was hopeful that further lockdowns could be avoided in the winter, but that there was \"no guarantee\".\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Scotland's The Sunday Show, he said: \"We would expect cases to rise as people interact more, potentially in bigger numbers.\n\"Also when the schools return we would expect more cases. But that is the precise reasoning why we are keeping some mitigations in place. The modelling will hopefully tell us that the pressure we are facing on the NHS will be in a place we can cope with.\"\nOn Friday, new Scottish government guidance suggested that some measures - such as face coverings - would be in place until 2022. Distancing of 2m will also be kept in healthcare settings.\nThe health secretary said it was difficult to tell what would happen over the winter months.\n\"All it takes of course is a new variant that the vaccine is not effective, or less effective but we have had such a successful vaccine programme that there have been so many people vaccinated, I would be confident we wouldn't have to go into a full lockdown,\" he said.\n\"But I couldn't give you a cast-iron guarantee of that in the future.\"\nMr Yousaf said people were right to look forward to the end of some restrictions.\n\"We should look forward to tomorrow. Monday is a significant day,\" he said. \n\"We are lifting some really big restrictions - limits on gatherings, limits that mean so much to people.\"\nBut he said that there was a reason that the term \"freedom day\", used in England last month, was discouraged in Scotland.\nHe told BBC Scotland News: \"The Scottish government has not used and has quashed any suggestion that it is \"freedom day\". We don't use that phrase because Covid has not gone away . \n\"Although case numbers have been going in the right trajectory for a number of weeks we still have high cases and unfortunately people are still dying from Covid.\"\nOn Saturday, some drop-in clinics began to vaccinate the 16-17-year-old age group. \nThe Scottish government hopes to have offered a first dose to this cohort within weeks.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) made the recommendation to add this age group on Wednesday. And all mainland health boards are expected to be vaccinating the teenagers from Tuesday.\nMr Yousaf also said the Scottish government would continue to push the JCVI to recommend vaccinations for even younger children.\nEdinburgh University public health expert Prof Linda Bauld said she would like to see this.\nShe said: \"I think it would make a difference because we have got a reservoir of infection potentially in the community in people who have got lots of social contacts, including teenagers, moving around. \n\"So if you have a younger person who is unvaccinated and can pass it on more easily then people who are vaccinated might also pick it up and that might include the more vulnerable and older.\n\"The MHRA has licensed the vaccine in those age groups and everybody is waiting to for the JCVI to say the next step may be 12-15 year olds. I hope they make that decision but I don't have all the evidence they are looking at all the time.\""

They say they were yards away and did not witness the assault.\nLast month, several police officers who defended the US Capitol testified before a Congressional committee investigating the attack. \nOne officer, Aquilino Gonell, said he feared he would be crushed by the mob.\nAnother officer, Harry Dunn, who is black, said he was racially abused."

      "text": "The health secretary has asked the competition watchdog to investigate \"excessive\" pricing and \"exploitative practices\" among PCR Covid test firms.\nIn a letter to the Competition and Markets Authority, Sajid Javid said it was time for a \"rapid high-level\" review to protect consumers.\nHolidaymakers have complained of huge prices and poor service from many of the 400-plus firms offering PCR tests.\nTests cost about \u00a375 per person on average but prices can reach hundreds.\nMr Javid wrote in his letter to CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli: \"I know that for too many people the cost of PCR testing can act as a barrier, especially for families who want to travel together. \n\"We have all experienced enormous disruption to our lives over this pandemic but it is not right if some families experience yet further disruption unnecessarily because of potentially unfair practices in the market for private travel tests.\"\nRather than wait for a long competition investigation, Mr Javid has requested immediate advice from the CMA on how to \"stamp out any exploitative behaviour in this market\".\nThe government publishes a list of companies and clinics offering testing but there have been reports that many have not got full accreditation.\nThere are reports of PCR tests being offered for as little as \u00a320, and more than \u00a3500. In addition to complaints about high charges, consumers have also reported not receiving test results or of being sent damaged PCR kits.\nAvi Lasarow, chief executive of Covid testing company Prenetics, said the decision to investigate excessive pricing was \"long overdue\". \n\"Companies on the government list must be responsible in their pricing strategies,\" he said.\n\"The list has been exploited by some testing providers luring in consumers with misleading prices and then offering tests that are up to nine times more expensive.\"\nMr Lasarow said the \"easiest way\" to make tests cheaper would be for the government to axe VAT on holiday Covid tests.\n\"If VAT was removed, a family of four flying from London to Majorca could save \u00a3166 - which would pay for the cost of the flights,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the CMA said that as formal investigations can take a long time, in this instance it will provide advice to Mr Javid with a view to taking swift action.\n\"We are aware of concerns about the evolving markets for Covid-19 tests for international travellers. We look forward to providing the Secretary of State with advice on how best to ensure that travellers have access to tests that are affordable and reliable,\" the CMA said.\nThe government has been under pressure from the travel industry and its own MPs to ditch the costly PCR tests.\nWillie Walsh, former boss of British Airways and now director general of the International Air Travel Association, has accused PCR firms of \"profiteering\". \nAnd last week, Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chairman of the Transport Select Committee, tweeted: \"Passengers are being ripped off with expensive PCR tests.\""

A record number of patients are currently waiting for surgery - such as hip or knee replacements - with more than 385,000 patients waiting more than a year, compared to just 1,600 before the pandemic.\nLast month Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he had been shocked to learn that waiting lists could rise to 13 million patients.\nThe IFS decided to crunch the numbers to see whether this was likely - it said Mr Javid's warning is \"well within the realms of possibility\".\nIn order to stop numbers getting that high, the NHS needs to treat even more patients than it did before the pandemic, the IFS said.\nExplaining how it reached its conclusions, the IFS said that after Covid hit in March last year, seven million fewer people joined waiting lists than was normal.\nIt is not yet known how many of these \"missing patients\" will come forward for treatment - but the IFS predicts that their return will increase waiting lists and put the NHS under more pressure.\n\"Even if only two-thirds of the missing patients return then with capacity at 95% of pre-pandemic levels - much more than the NHS is currently managing - waiting lists could easily exceed 13 million (and keep growing),\" said the IFS.\n\"Expanding capacity will be the only solution to cutting waiting lists in the future.\"\nAnd the IFS said the number could even soar to 14 million by autumn 2022 - and continue to increase - if 80% of the missing patients return and the NHS operates at 90% of its capacity levels in 2019.\nThis report argues there are millions of \"missing patients\" from the waiting lists who might have been expected to join it but haven't  - perhaps because they're worried about Covid infections or their conditions haven't been picked up yet. \nThe researchers have looked at different scenarios depending on what happens next to these patients. \nIn one scenario, if the NHS can't treat more patients than it did pre-pandemic, the waiting list could rise to 14 million by next autumn. \nEven in the most optimistic projection, the IFS says it could rise to nine million by 2025, but that would need the NHS to be able to work at 5% more capacity than it did before the pandemic and would come at a cost of at least \u00a32bn. \nIf the NHS can't boost capacity, the IFS warns, longer waiting lists will be with us for years to come.\nThe IFS said it was unlikely that all of the seven million missing patients would return, since some may have died, sought private treatment or chosen to live with their health issues - but they said most will probably come forward at some point.\nEarlier this year, the doctors' union urged people to remember that the waiting lists were not just \"numbers on a spreadsheet\". They are \"real people in pain\" who are distressed, the British Medical Association said.\nOne woman from Hampshire told the BBC that her hip pain was unbearable. \"It's like standing on jagged glass. I get so depressed about the pain I'm living with,\" she said.\nA new chief executive for NHS England was appointed last month - Amanda Pritchard. She acknowledged the NHS had \"big challenges ahead\", including the need to tackle backlogs. \nThe union for nurses said the IFS analysis showed the \"immense task\" that lies ahead - and called on Mr Javid to invest in the workforce.\nThe Royal College of Nursing added: \"A significant pay rise will demonstrate value and help retain experienced nursing staff whom health services can't afford to lose with this challenge ahead.\"\nAnd Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the modelling should be a \"wake-up call for ministers\".\n\"Years of underfunding and cuts to healthcare had already left our NHS with ballooning waiting lists before the pandemic hit. \n\"Given these warnings it's now even more urgent that a long-term rescue plan is put in place to give the NHS the resources and staff it needs to bring down waiting lists and reducing waiting times for treatment.\" \nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it was backing the health service with \u00a39.6bn to help it recover from Covid.\n\"This includes dedicated investment of \u00a31bn this year to tackle the backlog and reduce waiting lists, including by increasing capacity. The NHS is also trialling innovative ways to accelerate elective recovery and enable more hospitals to go further, faster.\n\"We will continue to support the NHS to deliver the appointments, operations and treatment people need.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Flu,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Four million people are to be offered flu jabs this year in Scotland's largest-ever winter vaccination programme.\nThe free vaccine has been extended to protect as many lives as possible and avoid additional pressure on the NHS.\nIt is believed immunity may be diminished due to lower levels of the flu virus circulating last year as a result of lockdowns.\nThe flu vaccination programme will begin in September.\nScotland's deadliest flu epidemic in recent times was in 1989 when 2,400 people died in the seven days to Christmas Eve.\nResearch from Public Health England, carried out in the first pandemic wave before any Covid vaccine had been made or given, suggested risk of death was more than double for people who caught flu on top of coronavirus, compared with coronavirus alone.\nIn March this year, public health expert Dr Susan Hopkins warned that the NHS had to be \"ready\" for surges in flu and other similar illnesses.\nShe said the UK must prepare for a \"hard winter\" because the population immunity to respiratory viruses other than Covid could be lower than usual.\nPreviously, the jab was limited to over-65s, those with certain health conditions, pregnant women, healthcare workers and carers. \nBut for the 2021-2022 flu season, the following will be invited to receive the free vaccine:\nHealth conditions considered to put people in an \"at risk\" groups include asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, heart and lung diseases, or autoimmune disorders.\nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf said flu could be\"extremely serious and infectious\". With Covid-19 still circulating in the community, he encouraged people in Scotland to get vaccinated against flu too. \n\"This will help to protect those most at risk as well as ease pressure on our National Health Service and social care services,\" he said. \"The vaccines are safe and the best way to help protect you, and others, from flu this winter.\"\nDeputy chief medical officer Dr Nicola Steedman said: \"The public health measures put in place to help fight against Covid-19 meant that the circulation of flu viruses was very low last season. \n\"As restrictions continue to lift and we get back to living our lives more normally it is important this year, more than ever, that you receive your flu vaccine if you are eligible, and before flu starts to spread widely. It only takes a few minutes to be vaccinated, and it helps to provide protection from flu for the period of time that flu is likely to be circulating in Scotland.\"\nMs Steedman also said the Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation (JCVI) had published interim advice on providing a third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to those eligible in the autumn.\nShe added: \"Any such extension to the vaccine programme would run alongside the vital flu programme, to protect those at risk from flu this winter. We will take this into account while we await the final JCVI recommendations. But we urge people not to forget about flu, and to come forward for their flu vaccination this year.\""

Ten ships are waiting at Pefki, in the north of the island, ready to evacuate more people if needed, a Coast Guard spokesperson told AP news agency. \nOn Saturday, a fire just north of Athens on Mount Parnitha spread smoke across the capital. Authorities set up a hotline for people with breathing difficulties, according to AP news. \nThousands of people have been evacuated from the area since Thursday but by Saturday the flames had receded. However with strong winds forecast, there are concerns that the fire could flare again. \nOne resident, who was sitting in a car park with his girlfriend, said they had only spent one night in their newly built house before they had to flee. He had spent four hours trying to use a garden hose to save his property. \nA number of countries have offered support to Greece. Nations including the UK, France, Romania and Switzerland have sent firefighters to the area. \nIn Turkey, authorities have been struggling to contain a number of blazes, which have been described by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as the country's worst wildfires.\nTens of thousands of hectares have been destroyed in Mediterranean and Aegean provinces. \nClimate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\nAre you in the area?

      "tags": "Alok Sharma,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "The world is \"dangerously close\" to running out of time to stop a climate change catastrophe, the UK government's climate chief Alok Sharma has said.\nMr Sharma - who is leading COP26, the climate summit hosted by the UK this year - said the effects were already clear with floods, fires and heatwaves.\n\"We can't afford to wait two years, five years, 10 years - this is the moment,\" he told the Observer.\nBut he did not condemn the government for allowing more fossil fuel projects.\nAnd he defended his decision to travel to more than 30 countries in seven months.\nMr Sharma's interview with the Observer comes ahead of a major report being released on Monday from the United Nations' climate change researchers.\nThe report is set to be the strongest statement yet from the UN group on the science of climate change - and will likely give details about how the world's oceans, ice caps and land will change in the next decades.\nThe summary has been approved in a process involving scientists and representatives of 195 governments, which - having signed off on the findings - will be under pressure to take more action at COP26 in November.\nDoug Parr, chief scientist with Greenpeace UK, said \"world leaders have done a terrible job of listening\" to warnings about climate change.\n\"This year, this has to change. We don't need more pledges, commitments and targets - we need real action right here right now.\"\nWildfires are currently raging in Greece, forcing thousands to evacuate their homes - and fires have also been burning in Turkey and California in the US. This summer, western Europe also saw its worst flooding in decades, which killed dozens of people.\nMr Sharma said if urgent action was not taken, the consequences would be \"catastrophic\". \n\"I don't think there's any other word for it,\" he said. \"You're seeing on a daily basis what is happening across the world. Last year was the hottest on record, the last decade the hottest decade on record.\"\nHe added: \"We're seeing the impacts across the world - in the UK or the terrible flooding we've seen across Europe and China, or forest fires, the record temperatures that we've seen in North America. Every day you will see a new high being recorded in one way or another across the world.\"\nMr Sharma said the report released on Monday is \"going to be the starkest warning yet that human behaviour is alarmingly accelerating global warming\".\n\"I don't think we're out of time but I think we're getting dangerously close to when we might be out of time. We will see [from the IPCC] a very, very clear warning that unless we act now, we will unfortunately be out of time.\"\n\"Africa has been waiting for the rest of the world to catch up and act on climate change for years,\" Fredrick Njehu, Christian Aid's senior climate change and energy adviser for Africa, highlighting the \"changing rainfall patterns or overbearing heat\" endured by the continent in recent years.\nHe added: \"The important thing now is that rich world governments make up for lost time and act quickly to reduce emissions and deliver promised financial support for the vulnerable.\" \nGlasgow is set to host the COP26 summit in November - which is the UN climate change conference. \nThe summit is seen as vital if climate change is to be brought under control, and leaders from 196 countries will meet to try and agree action. \nBut campaigners have accused the UK of hypocrisy, as there are plans to tap a new oil field off Shetland. The government has also said more oil and gas wells can be drilled in the North Sea, and there are plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria.\nEarlier this year, the global energy watchdog the International Energy Agency said there cannot be any new investment in oil, gas or coal projects if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C.\nMr Sharma refused to criticise the government's plan for the projects, saying: \"Future [fossil fuel] licences are going to have to adhere to the fact we have committed to go to net zero by 2050 in legislation.\n\"There will be a climate check on any licences.\"\nMr Sharma's interview comes after he was criticised for flying abroad for meetings - and visiting more than 30 countries in seven months.\nHowever, since then some environmental campaigners including Greenpeace have defended him, saying face-to-face meetings are important to persuade other nations to tackle climate change.\nMr Sharma told the Observer that in-person meetings were \"incredibly vital and actually impactful\".\n\"It makes a vital difference, to build those personal relationships which are going to be incredibly important as we look to build consensus,\" he said.\nIt also emerged in the Sunday Mirror that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab did not self-isolate after returning from France, which was on the amber plus list meaning all arrivals must quarantine.  \nA government spokesman said it was Mr Raab's job to represent the UK abroad and he followed Covid guidelines on return. \nThere is an exemption for ministers to avoid quarantine when returning from abroad."

      "text": "A Roman coin of the last pagan emperor which might have been deliberately damaged as an \"act of erasure\" was found by two metal detectorists.\nIt depicts Julian the Apostate, part of Rome's first Christian dynasty, who revived paganism when he became the emperor in AD361.\nThe coin was part of a hoard found near King's Lynn, Norfolk, in March 2020.\nIt appears to have been hidden during the AD367 Barbarian Conspiracy, a time of great turmoil in Roman Britain. \nA British Museum expert suggested a gouge on the coin around Julian's eyes could be an \"act of erasure against the last pagan emperor\".\nBut Adrian Marsden, a numismatist or coin specialist with the Norfolk Historic Environment Service, believes it looks more like accidental damage, as other Julian coins discovered in the hoard remain untouched.\nConstantine I (AD324 to 337) converted to Christianity and by the AD350s it was the empire's official religion. \nDr Marsden said his nephew Julian, who was raised a Christian, was appointed caesar, or deputy emperor, in AD355.\nHe led a successful, lightning campaign against the German tribes and on becoming emperor tried to reintroduce paganism. \nBut while on campaign in Persia, he \"gets himself killed by a stray arrow\" and died after less than two years in charge, to be succeeded by Christians, said Dr Marsden.\nThe coin was part of a hoard of at least 15 gold and 226 silver coins which were found in a field near King's Lynn.\nIt was hidden at the time of Barbarian Conspiracy era, an alleged invasion attempt by Picts and Saxons. \nBut with just one source claiming it took place and no \"archaeological evidence for an invasion, we do wonder whether the turmoil might have been an internal rebellion\", Dr Marsden said. \nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic is exploring a possible listing on the London stock market to raise money to repair the airline's finances.\nThe move could see shares offered to private investors as well as big City firms, but mean he loses overall control of his flagship business.\nVirgin Group owns 51% of the airline, and US-based Delta Air Lines the rest.\nIt is understood Virgin has hired City advisors to draw up flotation plans, but the airline called it speculation.\nLike most airlines, Virgin Atlantic's finances have been battered by the coronavirus collapse in air travel. In April, the airline posted a \u00a3659m loss for 2020 after passenger numbers dropped 80%, and it has announced thousands of job cuts.\nSelling a stake in the airline would raise much-needed funds as global aviation rebuilds. \nHowever, the share prices of airlines such British Airways-owner IAG and Easyjet are still significantly lower than pre-Covid levels amid widespread scepticism among some investors about how long it will take the industry to recover.\nNews of a possible stock market launch was first reported by Sky News. It said Virgin Atlantic's advisors, including banks Citi and Barclays, have in recent weeks been pitching the possible flotation to several potential big investors, which had responded positively to the idea.\nVirgin Atlantic revenues are heavily dependent on UK-US services, and the airline is hoping for a rapid rebound in services as lockdown restrictions ease. Earlier this year, chief executive Shai Weiss said he did not expect to see a big drop in fares as travel resumes.\nA flotation would mark the first time Virgin Atlantic shares have been sold to the public, and would likely see Virgin Group's stake fall below 50%. \nSir Richard founded Virgin Atlantic in 1984, and its success enabled him to build a business empire that now includes the Virgin Galactic space travel arm.\nBut the airline's survival appeared in doubt last year, with administrators put on standby while Sir Richard negotiated a \u00a31.2bn rescue package.\nThat package included a loan from the American hedge fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management. \nSir Richard had tried to secure rescue funds from the UK government, which refused his request, and use his Necker Island holiday resort as collateral to raise money.\nA Virgin Atlantic spokesperson called reports of a possible flotation \"speculation\" and declined to comment further."

      "text": "Withdrawing troops from Afghanistan is a strategic mistake that risks a resurgence of terrorism, a former top UK general has said.\nGen Sir Richard Barrons, who was head of UK Joint Forces Command, told the BBC the UK and Western allies have \"sold the future of Afghanistan\".\nMost British troops left last month and the Taliban have captured five cities in three days.\nA senior Tory backbencher called it a \"shabby withdrawal\".\nFighting in Afghanistan intensified in recent weeks after President Joe Biden ordered the withdrawal of US forces, followed by allies such as the UK.\nTwo decades after they were removed from power by the US over their support for Osama Bin Laden in the wake of the 11 September attacks, Taliban militants are advancing across the country and have seized five regional capitals since Friday.\nGen Barrons told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: \"The withdrawal now is a strategic mistake. I don't believe it's in our own interest.\"\nHe said the decision had \"sold the future of Afghanistan into a very difficult place\" and sent a \"really unfortunate message\" to allies in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\nIt suggests \"we don't have the stomach to see these things through, and we would rather leave than ensure that a humanitarian or political crisis doesn't occur\", Gen Barrons said.\n\"We will run the risk of terrorist entities re-establishing in Afghanistan, to bring harm in Europe and elsewhere,\" he said. \"I think this is a very poor strategic outcome.\"\nThe UK government advised all British citizens to leave this week because of the worsening security situation.\nBut Gen Barrons said an exodus of the international community \"as fair weather friends\", followed by the Afghan elite, could undermine the government and its military, accelerating the crisis.\nHe said he feared the country could split in two or be plunged into a decades-long civil war unless political discussions could resume.\nTory MP Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the House of Commons Defence Committee, wrote in the Mail on Sunday that the UK was making a \"shabby withdrawal\" and \"abandoning the country to the very insurgency that drew us there in the first place\".\n\"Unless we wake up to the reality of what is taking place, Afghanistan might once again become a terror state. This, remember, is the country that brought us 9/11,\" he said.\nThe UK and its allies should retain an assistance force of 5,000 troops to give ground, air and intelligence support to the Afghan army in their fight against the Taliban, Mr Ellwood said.\nBy withdrawing, the UK was also giving up a \"strategically crucial space to an expansionist China\", he said.\nBut Gen Barrons suggested China would be key to any political resolution, because of its influence on Pakistan - which was one of the few countries to recognise the Taliban when it last held power.\nHe said because China shared a border with Afghanistan it would want to avoid any instability that could mean refugees - or militants - flowing over the border.\nA UK Government spokeswoman said: \"We recognise that the security situation in Afghanistan is serious, and reports of the escalating violence are extremely disturbing.\n\"We do not believe there is any military solution to Afghanistan's conflict, and call on the Taliban to end their campaign of violence and engage in meaningful dialogue with the Afghan government.\n\"There needs to be a negotiated solution to ensure a lasting peace.\" "

      "text": "Police in Zimbabwe are investigating the death of a 14-year-old girl during childbirth, a case that sparked outrage among citizens and rights activists.\nMemory Machaya is reported to have died last month at a church shrine in the eastern region of Marange. \nThe case has exposed the exploitation of minors, as she was reportedly forced to abandon school to get married.\nThe United Nations urged the government to recognise child marriage as a crime and bring an end to the practice.\nThe organisation said it \"notes with deep concern\" and \"condemns strongly\" reports into the circumstances surrounding the death.\n\"The current trend of unresolved cases of violence against women and girls in Zimbabwe, including marriages of minors, cannot continue with impunity,\" the UN said in a statement on Saturday. \nThe girl's death on 15 July has put the spotlight on the practice of child marriage within Zimbabwe's Apostolic Church, which often rejects medicine and hospital treatment.\nHer family has said that the baby survived the birth and was doing well, local media report.\nThe circumstances that led to the death and subsequent burial are under investigation by the police and the country's state gender commission.\nAn online petition calling for \"justice for Memory Machaya\" has so far received more than 57,000 signatures. \nZimbabwean feminist activist Everjoice Win said it was time for people to pressure those \"with the power to uphold the law, or make new laws\". \nWomen and girls were \"not seen as fully human, with individual rights... to control our own bodies\" she wrote on Twitter. \nBy law, Zimbabwean girls are allowed to get married at the age of 18, while 16 is the age of sexual consent.\nBut some families believe child marriage can provide financial benefits. \nMany child brides hope marriage will provide the opportunity to go to school. However, young girls typically end up falling pregnant soon after, or being kept at home to carry out household chores."

      "text": "Saudi Arabia is to begin accepting vaccinated foreign visitors to the holy city of Mecca as part of the Umrah pilgrimage. \nThe authorities will begin taking travel requests from Monday.\nThe kingdom closed its borders some 18 months ago because of the coronavirus pandemic. Since 1 August, vaccinated foreign tourists are also allowed in. \nLast month, only around 60,000 vaccinated residents were allowed to take part in a scaled-down Hajj.\nThe Hajj is a pilgrimage to Mecca that Muslims who are able to must perform at least once in their lifetime. It takes place at a set time of year: in 2022, it will run from 7 to 12 July. \nThe Umrah pilgrimage can be undertaken at any time of the year and attracts millions from around the world.  Pilgrims may also visit the holy city of Medina.\nSaudi Arabia will initially allow 60,000 pilgrims to perform the pilgrimage each month, gradually increasing numbers to reach two million people a month, the state Saudi Press Agency (SPA) says.\nSaudi Arabia recognises the following vaccines: Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. \nForeign visitors will also have to agree to undergo quarantine if necessary, the SPA quotes deputy hajj minister Abdulfattah bin Sulaiman Mashat as saying.\nThe country has recorded nearly 532,000 coronavirus cases and more than 8,300 deaths. \nSeparately, it has also said it will begin compensating the families of health workers who died because of the coronavirus, state media reported.\nLast year, it said each would receive 500,000 riyals ($133,000; \u00a396,000).

      "tags": "Somaliland,History,Cardiff,Booker Prize,South Wales Police,Somalia",
      "text": "In September 1952, the last man to be hanged at Cardiff went to the gallows.\nMahmood Mattan was wrongly found guilty for the murder of shopkeeper Lily Volpert in Cardiff's Tiger Bay.\nIt was to prove one of the most notorious miscarriages of justice in British legal history and went some way to hastening the abolition of capital punishment in the UK.\nNow, a novel inspired by his story has been longlisted for the Booker Prize. \nMr Mattan was posthumously acquitted in 1998 - 46 years after he was executed - when it was found evidence had been largely fabricated and manipulated by police at the time.\nSomali-born author Nadifa Mohamed said her motive for writing the semi-fictionalised The Fortune Men was to portray the real Mahmood Mattan.\n\"Previously, he's been cast as this almost passive victim of police brutality, but there was far more to his character than that,\" she said.\n\"People who knew him said he was spikey, brave, happy to stand up for his rights and for those of the people around him.\n\"I believe that is, in part, why the police had singled him out to take the blame for the next major crime to be committed in the area.\"\nBoth born in what is now Somaliland, Mohamed's father met Mahmood when the two emigrated to Hull.\n\"They were both in the Merchant Navy, but their lives took very different directions. My father said Mahmood was just an ordinary guy, albeit a bit of a loner,\" she said.\nA merchant seaman, Mahmood Mattan married paper factory worker Laura Williams in 1946 after settling in Tiger Bay, and the pair had three children together.\nHowever, by 1950, the couple had separated and were co-parenting and living in the same street.\nMahmood was largely ostracised from the Somali community after being accused of stealing money from the Tiger Bay mosque, but when he was charged with murder they rallied around to pay for his legal defence.\nOn the evening of 6 March 1952, moneylender Lily Volpert, 42, had just closed her outfitters shop and was preparing to have supper, when there was a knock on the door.\nHer niece saw her talking to a man at the entrance, but nobody could identify him. A few minutes later she was found with her throat cut, and around \u00a3100 was missing from the till.\nThe last two customers in the shop, Mary Tolley and Margaret Bush, said they had not seen anyone matching Mahmood's description loitering but, after pressurised questioning, Mary Tolley changed her story, only to change it back again at trial.\nA search of Mahmood's house produced no evidence, yet he was arrested on the strength of the testimony of a Harold Cover, who was known to have a history of violence.\nOther statements disproving Mahmood had been in the area were suppressed by the police in court; though his defence was hardly aided by his own barrister who, in summing up, described Mahmood as: \"Half child of nature, half semi-civilised savage\".\nMohamed said her attitude to writing The Fortune Men had disturbing parallels with the police's own approach.\n\"I opted for semi-fiction because I wanted to convey the atmosphere of the time in a way I didn't think I could do with a straight-forward biography,\" she said.\n\"It opens with a family all gathered around the radio to listen to the news of George VI's death, a month before the murder.\n\"Yet the more I got into fictionalising the story, the more I realised that I was doing exactly what the police had done, I almost got into their mindset.\n\"It goes to show just how easily you can create a totally different version of events if you only look at what you're prepared to see.\"\nTwo events would cast doubt on Mahmood's conviction.\nIn 1954, Tahir Gass, another Somali man investigated for Lily's murder, was convicted of killing wages clerk Granville Jenkins in a country lane near Newport.\nThen 15 years later, in 1969, Harold Cover, the man whose evidence had sent Mahmood to his death, was convicted of the attempted murder of his own daughter, by cutting her throat in precisely the same fashion as Lily had been killed.\nYet the Home Secretary James Callaghan refused to reopen the case.\n\"There really is no happy ending to this story,\" Mohamed said. \n\"Laura believed in Mahmood's innocence until the last but after his execution the family were moved to Ely and they never recovered; sinking into a life of poverty and despair.\n\"If there is any crumb of comfort, it's that Laura lived long enough to see Mahmood's conviction overturned by the Criminal Cases Review Commission in 1998 - the first case to be quashed by the organisation.\"\nThe Booker committee will decide if The Fortune Men has been shortlisted in September, with the prize being awarded in November."

      "text": "Fully vaccinated people can now visit France without quarantining on their return to the UK, after travel rule changes came into force at 04:00 BST.\nBrittany Ferries said it had received a \"surge\" of bookings following the rule changes announced on Thursday.\nBut travel agents said the relaxation of quarantine for one of the UK's most popular destinations came \"too late to save the summer\".\nMeanwhile, travellers in Mexico had to rush back to avoid hotel quarantine.\nUnder the latest changes to the UK's traffic light system for travel, the rules have been relaxed for a dozen countries.\nFrance moved from its own amber-plus category on to the amber list, which means children and fully vaccinated passengers do not have to quarantine on their return, although unvaccinated travellers still have to self-isolate at home for 10 days.\nIt comes as the UK recorded 27,429 new Covid cases on Sunday, as well as 39 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nSunday's data means that after a consistent fall since mid-July, the weekly total of cases has shown a slight increase over the previous seven days, of 1.9%.\nAmong those to benefit from the rule changes is Emma Wood, who lives in Laon, France. Her parents, from Northallerton, North Yorkshire, are planning to visit France next week to meet Emma's six-month-old daughter for the first time.\n\"We're so pleased but we daren't get our hopes up until they're here,\" she said. \"They were going to come before but then they introduced the new amber-plus list.\"\nShe said she usually saw her parents five or six times a year but had not seen them in more than 12 months.\n\"My mum has been desperate to see her granddaughter,\" she added.\nLondoner Kyle Frank has also booked a trip after the change was announced. He plans to drive to Nice because he feels it is safer than taking a plane - and so he can bring his puppy, Indy, with him.\n\"It would have been great to book it before but everything has been changing so rapidly it's hard to understand when it will be safe to travel. So I'm trying to go now while I can,\" he told the BBC.\n\"There's no quarantine when I get back to London so I can get straight back to work.\"\nMoved from amber to green: Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway\nMoved from amber-plus to amber: France\nMoved from red to amber: India, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE\nMoved from amber to red: Georgia, Mexico, La Reunion and Mayotte\nChristophe Mathieu, chief executive of Brittany Ferries, said the company had seen bookings surge after it was announced travel rules for France were being relaxed.\nBut the company still only expects to carry a quarter of its usual number of passengers.\n\"Let's be realistic, we would need tens of thousands of people booking to make up for the poor season,\" Mr Mathieu said.\n\"It's more than welcome this announcement, it's good news, but it comes in a year when at the end of the day for us everything is about 2022 and making that a real, normal year.\"\nThe UK government sets the red, amber and green lists for England, while the other nations are in charge of their own lists. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland confirmed they will be adopting the same changes as England - although Wales criticised the UK government for not consulting them. \nThere are now 36 countries on the green list - from which even unvaccinated travellers do not have to quarantine - following the addition of seven more nations, including Germany, Austria and Norway.\nAnd India, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have been moved from the red list to the amber list.\nCountries have their own rules about allowing visitors - so being on the UK's green list does not guarantee travellers can visit.\nBut one travel agent said the latest changes had only made a small difference and testing requirements were still putting many Britons off booking foreign trips.\n\"It's far too late to save the summer,\" said Julia Lo Bue-Said, from the Advantage Travel Partnership.\nShe said a lot of people had already made their holiday plans and the increase in bookings had been \"marginal\".\n\"When you think that most businesses are 80% down, you need a huge volume to make up the shortfall they're experiencing,\" she said.\nFour destinations are also subject to tighter restrictions. Mexico, Georgia, and the French overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, have been added the red list.\nOnly British citizens, Irish citizens, and UK residents can travel from red list countries and they must stay for 10 days in hotel quarantine at a cost of \u00a31,750 for one adult - which increases to \u00a32,285 from 12 August.\nLotis Bautista, one of thousands of Britons on holiday in Mexico when the announcement was made, paid hundreds of pounds to cut short her trip by a week and rush back home before Sunday's deadline.\nShe said she and her husband could not have afforded the costs of hotel quarantine.\n\"I would be lying to you if I said I wasn't incredibly upset when it happened. Even though you know there are risks, you hope there might be a more responsible way of doing things from the government,\" Ms Bautista said.\n\"We're eighteen months into he pandemic and we're still being being given two, three days' notice.\"\nHave you made travel plans as a result of the changes to the rules?

      "text": "Wildfires are continuing to rip through the Greek island of Evia, prompting residents to flee to safety by sea. \nMore than 2,000 people have been evacuated, with elderly residents carried on to ferries.\nLocal officials said more help was needed to fight the fires that have destroyed parts of the island.\nThe EU said it was mobilising one of its biggest responses to tackle the wildfires affecting Greece and a number of other European nations.\nGreece and neighbouring Turkey have been battling devastating blazes for nearly two weeks as the region suffers its worst heatwave in decades. Temperatures have risen to 45C (113F) in Greece. \nA number of wildfires have struck the country in recent days. One blaze in the northern suburb of Athens is said to have subsided.\nHeatwaves such as this are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. The subsequent hot, dry weather is likely to fuel wildfires.\nOn Evia, a large island to the north and east of Athens, two fire fronts have destroyed thousands of hectares of land, along with a number of houses and businesses. \nFirefighters have been struggling to keep fires at bay in a number of villages on the island.\nImages on Sunday show more people being evacuated including elderly people who were pictured being carried on to ferries. \nWith no sign of the fire subsiding, residents and officials are calling for more help. \nGiannis Kontzias, mayor of the municipality of Istiaia in the northern part of Evia, told local news: \"It's already too late, the area has been destroyed.\"\nHe appealed for more help from water-bombing planes and helicopters. \nBut Civil Protection Chief Nikos Hardalias said the planes faced a number of difficulties including poor visibility caused by the fires. \nBy Bethany Bell, BBC News, Evia, Greece\nSome people are finding it hard to breathe because there is so much smoke and ash in the air. \nYesterday we were in one of the villages that was evacuated and the whole place was covered in a pall of orange smoke. One Serbian tourist who was waiting on the beach for a ferry said it was like an apocalyptic movie. \nPeople here are on alert and there is a lot of distress. There is a feeling that the authorities are letting people down and not helping enough but the government says it is doing all it can.\nA number of countries have responded to Greece's call for help including France, Germany and the UK.\nThe EU said member countries have now deployed nine planes, close to 1,000 fire fighters and 200 vehicles to Greece.\nLate on Sunday, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis expressed his \"heartfelt gratitude\" to countries that had sent assistance. \n\"We thank you for standing by Greece during these trying times,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nOn Monday, Mr Mitsotakis was due to chair a ministerial meeting to discuss relief measures for those who lost property in the fires.\nElsewhere in Greece, fires in the Peloponnese region are said to be stable and fires in the northern Athens suburb have subsided. \n\"The situation in Attica (which encompasses Athens) is better but we are afraid of the danger of flare-ups,\" Mr Hardalias said.\nThe military are patrolling the area amid concerns that the fire could re-start. \nTurkey is also battling a series of wildfires, which have been labelled the worst in the country's history. \nEight people have died and thousands have been forced to flee their homes.\nOn Sunday the country's Agriculture and Forestry Minister, Bekir Pakdemirli, said 235 fires had been contained and five were ongoing.\nAre you in Greece?

Video on social media shows hundreds of inmates leaving the city jail.\nOther provincial capitals under pressure include Herat in the west, and the southern cities of Kandahar and Lashkar Gah.\nThe Afghan military says dozens of Islamist fighters, including senior commanders, have been killed in Lashkar Gah. The Taliban however have denied the military's version of events.\nAnd in the Afghan capital Kabul this week, the Taliban shot dead President Ashraf Ghani's former spokesman and carried out a bomb attack on the house of the acting defence minister.\nTaliban fighters have also captured key border crossings with neighbouring countries in recent weeks.\nThe militant group has closed the border with Pakistan, and pictures show dozens of Afghans stranded on the Pakistani side, unable to return to their families.\n\"We came [to Pakistan] to attend a funeral three days ago. Now the border is closed. We're sitting here. We have no food and no money,\" a man trying to get home to Kandahar told Reuters news agency. \nThe US and UK governments have urged its citizens to leave the country immediately because of the worsening security situation.\nOn Friday, the British Foreign Office warned that militants were very likely to carry out attacks in Afghanistan. The US said citizens can receive a repatriation loan if they cannot afford to pay for a commercial flight themselves."

Then I tried ordering again from a different company, and they didn't give me that either.\n\"I was crying my eyes out because I was so hungry, I was starving,\" she said. \nShe said: \"On my first night, I got there, and I had no water. I was thinking, 'I know I'm hungry, but water is more important'.\n\"I was ringing and ringing and ringing asking and begging for water, I think I was crying at one point for water.\"\n\"There's no laundry service. I've run out of knickers, so I've been washing them in the sink - sounds bad but I have no choice.\" \nShe said other guests at the hotel had started passing supplies to each other using bed sheets tied up to make ropes.\n\"This boy cut up a bed sheet, tied it all together, tied the water and roped it down to me, so I could have a bottle of water. \n\"People are ordering food and putting the rope down and the delivery guy will just tie it on,\" she added.\nMs Burdge also said she had run out of medication she needed for a mental health issue because she was unable to communicate with the doctor at the hotel.\n\"I only took enough for a seven-day holiday, but now I don't have any,\" she said. \"I'm not supposed to stop taking it, but I don't have it to take.\" \nMiss Burdge said she had planned the holiday following a tough few months, and this had only made things worse.\n\"I lost my partner a few months ago, so I've come on holiday with my friend and her little girl just to get away really, just to have a break and clear my head,\" she said.\nSpain is currently on the UK's amber list, meaning double vaccinated travellers no longer have to quarantine once they return, but must take a private Covid test before the flight home.\nIf this test is positive, they must isolate for 10 days before returning to the UK, and this will sometimes mean being placed in a quarantine hotel. \nHotel Palma Bellver said food was served by hospital catering, not the hotel, and that water was available to guests on request.\nIn a statement, the hotel said: \"The operation is sanitary (more similar to that of a hospital than to that of a hotel), and therefore the meals (four a day) are served by the hospital catering, supervised by hospital dietitians.\n\"The guests/patients are allowed to order meals outside, (as well as other basic supplies) but not processed food, as per the doctor's prescription.\n\"The staff of our company only manages the inventory of rooms, we respond to the client-patient, and we serve as a 'connecting link' between the various agents involved,\" they added.

      "text": "Cuba's communist government has legalised small and medium-sized private businesses in the wake of mass anti-government protests last month.  \nUnder the new rules, enterprises with up to 100 employees will be allowed.\nPresident President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel said Cuba was taking firm steps to update its economic model.\nCritics say the government's plans have been accelerated because of July's protests, when thousands turned out to complain of economic ruin.\nDemonstrators condemned the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and demanded political change.\nDozens were arrested nationwide and that least one man died in the unrest.\nFriday's decision is seen as a major shift in government policy on the island, where state-run companies are the norm.\nThe protests came amid a severe economic crisis. \nIn July, the authorities said they would allow travellers arriving in the country to bring in food, medicine and other essentials without paying import duties.\nScrapping the import duties had been suggested by some Cubans as a way to ease the shortages of medicines and food.\nTourism, one of the most important sectors, has been devastated by global restrictions on travel during the pandemic.\nSugar, which is mostly exported, is another key earner for Cuba. But this year's harvest has been much worse than expected.\nAs a result, the government's reserves of foreign currency are depleted, meaning it cannot buy imported goods to supplement shortages, as it would normally do.\nCuba has blamed the US and its economic sanctions for the protests and Cuba's wider problems."

      "title": "Who are the Taliban?",
      "tags": "Pakistan,Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "The Taliban were removed from power in Afghanistan by US-led forces in 2001, but the group has seized control of the country once again following a rapid offensive.\nThe capital, Kabul, was the last major city to fall to the offensive that began months ago but accelerated as the hardline Islamists gained control of territories.\nThe group entered direct talks with the US back in 2018, and in February 2020 the two sides struck a peace deal that committed the US to withdrawal and the Taliban to preventing attacks on US forces. Other promises included not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks.\nBut in the year that followed, the Taliban continued to target Afghan security forces and civilians, advancing rapidly across the country.\nThe Taliban, or \"students\" in the Pashto language, emerged in the early 1990s in northern Pakistan following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. It is believed that the predominantly Pashtun movement first appeared in religious seminaries - mostly paid for by money from Saudi Arabia - which preached a hardline form of Sunni Islam.\nThe promise made by the Taliban - in Pashtun areas straddling Pakistan and Afghanistan - was to restore peace and security and enforce their own austere version of Sharia, or Islamic law, once in power.\nFrom south-western Afghanistan, the Taliban quickly extended their influence. In September 1995 they captured the province of Herat, bordering Iran, and exactly one year later they captured the Afghan capital, Kabul, overthrowing the regime of President Burhanuddin Rabbani - one of the founding fathers of the Afghan mujahideen that resisted the Soviet occupation. By 1998, the Taliban were in control of almost 90% of Afghanistan.\nAfghans, weary of the mujahideen's excesses and infighting after the Soviets were driven out, generally welcomed the Taliban when they first appeared on the scene. Their early popularity was largely due to their success in stamping out corruption, curbing lawlessness and making the roads and the areas under their control safe for commerce to flourish.\nBut the Taliban also introduced or supported punishments in line with their strict interpretation of Sharia law - such as public executions of convicted murderers and adulterers, and amputations for those found guilty of theft. Men were required to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka.\nThe Taliban also banned television, music and cinema, and disapproved of girls aged 10 and over going to school. They were accused of various human rights and cultural abuses. One notorious example was in 2001, when the Taliban went ahead with the destruction of the famous Bamiyan Buddha statues in central Afghanistan, despite international outrage.\nPakistan has repeatedly denied that it was the architect of the Taliban enterprise, but there is little doubt that many Afghans who initially joined the movement were educated in madrassas (religious schools) in Pakistan.\nPakistan was also one of only three countries, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which recognised the Taliban when they were in power in Afghanistan. It was also the last country to break diplomatic ties with the group.\nAt one point, the Taliban threatened to destabilise Pakistan from areas they controlled in the north-west. One of the most high-profile and internationally condemned of all Pakistani Taliban attacks took place in October 2012, when schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai was shot on her way home in the town of Mingora.\nA major military offensive two years later following the Peshawar school massacre greatly reduced the group's influence in Pakistan though. At least three key figures of the Pakistani Taliban had been killed in US drone strikes in 2013, including the group's leader, Hakimullah Mehsud.\nThe attention of the world was drawn to the Taliban in Afghanistan in the wake of the 11 September 2001 World Trade Center attacks in New York. The Taliban were accused of providing a sanctuary for the prime suspects - Osama Bin Laden and his al-Qaeda movement.\nOn October 7, 2001, a US-led military coalition launched attacks in Afghanistan, and by the first week of December the Taliban regime had collapsed. The group's then-leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and other senior figures, including Bin Laden, evaded capture despite one of the largest manhunts in the world. \nMany senior Taliban leaders reportedly took refuge in the Pakistani city of Quetta, from where they guided the Taliban. But the existence of what was dubbed the \"Quetta Shura\" was denied by Islamabad.\nDespite ever higher numbers of foreign troops, the Taliban gradually regained and then extended their influence in Afghanistan, rendering vast tracts of the country insecure, and violence in the country returned to levels not seen since 2001.\nThere were numerous Taliban attacks on Kabul and, in September 2012, the group carried out a high-profile raid on Nato's Camp Bastion base.\nHopes of a negotiated peace were raised in 2013, when the Taliban announced plans to open an office in Qatar. But mistrust on all sides remained high and the violence went on.\nIn August 2015, the Taliban admitted they had covered up Mullah Omar's death - reportedly of health problems at a hospital in Pakistan - for more than two years. The following month, the group said it had put aside weeks of infighting and rallied around a new leader in the form of Mullah Mansour, who had been the deputy of Mullah Omar.\nAt around the same time, the Taliban seized control of a provincial capital for the first time since their defeat in 2001, taking control of the strategically important city of Kunduz.\nMullah Mansour was killed in a US drone strike in May 2016 and replaced by his deputy Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada, who remains in control of the group.\nIn the year following the US-Taliban peace deal of February 2020 - which was the culmination of a long spell of direct talks - the Taliban appeared to shift their tactics from complex attacks in cities and on military outposts to a wave of targeted assassinations that terrorised Afghan civilians.\nThe targets - journalists, judges, peace activists, women in positions of power - suggested that the Taliban had not changed their extremist ideology, only their strategy. \nDespite grave concerns from Afghan officials over the government's vulnerability to the Taliban without international support, the new US president, Joe Biden, announced in April 2021 that all American forces would leave the country by 11 September - two decades to the day since the felling of the World Trade Center. \nHaving outlasted a superpower through two decades of war, the Taliban began seizing vast swathes of territory, before once again toppling a government in Kabul in the wake of a foreign power withdrawing.\nThey swept across Afghanistan in just 10 days, taking their first provincial capital on 6 August . By 15 August, they were at the gates of Kabul.\nTheir lightning advance prompted tens of thousands of people to flee their homes, many arriving in the Afghan capital, others heading for neighbouring countries.\nThe Taliban's return to rule brings an end to almost 20 years of a US-led coalition's presence in the country."

      "text": "The Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan, almost 20 years after being ousted by a US-led military coalition. \nEmboldened by the withdrawal of US troops, they now control all key cities in the country, including Kabul. \nThe Taliban took some areas from government by force. In other areas, the Afghan National Army withdrew without a shot being fired. \nAlthough renewed clashes had been going on for several weeks, from 6 August the Taliban made a more rapid advance across the country, as they took control of provincial cities.\nThe maps below start in early July and show the 400 or so government districts as they fell to the Taliban.\nUS forces based outside Afghanistan had launched air strikes against Taliban positions earlier last week, but they failed to slow the advance of the insurgents.\nAlthough most US troops left in July, several thousand returned to Kabul at the weekend to help evacuate American and allied personnel from the capital.\nThe airport in the capital was the only official route out of the country after the Taliban took control of all the major border crossings. \nCustoms duty on goods entering the country via crossings they control is now collected by the Taliban - although exact amounts are unclear as the volume of trade has fallen as a result of the fighting. \nBut, Islam Qala on the border with Iran was, for example, capable of generating more than $20 million per month. \nDisruption to the flow of imports and exports has affected prices of essential goods in the markets - fuel and foodstuffs in particular.\nUS troops and their Nato and regional allies forced the Taliban from power in November 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US.\nBut despite a continued international presence in the region, billions of dollars of support and training for the Afghan government forces, the Taliban regrouped and gradually regained strength in more remote areas.\nA  BBC study in 2017 showed the Taliban were in full control of a number of districts. But the research also showed they were active in many other parts of the country, mounting weekly or monthly attacks in some areas, suggesting significantly higher strength than previous estimates. \nIn 2017 about 15 million people - half the population - were reported to be living in areas either controlled by the Taliban or where the Taliban were openly present.\nAdditional reporting by BBC Afghan service"

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Sunday morning. We'll have another update for you on Monday.  \nThe latest changes to the UK's green, amber and red lists have come into force this morning. France is now fully back on the amber list - rather than \"amber plus\" - which means fully vaccinated travellers no longer need to self-isolate when they arrive back. Brittany Ferries said it had received a \"surge\" of bookings since the changes were announced on Thursday - but the company still only expects to carry a quarter of its usual number of passengers. \"Let's be realistic, we would need tens of thousands of people booking to make up for the poor season,\" said the ferry firm's boss. Travel agents also said the change to France, one of the UK's most popular destinations, came \"too late to save the summer\". Read more: Which countries are on the green list?\nThere's a stark warning about the state of hospital waiting lists in England. Currently, five million people are waiting for routine operations and procedures, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies has predicted that could rise to 14 million by next autumn. It said because of Covid, seven million fewer people joined the waiting list - but they are expected to soon seek treatment and cause a huge backlog. The government said it had given the NHS \u00a39.6bn to help it recover from Covid - which includes \u00a31bn to help get the lists down.\nAustralia is facing its biggest Covid outbreak in a year, in Sydney. A citywide lockdown is in force, and soldiers have been sent out onto the streets to enforce the rules. But many people living in the poorer and more ethnically diverse suburbs of the city say they have been left frightened and \"treated like second-class citizens\". Local councillor Dai Le and others have accused authorities of double standards, arguing Sydney's affluent eastern suburbs such as Bondi - where the outbreak began - have been treated differently. Another resident says: \"I have seen police every single time I've left my home. I have not been stopped, but I can honestly tell you I feel anxious leaving, almost practising what I'm going to say to a police officer when they stop me.\"\nWe're hearing a lot about the coronavirus jab rollout - including the pop-up vaccination centre at a Birmingham nightclub, or for Newcastle United fans at home games - but Scotland has expanded its offer of flu jabs to more people. Four million people will be offered the jabs in Scotland - including over-50s and all school-age children - making it the country's largest-ever winter vaccination programme. It's thought that immunity to flu may be diminished due to lower levels of the virus circulating last year because of the lockdowns, and research suggests risk of death from Covid was more than double for people who caught flu on top of coronavirus. More here, or we've also got details on England's, Wales's and Northern Ireland's flu jab plans. \nFor students across the UK, this has been another year of uncertainty and disruption - exams cancelled and final grades based on teachers' assessments. This week, A-level, Scottish Higher and BTec results will be out, but how are students feeling? \"I feel like it's been a rollercoaster,\" says Molly, 18, from Liverpool. \"There have been times when I feel like it's better it happened this way, and there have been other times when I think, if I could, I would redo the whole two years. The anxiety comes in waves.\" Meanwhile, Fatima from south London says she just wanted to sit exams. \"Especially because I live in a low-income neighbourhood.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid restrictions in Scotland have been lifted at the \"right moment\", according to the first minister.\nNicola Sturgeon admitted to feeling \"nervousness\" at the move, but said the vaccine was now giving \"significant protection\".\nLevel zero ended at midnight with almost all of the remaining anti-Covid measures now removed.\nThe legal requirement for physical distancing ends in most places and hospitality can open at full capacity.\nLarge outdoor gatherings can go ahead and nightclubs are allowed to open.\nMany clubs in Scotland opened their doors overnight for the first time since March 2020, with hundreds queuing up for the midnight reopening.\nOne clubber at the Buff Club in Glasgow told BBC Scotland: \"We are so excited for tonight. This is Freedom Day - we're ready.\"\nScotland has been under varying levels of Covid restrictions for almost 18 months.\nMs Sturgeon said in an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain: \"I think there's always going to be nervousness when we lift restrictions after such a long period.\n\"I have to be honest that there's some butterflies in my stomach about it today, but I think it's the right moment to do this.\"\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney said care was still required when dealing with the virus, but added it was the \"right moment to act\".\n\"We've seen a sustained fall in the number of cases that we've been experiencing of Covid,\" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland.\n\"We have very high levels of vaccination as a consequence of the supremely successful vaccination programme that has been put in place, so we have a significant amount of protection.\n\"And we have the benefit that we are still in the summer period and there is an opportunity for people to be spending more time out of doors.\"\nHowever, Mr Swinney, the Scottish government's minister for Covid recovery, warned that face coverings were likely to a \"significant\" part of life in Scotland \"at least through the winter\".\n\"When I've travelled in Asia there is a common use of face coverings by individuals... and it becomes part of the cultural activity of particular countries,\" he said.\n\"I don't know if that will happen here, but I think some people will feel safer as a consequence of wearing face coverings.\"\nResponding to Mr Swinney's comments, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the threat of Covid rules lasting until 2022 would \"dismay\" people across Scotland.\n\"Nicola Sturgeon seems determined to cling on to control, even when the public health data does not support all of the government's decisions,\" he said.\n\"For instance, they have provided no evidence to explain why 12 year olds need to keep wearing face masks but 11 year olds do not.\n\"It's vital that the rules are straightforward, logical and communicated clearly. That no longer appears to be the case.\"\nThe new rules also signal the return of outdoor events of more than 5,000 people and indoor events of more than 2,000 - but they must apply for permission from local authorities and the government to go ahead.\nOn Friday it was also announced that children under 12 would no longer have to wear face coverings.\nThere are also new rules on self-isolation for close contacts of positive cases.\nDouble-vaccinated adults and all children can now avoid self-isolation if identified as a close contact so long as they are symptomless and provide a negative PCR test.\nWhole classes in schools will no longer have to stay at home if an infection is discovered, although children and adults who are higher-risk close contacts will be told to isolate.\nIn an interview with BBC Breakfast, Nicola Sturgeon said the policy of wearing face coverings in schools will be reviewed after six weeks but she doesn't know how long the requirement will be kept in place in other settings.\nThe first minister said people should be cautious, but should also \"feel positive about where we are right now\".\nEdinburgh University public health expert Prof Linda Bauld, also said caution was still needed as the Office of National Statistics infection survey showed there remained a \"reasonable amount\" of infections in the community.\n\"There are still a large number of people who are very anxious about going through this next phase. They may be clinically vulnerable and we need to think about them in our own behaviour,\" she told BBC Scotland.\n\"The virus has not gone away.\"\nHowever, Prof Bauld added she was \"really optimistic\" that Scotland was \"getting on top of the pandemic\"."

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Taliban",
      "text": "The Taliban have captured three regional capitals in Afghanistan as they continue to make sweeping territorial gains in the country.\nThey seized control of the key northern city of Kunduz on Sunday, as well as Sar-e-Pul and Taloqan.\nIt means five regional capitals have fallen to the militants since Friday, with Kunduz being their most important gain this year.\nThe Taliban said there is no agreement on a ceasefire with the government. \nA spokesman for the group warned against further US intervention in Afghanistan while speaking to Al Jazeera TV on Sunday. \nViolence has escalated across Afghanistan after US and other international forces began to withdraw their troops from the country, following 20 years of military operations. \nTaliban militants have made rapid advances in recent weeks. Having captured large swathes of the countryside, they are now targeting key towns and cities.\nThe three northern cities fell to Taliban control within hours of each other on Sunday, with one resident in Kunduz describing the situation as \"total chaos\".\nThe Afghan government, meanwhile, said its forces were fighting to retake key installations.\nHeavy fighting has also been reported in Herat in the west, and in the southern cities of Kandahar and Lashkar Gah.\nThousands of civilians have been displaced this year. Families, including babies and young children, have been sheltering in a school in the north-eastern city of Asadabad.\n\"Many bombs were dropped on our village. The Taliban came and destroyed everything. We were helpless and had to leave our houses. Our children and ourselves are sleeping on the ground in dire conditions\", Gul Naaz told AFP.\n\"There was firing, one of my seven-year-old daughters went out during that fighting and disappeared. I don't know if she is alive or dead,\" another displaced resident said.\nThe US has intensified its air strikes on Taliban positions, with Afghan military officials saying militants have been killed. But the Taliban say the air strikes hit two hospitals and a school in the city of Lashkar Gah. Neither claim has been independently verified.\nThe US embassy in Afghanistan condemned the Taliban's \"violent new offensive against Afghan cities\", saying the group's actions to \"forcibly impose its rule are unacceptable\".\n\"They demonstrate wanton disregard for the welfare and rights of civilians and will worsen this country's humanitarian crisis,\" it said in a statement.\nBy Khalil Noori, BBC News, Kabul\nThis attack on a number of strategic cities and their fall to the Taliban was unprecedented. But as the deadline for the full withdrawal of foreign forces approached, a big change on the battlefield was expected.\nNow it is time for the Afghan government to prove that its well-equipped forces, 350,000 strong, are able to retake the lost areas.\nIt would be difficult for the Taliban to hold Kunduz, but for several weeks the group has kept control of commercial centres important for trade with Iran and Pakistan.\nThe populations in cities taken by the Taliban are paying the price of war, having lost loved ones or property. They are having to leave their homes, fearing the launch of a government operation to retake the cities.\nPeace talks with the Taliban in Doha are deadlocked. If the process resumes, from now on both sides will be trying to control the larger area to justify a greater share of power, if they agree on a transitional government.\nThe seizure of Kunduz is the most significant gain for the Taliban since they launched their offensive in May. The city, home to 270,000 people, is considered a gateway to the country's mineral-rich northern provinces.\nAnd its location makes it strategically important as there are highways connecting Kunduz to other major cities, including Kabul, and the province shares a border with Tajikistan.\nThat border is used for the smuggling of Afghan opium and heroin to Central Asia, which then finds its way to Europe. Controlling Kunduz means controlling one of the most important drug smuggling routes in the region.\nIt also holds symbolic significance for the Taliban because it was a key northern stronghold before 2001. The militants captured the city in 2015 and again in 2016 but have never been able to hold it for long. \nBy Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent\nFormer British Gen Sir Richard Barrons says there is a danger of Afghanistan feeling \"friendless\", in the wake of recent battlefield defeats and the possible withdrawal of diplomats and contractors from Kabul if things get worse.\nIt is much too early to speculate about a Saigon-style withdrawal from the capital, echoing the way the Americans hastily left Vietnam in the final act of the war there, in 1975.\nBut in recent days, British and American calls for their nationals to leave the country threaten to create a dangerous narrative.\nIt is something that western military planners have been worried about for some time, following US President Joe Biden's decision, in April, to withdraw American forces by 11 September.\nIn June, classified UK Ministry of Defence documents were found at a Canterbury bus stop by a member of the public. One of them voiced just this concern, speaking about the need to counter an \"abandonment narrative\" in Afghanistan.\n\"Precise language may be needed,\" it said, \"to avoid misunderstandings about 'retrograde to zero' vs normal diplomatic (including military) representation.\"\n\"Retrograde to zero\" is the peculiar euphemism used to describe the withdrawal process now in its final weeks. In other words, planners were only too aware of creating the dangerous impression that Afghanistan might indeed be left \"friendless\".\nThat is not yet the case. American air strikes are still being used in an attempt to halt the Taliban's advances. Britain and the US will doubtless have hidden assets on the ground, working feverishly to stem the tide of the war."

And Kay said that getting back on stage was like \"getting in a hot bath\".\nIn late 2017, the Phoenix Nights star cancelled his tour and all future work projects due to \"unforeseen family circumstances\". \nHe returned the year after with the finale of his BBC TV show Car Share, but has not appeared live since.\nThis weekend's matinee and evening shows were staged in aid of Manchester University student Ms Nuttall, who was diagnosed with having an aggressive form of brain cancer - glioblastoma multiforme -  in October 2018, during her first term at King's College London.\nBrain scans showed six tumours, and she was told she had 12-18 months to live.\nSince then, Ms Nuttall, who was in the audience on Saturday, has been undergoing immunotherapy in Germany as one of the few avenues of treatment available, alongside a costly complex cell vaccination programme, with each jab costing \u00a327,000.\nAt the Apollo, her sister Gracie introduced Kay and told the audience their family was \"eternally grateful\" to them for \"potentially saving my sister's life\".\nSoon after her initial diagnosis, Laura's mum Nicola said the family received an unexpected call from Kay, who she had previously met nearly 20 years ago when working at Granada television.\n\"He just called up out of the blue and said, 'How can I help?'\" she said previously.\nThose in attendance on Saturday were required to provide either proof of having been double vaccinated, or a negative Covid test.\n\"People have been bringing them to the gate in bags,\" quipped Kay, about the lateral flow tests.\nAnswering questions submitted by fans, he revealed he had written two Christmas special episodes of one of his shows, Max and Paddy, with Paddy McGuinness, but that they had never got round to making them.\nHe also admitted he can no longer buy garlic bread from the supermarket, when quizzed about his famous catchphrase.\nThe first show, which ended as it started with a standing ovation, ran over by an hour, causing the evening crowd to queue in the rain for a later-than-advertised second instalment.\nMany also paid way over the asking price after tickets had been snapped up by touts.\nOfficial funds raised from the event will go mostly towards Ms Nuttall's treatment, but with some cash going to the Brain Tumour Charity.\nShe previously posted on her fundraising page: \"I still can't quite believe this is really happening!\"\nKay's only other public appearance in recent times was on Cat Deeley's BBC Radio 2 show this year to talk about his love of music, and in particular the Mamma Mia! musical.\nHe announced this week that a string of planned \"dance-a-thons\", which ended up being cancelled last year due to the pandemic, had now been rescheduled for 2022.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

such a state, with sections where she would not swim any longer.\n\"It's just disrespect from water companies and farmers treating it like an open sewer,\" the 55-year-old said.\nIn April, D\u0175r Cymru Welsh Water said 100,000 discharges happened across more than 2,000 water treatment works and sewer overflows across the Welsh network in 2020.\nAnd over the years D\u0175r Cymru has been fined hundreds of thousands of pounds for killing fish, spilling chemicals as well as dumping sewage.\nMs Jones, who sometimes spends as much as 40 hours a week in the Wye, reports the problems she sees. \n\"It's companies, it's people, it's businesses who just think it's an easy way to get rid of sewage, wash-off from poultry farms, everything,\" she said. \n\"I desperately want to protect the river and feel like I am letting it down.\"\nShe called for greater accountability, changes to the law and greater fines for those found to have polluted.\nIn December, a report by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) found more than half of the River Wye was failing to meet pollution targets.\nConcerns have been raised about the effects of phosphates from chicken farms on pollution levels in the Wye. \nBut, while NRW said poultry farms in Powys were having an impact, it said the reasons behind the pollution were more complex and sources were varied. \nMs Jones recently highlighted the state of the Wye by swimming a kilometre (0.6 miles) along the river in Monmouth while towing a coffin bearing the words \"Death of the Wye\", alongside paddle boarders dressed as grim reapers. \n\"When you see the amount of sewage that is dumped, it is diabolical,\" said Angela, who lives in Monmouthshire. \n\"There is no way I am going to give up on this river.\"\nIn April, the BBC's Panorama highlighted D\u0175r Cymru as one of the worst offenders among UK water companies for dumping untreated sewage.\nEnvironmentalist George Monbiot highlighted algae which has flourished in rivers like the Wye. \nAccording to the Natural Environment Research Council, this is caused by excess phosphorus from sewage, and run-off from fields fertilised with phosphorus compounds. \nIt also leads to a reduction of oxygen in water.\nMr Monbiot drew attention to damage wrought on rivers by farming as chemicals and nitrates from the dung of cattle, pigs and chickens ran into them.\nHe added: \"We are seeing a comprehensive ecological collapse going on in Wales' rivers.\"\nThe Welsh government has designated the whole of Wales a \"nitrate vulnerable zone\" (NVZ) and introduced stricter rules on the storage and spread of slurry, in a bid to tackle river pollution. \nBut a farming union is challenging Wales' pollution rules in the High Court.\nAfonydd Cymru, which represents river trusts, said sewer overflows needed to be addressed, but warned replacing the existing system would take decades and cost billions of pounds.\nIt said agricultural pollution had worsened as livestock farming intensified. \nChairman Chris Mills said: \"Waste products being produced from this farming are simply too great for the land to cope with, coupled with inadequate storage capacity, inappropriate spreading, and poor land use management.\"\nMonmouth MP David Davies is calling on the Welsh government to follow the UK government and bring in new legislation to tackle river pollution.\nThe UK government says its Environment Bill would include new legal duties to tackle sewage discharges into rivers.\nMr Davies, a wild swimmer himself, said: \"It is absolutely vital we protect our waterways\".\nNFU Cymru said it was concerned about \"false claims\" made about poultry farming.\nA spokeswoman said: \"Despite claims from some campaigners regarding the impact of poultry farming within the Wye catchment, a recent NRW report is clear that the overall pattern of failures in the Wye does not support the hypothesis that poultry units are the main, or even a particularly important reason, for nutrient failures within the catchment.\"\nThe Welsh government said it had provided \u00a39.5m during this financial year to improve water quality in Wales, and that 42% of Wales' water bodies and 46% of rivers were at \"good status\".\nBut, it added: \"Pressures from the past, such as legacy chemicals, will affect the water environment for decades to come.\"\nNatural Resources Wales' Ceri Davies said it had a range of projects to improve the health of Wales' rivers, citing its \u00a36.8m \"Dee life\" scheme.\n\"We have prosecuted water companies three times over the past six years, whilst five prosecutions have been related to agricultural pollution,\" she said.\nD\u0175r Cymru Welsh Water said it had invested more than \u00a385m in the past decade on removing phosphorus from rivers, including at 10 locations on the Wye, where it said it had been responsible for \"less than a third\" of phosphorus.\n\"We are committed to working collaboratively with all bodies involved and to play our part in helping to further enhance river water quality,\" a spokesman added."
