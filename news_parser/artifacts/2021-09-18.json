      "title": "Four more small energy firms could go bust next week",
      "tags": "Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Energy industry,Energy service companies",
      "text": "At least four of the smaller UK energy companies are expected to go bust next week amid soaring wholesale gas prices. \nIndustry sources have told the BBC that four firms have asked larger players to bid to take over the supply to one million customers.\nThe price rise has left some companies unable to provide their customers with the energy they have paid for.\nIndustry rules mean supplies will continue for affected customers, and they will not lose money owed to them.\nThe new company is also responsible for taking on any credit balances the customer may have. \nBut paying that credit out to customers is a further disincentive for companies to take on new business. \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted: \"Some energy companies are facing pressure. Ofgem has robust measures in place to ensure that customers do not need to worry, their needs are met, and their gas and electricity supply will continue uninterrupted if a supplier fails.\"\nThe government added that if the company is not taken over there were processes in place to appoint a special administrator to temporarily run the suppliers.\nIt came after the government held talks with representatives from the energy industry amid growing concern about the impact of the spike in wholesale gas prices on households and businesses, including food manufacturers.\nThe government said the business secretary was reassured that security of supply was not a cause for immediate concern within the industry. \n\"The UK benefits from having a diverse range of gas supply sources, with sufficient capacity to more than meet demand... the UK's gas system continues to operate reliably and we do not anticipate any increased risk of supply emergencies this winter.\"\nMr Kwarteng said: \"Our largest single source of gas is from domestic production, and the vast majority of imports come from reliable suppliers such as Norway...\n\"However, our exposure to volatile global gas prices underscores the importance of our plan to build a strong, home-grown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\"\nThe business secretary said he will have further talks with Ofgem on Sunday to discuss the issues raised by the industry, and on Monday he will seek a further meeting with industry figures \"to plan a way forward\".\nFour small suppliers ceased trading in recent weeks, including Edinburgh-based People's Energy, which supplied gas and electricity to about 350,000 homes and 1,000 businesses, and Dorset-based Utility Point which had 220,000 domestic customers.\nAt the beginning of 2021 there were 70 energy suppliers in the UK. Industry sources say there may be as few as 10 left by the end of the year. \nGovernment sources have said the impact on small energy companies that might be the most exposed was being monitored.\nSource: Citizens Advice\nMany smaller companies have not insured - or hedged - their exposure to rapidly rising prices and some of the ones that have are cashing in that insurance now to survive - leaving them vulnerable to further shocks.  \nThe end of summer is the time of year when credit balances are at their highest as customers have been paying their usual monthly amount but not using much energy for heating their homes.  \nOfgem may have to allow the cost of those balances to be spread across the industry - adding hundreds of millions of pounds to energy bills through industry-wide levies.  \nUnder normal circumstances there is a competitive auction process with the company offering the lowest energy price being rewarded with the additional customers. That is not the case in current market conditions.  \nAs one industry executive put it: \"With energy prices having rocketed, and the energy price cap [the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard tariff] already having been set for this year, no-one is that keen to take on new business. The cap is now the cheapest price in the market.\"\nWhen this has happened in the past, the companies involved have failed and Ofgem has asked larger players to bid to take on the new customers. \nIndustry group Oil & Gas UK said wholesale prices for gas are up 250% since January - with a 70% rise since August.\nHigh global demand, maintenance issues at some gas sites and lower solar and wind output are blamed for the rise.\nEmma Pinchbeck, chief executive of trade association Energy UK, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: \"There is a longer conversation to be had about our retail market design and how we make sure we are not vulnerable to volatile, international commodity prices again.\"\nAdditional reporting by Alex Kleiderman"

      "text": "The US government is set to fly back to Haiti thousands of migrants who have gathered under a US-Mexico border bridge in recent days, US media report.\nFlights will begin on Sunday and could involve up to eight a day, officials told the Associated Press.\nAt least 10,000 people, mostly Haitian migrants, are camped under the bridge connecting Del Rio in Texas to Mexico's Ciudad Acu\u00f1a, and more are expected.\nDel Rio's mayor Bruno Lozano has declared a state of emergency.\nDescribing the situation as \"unprecedented\" and \"surreal\", he said border patrol had been overwhelmed and \"agitated\" migrants were living in impossible conditions.\nThe border crossing at Del Rio was temporarily closed on Friday \"to respond to urgent safety and security needs presented by\" the influx of migrants, US Customs and Border Protection said.\nThe makeshift camp at Del Rio has few basic services and migrants, waiting in temperatures of 37C (99F), have been wading back across the river into Mexico to get supplies.\nShelters have been made from giant reeds and many are using the river to bathe and wash clothes in, the AP reports. At least two babies are reported to have been born in the camp.\nRamses Colon, a 41-year-old Afro-Cuban asylum seeker who worked in Peru to save money for the trip, said the camp was \"chaos\".\n\"You stand there among thousands with your little ticket waiting for your turn,\" he told the Washington Post. Migrants have been given tickets with numbers while they wait to be processed. \nRepublican Congressman Tony Gonzalez, whose district includes Del Rio, said in an interview with Fox News that the situation is \"as bad as I've ever seen it\". \n\"When you see the amount of people and how chaotic it is and how there is literally no border, folks are coming to and from Mexico with ease, it's gut wrenching and it's dangerous,\" Mr Gonzalez added. \nThe migrants are mostly Haitians, with some Cubans, Peruvians, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans also present, reports say.\nThey appear to be part of a larger wave of Haitians heading north, many of whom arrived in Brazil and other South American nations after the 2010 earthquake, the Washington Post reports.\nThe US government has been facing a surge of migrants at the border.\nEarlier this year, it was reported that the number of migrants detained at the US-Mexico border in July exceeded 200,000 for the first time in 21 years, government data shows.\nAnd last month, the authorities arrested more than 195,000 migrants at the Mexican border, according to government data released on Wednesday. This summer's numbers represent a significant increase from the 51,000 arrested in August 2019.\nImmigrants rights activist Jenn Budd told the BBC she believes the situation is a direct result of the Biden administration's extension of Title 42, a Trump-era pandemic policy that allows the US to swiftly expel undocumented migrants.\n\"When you have large numbers of people who need refugee or asylum status, and have essentially closed down the system that deals with refugees and asylum seekers, then you have people with no other choice but to cross illegally,\" said Ms Budd, a former Border Patrol agent and intelligence analyst. \n\"In order to have national security, you have to have a robust and humane asylum system,\" she added. \"Otherwise, people end up spilling over illegally, nobody gets checked, and then people get hurt like this\".\nOn Thursday, a federal judge blocked the administration from continuing to use title 42. The judge said that the policy does not give the government power to expel migrants or deny them opportunities to seek asylum. The order will go into effect in 14 days, giving the government an opportunity to appeal.\nSince taking office, President Joe Biden, who had vowed to reform US immigration, has created a taskforce to reunify migrant children with their families, paused construction of Donald Trump's border wall, and called for reviews of legal immigration programmes terminated by his predecessor.\nMr Biden has also presided over a record-breaking influx of arrivals to the US southern border, including hundreds of unaccompanied children who are being held in US immigration detention facilities."

      "tags": "Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Energy industry",
      "text": "Ofgem has said that UK household energy bills will be affected by soaring prices of fossil fuels globally.\nThe energy regulator told the BBC that increasing prices, for gas in particular, \"will feed into all customer energy bills in the UK\".\nIt described the energy price cap as one of the \"best tools\" to ensure consumers pay a fair price.\nBut the price cap for default domestic energy deals has already been raised to cover rising wholesale costs.\nThe typical gas and electricity customer is likely to see their bill go up by \u00a3139 to \u00a31,277 a year from October.\nPrepayment customers, meanwhile, will see an increase of \u00a3153, from \u00a31,156 to \u00a31,309.\nThe price cap limits the price that companies can charge customers who have not recently changed their tariff or energy supplier and allows them only to charge legitimate costs.\n\"We have put tough rules in place to ensure suppliers treat customers who are struggling with bills fairly, and welcome their commitment to reach out to those who most need help,\" an Ofgem spokesperson said.\n\"Where help is not forthcoming, we will not hesitate to act,\" the watchdog added.\nLisa Barber, home products and services editor at Which?, warned that if the wholesale cost of energy continued to rise, those on variable tariffs might see their bills increase and the number of cheap tariffs on the market might shrink.\nTo keep costs down, Which? suggests:\nIt comes after the UK had to fire up two old coal power plants to meet electricity needs earlier this week.\nWarm, still, autumn weather has meant wind farms have not generated as much power as normal, while spiking prices have made it too costly to rely on gas.\nOn Tuesday, the use of coal returned to 2.2% of the UK's electricity generation.\nAudrey Gallacher, Energy UK's deputy chief executive, said: \"Due to the unprecedented price increases in natural gas, National Grid, the electricity system operator, has had to make some tough choices about where we get our power from in order to maintain security of supply.\nShe said the move highlighted the \"need to continue the low carbon energy transition, and further reduce our dependency on fossil fuels for our heat and power\". \n\"It will not only help us meet climate change targets but remove the risk of being exposed to volatile international wholesale prices.\"\nEnergy UK added that it \"recognises\" the impact increased energy prices would have on customers and that anyone worried about their bills should talk to their supplier.\nSome suppliers have said that profits have been hit by financial assistance offered to customers struggling to afford the higher prices.\nRobert Buckley, and energy analyst at Cornwall Insights, said prices for power which is needed immediately are at all-time highs - 10 times the prices of last summer.\n\"There's very high international commodity prices for gas and for carbon as economies recover from Covid, and the EU has tightened up its carbon market rules,\" he said. \"Very high coal prices as well.\"\n\"In the UK we've a combination of low wind, we've had outages at some of the nuclear stations, some of the gas stations have been offline, and we've had lower flows into the country of gas from Norway,\" he said.\nConsumers will see these rises push their bills up this winter as the price cap goes up, but if wholesale energy prices continue at these highs the cap \"will go up a lot more\".\nHowever, in the meantime the high prices are \"also very bad for suppliers because the cap limits what they can charge their consumers, and the market is way above that now\", Mr Buckley added, saying it was \"very sad\" that some small suppliers had already gone out of business."

      "text": "Almost 10 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 197 countries worldwide. \nHowever, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world.  \nSome countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but others are some way behind.\nWith an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. \nOverall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with about three billion and 1.6 billion respectively. The US is third, with more than 530 million.\nMany poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine.\nCovax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021, but downgraded its supply forecast as a the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.\nThe scheme has now distributed more than one billion vaccines.\nThe vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. \nUnlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute.\nMost governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. \nThe Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, UK, Europe and other countries. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia.\nEarly studies suggest the newly identified Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. \nA third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 96 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes.\nWorldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. \nOur World in Data, a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, collated the information in the map and table above.\nPopulation figures have been sourced from the United Nations' mid-2021 estimates provided by Our World in Data."

      "text": "The Taliban appear to have shut down the women's affairs ministry and replaced it with a department that once enforced strict religious doctrines.\nOn Friday, the sign at the ministry was removed, and a sign for the ministry of virtue and vice put in its place.\nVideos on social media showed women employees outside the offices, urging the Taliban to let them return to work. \nDuring the Taliban rule in the 1990s, the ministry forced strict Islamic rules and harsh restrictions on women.\nIn the last 20 years Afghan women have fought for and gained a number of basic rights, but there are now fears that progress is being upended by the Taliban's new all-male interim government.\nThe BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet, in Kabul, says that while Taliban leaders have made promises that they understand Afghanistan has changed - and that so have they - there seems to be a growing mismatch between promises and policies.\nHuman rights groups have previously criticised the virtue and vice ministry for silencing dissent, violently enforcing restrictions on citizens - especially women and girls - and spreading fear and distrust throughout communities. \nBut Taliban members say the institution is important: \"The main purpose is to serve Islam. Therefore, it is compulsory to have [a] Ministry of Vice and Virtue,\" a Taliban member, Mohammad Yousuf, told the New York Post.\nIts full name, according to the new sign on the Kabul compound, is the Ministry for Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice.\nIt was already in existence before the Taliban first came to power, but it expanded during their rule between 1996 and 2001. \nThe ministry was responsible for deploying so-called morality police onto the streets to enforce the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islamic religious law, known as Sharia.\nIt became known for beating women who it perceived were dressed \"immodestly\", or who were outside without a male guardian. Girls were not allowed to be educated past primary school - a measure the group has now reportedly reintroduced.\nEntertainment like music and dancing was banned, and activities such as playing chess or flying a kite were prohibited. Prayer times were strictly enforced, men were made to grow beards, and Western-style haircuts were frowned upon.\nAnyone found to have violated the rules was harshly punished - flogging, beatings, amputation and public execution were not uncommon.\nTwo Taliban members in Kabul told The Washington Post newspaper that they did not expect the Taliban to use force in the same way the group had in the past, and that its enforcers would not be police or soldiers.\nThe ministry was disbanded after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, although then-President Hamid Karzai re-established a similar but less powerful department in 2006 following pressure from conservatives.\nAt the time, Human Rights Watch called the ministry a \"notorious symbol of arbitrary abuses\".\nFemale staff who worked at the women's affairs ministry compound said they had been trying to come back to work for weeks, but had been locked out of the building.\n\"For women, nothing will be there anymore,\" one worker said. \"All of us have responsibilities for our families... We are educated and do not want to confine ourselves to the house.\"\nTaliban officials have said that under their new government, women will be allowed to study and work in accordance with the group's interpretation of Islamic religious law. \nWomen have been told to stay at home until the security situation improves, and Taliban fighters have beaten women who were protesting against the all-male interim government.\n\"When there is no ministry, what should an Afghan woman do? Is their [Taliban] conscience agreeable if Afghan women beg on the roads?\", another woman said outside the compound."

The latest evidence and medical professionals agree that the vaccine provides the greatest protection from Covid-19.\"\nThe latest Covid figures showed there were 520 people in hospital with Covid in Wales, with an average of 42 admissions each day. \nDr Viki Male, a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales earlier this week vaccines were safe and effective for those already pregnant and people trying to conceive. \nShe said: \"We know that Covid is dangerous during pregnancy, particularly in the second half of pregnancy. If you catch Covid it's more likely that your baby will be born pre-term. It's also more likely that your baby will be stillborn. \n\"So if you're thinking of becoming pregnant, you might want to get the vaccine so you're protected in advance.\"\nShe added there was no evidence Covid vaccines had stopped people from conceiving, including in IVF settings, and that those already pregnant should get vaccinated. \n\"If you're already pregnant we have absolutely loads of data about how safe the vaccines are in pregnancy,\" she said.\n\"There's no increased risk of miscarriage, pre-term birth, stillbirth, the baby being smaller than we expect, or any congenital abnormalities. \n\"We recommend Covid vaccination during pregnancy, we do not recommend getting Covid during pregnancy.\""

Killed them all, of course.\"\nHours before the last episode aired, authorities arrested Durst in New Orleans for Ms Berman's murder. Jurors were played the clip during the trial. \nProsecutors called Durst, 78, a \"narcissistic psychopath\". It now looks likely he will die in jail. \nSusan Berman was a crime writer, and had acted as a spokesperson for Durst when he became a suspect in his wife's disappearance.\nAt an earlier hearing, Durst's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, objected to jurors also being shown clips from All the Good Things, a 2010 film about his marriage starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst.\nThe film was directed by The Jinx's filmmaker Andrew Jarecki and depicts the life of the tycoon, showing him as a murderer.\nDurst's wife Kathleen McCormack, a medical student, went missing in 1982 and is presumed dead.\nShortly after Friday's verdict, her family issued a statement urging prosecutors in New York's Westchester County to prosecute Durst.\n\"The justice system in Los Angeles has finally served the Berman family. It is now time for Westchester to do the same for the McCormack family,\" they said.\nProsecutors argue that Durst actually murdered three people - the third being an elderly neighbour, Morris Black, who discovered Durst's identity in 2001 while he was hiding out in Texas.\nDurst was acquitted of murdering Mr Black, successfully arguing he had killed him on the grounds of self-defence before cutting up the body.\nDurst is an estranged member of one of New York's wealthiest and most powerful real estate dynasties. His brother Douglas Durst, who testified at the trial, told the court: \"He'd like to murder me.\"\nDurst is due to be sentenced on 18 October. "

Gabby is missing.\"\nThe couple set off on a nomadic nationwide road trip in a white Ford Transit van in July, posting updates on social media. \nThey filmed themselves smiling, kissing, and running on beaches in a YouTube video, \"Beginning Our Van Life Journey\", which has been viewed over 600,000 times.\nTwo weeks before Ms Petito went missing, on 12 August, police in the southern Utah town of Moab were called to a possible domestic violence incident involving the couple. \nPolice released bodycam footage which showed Ms Petito crying and complaining about her mental health to officers. She also said the couple had been arguing more frequently.\nThe officers recommended they spend the night apart but did not file any charges. It is not yet known what happened next."

      "tags": "Puberty,LGBT,Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust",
      "text": "Doctors can judge if under-16s can give informed consent to puberty blocker use, the Court of Appeal has ruled.   \nThe appeal was brought by the Tavistock Trust, which runs the UK's only youth gender identity clinic.\nThe decision reverses a 2020 ruling that under-16s lacked capacity to give informed consent to the treatment, which delays the onset of puberty.\nThe original case was brought by Keira Bell, who says the clinic should have challenged her more over transitioning. \nShe said she was disappointed by the decision, and will seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.\nCourt of Appeal judges said they recognised \"the difficulties and complexities\" of the issue, but that \"it is for the clinicians to exercise their judgement knowing how important it is that consent is properly obtained according to the particular individual circumstances\".\nPuberty blockers are drugs used to \"pause\" puberty by suppressing the release of hormones.\nThey are prescribed to some children who are experiencing gender dysphoria, which the NHS describes as \"a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity\".\nThe Tavistock clinic said it welcomed the decision.\n\"The judgement upholds established legal principles which respect the ability of our clinicians to engage actively and thoughtfully with our patients in decisions about their care and futures,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"It affirms that it is for doctors, not judges, to decide on the capacity of under-16s to consent to medical treatment.\"\nThe Tavistock's Gender Identity Development Service (Gids) said that hormone treatment \"allows a young person time to consider their options and to continue to explore their developing gender identity before making decisions about irreversible forms of treatment\".\nIn December 2020, the High Court ruled under-13s were \"highly unlikely\" to be able to give informed consent to what it described as \"experimental\" treatment and it was \"very doubtful\" those aged 14 and 15 would have the sufficient understanding of the implications.\nKeira Bell, one of the claimants in the case, started taking puberty blockers at the age of 16 after being referred to Gids.  \nShe was later prescribed the male hormone testosterone and had surgery to remove her breasts.\nNow in her mid-20s, she regrets the decision to transition to a male, and feels there wasn't enough investigation or therapy before she reached that stage.\nShe said she had \"no regrets\" about bringing the case, which she said \"shone a light into the dark corners of a medical scandal that is harming children and harmed me. \n\"I am obviously disappointed with the ruling of the court today, and especially that it did not grapple with the significant risk of harm that children are exposed to by being given powerful experimental drugs.\"\nThis a complex, controversial area, yet the Court of Appeal's ruling is very clear. \nIt is for doctors working with families and the children themselves to decide whether that young person can truly understand the implications of taking drugs that could change the course of their life. \nEffectively this ruling has removed the courts from the decision-making process in all but the most difficult cases. \nThis will be welcomed by many young people struggling with their gender identity, who believe the long wait for treatment that they already face is causing huge distress and harm. \nBut for those like Keira Bell, who believe they weren't challenged enough when they made decisions that shaped their futures, there will be real disappointment. \nHowever, the court cases have led to more discussion of the issues - and many will hope that they will also lead to greater understanding. \nIn March, a separate judgement from the court's Family Division had ruled parents could give consent for under-16s to access puberty blockers, with other safeguarding measures considered.\nThe Tavistock temporarily paused new referrals to its endocrinology service following the rulings. \nEligible under-16s who had already been referred for treatment, and have parental consent, are having their cases reviewed by Gids, with decisions overseen by an independent NHS England review group.\nThe NHS said the findings of Dr Hilary Cass's independent review into NHS gender identity services for children and young people would shed further light on the issue.\nThe review was announced in September 2020, when it was said it would take \"12 months or possibly longer\". \n\"The NHS commissioned Dr Hilary Cass to review gender identity services prior to the original High Court ruling to ensure the best model of safe and effective care is delivered - this will set out wide-ranging recommendations including on the use of puberty blockers and the many contested clinical issues identified by the court,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"An independent multi-professional review group will continue to confirm whether clinical decision making has followed a robust consent process now that the endocrine pathway has been reopened by the Tavistock.\" "

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Prince Andrew, Duke of York",
      "text": "For weeks, lawyers acting for a woman who alleges she was sexually abused by Prince Andrew have been trying to alert him to their plans.\nIt has been a drawn-out process involving email auto-replies and courier receipts.\nTo serve a member of the Royal Family once meant to do one's duty for Queen and country.  \nBut a month-long chase by US lawyers to find Prince Andrew and in the legalese, serve him with allegations of abuse, has brought a whole new meaning to the phrase. \nThis is what you need to know - and why we're nowhere yet near learning the truth in this case. \nVirginia Giuffre is suing Prince Andrew for damages, alleging that she was sexually abused by him when she was controlled by the super-rich sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. He killed himself in 2019.\nEpstein was once a friend of Prince Andrew - and the ninth-in-line to the throne has consistently denied the allegation and says he can't even remember meeting Ms Giuffre. \nBut it's for a court in New York to decide whether her allegations are true - assuming the case ever gets going. \nIf you sue someone for damages, you must first \"serve\" the case on the person you are intending to sue. \nThat means you make sure the documents containing your allegations reach their hands - or at the very least get to a lawyer working for them. \nThat rule is at the heart of justice in the US and the UK: a judge must be sure that the defendant knows what they are being accused of. \nSo, Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York, who is in charge of the Virginia Giuffre case, won't even consider her claims until he is sure that Prince Andrew has received the allegations in proper legal form and has had time to respond.\nAnd that's where we've currently been stuck - until now - as publicly available documents in the United States show. \nOn Thursday, 26 August, Cesar Sepulveda, a corporate investigator, turned up at the gates of Windsor Great Park. \nMs Giuffre's lawyers employed Mr Sepulveda to take the legal papers to the Duke of York's home. \nWhen he arrived on an unseasonably grey August morning, he had a fruitless wait.  \nHe handed over his business card and despite conversations with police officers standing guard, no officials working for the Prince could be found. \nThe next day he returned and, in his court statement, he recounts that this time a police officer told him the documents could be left at the gate to be forwarded on to \"the legal team.\" \nFast forward to 13 September and David Boies, Virginia Giuffre's lawyer, joins a teleconference in a New York courtroom. \nHis sole objective was to convince Judge Kaplan that the prince had now been served and the case should proceed. \nLegal documents show the lengths that Mr Boies' and his firm had gone to.\nThe chase had in fact begun weeks before Mr Sepulveda's Windsor visit. \nDocuments were emailed to any British lawyer the Giuffre team could find who had represented the Prince in the past. They sent the requests by courier - and showed the delivery receipts to the US court. \nOne receipt read: \"Hi. Your package was delivered Wed 08/18/2021 at 8.28am. Delivered to Royal Lodge at Windsor... Received by A POLICE OFFICER.\"\nNobody replied.\nMs Giuffre's team also showed the court a photo of them posting the documents by Royal Mail directly to the prince. \nBut they didn't stop there.\nThey had discovered the Duke of York's office email address and sent the papers once more to tell him he was being sued... and this time they received a reply. \n\"Thank you for emailing The Duke of York's Office,\" it read. \"This is an automatic acknowledgement to tell you that we have received your email safely.\"\n\"I think that it is clear that Prince Andrew has actual notice of this complaint and proceeding,\" Mr Boies argued to the New York court on Monday. \"I believe we have complied with the service requirements.\"\nBut that's not the way the prince's newly-appointed Los Angeles lawyer saw it. \nAndrew Brettler, on the line from California, argued the duke had not been served at all - and it should be for the High Court in London to decide.\nAnd that's because of a not widely known but extremely important international agreement called the Hague Convention. \nThis agreement means an American court can ask a British one for help in tracking down a defendant and serving papers on them. \nJudge Kaplan told the duke's LA lawyer that if he continued to object to Ms Giuffre's team chasing down Prince Andrew themselves, he would indeed consider sending a judge-to-judge request to the British for help.\n\"I think we are making this a lot more complicated that it really is,\" he remarked on the call.  \n\"Regardless of whether your client has been served effectively to date... you have a pretty high degree of certainty that he can be served sooner or later.\"\nAnd that's where Master Barbara Fontaine comes in, The Queen's Remembrancer. \nShe's the High Court judge in charge of overseeing foreign requests for help. \nWhat about the Queen's Remembrancer bit? That's an ancient judicial title. One of her duties is to review for the monarch the annual plans for new trees in the Forest of Dean - but this and other ceremonial roles have nothing to do with her modern legal duties.\nOn Wednesday Master Fontaine confirmed she had received a valid request for assistance from New York. That meant her office would soon send the allegations to Prince Andrew once and for all. \nBut London solicitors for the duke objected - so the process stalled again. They have until next Friday to launch a formal challenge. \nWill that happen? Well, there's now been an important twist back in New York. \nLate on Thursday, Judge Kaplan ruled that Andrew Brettler, the Los Angeles lawyer who had joined the teleconference for the prince earlier in the week, should now be sent the documents. \nHe said: \"Service on the defendant's US counsel is reasonably calculated to bring the papers served to the defendant's attention, regardless of whether his US counsel is authorised to accept service on his behalf.\"\nAnd so after weeks and weeks of too-ing and fro-ing it appears the New York judge has decided it's time to get on with things. \nIf Prince Andrew cannot now avoid service, the case is still far off the prospect of him giving evidence. The next stage is likely to be challenges to whether the claim against him is even valid - because Ms Giuffre brought legal action against Jeffrey Epstein before he died. \nThe prince's lawyers have said in court that Ms Giuffre agreed in 2009 not to sue anyone else connected to Jeffrey Epstein when she settled her damages claim against the now-dead financier. \nThe precise wording of that deal is currently confidential - sealed by a court. \nUnsealing that document is looking like the next battle, if the prince is finally served and the case gets under way.

People are dancing, people are busy and actually nightclubs are a lot safer because of the ventilation we have.\n\"First to close, last to open and we've been picked on by the government. Despite all our efforts its been a really tough time for us.\n\"Our venues are at a really fragile state of recovery and many hundreds of jobs are at risk.\n\"Our customer and staff safety have been at the forefront of our agendas but, in the interest in fairness, we would have liked to see this across all retail and hospitality which makes it a difficult pill to swallow.\"\nNight Time Industries Association Wales said: \"We are disappointed that the Welsh government has felt it must mandate Covid passports at this stage, albeit a more liberal implementation with the inclusion of testing.\n\"We still feel that these measures will have a negative impact on businesses, and will create considerable market distortion.\"\nAnd UK Hospitality's executive director for Wales, David Chapman, said it would be an \"extra burden\" leading to closures and job losses.\nHe said it had made the case against passes because of difficulties including definitions of businesses and conflict with customers, all at the same time as a shortage of staff.\n\"Those affected businesses, already in a fragile state following repeated lockdowns and periods of onerous trading restrictions, now find themselves facing further economic and resourcing pressures,\" he said. \nFor Alys Scourfield, from Cardiff, the announcement of Covid passes has \"changed her life\". \nIt means she will now be able to go to watch Wales in the autumn nationals with her son, for what may be her final time. \nMrs Scourfield's \"time is limited\" after her cancer recently spread to her spine. \nShe said she would not go to an event with a large crowd unless she was sure everyone was double jabbed or had a negative test.\n\"I need to go out for mine and my children's mental health and pretend to be a normal person for the short time I've got left,\" she said.\n\"This will make me feel much safer and feel that I've done everything I can possibly do to reduce the risk.\"\nThe leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said he was disappointed by the announcement.                                                                                                       \n\"Welsh Conservatives have been against the introduction of such documentation from the outset, due to the wide-ranging ethical, equality, privacy, legal, and operational ramifications,\" he said.\n\"The inclusion of the lateral flow test element eases one area of concern but a whole host remain, particularly regarding the overall effectiveness of this measure and the impact it will have on businesses, jobs and Wales' economic recovery.\" \nRhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, said he was \"a bit perplexed about elements of this Covid pass scheme\".\n\"It's a much broader target base - we're talking about football matches, not just nightclubs, so there are issues of implementation, certainly,\" he said.\nWelsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds promised to vote against the scheme if it faces a vote in the Senedd.\n\"I understand many people want to get back to a sense of normality, but vaccine passports are not the way to do this and we need to be careful about the precedent they set. They are medical ID cards in all but name and Welsh Liberal Democrats will lead the fight against their introduction.\"\nAt Friday's news conference, Mr Drakeford also said people should keep working from home where possible.\nAlthough the guidance has no legal force, the Welsh government said it wanted to \"reinforce the importance\" of working from home.\nMany large employers are already using \"hybrid\" models, with staff splitting time between home and the office.\nMr Drakeford said: \"If you don't need to be in the office, for example, please work from home whenever you can.\n\"In England, working from home is part of their Plan B - here in Wales is part of our Plan A and in line with that advice from Sage that we should build up our defences in the autumn and winter early.\""

      "text": "Covid passes for nightclubs and large events in Wales have split opinion, with some saying they are reassured by the rules while others are concerned.\nPeople will need to prove they have been vaccinated or had a negative test from 11 October.\nDisability blogger Holly Greader said she felt \"comforted\", but club owners said they could deter people going out.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has said the passes could cut the chances of another lockdown.\nAnyone aged over 18 wishing to attend nightclubs or large-scale event will be required to show the pass to prove they are either fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test result within the last 48 hours.\nIndustry experts warned the passes could stop clubs being able to cash-in on parties over Christmas and New Year after last year's lockdown and restrictions over the festive period.\nHowever, disability campaigners welcomed the news, saying it would help reassure those most at risk of getting seriously ill from Covid-19 when going out and attending festivals, concerts and matches.\nHolly Greader, 23, from Cardiff, who has multiple chronic illnesses, said knowing people had tested negative or where double jabbed would help her feel safer going out in the coming months.\nHowever, the disability campaigner told BBC Radio Wales she felt the rules should be stronger.\nShe said she believed people should have had both the vaccine and a negative test result to attend events, and that it should be extended to pubs and bars.\nBut she said it should not bar those who were unable to have the jab.\nShe said the passes would help give her and others who have been classed clinically extremely vulnerable \"comfort\", but added it was not just about being able to go out.\n\"It's about actually keeping ourselves as well as possible going forward... we already have a lot of medical problems and adding Covid to the mix will make us sicker,\" she said.\n\"It could lead to a point where we don't get a choice whether we are able to go out because our health has decided that for us.\"\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford made the announcement as part of the latest review of coronavirus restrictions, despite warnings from a nightclub trade body that the move may damage the nightclub industry.\nThe Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in Cardiff Bay have criticised the introduction of the passes, while Plaid Cymru said it was \"perplexed\" by elements of the plan.\nOn Saturday, David Chapman, director of UK Hospitality in Wales, warned people would have house parties rather than go out to clubs due to the checks.\nHe said the impact of the passes was \"unclear\" and could put the Christmas party season at risk, harming an industry which was \"desperate\" for the income after months of lockdowns and restrictions.\n\"This change hasn't come with any sort of detail, we don't know what the repercussions are for pubs becoming nightclubs, or what we do about people coming to clubs who don't have the accreditation,\" he said.\n\"There is so much uncertainty that the industry now has to try to resolve in a period of three weeks - that doesn't help viability.\"\nAnyone who is aged over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the last 48 hours, can get the digital NHS Covid pass.\nHowever they will only be compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter:\nPasses are also a way of proving you do not need to self-isolate if you have been identified as a close contact of a positive Covid case, and can be used when travelling abroad.\nConcerns have also been raised that IT issues may mean some jabs were not recorded, meaning some people's passes may not be up to date.\nFormer pub landlord Christine Hire, 61, said she found out her second jab had not been officially recorded after downloading the app ahead of a holiday with her husband, Alan, to Jersey next week.\nMs Hire, from Llanelli, had her second jab in Carmarthenshire in June, but had to contact her health board after getting a letter two weeks ago telling her to go in for her second dose.\nWhen she phoned to tell them she had already had both doses, she was told it would be corrected.\nShe said when she called to get it fixed, she was told there had been an IT issue at the time of her jab and it was being resolved.\nBut she said she feared it would not be done in time for their trip.\n\"They told me to keep checking, but this was in June, how long is this going to take to get right? They told me it had impacted thousands of people,\" she said.\n\"I'm going to have to go with my paper pass, I am just praying that's going to be enough.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"We are aware of technical issues around vaccinations not appearing on the NHS Covid Pass in a minority of cases and are working with the UK government to resolve this.\""

      "text": "At Balkh airfield in Mazar-i-Sharif, northern Afghanistan, Taliban fighters excitedly snap photos of a Russian-made MI-17 helicopter touching down.\nOn board are senior Taliban officials. Sitting in the cockpit are their former enemies: pilots from the old Afghan air force. \nMaulvi Abdullah Mansour, the Taliban commander in charge of the airfield, shows me round the fleet he now controls. It includes attack helicopters and fighter planes, gifted to the previous government by international forces.\nUnder the old government, the aircraft were often used to target the group. It's not clear how they will be used now that the war is over. \"If we ever need them in the future, they are here,\" Mansour says.\nAs the Taliban advanced across Afghanistan ahead of its August victory, dozens of pilots fled the country in fear of their lives, taking their aircraft with them. But others stayed on and now work under the leadership of the Taliban, reassured, it appears, by assurances of an amnesty. \nI ask Maulvi Mansour how it feels to now be working alongside men he was once fighting against. \"We always knew in our hearts that we would conquer and liberate the country,\" he says, \"but we also knew that one morning we would sit down and work together because they are our countrymen.\" \nSitting next to him is Gul Rahman, a helicopter pilot. He appears cautious in his answers, insisting that once he heard about the Taliban's amnesty he was never afraid of returning to work. \n\"It was inevitable this would happen one day,\" he says, \"we never thought we could continue on our separate paths forever \u2026 We will leave the politics to the politicians and work together to develop the country.\"  \nYounger Taliban fighters mill around us in the hangar, looking on with curiosity at two MD-530 helicopters. Signs of a degree of underlying tension are visible as one of the Talibs quizzes a mechanic about his qualifications. \"You all got these jobs through personal connections, not because you're properly qualified,\" he says in an accusing tone. Nevertheless, overall the atmosphere seems amicable.\nElsewhere, the transition from old to new regime is going less smoothly. The country is facing an economic crisis, with foreign reserves frozen as the international community decides how to help Afghans but not the Taliban. There are restrictions on cash withdrawals and long queues at banks. Second-hand markets have sprung up in cities across the country, with desperate Afghans trying to sell their possessions just to be able to afford enough to eat. \nOne woman, Shagufta, is sat on the roadside, rifling through the clothes she's brought to sell. \"Life has become an insult now, we are dying slowly,\" she tells us tearfully. She's weak because she didn't have any food for breakfast, or for dinner the night before. \"Everything I had I gave to my children,\" she says, \"now I am selling their finest clothes, what they used to wear to weddings \u2026 If I get a good price I will buy oil, rice and flour.\" \nHer story epitomises the deep-rooted inequalities in the country. Her husband retired from the police six years ago, but barely ever received his pension under the previous government. The family was just about able to cope as Shagufta worked washing and stitching clothes in her neighbourhood. With increased financial pressure though, even that work dried up. \"The Islamic Emirate is good, there's no theft or crime anymore,\" she says. \"We just have one problem, there's no work and no money.\" \nThe second-hand market in Mazar-i-Sharif is teeming. Many of those we meet are government employees. Most public sector workers haven't received their salaries for at least two months now. The problem began under the previous government, but now they have no idea when or if they will be paid again. \nOne teacher has already sold everything she can. \"I became a shopkeeper in my own house and sold all my belongings \u2026 Whatever I earned I am using to buy food now. Whenever I come here and see the condition of the people I go home and cry.\" Nonetheless, she says she's still turning up to work every day. \nAcross the road is Mazar-i-Sharif's main hospital. It's now run by a Taliban official, but his deputy is continuing in the same position he held under the previous government. Staff haven't been paid since the Taliban takeover, with uncertainty over how the ministry of health will be funded, while the current reserve stock of medicine will only last for another month.\nThe transition of power in Afghanistan ended up being much less violent and bloody than many had feared, but around half the country were already in dire need, and for many now the struggle to survive is getting even harder. \nBack in Kabul, we meet a former policeman trying to make ends meet. \"It makes no difference to me who's in the government,\" he says. \nHe is now selling Taliban flags by the side of the road.\n\"There's no work around,\" he says. \"What else can I do?\" \nAdditional reporting by Malik Mudasir and Shams Ahmadzai."

      "text": "Meat processors are in talks with the government over a shortage of carbon dioxide that could hit meat production.\nPoultry producers said the shortage \"threatens national food security\".\nThe gas is used to stun pigs and chickens prior to slaughtering, and also in the packaging process.\nThe carbon dioxide used by the meat industry is a by-product of fertiliser production, but fertiliser factories have been halting production due to soaring natural gas prices.\nThe government said it was monitoring the situation \"closely\".\nIt has been holding emergency talks with industry groups and meat processors, as first reported by the Financial Times.\nFertiliser producers have been struggling with natural gas prices that are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis.\nIn the UK, lower winds have meant less renewable energy is generated, there have been outages at some nuclear stations, and there have been lower flows into the UK of natural gas from Norway, pushing up the price of natural gas.\nThis week, two large UK fertiliser factories owned by US firm CF Industries Holdings suspended operations due to soaring gas prices, and on Friday Norwegian firm Yara said it would also cut production at a number of its European plants.\nNick Allen, the chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), attended emergency talks with the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) on Friday to discuss the issue.\n\"This crisis highlights the fact that the British food supply chain is at the mercy of a small number of major fertiliser producers - four or five companies - spread across northern Europe. We rely on a by-product from their production process to keep Britain's food chain moving,\" Mr Allen said.\nAbout 20 million birds per week are slaughtered, but abattoirs only hold a limited stock of carbon dioxide, British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths said.\n\"With fewer than 100 days to go until Christmas, and already facing mounting labour shortages, the last thing British poultry production needs is more pressure.\n\"If CO2 supplies become tighter and more unpredictable then supply chains will have to slow down. Ultimately, no CO2 means no throughput.\"\nHe said the industry group's members \"are on a knife-edge situation at the moment\".\nMeat processors are working with government to \"mitigate any major impact on a sustainable supply of food\", he added.\n\"This is incredibly serious,\" one supermarket executive told the BBC. \"Some suppliers are telling us they could run out of CO2 in less than two weeks.\"\nIndustry groups and processors also had a meeting with the government on Thursday.\nMeat processors have already been struggling with a shortage of lorry drivers and recruitment problems at abattoirs exacerbated by EU nationals leaving the UK after Brexit.\nCarbon dioxide is used when slaughtering pigs and chickens to stun them, and it is used during the packaging process for all meat to prolong shelf life.\nIt is widely used throughout the food industry, including in brewing.\nHowever, the closure of the two CF Industries plants has cut 60% of the UK's food-grade carbon dioxide supply, the BMPA spokesperson said.\nIt unclear how much carbon dioxide abattoirs and other food factories have stored.\nThe remaining UK carbon dioxide production is being prioritised for the NHS for medical uses, and for the nuclear industry, which uses it as a coolant.\nWithout carbon dioxide, the slaughtering process of pigs and chickens cannot go ahead, the spokesperson said.\nThe Cucumber Growers Association also warned of the effect of high natural gas prices on crops.\nGas is used to heat greenhouses and provide carbon dioxide \"which are both critical factors in growing and achieving the yields required to survive in the modern industry\", it said in an open letter.\nThe \"extreme rise\" in wholesale gas prices has piled costs on growers, it added.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are monitoring this situation closely and are in regular contact with the food and farming organisations and industry, to help them manage the current situation.\""

      "text": "The international travel traffic light system is being simplified in England with a single red list, as part of an overhaul of the rules from 4 October.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps also said eight countries would be taken off the red list from Wednesday.\nIt means people returning from places such as Turkey will no longer have to stay in hotel quarantine.\nAnd PCR tests will no longer be required for fully vaccinated travellers returning to England.\nUnder the new testing regime, people who have had both jabs will not need to take a pre-departure test before leaving any country not on the red list.\nAnd Mr Shapps said later in October, they would be able to replace the day two PCR test with a cheaper, rapid lateral flow test.\nWhile travel is a devolved matter, the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish governments have often followed the UK government's rules during the pandemic. \nWales said it would follow England in removing Turkey, Pakistan, the Maldives, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Oman, Bangladesh and Kenya from the red list. It would \"carefully consider\" the proposed changes on testing but said they are \"not without risk\".\nScotland said it would simplify its traffic light system but ruled out removing the requirement for PCR tests, due to \"significant concerns at the impact on public health\".\nThe transport secretary said the new travel rules would remain in place \"at least until the new year\".\n\"The purpose is to make it easier to travel without the bureaucracy, without so many tests, and with a greater level of certainty now that we've got so many people vaccinated,\" he said.\nThe travel industry said the announcement was a step towards helping tourism recover.\nAirlines UK said it was a \"shot in the arm\" that \"moves us much closer to the reopening of UK aviation\".\nStewart Wingate, chief executive of Gatwick Airport, said customers can \"book with more confidence in the months before Christmas and beyond\" and said there was \"significant pent-up demand for travel\".\nBut he said the remaining constraints on travel, such as the need to fill out a passenger locator form, should also be removed.\nBritish Airways' chief executive and chairman, Sean Doyle, said fewer than 1% of travellers from low-risk countries tested positive and all testing for fully vaccinated travellers should be scrapped \"in line with most other European countries\".\nHuw Merriman, the Conservative chairman of the Commons Transport Committee, said the changes could have an immediate positive impact on the UK's travel industry, coming before the October half-term break for schools.\nHe said the changes addressed the committee's criticism of \"confusing watchlists and quarantines\", the delay in \"reaping the benefit\" of vaccination levels, and the high costs of PCR tests.\nby Jim Reed, BBC health reporter\nOver the summer, scientists advising the government said that the biggest threat to our health security was a coronavirus variant that could spread faster or was resistant to our current vaccines. \nWe've been bitten by this before. In April the first cases of the Delta variant were spotted in travellers from India. \nIt started spreading quickly and, by June, it had taken over as the dominant form of the virus in the UK. Later studies suggested it was more contagious and more likely to put those infected in hospital.\nDetecting new variants was a key reason why all vaccinated travellers had been told to pay for a private PCR test two days after they arrived back home. We were told that those expensive lab tests were needed to genetically sequence the sample and find out if the next potentially more dangerous variant had arrived.\nBut critics said that, in reality, the proportion of samples that could be analysed in this way was very low - partly because a certain level of virus was needed for the test to work properly. \nThe latest figures suggest that between August 12 and September 1 only around 25% of positive cases in travellers arriving in the UK were successfully sequenced. \nUnder the new plans, fully vaccinated travellers will instead be able to pay for a cheaper, but less sensitive, lateral flow test which can be taken quickly at home.\nLFTs cannot be sequenced so anyone who tests positive will be asked to take a second follow up PCR lab test, which will be paid for by the NHS.\nBut there is a worry that without regular, automatic PCR testing of all samples, more variants could slip through the net and weaken our defences against coronavirus in the future."

      "text": "Police have condemned \"outbreaks of racist and sectarian singing\" by some of those attending Orange Order processions in Glasgow.\nIt said the behaviour was \"utterly unacceptable\" and a number of arrests had been made in connection with various offences. \nThe Orange Order has said there had been parades in Glasgow for 200 years with \"very, very little trouble\". \nIt insisted the group was not anti-Catholic.\nThousands of people attended the marches through the city, which were rescheduled from 12 July due to the Covid rules. \nPolice Scotland said 800 officers had been called in to police the marches. \nChief Superintendent Mark Sutherland said: \"We are aware that on a number of occasions there have been outbreaks of racist and sectarian singing by some of those attending to support the Orange Order processions, this is utterly unacceptable and we completely condemn this behaviour.\"\nHe said action would be taken \"against those intent on causing harm and dividing our communities\" where possible, and that arrests had been made. \nFollow-up investigations would be launched as necessary, he added. \nCh Supt Sutherland continued: \"Once again, we see a number of people intent in causing offence and stirring up hatred by singing unacceptable sectarian and racist songs. \n\"It is clear that sectarianism remains a serious, ongoing problem in Scotland.\" \nOver the course of the day the parades passed three Catholic churches, where vigils were held by campaigners who said the walks were anti-Catholic. \nRonnie Convery, of the Archdiocese of Glasgow, earlier told the BBC that the Catholic Church acknowledged people had a legal right to march through the city.  However, he asked that the parades were timed and go on a route that avoided causing \"fear and alarm\" in the Catholic community. \nGlasgow City Council has the power to alter a parade's route or timing but has opted not to do so. A spokesman for the council said the parades would be \"more disruptive to the life of the city\" if they took an alternative route. \nJim McHarg, Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, said his organisation had \"every right\" to process through the streets. \n\"As an organisation, we have always respected other's points of views and opinions. \n\"Our organisation is based on the motto of civil and religious liberty for all people - and that includes us.\"\nHe said the council told the Orange Order to parade on main streets, and Catholic churches were built on main streets so it was inevitable that parades would have to pass some churches. \n\"We do not go there to cause any offence whatsoever. It's most certainly not deliberate - we are not out to offend anyone.\" \nJeanette Findlay, from the Call It Out campaign, which opposes anti-Irish and anti-Catholic bigotry, said the marches \"absolutely should be rerouted\" by the council so they did not pass Catholic churches.\nShe pointed out that it had the powers and had exercised them in the past.\nMs Findlay said this would \"balance the rights of the community\", and said she was \"very happy\" for the Orange Order to march, and she would defend their right to, adding \"All that we're asking is that they don't march past Catholic churches\". \nGlasgow City Council said 32 roads in the city were closed off for the processions. \nThe Church of Scotland said it condemned anti-Catholic bigotry and sectarianism.\nIt added: \"Over the years we have worked together [with the Roman Catholic Church] to tackle sectarianism and support one another.\n\"We speak to leaders in the Roman Catholic Church every week and greatly appreciate the friendship that exists between our churches and our communities.\"\nThere have been a number of high-profile incidents around parades by Protestant Loyal Orders and Irish Republican demonstrations in Glasgow in recent years. \nRecent incidents linked to the marches include an attack on a Catholic priest by a follower of an Orange parade in 2018. \nViolent protests at a Republican march in 2019 led to a number of parades being cancelled by Glasgow City Council.\nLast summer's parades did not go ahead as a result of the Covid pandemic. \nThere have also been outbreaks of violence at some events related to football. \nA number of people were assaulted in May after thousands of Rangers fans took to the streets of Glasgow - despite the Covid restrictions - when the club won the Scottish Premiership. \nThe first minister criticised the \"sectarian\" scenes as \"utterly unacceptable\", saying that \"vile anti-Catholic prejudice\" was on display.  \nEarlier this month, a number fans were charged after footage emerged online of fans singing a sectarian song ahead of an Old Firm game."

      "text": "The government is holding urgent talks with representatives from the energy industry amid growing concern about a spike in wholesale gas prices.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is talking to suppliers to hear how wide-reaching the impact of surging prices could be on companies and households.\nHigh global demand, maintenance issues at some gas sites and lower solar and wind output are blamed for the rise.\nThe high prices have already led two large fertiliser plants to close.\nThis has resulted in a cut in the supply of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a by-product of fertiliser production - to the food industry and other manufacturers.\nGovernment sources have said there is no threat to gas supplies and the impacts on small energy companies that might be the most exposed are being monitored.\nBut the BBC has been told that officials are looking at whether products that could end up being in short supply, such as fertiliser, could be imported from abroad. \nMeanwhile, the British Soft Drinks Association said some producers are facing a shortage but have plans in place to help maintain their businesses. \nNatural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis.\nIn the UK, lower winds have meant less renewable energy is generated. There have also been outages at some nuclear stations and lower flows into the UK of natural gas from Norway, pushing up the price of natural gas.\nIndustry group Oil & Gas UK said wholesale prices for gas are up 250% since January - with a 70% rise since August.\nThe Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) reported that in 2020, 60% of the UK's natural gas supply was imported.\nMr Kwarteng is talking to chief executives from gas producers, the National Grid, suppliers including Scottish Power, EON and EDF, and the regulator Ofgem.\nThe business secretary said energy security was \"an absolute priority\".\nThe Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said on its website: \"While we are not complacent, we do not expect supply emergencies this winter.\"\nDermot Nolan, director at Fingleton Strategic Consultancy and former chief executive of Ofgem, told the BBC gas prices have increased not just in Britain but all over the world, with \"Germany and Spain experiencing similar types of increases\". \nHe said \"high gas and high electricity prices will be sustained for the next three to four months\", adding that it was difficult to see what the government could do about it.\nShadow business secretary Ed Miliband said the government must \"ensure security of supply and take the long-term action to put in place a much more robust, resilient and diverse energy infrastructure\".\nHe said: \"It is a fundamental failure of long-term government planning over the last decade that we are so exposed and vulnerable as a country and it is businesses and consumers that are paying the price.\"\nUK consumers are already facing a big hike in bills this winter as higher wholesale prices have led to a recalculation of the energy price cap, but perhaps the more immediate threat is a shortage of carbon dioxide used in the food industry. \nThe energy-intensive fertiliser industry has seen two huge plants in Teesside closed down as the gas price has made them uneconomic - which has caused knock-on shortages of CO2 - a by-product of fertilisation production. \nCO2 is used to stun animals before slaughter, as a coolant agent in transport and as a shelf life extending agent in food packaging. \nNick Allen from the British Meat Processors Association described it as a 'black swan event' - meaning a rare but potentially destructive set of circumstances. \nHe said supply already stretched from shortages of labour in abattoirs and shortages of HGV drivers may break with this additional stress. \nMeanwhile, Richard Griffiths, CEO of the British Poultry Council, has said the current situation felt more serious than previous CO2 shortages and that ministers would need to act quickly to ensure the government delivers on its promise to 'save Christmas'.\nMeat processors are also in talks with the government over shortages of carbon dioxide because of its use in meat production. The government source said CO2 supplies for nuclear power and hospitals would be prioritised. \nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said this \"could not come at a worse time\".\nHe wants government to work with industry to find a solution quickly so problems \"don't escalate further\".\nThe government pointed out that the energy price cap will limit the impact on household bills, although that cap is due to rise next month. \nA spokesperson said: \"The UK benefits from having access to highly diverse sources of gas supply to ensure households, businesses and heavy industry get the energy they need at a fair price.\n\"We are monitoring this situation closely and are in regular contact with the food and farming organisations and industry, to help them manage the current situation.\"\nAdditional reporting by Alex Therrien."

      "tags": "NHS",
      "text": "The UK's \"most vulnerable\" hospital patients, who are unable to build up an antibody response to Covid, will be offered new drug Ronapreve from Monday. \nThe new Covid treatment, approved just last month, uses a pair of laboratory-made antibodies to attack the virus.\nIt was famously used as part of the suite of experimental medicines given to US President Donald Trump last year. \nThe antibody cocktail has been shown to reduce hospital stays by four days and cut the risk of death by a fifth.\nThe government said it had secured sufficient supply of the new therapeutic for eligible NHS patients across the four nations to cover the forthcoming winter.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said he was \"thrilled it will be saving lives from as early as next week\".\n\"The UK is leading the world in identifying and rolling out life-saving medicines, particularly for Covid 19, and we will continue our vital work to find the best treatments available to save lives and protect the NHS,\" he said.\nThe new treatment is expensive and priority will be given to those patients at greatest risk of becoming severely ill. \nIt will be offered to those over-50 without the necessary antibodies, and those aged 12-49 who are immuno-compromised - for example those with certain cancers - who struggle to mount an antibody response, either through being exposed to Covid, or from vaccination.\nThe government said guidance would be sent to clinicians imminently so they can begin prescribing the treatment as soon as possible.\nOf those eligible patients, antibody testing will initially be used to determine whether they are seronegative - meaning those who do not have an adequate existing antibody response - and will therefore be eligible for treatment. \nThe treatment antibodies - casirivimab and imdevimab - will then be administered to patients through a drip. The drug works by binding to the virus' spike protein, stopping it from being able to infect the body's cells.\nThe antibody therapy attacks the virus, unlike other Covid treatments such as the steroid dexamethasone that calm the body's overactive immune system. \nThere had been concern the idea was a dud after trials failed when antibodies were taken from patients who had recovered from Covid.\nHowever, the companies Regeneron and Roche tested monoclonal antibodies in the laboratory to find the two that were best able to stick to the virus. \nThis has proved far more effective, and the therapy continues to work against new variants. \n\"Ronapreve is the first dedicated medicine developed for Covid 19 to receive marketing authorisation from the MHRA, representing a significant milestone in how the NHS is able to fight this disease,\" said Paul McManus, Covid 19 lead at Roche Products Ltd.\n\"We're grateful for the collaboration of the vaccine taskforce and NHS England in helping to bring this important antibody cocktail to treat and prevent acute Covid 19 across the UK.\""

      "title": "Afghanistan: A new order begins under the Taliban's governance",
      "tags": "Kabul,War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "The phrases have tripped off the tongues of Taliban for quite some time.  \n\"We're working to establish an inclusive government that represents all the people of Afghanistan,\" promised Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar when he recently arrived in Kabul to start talks aimed at forming a leadership to move the movement from guns to government.  \n\"We would like to live peacefully,\" vowed Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid at the first press conference in the capital after the Taliban suddenly swept into power on 15 August. \"We don't want any internal enemies and any external enemies.\" \nJudge them by their actions, not their words, has become the mantra of a fast-expanding league of Taliban watchers including Afghans, foreign governments, humanitarian chiefs and political pundits the world over. \nBut Afghans are watching most closely of all. They have to.  \nOn a day when brave protesters with bold banners spilled into the streets of Kabul and other cities - Afghan women leading the charge to demand their rights, their representation, their roles in society - the new Taliban government was unveiled.   \nWas this more evidence of the media-savvy Taliban? It temporarily knocked news of Taliban firing guns in the air, wielding rifle butts and sticks to disperse protesters, out of the world's headlines.  \nBut it was a modest ceremony, in the mundane setting of a press conference, for such a momentous, much-anticipated message. It electrified social media, and delivered a gut punch to those who had held fast to Taliban promises.  \nFar from being inclusive, it is exclusively Taliban. The old organigram of the Taliban movement, with its commissions, deputies, and the all-powerful Emir Hibatullah Akhundzada, has been transplanted into a cabinet with the same political architecture of governments everywhere. \nIts makeup is overwhelmingly drawn from Pashtun tribes, with only one Tajik and one Uzbek, both Talibs. There's not a single woman, not even in deputy minister positions. \nThe reviled Ministry of Vice and Virtue is back; the Women's Affairs Ministry is out. \nIt's a government of the old guard, and the new generation of mullahs and military commanders: men in charge when the Taliban ruled in the 1990s who return, beards much lighter and longer; former Guantanamo Bay prisoners; current members of US and UN black lists; battle-hardened fighters who pressed forward on every front in recent months; self-styled peacemakers who sat around negotiating tables, and shuttled around regional capitals with promises of a new Taliban 2.0.  \nSome names stick out - some so far they can seem provocative. \nThe caretaker head of cabinet is the white-bearded Mullah Hasan Akhund, a founding member of the Taliban who's on the UN's sanctions list. \nThe caretaker Minister of the Interior is Sirajuddin Haqqani. His face has rarely been seen except in a photograph, partially obscured by a caramel-coloured shawl, in a FBI wanted poster announcing a big bounty of $5m that's also on his head. His more recent claim to fame was an op-ed in the New York Times in 2020 calling for peace which failed to mention that the Haqqani Network named after his family is held responsible for some of the worst attacks on Afghan civilians. The Haqqanis insist there's no such network; they say they're part of the Taliban now.  \nThe caretaker Minister of Defence, Mullah Yaqoob, represented by a black silhouette, is the eldest son of the founding Emir of the Taliban, Mullah Omar. \nBut, wait, this is just a caretaker cabinet.  \nAt the press conference in Kabul, as a raucous chorus of questions rose from journalists in the room, it was said more posts might be announced in time. \"We haven't announced all the ministries and deputies yet so it's possible this list could be extended,\" Ahmadullah Wasiq, deputy head of the cultural commission, told my colleague Secunder Kermani.  \nThis may be the opening political salvo to reward and reassure their rank and file fighters, many of whom have been streaming into Kabul, to welcome the return of a \"pure Islamic system\".   \nIt also appears as a carefully constructed compromise. Mullah Akhund suddenly emerged at the top, fixing in place rival political and military heavyweights including Mullah Baradar whom many predicted would take a leading role, instead of a deputy position.  \nTaliban leaders are said to have pushed back against calls to include political leaders from the past, especially those tainted by corruption, arguing they've already had their time at the top.  \nA phrase still rings in my ears from Taliban negotiator Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, who's now been appointed as deputy foreign minister, the same role he held the last time round. \nWhen I asked him in February 2020, after the signing of the landmark US-Taliban deal, what he would say to Afghans who feared their return, he replied with great gusto: \"I tell them we will have a government acceptable to the majority.\" The word majority was punctuated by a loud emphasis. \nIn other words, a government dominated by traditional values, not what they mock as Western ideas.  \nThose were heady days when Afghans dared to hope the worst of the war was over. Later that year, on the first day of formal Afghan talks in the Gulf state of Qatar, a buzz shot through the room when the Taliban hinted they would no longer be demanding an Islamic Emirate; they said they understood its sensitivity.  \nIn talks with female negotiators, they reassured them women could play every role except president, including government ministers.  \nThat was then. This is now. The Taliban are in charge.\n\"Those who do not pay attention to the social fabric of Afghanistan will face serious challenges,\" warns negotiator and former MP Fawzia Koofi, who heard many of those promises.  \nThat challenge is already crystallising in protests on the streets, in statements from capitals around the world.  \n\"The world is watching closely,\" warned a statement from the US State Department. \"Little chance of international recognition of Taliban soon,\" declared an editorial in Russia's Nezavisimaya Gazeta. \nAnd a challenge may even rise from within a younger generation of Taliban.  \n\"We must pay attention to the lessons of history,\" a young Talib recently reflected to me. He emphasised that if the Taliban tried to dominate again, they could be toppled again, as they were in 2001, as the last government just was. Another expressed unease that mullahs schooled only in religious matters were being given so many posts. \nIn a statement issued soon after the caretaker cabinet was announced, the Emir noted that \"all talented and professional people\" were desperately needed for their \"talents, guidance, and work.\"   \nBut in all his exhortations, it was also clear the bottom line was about strengthening \"the system,\" the re-established Islamic Emirate. This takes precedence above all else.  \nIn recent days in Kabul, I've asked Taliban watchers of various ilk if they thought the leadership would harden over time, or open up.  \nPowerful winds could tilt them in many directions. \nThe world's major aid agencies, who provided around 80% of the old government's budget, are watching closely.\n\"They're in very, very dire straits,\" the UN's humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths told me as he ended a visit where he emphasised the centrality of humanitarian principles and values, including the inclusion of women and girls. Senior officials, he remarked, asked him for patience and advice.  \nAfghanistan's new leaders are also under the microscope of jihadi movements worldwide who've enthusiastically welcomed a new land of Islamic governance compliant with Islamic Sharia law.  \nAfghanistan is, to use the expression, \"too big to fail\". Warnings about a safe haven for extremist groups, worries about human rights and a deepening humanitarian crisis of hunger and hardship, will concentrate many minds on trying to find a way to work with leaders still finding their way, still rooted in their past, rather than, as yet, a different kind of future.  \nBut that mantra will stick - actions, not words, matter most. \nIn the UK you can listen to Lyse Doucet's podcast, A Wish for Afghanistan, on BBC Sounds ."

      "tags": "Down's syndrome,Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "UK researchers have developed a calculator to identify those at highest risk of severe illness from Covid despite having one or two vaccines. \nThey say jabs provide protection against serious illness and death for most people, but for some the risks - while much lowered by jabs - remain.\nThis includes older people, people with Down's Syndrome, and those with weakened immune systems.\nThe risks are highest for those who have not been fully vaccinated. \nWriting in the BMJ, scientists say those at risk should ensure they have both jabs. \nThey suggest their risk calculator could be used to help spot fully vaccinated individuals who may additionally benefit from boosters or early treatment - including newer therapies such as monoclonal antibodies.\nThe research team - which includes scientists from the universities of Edinburgh, Oxford and Nottingham -  examined hospital records involving some five million people in England who had had two jabs and about two million who had had one. \nThere were about 2,000 deaths linked to Covid and almost the same number of Covid hospital admissions - most occurred 14 or more days after the first vaccine (when substantial immunity is expected to have developed). \nJust 81 deaths and 71 admissions happened 14 or more days after the second vaccine dose.\nFrom this data, the groups most at risk of severe illness or death, included:\nResearchers say while overall the risks would be lower for people who have had two jabs, they would expect the general pattern to remain in terms of the groups identified to be at higher risk.\nBut they say because there were relatively few Covid-related hospital admissions and deaths in people who had two jabs it was harder to build up a precise picture. \nAnd they say certain risks - such as people who do high-risk jobs - could not be taken into account. \nProf Julia Hippisley-Cox, from the University of Oxford, said: \"Individual risk will always depend on individual choices as well as the current prevalence of the disease. However we hope that this new tool will help shared decision making and more personalised risk assessment.\"\nThe risk calculator is available online for academic use and there are plans to make a version that will be available to the public. \nAn earlier version of the risk calculator helped spot people who would benefit from shielding in England.

      "text": "Holiday bookings have surged since the government announced foreign travel rules were being simplified in England.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the travel traffic light system was being replaced with a single red list.\nAnd fully vaccinated people will no longer need a pre-departure test before returning from non-red list areas.\nTravel firms said they had already seen an uptick in bookings and expected a busy weekend.\nAs part of the changes announced by Mr Shapps on Friday, eight countries - Turkey, Pakistan, the Maldives, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Oman, Bangladesh and Kenya - are being removed from the red list from Wednesday. \nIt means people returning from these destinations will no longer have to stay in hotel quarantine. \nMr Shapps also announced that from October travellers returning to England will no longer have to take a PCR test two days after arrival. Instead, they can take the quicker and cheaper lateral flow tests.\nHuw Merriman, chairman of the Commons transport select committee and who previously criticised PCR tests for being too expensive, welcomed the rule change.\nThe Conservative MP told BBC Breakfast it would make foreign travel simpler, more cost-effective and reflected the UK's high vaccination rate.\nHe also said it would be \"interesting\" to see if there would be some form of registration requirement for lateral flow tests.\nTravel bosses welcomed the changes and reported an increase in holiday bookings since the announcement.\nSteve Heapy, chief executive of tour operator Jet2, said there had been a \"phenomenal\" consumer reaction since the announcement, with \"huge\" demand for holidays in the next few weeks.\nHe added that destinations across the board were \"selling well\" across late summer, winter and summer 2022 dates, and the firm had seen a \"surge in bookings\" for family holidays during October half-term.\nThomas Cook said October half-term bookings were three times higher than in August and it expected this weekend to be the biggest of the year. \nTui also said it had seen \"an uptick in bookings\" for Turkey for next month, while online travel agency Skyscanner saw a spike in traffic in the 30 minutes following Mr Shapps's announcement.\nChris Parker, director of capacity and passenger performance at DFDS ferries, said the rule changes were \"better late than never\" but it was a \"shame\" that the summer season had been lost.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was a real collapse in bookings this year, at about 20% of 2019 bookings.\nBut following Friday's announcement, there was an \"immediate spike\" in visits to their website and an uptick in bookings for October onwards. \nThe travel rule changes will see families and loved ones reunited.\nSafina Hameed said she was \"over the moon\" Pakistan will be removed from the travel red list, as it means she will be able to hug her daughter for the first time in two years.\nMrs Hameed, who lives in Karachi, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that being separated from her daughter Shahana Minhas and her only grandson was \"horrible\".\nMrs Minhas, who lives in London, said she and her husband had been cautious about Covid and wanted to wait until they and their parents were vaccinated before they considered travelling to see each other.\n\"But then as soon as we got vaccinated and our parents got vaccinated, Pakistan went on the red list so there went any hope of actually being able to see them finally.\"\nSince the announcement, she has been looking at flights to Pakistan.\n\"It's literally been counting the days until we can finally see each other and things can go back to the way that they were,\" she said.\nLabour has raised concerns over how the monitoring for coronavirus variants will continue amid the plans to scrap the PCR test requirements.\nShadow transport secretary Jim McMahon urged ministers to explain how it would continue and whether they planned to increase sequencing of tests.\nThe Scottish government said it would also drop the traffic light system but would not follow England in removing the pre-departure test requirement for fully vaccinated people returning from non-red list countries.\nThe country's Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson, said there were \"concerns\" this would \"weaken our ability to protect the public health of Scotland's communities\".\nScotland will also not copy England in using lateral flow tests on day two at this stage.\nThe decision to diverge from England's rules has been criticised by Edinburgh Airport, which said the move would \"further curtail Scotland's aviation and travel industries in their recovery\".\nThe Welsh government said it would consider the UK government's proposed changes, but health and social services minister Eluned Morgan warned they could \"weaken the line of defence on importing infection and increase opportunities for new infections and new variants to enter the UK and Wales\".\nBoth administrations said they would mirror the changes to the red list destinations.\nNorthern Ireland's executive said it will follow other UK nations in dropping the traffic light system, but the proposed changes on pre-departure and post-arrival testing were still under consideration and would be discussed by ministers next week.\nMr Shapps said the measures were intended to strike the \"right balance\" between simplifying the system while managing the public health risk \"as the number one priority\".\nAirport Operators Association chief executive Karen Dee said the easing of restrictions should encourage more people to travel over the winter, but urged ministers to put support into the industry as furlough ends.\nEasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said it was a \"welcome step forward\" which would make travel to Europe significantly easier although more needed to be done."

The expiry date refers to the barcode and will update automatically. It does not apply to your vaccination status.\nIt's worth noting that in Wales, you cannot get the pass via the NHS app, as this is only valid in England. This is also different to the NHS Covid-19 app which alerts you if you've been close to someone with the virus.\nIf you do not have photographic ID you will need to request a paper NHS Covid certificate.\nCall 0300 303 5667 for a paper copy at least five days after your final dose.\nIt is an offence to deliberately use a fake Covid pass or produce a fake lateral flow test (LFT).\nPeople caught using fake LFTs or a fake Covid pass could be given a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) of \u00a360.\nThis can be reduced to \u00a330 if paid within 14 days, but if it's not a first offence the FPN would double to \u00a3120.\nIf there is any doubt about whether documents are real, the Welsh government said a Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) should be contacted.\nIf venues do not follow the rules, they could receive an improvement or closure notice, FPN or be fined up to \u00a310,000.\nPasses have been freely available for some time and venues could already read it with existing technology.\nBut if they don't have the verifier app, they may judge them by sight.\nFestivals, such as Green Man in the Brecon Beacons, have already been using the system.\nWales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said: \"These measures are examples of what Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] calls low-cost interventions, which may be enough to prevent the need for tougher restrictions later on.\"\nCouncil enforcement teams will work with businesses to check they are following the rules.\nFor those people living close to the border, your GP may actually be in England.\nIn that case you may need to use the NHS App system for England.\nSince 1 October, people in Scotland have needed a Covid vaccination certificate to enter nightclubs, adult entertainment venues and large-scale events.\nThe UK government decided not to go ahead with vaccine passports in England, despite saying they would be introduced at the end of September.\nBut they might be considered again later, if there is a Covid surge over the winter.\nNorthern Ireland has not yet announced whether it will introduce a similar scheme.\nThe rules also apply to those coming to Wales. The idea is that visiting teams will let fans know.\nThere may be some flexibility on checks to avoid long queues outside stadiums. \nBut venues should be ready to work with the police and councils to decide when it is reasonable to relax checks.\nIt renews for 30 days every time you download it.\nThis has been a tricky one that the cabinet has been wrestling with, having met four times to debate the issue.\nThe first minister said they were \"acutely aware\" of the implications for civil liberties and were giving relevant sectors time to prepare before passes were introduced on 11 October.\nHowever, he added people also had rights to live in a society where everyone takes \"reasonable measures\" to keep each other safe.\nThe Welsh government also hopes introducing Covid passes will improve vaccination rates, particularly among younger people.\nJodie Beck, from human rights group Liberty, said: \"While we welcome the decision to not exclude those who have not received the vaccine from attending large events, the introduction of a vaccine pass in Wales still sets a dangerous precedent.\n\"Vaccine passports under any name mean more coercion and division, and risk creating a two-tier society where people who are already marginalised will see their rights and autonomy most affected.\"\nGenerally, no. The Welsh government wanted to avoid excluding those who have not had, or been able to have, a vaccine by including those with a recent negative test.\nHowever, workers, performers and so on, will not require a pass as there are already rules in place for employers to safeguard workers."

      "tags": "Streaming,Netflix,United States",
      "text": "Georgian chess icon Nona Gaprindashvili has filed a defamation lawsuit against Netflix, saying she was incorrectly portrayed in the hit series The Queen's Gambit.\nThe case refers to a sequence in the drama's final episode which says Gaprindashvili, now 80, had never played competitive chess with men.\nThe document says that by 1968, the year in which the episode is set, she had faced at least 59 male players.\nNetflix said the claim had \"no merit\".\nThe company said it had \"only the utmost respect\" for Gaprindashvili and her \"illustrious career\" but that it would \"vigorously defend the case\".\nThe Queen's Gambit is based on the 1983 novel by Walter Tevis and focuses on a fictional chess player called Beth Harmon, played by Anya Taylor-Joy. The series was released last year, becoming what Netflix described as its \"biggest limited scripted series ever\".\nIn the final episode, a commentator mentions Gaprindashvili when describing Harmon: \"The only unusual thing about her, really, is her sex. And even that's not unique in Russia. There's Nona Gaprindashvili, but she's the female world champion and has never faced men.\"\nThe 25-page case filed in the Federal District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday said: \"Netflix brazenly and deliberately lied about Gaprindashvili's achievements for the cheap and cynical purpose of 'heightening the drama' by making it appear that its fictional hero had managed to do what no other woman, including Gaprindashvili, had done.\"\nIt added: \"The allegation that Gaprindashvili 'has never faced men' is manifestly false, as well as being grossly sexist and belittling.\"\nBorn in 1941 in the Georgian town of Zugdidi, Gaprindashvili began playing chess at the age of 13, became female World Championship at 20 and was the first woman to be awarded the title of grandmaster, according to the lawsuit.\n\"By 1968,\" the lawsuit says, Gaprindashvili \"had competed against at least 59 male chess players (28 of them simultaneously in one game), including at least 10 Grandmasters of that time.\"\nGaprindashvili, who lives in Tbilisi and continues to compete in chess tournaments, is seeking $5m (\u00a33.6m) in compensation and the removal of the statement that she had never played against men. The lawsuit says the line had been changed from the book on which the series is based.\nThe Queen's Gambit was viewed in more than 62 million households in the first 28 days after its release, according to Netflix. It won two awards at this year's Golden Globes and has garnered 18 nominations at the Emmy Awards, which will take place this weekend."

      "text": "Despite all the promises to take action, the world is still on course to heat up to dangerous levels.\nThat's the latest blunt assessment of the United Nations. \nIts experts have studied the climate plans of more than 100 countries and concluded that we're heading in the wrong direction. \nScientists recently confirmed that to avoid the worst impacts of hotter conditions, global carbon emissions needed to be cut by 45% by 2030. \nBut this new analysis shows that those emissions are set to rise by 16% during this period.\nThat could eventually lead to a temperature rise of 2.7C (4.9F) above pre-industrial times - far above the limits set by the international community.\n\"The 16% increase is a huge cause for concern,\" according to Patricia Espinosa, the UN's chief climate negotiator.  \n\"It is in sharp contrast with the calls by science for rapid, sustained and large-scale emission reductions to prevent the most severe climate consequences and suffering, especially of the most vulnerable, throughout the world.\"\nIt's a stark warning about the scale of the challenge faced at the COP26 climate conference, scheduled to take place in Glasgow in just over six weeks' time.\nThe central aim of the giant event is to keep alive hopes of limiting the rise in global temperatures by persuading nations to cut their emissions. \nUnder the rules of the Paris Agreement on climate change, countries are meant to update their carbon reduction plans every five years.\nBut the UN says that of 191 countries taking part in the agreement, only 113 have so far come up with improved pledges. \nAlok Sharma, the British minister who will chair the COP26 conference, said nations that had ambitious climate plans were \"already bending the curve of emissions downwards\". \n\"But without action from all countries, especially the biggest economies, these efforts risk being in vain.\" \nA study by Climate Action Tracker found that of the G20 group of leading industrial nations, only a handful including the UK and the US have strengthened their targets to cut emissions.  \nIn another analysis, the World Resources Institute and Climate Analytics highlight how China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - together responsible for 33% of greenhouse gases - have yet to submit updated plans.  \nIt says that Australia and Indonesia have the same carbon reduction targets they did back in 2015 - while the Paris Agreement is meant to involve a \"ratchet mechanism\" of progressively deeper cuts. \nAnd the study finds that Brazil, Mexico and Russia all expect their emissions to grow rather than to shrink. \nFor the poorest countries - most vulnerable to rising sea levels and new extremes of heat and drought - seeing a rapid fall in the gases heating the planet is a priority. \nSonam P Wangdi, chair of the Least Developed Countries group, said: \"G20 countries must take the lead in quickly cutting emissions to mitigate climate change. \n\"These are the countries with the greatest capacity and responsibility, and it's well past time they step up and treat this crisis like a crisis.\"\nThere are hopes that China may revise its climate plans ahead of the Glasgow conference.\nAs the world's largest emitter, it has previously said it aims to peak its emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.\nAn announcement soon of more ambitious targets would give the talks a significant boost but there are no clues about when - or even whether - that might happen.\nFollow David on Twitter."

      "tags": "Long Covid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates about 1.3 million people in the UK have \"long Covid\" - symptoms lasting more than four weeks. \nMost people who catch Covid don't become severely ill and get better relatively quickly. \nBut some have long-term problems after recovering from the original infection - even if they weren't very ill in the first place.\nLong Covid is not fully understood, and there is no internationally-agreed definition - so measures of how common it is or what symptoms are involved vary. \nGuidance for UK health workers describes long Covid as symptoms that continue for more than 12 weeks after an infection which cannot be explained by another cause. \nAccording to the NHS website, these can include:\nBut patient surveys have identified tens and even hundreds of other symptoms. A large study by University College London (UCL) identified 200 symptoms affecting 10 organ systems.  \nThese include hallucinations, insomnia, hearing and vision changes, short-term memory loss and speech and language issues. Others have reported gastro-intestinal and bladder problems, changes to periods and skin conditions.  \nThe severity of symptoms varies, but many have been left unable to perform tasks like showering or remembering words. However these symptoms can have other causes too. \nONS research published in September 2021 found 0.5% of people who tested negative for coronavirus had at least one symptom that lasted for three months, compared to 3% who tested positive. \nThere is currently no standard test, with doctors first ruling out other possible causes for symptoms.\nPeople who are suspected of having it are likely to be tested for other issues first like diabetes, thyroid function and iron deficiency, before being offered a long Covid diagnosis. \nIt is possible that a blood test could become available in the future. \nWe don't yet know for sure.\nIt could be that the initial infection makes some people's immune systems go into overdrive, attacking not just the virus but their own tissues. \nThe virus itself getting into and damaging our cells might explain some symptoms like a loss of smell and taste, while damage to blood vessels could, for example, contribute to heart and lung problems. \nAnother theory suggests that fragments of the virus could remain in the body, possibly lying dormant and then becoming reactivated. \nThis happens with some other viruses, like herpes and the Epstein Barr virus which causes glandular fever. \nHowever, there isn't currently much evidence for this happening with Covid.\nIt's likely there are several different things going on in different people, to cause such a wide range of problems. \nThis is difficult to pin down because doctors only recently started recording long Covid.\nThe latest ONS estimate suggests that about 1.3 million people in the UK have it. Of those, 892,000 (70%) first caught the virus at least 12 weeks ago and 506,000 (40%) at least a year ago.\nThe survey asked nearly 352,000 people to record their own symptoms.\nIt suggests the condition is most common in: \nIn April, the ONS indicated about one in every 10 people with Covid had symptoms lasting at least three months. \nBut in September, it suggested this proportion was one in 40.\nFigures will continue to change as more data is collected, and will vary according to the definitions used. \nChildren are less likely than adults to catch Covid and are therefore less likely to develop long Covid - but some still do. \nHowever, in August 2021 leading experts said they were reassured about the scale of long Covid in young people after the biggest study in the world showed persistent symptoms were less common than feared. \nSome early estimates had suggested as many as half of all children who caught coronavirus would develop long Covid.\nA team of researchers, led by the Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, investigated more than 200,000 positive cases among 11 to 17-year-olds between September 2019 and March 2020.\nThey think that between 4,000 and 32,000 of those were still experiencing symptoms 15 weeks later. \nWe don't have know how severe the symptoms were, but there was little evidence that children were left bedridden or unable to go to school.\nBut the researchers stressed the risk to young people is \"not trivial\", and said it was vital children get the medical support they need. \nSome reports suggest people who have been vaccinated are less likely to have long Covid. \nVaccination can help prevent people contracting the virus and developing long Covid in the first place.\nIt may also prevent infections \"turning into\" long Covid but this is less clear. \nAbout 90 long Covid assessment centres have been set up across England.\nSimilar clinics have opened in Northern Ireland, while in Scotland and Wales patients are referred to different services by their GPs or other health professionals, depending on their symptoms.\nAt the moment there are no proven drug treatments and the main focus is on managing symptoms and gradually increasing activity. \nStudies on how best to spot, treat and improve the lives of people with long Covid are continuing.

      "text": "The US has admitted that a drone strike in Kabul days before its military pullout killed 10 innocent people.\nA US Central Command investigation found that an aid worker and nine members of his family, including seven children, died in the 29 August strike.\nThe youngest child, Sumaya, was just two years old.\nThe deadly strike happened days after a terror attack at Kabul airport, amid a frenzied evacuation effort following the Taliban's sudden return to power.\nIt was one of the US military's final acts in Afghanistan, before ending its 20-year operation in the country.\nUS intelligence had tracked the aid worker's car for eight hours, believing it was linked to IS-K militants - a local branch of the Islamic State (IS) group, US Central Command Gen Kenneth McKenzie said.\nThe investigation found the man's car had been seen at a compound associated with IS-K, and its movements aligned with other intelligence about the terror group's plans for an attack on Kabul airport.\nAt one point, a surveillance drone saw men loading what appeared to be explosives into the boot of the car, but these turned out to be containers of water.\nGen McKenzie described the strike as a \"tragic mistake\", and added that the Taliban had not been involved in the intelligence that led to the strike.\nThe strike happened as the aid worker - named as Zamairi Ahmadi - pulled into the driveway of his home, 3km (1.8 miles) from the airport. \nThe explosion set off a secondary blast, which US officials initially said was proof that the car was indeed carrying explosives. However the investigation has found it was most likely caused by a propane tank in the driveway.\nOne of those killed, Ahmad Naser, had been a translator with US forces. Other victims had previously worked for international organisations and held visas allowing them entry to the US.\nRelatives of the victims told the BBC the day after the strike that they had applied to be evacuated, and had been waiting for a phone call telling them to go to the airport.\nIn a statement, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said: \"We now know that there was no connection between Mr Ahmadi and Isis-Khorasan, that his activities on that day were completely harmless and not at all related to the imminent threat we believed we faced.\n\"We apologise, and we will endeavour to learn from this horrible mistake.\"\nThe horrific consequences of the US military's miscalculation have drawn questions about the accuracy of future counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan with a US presence no longer on the ground. \nThis catastrophe exposed the dreadful human cost of a war that inflicted a lot of damage from the air for years.\nThat it should take place just as the Americans ended their 20-year occupation will cast an even darker stain on the chaotic US exit. \nBut for some in the region, it is a particularly stark example of the ongoing dangers of drone warfare.\nWhen the US started to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, the Taliban managed to seize control of the country within about two weeks in a lightning-fast offensive. \nPresident Ashraf Ghani fled to the United Arab Emirates, and Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, fell on 15 August.\nIt sparked a mass evacuation effort from the US and its allies, as thousands of people tried to flee. Many were foreign nationals or Afghans who had worked for foreign governments.\nThere were scenes of panic and chaos at Kabul airport, and some people fell to their deaths after trying to cling to US military planes as they took off.\nThe security situation was further heightened after a suicide bomber killed up to 170 civilians and 13 US troops outside the airport on 26 August. IS-K said it had carried out the attack.\nMany of those killed had been hoping to board evacuation flights leaving the city.\nThe last US soldier left Afghanistan on 31 August - the deadline President Joe Biden had set for the US withdrawal. \nMore than 124,000 foreigners and Afghans were flown out of the country beforehand. But some people were unable to get out in time, and evacuation efforts are ongoing."

Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "The Taliban say they will rule Afghanistan according to Sharia, or Islamic law.\nThe militant Islamist group have taken control after the departure of US and allied forces from the country.\nIn the first press briefing after taking power, a Taliban spokesman said issues such as the media and women's rights would be respected \"within the framework of Islamic law\", but the group has not yet provided any details of what that will mean in practice.\nThe Taliban have been known for their strict interpretation of Sharia, including punishments such as public executions of convicted murderers and adulterers.\nSharia is Islam's legal system. \nIt is derived from the Quran, Islam's holy book, as well as the Sunnah and Hadith - the deeds and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. \nWhere an answer cannot be derived directly from these, religious scholars may give rulings as guidance on a particular topic or question.\nIn Arabic, Sharia literally means \"the clear, well-trodden path to water\".\nSharia acts as a code for living that all Muslims should adhere to, including prayers, fasting and donations to the poor.\nIt aims to help Muslims understand how they should lead every aspect of their lives according to God's wishes.\nSharia can inform every aspect of daily life for a Muslim. \nFor example, a Muslim wondering what to do if their colleagues invite them to the pub after work may turn to a Sharia scholar for advice to ensure they act within the legal framework of their religion.\nOther areas of daily life where Muslims may turn to Sharia for guidance include family law, finance and business. \nLike any legal system, Sharia is complex and its practice is entirely reliant on the quality and training of experts.\nIslamic jurists issue guidance and rulings. Guidance that is considered a formal legal ruling is called a fatwa.\nThere are five different schools of Islamic law. There are four Sunni schools: Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanafi, and one Shia school, Jaafari.\nThe five schools differ in how literally they interpret the texts from which Sharia law is derived.\nInterpretation of Islamic law is also nuanced according to local culture and customs, which means Sharia may look quite different in different places.\nIslamic scholars says Sharia is mainly a code of ethical conduct and about worship and charity but a part of it deals with crime. \nSharia law divides offences into two general categories: \"hadd\" offences, which are serious crimes with set penalties, and \"tazir\" crimes, where the punishment is left to the discretion of the judge.\nHadd offences include theft, which under the strictest interpretations of Sharia, can be punishable by amputating the offender's hand. \nThere are many safeguards and a high burden of proof in the application of hadd penalties. But experts say that often doesn't happen in practice.\nSome countries where Islamic law is applied adopt or enforce such punishments for hadd offences, and surveys have suggested attitudes of Muslims to harsh penalties for such offences vary widely."

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "text": "Pensioners who have just turned 66 have spoken of their stress and anger after failing to be paid their state pension.\nBacklogs in processing applications at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) mean thousands of people have not received their entitlement on time.\nOne told the BBC she \"wanted to cry\" and \"felt like she didn't count\" after her payments were not made.\nThe department has apologised, blaming the pandemic and staffing issues for the delays.\nOver the course of the summer, thousands of people reaching the state pension age of 66 have applied for their state pension, but have not received any money.\nThey include Christine Shawcroft, who turned 66 in the middle of July, and - like many others - has made numerous calls to the DWP, spending at least 45 minutes on hold before getting through.\n\"I'm pretty disgusted and, to be honest, I am beginning to lose patience,\" she said. \"I have failed to get a reasonable answer as to why I am still waiting.\n\"I understand there is Covid, but I'm sure it is not responsible for everything.\"\nRecently retired probation service receptionist Linda Higgins echoes that view - saying there have been \"a lot of Covid excuses\".\nShe, too, has yet to be paid any of her state pension after turning 66 in July. She said her personal pension was not enough to live on. \n\"I've not received a penny. It makes me stressed and scared that I'm not going to get it,\" she said. \"I paid my taxes for 45 years so it is just not fair,\"\nConcerns have been raised that some of those affected face a significant gap between receiving any working income, or working-age benefits, which have already stopped, and their state pension.\nGrandmother-of-three Maria Bellamy said she was enduring weeks of delays for her new state pension. As a cleaner, she had not been able to build up any significant savings and was relying on her husband's pension.\n\"They say I am a priority, but nothing happens. I feel very down about it as it makes me feel like it is my own fault,\" she said. \"I have always worked and been independent with money.\n\"Now sometimes I want to cry. We are good citizens, made to feel that you don't count. We put people into government who are supposed to look after us.\"\nFormer pensions minister Ros Altmann, who sits in the House of Lords, said that many thousands of people reach state pension age every year, and that there was \"clearly a major problem with administration\" at the DWP.\nShe said it would not be a surprise if the department had been stretched by the increase in claims for universal credit caused by the pandemic, but that the whole system should be more automated.\nPensions Minister Guy Opperman told MPs that hundreds of department staff were being redeployed to deal with the backlog in state pension payments.\nA DWP spokesman said: \"We are sorry that some new state pension customers have faced delays receiving payment.\n\"All those affected have been identified and we have deployed extra resources to process these as a priority. Any claims made today should not be subject to delay.\"\nThose without their money should be paid automatically, and Mr Opperman said that the system would be back to normal by the end of October.\nThe DWP is already facing criticism and a heavy workload after it emerged that an estimated 200,000 female pensioners are collectively owed up to \u00a32.7bn after the under-payment of state pensions owing to historic errors at the department."

      "text": "The Taliban have excluded girls from Afghan secondary schools, with only boys and male teachers allowed back into classrooms.\nSchoolgirls told the BBC they were devastated not to be returning. \"Everything looks very dark,\" one said.\nTaliban officials who seized power last month said they were working to reach a decision on the matter.\nMany fear a return of the regime of the 1990s when the Taliban severely restricted girls' and women's rights. \nUnder their new government, Taliban officials have said that women will be allowed to study and work in accordance with the group's interpretation of Islamic religious law.\nBut working women have been told to stay at home until the security situation improves, and Taliban fighters have beaten women protesting against the all-male interim government.\nOn Friday, the Islamist group appeared to have shut down the women affairs ministry and replaced it with a department that once enforced strict religious doctrines.\nA statement issued ahead of Afghan schools reopening on Saturday said: \"All male teachers and students should attend their educational institutions.\" \nSecondary schools are usually for students aged between 13 and 18, and most are segregated. \nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid was later quoted by Afghanistan's Bakhtar News Agency as saying that girls' schools would open soon. He said officials were currently working on the \"procedure\" for this, and details including the division of teachers.\nThe spokesman told the BBC that officials were also trying to sort out transport for older schoolgirls. \nSchoolgirls and their parents on Saturday said prospects were bleak. \n\"I am so worried about my future,\" said one Afghan schoolgirl, who had hoped to be a lawyer.  \n\"Everything looks very dark. Every day I wake up and ask myself why I am alive? Should I stay at home and wait for someone to knock on the door and ask me to marry him? Is this the purpose of being a woman?\"\nHer father said: \"My mother was illiterate, and my father constantly bullied her and called her an idiot. I didn't want my daughter to become like my mum.\"\nAnother schoolgirl, a 16-year-old from Kabul, said it was a \"sorrowful day\".\n\"I wanted to become a doctor! And that dream has vanished. I don't think they would let us go back to school. Even if they open the high schools again, they don't want women to become educated.\"\nEarlier this week, the Taliban announced that women would be allowed to study at universities, but they would not be able to do so alongside men and would face a new dress code. \nSome suggested the new rules would exclude women from education because the universities do not have the resources to provide separate classes.\nBarring girls from secondary schools would mean none would be able to go on to further education. \nSince the Taliban were removed from power in 2001, enormous progress has been made in improving Afghanistan's education enrolments and literacy rates - especially for girls and women.\nThe number of girls in primary schools increased from almost zero to 2.5 million, while the female literacy rate nearly doubled in a decade to 30%. However, many of the gains have been made in cities. \n\"This is a setback in the education of Afghan women and girls,\" said Nororya Nizhat, a former Education Ministry spokesperson. \n\"This reminds everyone of what the Taliban did in the 90s. We ended up with a generation of illiterate and non-educated women.\"\nShortly after taking power the Taliban said the rights of women in Afghanistan would be respected \"within the framework of Islamic law\".

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "France,China,Submarines,Nuclear submarines,United States,Australia",
      "text": "France has said it is recalling its ambassadors in the US and Australia for consultations, in protest at a security deal which also includes the UK. \nThe French foreign minister said the \"exceptional decision\" was justified by the situation's \"exceptional gravity\".\nThe alliance, known as Aukus, will see Australia being given the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines.\nThe move angered France as it scuppered a multibillion-dollar deal it had signed with Australia.\nThe agreement is widely seen as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea. It was announced on Wednesday by US President Joe Biden, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison.\nFrance was informed of the alliance only hours before the public announcement was made.\nIn a statement late on Friday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who had described the pact as a \"stab in the back\", said the ambassadors were being recalled at the request of President Emmanuel Macron.\nThe deal \"constitute[s] unacceptable behaviour between allies and partners whose consequences directly affect the vision we have of our alliances, of our partnerships and of the importance of the Indo-Pacific for Europe\", Mr Le Drian said.\nA White House official said the Biden administration regretted the move and would be engaged with France in the coming days to resolve their differences.\nSpeaking in Washington, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said she understood the \"disappointment\" in France and hoped to work with the country to ensure it understood \"the value we place on the bilateral relationship\".\nA recall of ambassadors is highly unusual between allies, and it is believed to be the first time France has recalled envoys from the two countries. French diplomats in Washington had already cancelled a gala to celebrate ties between the US and France which was scheduled for Friday.\nAt the Elys\u00e9e in Paris, they are concerned that in Washington, Canberra and London officials are underestimating and misinterpreting French anger - which is not about the loss of the submarine contract per se,  but about the way France - an allied nation with a presence in the Pacific - was cut out of the picture in secret talks between the three English-speaking countries.  \nThat's why President Macron last night ordered the recall for consultations of the two ambassadors:  to show that from France's perspective this is a very big deal indeed,  and that it raises questions over the essence of its relationship with America, Australia  and, indeed, the UK - though it's noticeable that France is not recalling its ambassador to London.  \nThe explanation given in briefings to the French press,  with deliberate disdain,  is that France considers the UK a junior player in the new pact, seeking a new world role post-Brexit, and riding along on Uncle Sam's coat-tails.\nThe pact means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. It will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies.\nThe announcement ended a deal worth $37bn (\u00a327bn) that France had signed with Australia in 2016 to build 12 conventional submarines. China meanwhile accused the three powers involved in the pact of having a \"Cold War mentality\"."

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nHoliday bookings are expected to surge following the announcement on Friday that England's travel rules are to be eased. Travel agents said they had seen an uptick in bookings after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced the amber list was being scrapped and testing rules were being relaxed. Thomas Cook said it expected this weekend to be the busiest of the year so far.\nThe UK's most vulnerable hospital patients, who are unable to build up an antibody response to Covid, are to be offered new drug Ronapreve from Monday. The treatment, approved just last month, uses a pair of laboratory-made antibodies to attack the virus. It was used as part of the suite of experimental medicines given to US President Donald Trump last year when he contracted the virus.\nA risk calculator has been developed to identify those who are at highest risk of severe illness from Covid, despite having had one or two vaccine doses. The UK researchers behind the device say it could be used to help spot fully vaccinated people who may benefit from boosters or early treatment - including newer therapies such as monoclonal antibodies. Those who are likely to be more vulnerable include older people, people with Down's Syndrome, and those with weakened immune systems.\nWelsh hospitals are becoming \"terribly stretched\" as Covid admissions rise, an intensive care doctor has warned. Richard Pugh, an intensive care consultant in north Wales and chairman of the Welsh Intensive Care Society, said staff were being forced to move patients between hospitals. He blamed an unprecedented workload of non-Covid patients and increasing coronavirus cases. There are not enough critical care beds, he added.\nThe flu vaccination programme is being widened in Northern Ireland ahead of a winter in which the virus will circulate with Covid-19. Schoolchildren in years eight to 12 and people aged over 50 are among the groups that will be eligible for the jab this winter. The vaccination programme is set to officially begin next month. However, it is expected GPs will begin to administer the vaccine as soon as they receive their initial orders.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nConfused about the Covid travel rules?

It's not that I wanted to be a hero, but my job was to find them no matter what.\"\nThat evening, just 16 hours after setting off, Stuart was back at his local pub in Mansfield after one of the most taxing days of his 34 years in mining.\nIt was then what he had seen and been through became too much to cope with.\n\"I just broke down,\" he recalls. \"Your training prepares you for some things, but nothing prepares you for the emotional side.\"\nHis team of five had encountered a chaotic scene.\n\"As soon as got over where the water was it was a case of searching left and right, up and down, for about 400m,\" recalled Stuart.\n\"Where we got to where the incident had occurred, the mine was 700 to 800mm high - or it should have been - but when we looked we only had about 150 to 200mm of space to work in because of all the debris and silt that had been washed in.\n\"You could see where the water had come up to. If you can imagine someone who's got dirty has had a bath, when the water is let out you get a line around the bath.\n\"This was the same in the coal. Above the line was all dust, and below it the coal was shining.\n\"We didn't know if anything else was going to come down from the roof, so we proceeded very, very cautiously.\"\nEventually, one of his team spotted part of a high-visibility jacket. They tunnelled through the debris and found the body of Charles Breslin.\n\"The water was still coming in,\" said Stuart. \n\"I was trying to hold the team together and motivate them to get through as there were concerns about whether that was residual water or new water.\"\nStuart knew from other operations what it was like to find men trapped but alive, and still hoped for a miracle.\n\"We wanted to get them back to their families so they could either have them back at the dinner table, or be able to grieve in the way they wanted to,\" he said.\nAnd to grieve it was. When the last body had been recovered, his team of four headed back the midlands, stopping at a local shop for a couple of cans of energy drink before the long drive home, where the tears began.\nStuart lost his job as a mines rescue officer in 2015, and now works as a painter and decorator for his local council. \nAnd having followed his father's footsteps into mining, he says he still misses it despite the dangers.\n\"If I got the call saying I was needed tomorrow, I'd go,\" he said. \"It's in your blood.\n\"There's definitely a connection between miners. It can be soul-destroying and it can be dangerous work but that's the job.\"\nBrian Robinson, an experienced mines rescue officer who has been working in the industry since 1977, admitted the prospect of water flooding a mine had been on his mind back in 2011.\n\"I'd actually said not long before it happened that I'd dealt with just about every mining incident going from falls to explosions to fires to gassings yet, thankfully, not an inundation of water and then it happened.\"\nThe year before the Gleision disaster, 29 men died in the Pike River disaster in New Zealand. Brian worked as an advisor to the victims' families as they tried to stop the government sealing the mine with the men's remains still inside.\nWhen Brian arrived at Gleision, the men who had escaped the torrent had passed on what knowledge they could.\n\"Every rescue team member knew that there could be imminent danger but they still went down,\" said Brian.\n\"Obviously, with prior knowledge and experience you gain this sense of whether it's safe or not, but there was a little, let's call it a 'pucker factor' that came into play.\"\nWith water still coming in and roof supports washed away, Brian said it was \"a real mess\" underground.\nBut despite the dangers, he said the bond that exists between miners meant there was no let-up in the operation.\n\"The rescue team members wanted to go in time and time again. If they had a rest it wouldn't be for long, they knew there was a job to be done.\"\nWhen the body of Garry Jenkins was found on the Friday, Brian still hoped they could rescue the others, but that optimism was replaced by \"deflation\" when Phillip Hill - the last man to be found - was brought out.\nBrian, who now runs UK Mines Rescue Ltd, said he thinks about the disaster ever year when the anniversary comes round.  \n\"Mining is a small industry so you tend to know people. I knew one of the victims.\n\"It's hard to put emotion out of it. It's your colleagues. A band of brothers you could say.\"\nTrapped Underground: The Gleision Mine Disaster, a BBC Wales Investigates programme, is now available on  iPlayer."

      "tags": "Universities",
      "text": "England's universities must take student views into account when deciding how much to teach online, says regulator the Office for Students.\nWith Covid restrictions lifted, the majority of teaching is expected to be face-to-face this year, says chief executive Nicola Dandridge.\nBut larger group teaching sessions, such as lectures, are likely to be online in many institutions.\nAnd numerous universities have told the BBC they are using a mixed approach.\nIn a snapshot survey of 47 universities, just 13 said they would be offering mostly face-to-face tuition. The others say they are adopting a more blended approach.\nAnd 19 institutions told the BBC they would be offering additional online learning resources. \nIt comes as hundreds of thousands of students are heading for university.\nLast week, former education secretary Gavin Williamson told vice-chancellors at the Universities UK conference that he expected students to be \"taught in person and alongside other students\".\nMs Dandridge said she was expecting the overwhelming majority of universities and colleges to offer primarily face-to-face teaching.\nBut she said the experience of the pandemic had revealed \"elements of online provision which are really valuable and really useful\".\n\"So there will be elements of online provision where it suits students and where it works, in terms of quality of teaching, but primarily it is face-to face-teaching.\"\nShe added: \"What we will be looking for is quality provision whether or not it's face-to-face or online. \n\"Critically, universities will be taking into consideration the views of students - what do they want, what is their feedback? And that then is factored into the course provision over the course of the next year.\"\nLast year, almost all the teaching Will Huddie received on his theoretical physics course at the University of Leeds was online. \n\"It was difficult,\" he said. \"It's much more natural to discuss questions in person.  \n\"There's so much value in having the lecturer explaining things to you when they're in front of you.\n\"Even after a year-and-a-half of using this online technology, no-one wants to be the person to put up their hand. The interactivity is really poor.\"\nOutraged that teaching had remained online while Covid restrictions were lifted elsewhere, Will started a petition for a return to face-to-face teaching which was signed by thousands of others students.\nWill's course is now due to be delivered entirely face-to-face in the coming year, but the lectures will also be streamed online for those self-isolating and international students who cannot reach the UK.  \n\"I want entirely face-to-face - it's what I signed up for. I don't think blended learning would wash very well with UK students,\" he said.\nA University of Leeds spokesperson said it was committed to working with students to ensure an active and engaged learning experience, using all of the campus and its digital resources. \n\"All seminars, tutorials, workshops, practical classes, performance activities and discussion groups will take place in person, with large-scale teaching events - supported by digital technology - taking place online.\"\nA spokesman for the Russell Group of 24 top universities said they were looking forward to students returning to campuses. \n\"Students can expect most seminars, small group classes and lab work to be taught in person, alongside a range of extracurricular activity, social events and support services on campus.\"\nBut, he said, an element of digital learning would continue, with many large group lectures remaining online.\nHe said many students saw benefits to this approach which was more flexible and accessible. \nNational Union of Students vice-president for higher education Hillary Gyebi-Ababio called for online learning that enhanced and added to the in-person student experience - but that did not replace it entirely.\n\"We are concerned that for some universities, online learning is simply a cost-cutting exercise, brought about by universities needing to stay financially afloat in a competitive market,\" she said."

      "tags": "Women,Personal debt,NHS,Pregnancy",
      "text": "Some pregnant women visiting the UK have been wrongly told they could be denied visas for future trips unless they pay maternity care bills while in the country, the BBC has learned.\nCharity Maternity Action says it has found significant failings in how debt collectors CCI Credit Management work.\nCCI says it represents more than 75% of trusts and health boards, and recoups money from visitors for NHS care.\nIt said it was reviewing all communications with overseas visitors.\nMigrants, visitors and former residents of the UK must pay for their care when they are in the UK.\nRules on charging are aimed in part at preventing people from overseas deliberately coming to the UK to give birth on the NHS for free. Government rules compel NHS trusts to chase up debts. \nHowever, NHS guidelines say debt should not be an automatic reason for refusal of visas - which may be needed to visit, work or stay in the UK - and only that officials \"may consider\" it.   \nSafeguards are designed to be in place to ensure that those in need of urgent care always receive it, and there are exemptions from charges for some groups of people. \nJune (not her real name), who came to the UK from overseas, received a bill from CCI Credit Management for more than \u00a34,600 for her maternity care while she was pregnant. \nShe had just fled a violent relationship, was destitute and her pregnancy was considered high risk because of a past stillbirth.  \n\"I was really, really scared. I can't tell you how stressed I was. I kept going on the internet searching about this stuff,\" she says. \nHer letter from CCI contained the warnings about future visas. It also said debts would be taken into account for potential asylum applications. In fact, NHS debts are not considered when asylum applications are assessed.\nCCI said in a statement: \"For this error we unreservedly apologise.\n\"Please be assured that we are currently reviewing all communications with NHS overseas visitors in order to ensure that there can be no repetition of this mistake, and that further training is being provided to our teams.\"\nThe NHS trust dropped June's charges after Maternity Action contacted them. \nBut the charity says there are trusts who have refused to write off debts for those who are destitute or on very low incomes - despite guidance saying they can. They also say some trusts show poor understanding of the domestic violence provisions. \nChristine Benson, senior legal officer at Maternity Action, said NHS trusts needed to take safeguarding seriously. \n\"NHS trusts must take responsibility for the debt collection agencies and the messages that they're giving to women,\" she said.\nMaternity Action warns there is a growing body of evidence that charging for NHS maternity care deters women from coming forward for care. \nMary came to Britain to meet her husband - an EU national working here for seven years. But at immigration, the authorities said they believed she was involved in a sham marriage. She was allowed into the country but not given leave to remain. Her claim is still pending.\nShe said she did not access medical care throughout her pregnancy because she feared being charged until, at 21 weeks, she miscarried. She now owes \u00a34,500. \nIt is not clear if going for scans earlier in her pregnancy would have resulted in a different outcome. But evidence suggests the kind of care someone receives can have an impact. \n\"It's really important that you have regular check-ups in pregnancy, and that's kind of a standard of care worldwide,\" says Andrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at King's College London. \n\"There are many scenarios where acute management will make a big difference and turn around the outcome.\"\nThere is also evidence that some women turn to desperate measures to pay off their debts.\nMs Benson says: \"Women tell us that they engage in survival sex to support themselves and their families and to repay debts, that they stay in exploitative relationships.\"  \nDr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, says he was \"incredibly concerned\" that women are putting off seeking care during pregnancy and says \"urgent action was needed to break down barriers\". \nClare Livingstone, from the Royal College of Midwives, says that charging these women is \"not only wrong, it is dangerous\". \n\"There must be no barriers that prevent or make these women fearful of coming to our maternity services for the care they need.\" "

      "text": "Householders in the UK will find out in the next few weeks how much their gas bills are likely to increase in the coming year.\nThe energy regulator is due to announce the new energy price cap - the maximum amount that suppliers can charge in Great Britain.\nIt's expected to rise steeply, because global wholesale prices have gone up so much.\nEvery six months, Ofgem, the energy regulator, reviews the maximum price that suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThis is called the energy price cap. \nAbout 15 million households saw their energy bills increase by 12% when it was last updated in October. \nThe next review is due at the beginning of February, and the new cap will come into effect in April. Industry predictions suggest gas prices could go up by as much as 50%.\nThere is a separate energy market in Northern Ireland, with two gas suppliers, and prices have risen sharply for consumers there too.\nThere's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies over the past year.\nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. At the end of December, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about \u00a32,000 next year.\nReasons for the increase include:\nThere are a number of technical and geopolitical issues at play as well, which mean many countries across Europe are grappling with the same problems.\nHowever, the UK is hit relatively hard-hit because it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas. Around 85% of homes have gas central heating, and it also generates a third of the country's electricity. \nStorage capacity in the UK is also lower than in some other European countries.\nSince wholesale gas prices started to spike, more than 20 retail energy suppliers have collapsed in the UK. \nThis is largely because the energy price cap prevented retailers from passing on higher wholesale prices to their customers.\nSeveral smaller companies, with fewer reserves, could not weather this.\nFailed firms include Bulb Energy, with 1.7 million customers. Because of its size, it was put into \"special administration\", and is now run by the government, through Ofgem.\nNearly four million customers have been affected. Many households saw their energy prices rise when their supplier went bust, and they were switched over to a more expensive deal with another supplier.\nThe government faces calls from energy companies, the opposition, and even some of its own MPs, to do more to prevent prices from rising too much.\nSuggestions include:\nIn the past, consumers have been encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise.\nBut at the moment better offers - including fixed deals - are simply not available.\nPeople already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, householders are being encouraged to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.\nThe Energy Saving Trust says that simple changes to our homes and habits could offset the current price rises.\nMany companies face a considerable rise in their bills. That could mean they have to: \nEnergy-intensive industries are particularly exposed, but the problem affects every company that has to pay energy bills - even if it is just to heat an office or shop."
