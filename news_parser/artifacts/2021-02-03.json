      "title": "Covid: New Oxford vaccine 'ready by the autumn' to tackle mutations",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A vaccine to tackle the coronavirus variants could be ready to deploy by the autumn should it be needed, the Oxford-AstraZeneca team says.\nProf Andy Pollard, from Oxford University, said tweaking a vaccine was a relatively quick process and would only need small trials before roll-out.\nIt comes as the UK announced more than 10 million people had received a jab.\nThere is still strong evidence existing vaccines work well against the mutations that have emerged.\nAlthough their overall effectiveness may be weakened a little.\nThe comments came after results released by the team showed the first evidence the vaccine can reduce the chances of people catching and passing on the virus, which has always been uncertain. \nThe data, which has not yet been published or reviewed, showed vaccination with the Oxford-AZ jab could cut transmission by up to 67%. \nThis means the vaccine could significantly slow the spread of the virus, potentially allowing restrictions to be lifted more quickly, as well as protect people from becoming seriously ill and dying with Covid-19.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the results were \"absolutely superb\" and showed vaccines are \"the way out of this pandemic\" but that the \"on-going challenge\" would be for vaccine manufacturers to keep up with what the virus is doing.\nHe described the fact that 10 million people had received their first dose of a vaccine as a \"hugely significant milestone\" and said \"every jab makes us all a bit safer\".\nThere is most concern about the South African variant, which shows signs of being able to escape some of the protective effect of the vaccines. There are already signs this has begun circulating in some parts of the UK, prompting surge testing to be introduced into parts of London, Surrey, Kent, Hertfordshire and Southport.\nThe mutation behind this variant - called E484K - has also been detected in some of the infections caused by UK strains that are circulating in parts of Bristol and Liverpool.\nProf Pollard said his team were already looking at updating the vaccine to make it more effective against the mutations that are being seen.\n\"I think the actual work on designing a new vaccine is very, very quick because it's essentially just switching out the genetic sequence for the spike protein.\n\"And then there's manufacturing to do and then a small scale study. So all of that can be completed in a very short period of time, and the autumn is really the timing for having new vaccines available for use,\" he said.\nIt's not yet clear how the new vaccine would be given to people, but it is possible it could take the form of a one-dose booster which is updated and rolled out every year or so.\nSir Mene Pangalos, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals research and development at AstraZeneca, added: \"Our ambition is to be ready for the next round of immunisations that may be necessary as we go into next winter. That's what we're aiming for.\"\nHe added the manufacturing process would also be easier as plants would be fully up to speed by then.\nThe trials that would need to be run are only likely to involve a few hundred people as the team would only need to check safety and that a good immune response is generated by carrying out blood tests.\nThere were a further 1,322 deaths in the UK reported on Wednesday within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, bringing the total number of people who have died by this measure to 109,335.\nIn other developments: "

      "tags": "NI Brexit,Simon Coveney,Michelle O'Neill,Arlene Foster,Brexit",
      "text": "A DUP MP has called on the prime minister to \"be the unionist we need him to be\" in addressing concerns over the Irish Sea border.\nIan Paisley told the Commons that the Brexit agreement had betrayed unionists and made them \"feel like foreigners in our own country\".\nMeanwhile a \"cordial\" meeting between the UK government, EU and NI's first and deputy first ministers has ended.\nThere will be further discussions next week.\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and European Commission Vice-President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said they would \"work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues\".\nSpeaking before that meeting took place, Mr Paisley said \"tea and sympathy would not cut the mustard\" and urged Downing Street to act.\nBoris Johnson said the government would \"do everything we need to do\".\nUnionists oppose the part of the Brexit deal known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, arguing it damages trade and threatens UK unity.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster, who leads the Democratic Unionist Party, has announced plans to stop north-south activities related to the NI Protocol until action is taken to address what she called a \"growing crisis\" over the Irish Sea border.\nResponding to Mr Paisley in the Commons, the prime minister insisted he was committed to Northern Ireland and the union.\nHe said the government would act \"legislatively\" or by invoking an emergency mechanism known as Article 16 to override part of the protocol, if other solutions cannot be reached with the EU to remove GB-NI trade barriers.\nThe UK has already written the EU asking for agreement to a long extension of grace periods for the Irish Sea border.\nCurrently, supermarkets and other businesses are being allowed to operate with reduced requirements for paperwork and certification when moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nThe first of those grace periods is due to expire in April, but in a letter to the EU the UK government has asked for an extension until 2023.\nIt has also requested the creation of a common travel area for pets which would reduce the new post-Brexit processes for moving pets across the Irish Sea.\nUK and EU leaders held talks to try to resolve the trade issues between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nMrs Foster spoke to Mr Johnson ahead of the UK-EU meeting, which she took part in along with Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, Mr Gove and Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d.\nFollowing the meeting, the first minister said the UK government accepted problems with trade between GB and NI following Brexit were \"more than just teething problems\", however, she added: \"I'm not so sure that's the case in the European Commission.\"\n\"I have to say I was disappointed with some of the statements made by Maros Sefcovic in relation to teething problems [relating] to the rigorous implementation of the protocol because of course that's not going to cut it,\" she said.\n\"I think everybody knows now that there's fundamental reform and that needs to be dealt with very, very quickly.\n\"We have some cliff edges coming up on 1 April and we all know that, so therefore we need to work very quickly to deal with these issues.\"\nBut Ms O'Neill welcomed the position from the European Commission.\nThe deputy first minister said Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d had \"put his hands up\" in the meeting over the attempt to introduce Article 16 last Friday.\nMs O'Neill said he also asked that the Commission's \"track record\" of political and financial support for peace in Northern Ireland was taken into account.\n\"I think they [European Commission] came at it with a very constructive and open mind in terms of resolution to some of the outstanding issues however they were also equally very clear that the protocol must be implemented in its entirety,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\"The EU has been very clear in saying that the protocol is not up for renegotiation - I share that view.\"\nMr Gove and Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d released a joint statement to say they would \"work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues\".\nThe statement said the UK government and EU Commission reiterated their full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and to the \"proper implementation\" of the protocol\nBoth \"condemned unreservedly any threats or intimidation\". \nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d is also set to travel to London to continue talks.\nOn Monday night, Stormont's Department of Agriculture decided to suspend Brexit checks on animal products at some NI ports after \"threats\" were made against inspection staff.\nHowever, a senior police officer said there was no evidence any of the main loyalist paramilitary groups were involved in the incidents.\nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he recognised there were \"serious problems\" with the protocol that needed to be resolved.\nBut he warned it should be improved where possible, rather than scrapped as unionists have demanded.\nBrussels might feel battered and bruised over its Article 16 blunder, but is it ready to bend?\nThat is the hope of Michael Gove and Arlene Foster as they attempt to squeeze some concessions from Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d around the NI Protocol.\nAsking for a two year extension for Protocol exemptions is a big demand from London and won't sit easy with Brussels.\nBut the DUP asking for the Protocol to be binned is a big demand which won't sit easy with London.\nRemoving the Protocol would involve renegotiating a Withdrawal deal which took four years to put together.\nBoris Johnson last night made clear his \"unshakeable\" commitment to securing Northern Ireland's place in the union, but he also made clear he wants to fix the protocol, not ditch it. \nWhat we may get today is an extension of the grace period to allow businesses more time to adjust to the new rules.\nThat will be sold by some as the first victory in a longer battle, but for others it will be as much as the EU should bend.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was \"highly regrettable that the first minister had chosen to approach the challenges presented by Brexit in a way that will increase instability and heighten tension at a time of immense sensitivity\". \nThe Foyle MP again called for a moderation in language.\nThe NI Protocol was part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products.\nInstead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nThis is because Northern Ireland in effect remains part of the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left.\nArticle 16 of the protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nOn Friday evening the EU announced it would trigger the clause and introduce the export controls on its vaccines entering Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent the region becoming a backdoor for jabs to be sent to the UK mainland.\nIt later reversed this decision, but unionist parties in NI have been pressing the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK."

      "tags": "Indian farmers protest 2020,Asia,India,Greta Thunberg",
      "text": "India has accused \"foreign individuals\" and celebrities of \"sensationalism\" after a tweet by pop superstar Rihanna, extending support to protesting farmers, drew global attention.\nHours after the singer's tweet, teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg and the US vice president's niece Meena Harris also tweeted support for the farmers.\nTheir widely shared tweets went viral, garnering thousands of responses.\nFarmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders against new farm laws.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, India's external affairs ministry said parliament had passed \"reformist legislation relating to the agricultural sector\" after a full debate and discussion. \n\"The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,\" it added.\nRihanna's tweet on Tuesday linked to a news story about the internet blockade at the protest sites.\nIndia suspended mobile internet services in three areas around the capital, Delhi, where tens of thousands of farmers are camping to protest against the new laws. \nThe government said the shutdown was to \"maintain public safety\".\nThe protest made international headlines last week when a tractor rally by farmers ended in violent clashes that left one protester dead and more than 500 police injured, according to the authorities. \nSome demonstrators stormed Delhi's historic Red Fort and occupied it until police pushed them back.\nFarmers' groups and union leaders condemned the violence but said they would not call off the protest.\nThe pop superstar's tweet to her 101 million followers sent her name to the top of social media trends in India. Her post drew a global outpouring of support. \nThere were many who also criticised the singer for wading into the protests against the laws that have been defended by the government and its supporters.  \nBollywood actress Kangana Ranaut, a supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), posted a message quoting the tweet.\n\"No one is talking about it because they are not farmers, they are terrorists who are trying to divide India,\" she wrote.\nHours after Rihanna's tweet, Greta Thunberg also tweeted in support of the farmers.\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris's niece Meena Harris also posted in solidarity with the striking farmers.\n \"We ALL should be outraged by India's internet shutdowns and paramilitary violence against farmer protesters,\" she wrote.\nBritish MP Claudia Webbe also expressed her support for the farmers, writing, \"Thank you Rihanna. In an era where political leadership is lacking, we are grateful for others stepping forward.\"\nThe farmers' protest, now in its third month, presents the biggest challenge Mr Modi has faced. His BJP government has offered to suspend the laws but the farmers want them repealed.\nThe authorities are extremely sensitive to criticism and, on Monday, Twitter restored dozens of Indian accounts that were earlier blocked after a legal notice by the government, citing objections based on public order. \nThe accounts included those of farmers' leaders, activists and a respected news magazine.\nThe contentious farm laws loosen rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce which have protected India's farmers from the free market for decades.\nFarmers fear that the new laws will threaten decades-old concessions - such as assured prices - and weaken their bargaining power, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by private companies."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Public Health England is investigating cases of coronavirus with 'worrying' new genetic changes that have been found in some regions of the UK. \nTests show they have a mutation, called E484K, that is already seen in the South Africa variant. \nAlthough this change may reduce vaccine effectiveness, the current ones in use should still work, say experts.\nThere have been 11 cases in Bristol and a cluster of 32 cases in Liverpool. \nUrgent testing for the South Africa variant is already starting in parts of England and could be rolled out to other areas seeing different variants with the same E484K mutation. \nScientists working with Public Health England found a small number of cases of the UK 'Kent' variant with the E484K mutation - it was seen in 11 out of 214,159 samples that they tested, and predominantly from the South West of England.\nIt is likely there may be more cases that haven't yet been found. The Liverpool area has seen 32 cases of original coronavirus that have the E484K mutation too.\nIt's not unexpected that variants are appearing or that they will continue to change - all viruses mutate as they make new copies of themselves to spread and thrive.\nDr Julian Tang, a virus expert at the University of Leicester, described the finding as \"a worrying development, though not entirely unexpected\".\nHe said it was important people follow the lockdown rules and get cases of coronavirus down to prevent opportunities for the virus to mutate further. \n\"Otherwise not only can the virus continue to spread, it can also evolve.\"\nHe said that allowing spread could allow a \"melting pot\" for different emerging variants. \nScientists have already been checking what these new mutations might mean for existing coronavirus vaccines that were designed around earlier versions of the virus that started the pandemic. \nSome research appears to show E484K may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies.\nBut early results from Moderna suggest its vaccine is still effective against variants with this mutation - although the body's immune response may not be as strong or prolonged.\nTwo new coronavirus vaccines that could be approved soon - one from Novavax and another from Janssen - also appear to offer good cover against variants, protecting against serious illness. \nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts.\nA silver lining may be that the variants are mutating in a similar way rather than diverging from each other. \nProf Ravi Gupta from the University of Cambridge said: \"This gives us a sign that it has certain favoured routes - and we can work to block those off with a vaccine.\"\nFormer UK health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the race was on to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible in order to keep a step ahead of the virus.\nMeasures such as washing your hands, keeping your distance from other people and wearing a face covering will still help prevent infections."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nWe knew that Covid-19 vaccines stopped some people getting ill from the virus. But we didn't know whether the vaccines stopped people catching and spreading it. On Tuesday evening, a study - which has not been formally published - said the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab had a \"substantial\" effect on transmission, as well as reducing the chances of getting ill. Health Secretary Matt Hancock hailed the news as \"absolutely superb\". The study, by the University of Oxford, swabbed people every week to test for the presence of the virus. If there's no virus it cannot spread - and the numbers testing positive halved once they had been given two doses. The study also seems to support the UK government's decision to wait longer between doses, in order to give more people the first jab sooner. Protection remained at 76% three months after the first dose. This rose to 82% after people were given the second dose. Read more about the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine here - or watch the video below.\nThe French health authority has said AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine should be given only to people aged under 65. It said there was insufficient data on its efficacy for older people. The EU drugs regulator has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults, but members can set their own rules. Other EU states, including Germany and Italy, have also recommended it is not used for older people.\nAlmost nine in 10 people who catch Covid-19 still have antibodies six months later, a study of almost 1,700 people suggests. This means people are unlikely to catch the virus twice in a short space of time. The data - from one of the world's largest follow-up Covid studies - also provides more detail about likely symptoms. While 26% had a cough and 28% a fever, 43% said they lost their taste or smell. But 40% had none of these symptoms - and about 20% had none at all.\nRyanair has been told to remove \"irresponsible\" adverts which said people could \"jab and go\" after having a Covid vaccination. The Advertising Standards Authority said it got 2,370 complaints - the third highest ever received. The airline has stopped the adverts, but said it disagreed with the rulings. The ASA said: \"The ads misleadingly provided consumers with a reassurance that being vaccinated against Covid-19 was likely to allow them to go on holiday without restrictions.\"\nTwo Australian MPs have clashed in a parliamentary corridor, with Labor's Tanya Plibersek accusing the government's Craig Kelly of spreading misinformation about Covid-19. Ms Plibersek said Mr Kelly had \"crazy conspiracies\" about treatments that were not backed up by science.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Results that show the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might reduce the spread of coronavirus have been hailed as \"absolutely superb\" by the health secretary.\nMatt Hancock said the study shows \"vaccines are the way out of this pandemic\".\nIt is the first time a vaccine has been shown to reduce transmission of the virus.\nThe UK has given a first Covid jab to more than 10 million people so far.\nThe results of the study, which has not yet been formally published, suggest that the vaccine may have a \"substantial\" effect on transmission of the virus.\nIt means the jab could have a greater impact on the pandemic, as each person who is vaccinated will indirectly protect other people too.\nMr Hancock called the study \"really encouraging\" on Twitter, adding that the results were \"absolutely superb\".\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, he said this latest analysis showing the vaccine reduces transmission would \"help us all get out of this pandemic\".\nMr Hancock said passing the 10 million mark for people who have received a first dose was a \"hugely significant milestone\", tweeting that \"every jab makes us all a bit safer\".\nThe study by the University of Oxford, where the vaccine was developed, measured the impact on transmission by testing for asymptomatic infections, swabbing participants every week in addition to recording when anyone fell ill with Covid-19.\nAs well as showing an effect on transmission, the study found the vaccine offered 76% effective protection from a single dose for three months.\nWith no fall in protection during the three-month period, the researchers said the results supported gaps between first and second doses of between four and 12 weeks. \nThe effectiveness of the vaccine increased with a longer gap of 12 weeks before the booster jab.\nWhen the second dose is given, the study found the level of protection from the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine rises to 82%.\nIn other developments:\nThe UK has set itself apart from many other countries by prioritising giving the first dose to as many people as possible, delaying the second jab for about 12 weeks. \nThe aim is to save more lives by giving some protection to a larger number of people, but the UK has faced criticism from the British Medical Association for following this path with no international support.\nProf Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, said the results supported the UK's approach to delaying the booster shot.\nIt \"reassures us that people are protected from 22 days after a single dose of the vaccine,\" he says.\nThe new analysis of the Oxford vaccine suggests that transmission of the virus from those who have been vaccinated could be substantially reduced. \nIf verified by the scientific review process, it means that as more people get the jab, infection levels could come down faster than they would otherwise and enable the government to lift restrictions sooner than they could otherwise. \nOne in six of the population has had at least one jab so far. \nThere's still a long way to go but the impact on case numbers could begin to be felt in the coming weeks.\nThe fly in the ointment though is the recent emergence in the UK of variants that may be more resistant to some vaccines. \nExperts believe that jabs will still offer good protection especially against severe illness, but even so this could slow progress.\nThe race is now on to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, in order to keep a step ahead of the variants. \nThe government is also trying to slow the spread of variants through enhanced surveillance and testing. \nBut a critical part of the strategy is to drive down infection levels, so people don't catch the virus in the first place, whatever variant it might be.\nIn France, use of the Oxford vaccine has been restricted by health authorities who say it should only be given to people under 65.\nMr Hancock, the UK health secretary, said scientists had looked directly at the over-65s and there was \"a high degree of confidence\" that the Oxford vaccine worked on people of all ages.\nHe added that the latest research showed the world the vaccine works - \"it works well\" and \"categorically supports\" the government's strategy.\nAsked if it could now mean children in England returning to school before 8 March, he pointed out 30,000 people were still in hospital.\n\"We've got to get this right down,\" he told the Today programme. \n\"It's too soon to be able to take action in England and we've set out the timescale because we think that's when we should be able to take action, if all goes well.\"\nAlongside the Oxford vaccine, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is also being rolled out across the UK.\nClinical trials of the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna, which has been approved but is not yet in use, did not look for a potential impact on transmission. \nHowever, BBC health correspondent James Gallagher said the different vaccines all target the same part of the virus so if one can cut transmission, there is a good chance the others can too.\nThe data from this latest trial was drawn before new variants, including the South Africa one, emerged.\nAsked how protective the Oxford vaccine could be against new mutations, Dr Pollard said he was anticipating \"good protection\" against the Kent variant and would publish details \"very soon\".\nOn other variants, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"When we look at the new mutations that have been arising in other countries and now also here in the UK - that is the virus trying to escape from human immunity, and that's whether it's from vaccines or from infection.\n\"I think that's telling us about what's to come, which is a virus that continues to transmit, but hopefully that will be like other coronaviruses that are around us all the time, which cause colds and mild infections.\n\"We will have built up enough immunity to prevent the other severe disease that we've been seeing over the last year.\"\nFigures from Tuesday show there were 16,840 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, with the number of new infections dropping 27% since last week. \nA further 1,449 people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test."

      "text": "People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts.\nThe UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that \"adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nData from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. \nBased on the current data, the following is advised:\nThe MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April.\nThe MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate.\nAnd the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. \nIts head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was \"firming up\", more evidence would be needed. \nThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\".\nThe MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nPlatelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\nAmong these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT).\nCVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. \nAs a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke.  \nThe clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. \nThe MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice:\nCovid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clotting should be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect.\nAfter a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link.\nNevertheless, Denmark has stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - and Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. \nFrance is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, while Australia says people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness.\nOnce injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus.\nExperts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. \nThe government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is \"plenty of evidence\" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant which is dominant in the UK.\nThere is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. \nHowever a study of around 2,000 people suggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you in the morning.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson says coronavirus infection rates remain \"alarmingly high\" in the UK, although there are \"some signs of hope\", with the number of Covid patients in hospital beginning to fall. Latest figures show some 32,000 Covid patients are currently in hospital and there have been another 19,202 cases in the past 24 hour-period - although the figure is below 20,000 for a third successive day. Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson also said the UK has passed the \"milestone\" of vaccinating more than 10 million people thanks to the \"colossal\" effort of everyone involved in the vaccination programme. \nPeople across the country have joined in a national clap in memory of Captain Sir Tom Moore. The 100-year-old, who raised almost \u00a333m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus on Tuesday. Boris Johnson, who led the tribute, said it was \"for the spirit of optimism that he stood for\" but also \"all those he campaigned for\". Capt Sir Tom's family said they were \"incredibly touched\".\nThe team behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has said that new jabs to tackle coronavirus variants should be ready by the autumn. Prof Andy Pollard, from Oxford University, said tweaking a vaccine was a relatively quick process and would only need small trials before being rolled out. There is still strong evidence existing vaccines work well against the mutations that have emerged, although their overall effectiveness may be weakened a little. Here we take a closer look at the South African variant - and the risk it poses.\nDays before the Australian Open is due to start, a number of tennis players have been told to isolate after a worker at their hotel in Melbourne tested positive for Covid-19. In all, more than 500 people - including officials and support staff - are affected. Meanwhile, officials running this summer's Tokyo Olympics have set out how they to plan to keep the games safe during the pandemic. The proposals include testing athletes every four days, while people watching won't be allowed to cheer or shout - only clap. \nA former nurse who lived through the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic has received her Covid-19 vaccine. Hilda Richards - now 103 - said that she \"felt good\" after having the jab. The great-grandmother, one of very few people to have lived through both pandemics, cared for soldiers injured in the Battle of Dunkirk and has lived for the past year at a care home in Wrexham.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nVaccine development is continuing at pace around the world, here we take a closer look at those being developed by China - the first country in the world to give some of its population a Covid jab.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Captain Tom Moore,Obituaries",
      "text": "At times of crisis, a nation needs hope and heroes. \nSometimes, they're found in unlikely places - and when Britain first locked down against the coronavirus pandemic, it discovered Captain Sir Tom Moore.\nIn April 2020 the then 99-year-old war veteran accepted a little family challenge: to raise \u00a31,000 for health service charities by walking 100 lengths of his garden before his 100th birthday at the end of that month.\n\"One small soul like me won't make much difference,\" he declared in his first TV interview. \nHe could not have been more wrong.\nBy the time he closed his fundraising page at midnight on his 100th birthday, Captain Sir Tom had raised more than \u00a332m from more than one-and-a-half-million global donors.\nBut that was just the beginning - a knighthood, RAF flypast to mark him turning 100 and personal greetings from the Queen and prime minister soon followed.\nAnd he even became the oldest person ever to score a number one single in the UK, when he and Michael Ball sang a cover of You'll Never Walk Alone.\nCaptain Sir Tom was born in Keighley on 30 April 1920. His father, Wilson, came from a family of builders; his mother, Isabella, taught children at a local school. \nIt was a comfortable, middle-class background, but a decade later came the Wall Street Crash. It triggered a world-wide economic depression which hit Yorkshire mill towns hard. \nA quarter of the British population struggled to feed themselves. Young Tom was surrounded by long lines at soup kitchens, and classmates suffering from rickets and tuberculosis. \nBright enough to win a place at grammar school, he found he enjoyed working with his hands more than reading books.\n\"I was always a very practical boy,\" he recalled. \"The sort of toys I liked would be a piece of wood, some nails and a hammer.\"\nBut his real passion was motorbikes. At the age of 12, Captain Sir Tom discovered one lying in a barn and bought it for half a crown. He proudly took it home, and lovingly did it up.\nHe left school to start an apprenticeship in civil engineering, but there was barely time to finish it before World War Two broke out. \nConscripted into the British army in June 1940, Captain Sir Tom joined the Duke of Wellington's regiment - an infantry battalion with historic links to the West Riding.\nBy his own admission, he was \"too young to feel frightened\". Indeed, for a practically-minded motorsport enthusiast barely out of his teens, the British army was a thrilling place.\nCaptain Sir Tom spent time in Cornwall, preparing to defend the coast from a German invasion, and learned how to drive tanks. \nSelected for officer training, he became a second lieutenant on his 21st birthday, and - now part of the 146th Royal Armoured Corps - found himself posted to India.\nWith the Suez Canal closed, the sea journey took six perilous weeks. The convoy inched around the southern tip of Africa, at constant risk from German submarines. \nThe train ride across India took nearly as long, the burning heat made only slightly less unbearable by huge blocks of ice scattered among the troops.\nTheir final destination was Burma, where the British army and its Indian allies had been forced into a fighting retreat by a seemingly unstoppable Japanese advance. \nCaptain Sir Tom was joining the bruised and bloodied \"forgotten army\", which was suffering from disease and low morale. It was fighting in the world's least hospitable terrain, with impenetrable jungle, poisonous snakes, and hot lashing rain for six months of every year. \nMuch of the fighting was done hand-to-hand, with no quarter given on either side. Years later, Captain Sir Tom clearly recalled staring into the \"whites of the eyes\" of the opposing troops.\nWith his knowledge of motorbikes, Captain Sir Tom was asked to train dispatch riders. Radio transmissions could be intercepted, so this was the best means of getting information to and from the front line.\nIt was dangerous work. Dispatch riders worked alone and at night. The roads that did exist were deeply rutted and thick with mud, and the risk of ambush was ever-present.\nCaptain Sir Tom loved the motorbikes, but described the job as a \"poisoned chalice\". Once the engine started, there was no stopping or going back. \n\"If it didn't go well,\" he said bluntly, \"I was dead\".\nSlowly, the 14th army turned the tide in Britain's favour. Over the next two years, Captain Sir Tom's team helped cut Japanese supply lines along the Burmese coast.\nOne notable occasion was the battle for Ramree Island in 1945. More than 1,000 Japanese infantrymen were forced into a mangrove swamp infested by salt-water crocodiles. Only a handful emerged.\nBy this time, Captain Sir Tom had survived a nasty bout of dengue fever and been promoted to Captain. With the Japanese finally on the back foot, he returned to England to train recruits in the art of driving tanks.\nOn VE Day, there were \"certain activities in the bar\", but Captain Sir Tom's thoughts were with his mates still fighting in the Far East. \"They didn't get a day off,\" he said.\nHe became an instructor at the Armoured Fighting Vehicle School in Dorset. He loved the work, but was desperately unhappy at home\nIn 1949, he married his first wife Billie and took a job as a sales manager for a roofing company in his native Yorkshire. The troubled marriage lasted 18 years and did not produce children.\nNow in his late 40s, Captain Sir Tom resigned himself to never finding love. Until, a few years later, he met Pamela.\nShe was 15 years younger and an office manager at the firm's headquarters in Gravesend. Romance blossomed, and Captain Sir Tom began to think of excuses to travel down to Kent.\n\"She looked terrific to me, like a model,\" he later told the Daily Mail. \"The attraction became stronger and I eventually married her.\"\nCaptain Sir Tom raced his beloved Scott motorbikes around Yorkshire, winning various cups and medals. He and Pamela had two children - Lucy and Hannah.\nIn 1992, Captain Sir Tom retired at the age of 72. He was looking forward to retirement but life proved less than kind.\nPamela fell ill with dementia. Captain Sir Tom cared for his wife for two years, and then visited her care home every day until her death in 2006.\nNot wanting to be alone, Captain Sir Tom moved into his daughter Hannah's home in the Bedfordshire village of Marston Moretaine. \nThere, his routine seldom wavered: waking early each morning to let the dogs out, followed by a daily jog on a running machine. He allowed himself a few luxuries, including a daily glass of wine in front of the television. Judge Judy was a favourite programme.\nCaptain Sir Tom was treated for skin cancer and a broken hip, and received \"marvellous service\" from the NHS. When the world locked down for the coronavirus pandemic, he saw a chance to give something back.\nBut a piece in Bedford Today about his sponsored walk mushroomed into a global media event. For millions trapped at home, Captain Sir Tom was a much-needed symbol of defiance, national unity and hope. \n\"Please remember,\" he said repeatedly, \"tomorrow will be a good day.\" The money flooded in. \nAs Captain Sir Tom turned to complete his final lap, the total stood at more than \u00a312m. It would eventually surpass \u00a330m. An honour guard from his old regiment saluted an extraordinary achievement.\nHis cover of You'll Never Walk Alone, a duet with Michael Ball, raised even more - hitting the top of the charts in time for Captain Sir Tom's hundredth birthday and making him the oldest person ever to score a number one single in the UK.\nOn the day itself, a Spitfire wheeled in tribute over Marston Moretaine; a local school volunteered to display 160,000 birthday cards sent to a national treasure.\nCaptain Sir Tom - promoted to Colonel - did not set out to inspire millions. Like the young lieutenant in 1941, he was just trying to do his bit. The Queen knighted him at a special ceremony at Windsor Castle on 17 July 2020.\nWith stubbornness, courage and optimism, he was the right man at the right time.\nHe was Britain as it needed to see itself: selfless, patriotic and undefeated - and never taking a backward step.

      "text": "Trade unionists attempting to overturn convictions in a 47-year-long campaign have told the Court of Appeal they were victims of an establishment plot.  \nThe 14-strong group, including actor Ricky Tomlinson, say police destroyed evidence, and shadowy security chiefs prejudiced their trial. \nThe men were convicted over allegedly illegal protests during a 1972 strike.\nSix of the 14 have since died, including Dennis Warren, who was jailed for three years. \nTheir families are continuing the cases in their names. Tomlinson, then known as Eric, was jailed for two years in the first of three trials that lasted until 1974.\nIn June 1972, trade unionists called the UK's first-ever national builders' strike in protest against pay, unjust employment practices and dangerous conditions on sites.\nFlying pickets, in which trade unionists travel to demonstrate from one site to another, went from town to town urging builders to down tools - and in September six coach-loads of strikers demonstrated in Shrewsbury and Telford.\nPolice arrested none of the demonstrators that day - but five months later, amid pressure from building industry bosses, Tomlinson and others were charged and subsequently convicted of offences including unlawful assembly, intimidation and affray. \nThose convictions triggered a massive campaign among left-wing groups during the 1970s - but the men failed to have the verdicts reversed on appeal. \nLast year, the Criminal Cases Review Commission, the official body that looks at potential miscarriages of justice, sent the case back to the Court of Appeal after Eileen Turnbull, the researcher for the justice campaign, uncovered a potentially crucial document in the National Archives. \nThat document, part of prosecution papers, revealed for the first time that police had destroyed some of the original witness statements.\nDanny Friedman QC, speaking for 12 of the men, told the Court of Appeal these missing original statements would have been crucial. \n\"If today a prosecution counsel is told by [police] officers ... original statements have been destroyed, two things absolutely have to happen.\n\"Number one, you need to immediately get a statement from the officer in the case, explaining in detail what on earth he is talking about. Secondly, you must also make sure that this issue is disclosed to defence and the judge.\"\nMr Friedman said the jury must have also known about a highly-prejudicial ITV documentary, Red under the Bed. \nOfficial government papers show its content was influenced by a then secret anti-communist propaganda unit inside the Foreign Office which, alongside MI5, was concerned about Moscow's potential infiltration of trade unionists.   \nThe programme was broadcast halfway through the trial - at a time when there were only three TV channels in the UK - and it was also reported in many national newspapers. \nIt purportedly investigated communist agitators and included footage of the defendants, their supporters, police lines and pictures of strikers. \nA studio discussion following the film included a panellist referring to the builders' strike as an example of \"blatant communist influence\". \nThat statement alone was deeply prejudicial, say the 14's lawyers, because it would have provoked \"panic\" in the mind of the jury.\nMr Friedman told the court: \"It is obvious... a covert executive agency played a part in deliberately propagandising against the core subject matter of the [men's prosecution].\n\"It is clear now that the higher echelons of the state bore responsibility for deliberate covert involvement in the production of the programme.\"\nLawyers for the Crown Prosecution Service are expected to argue during the appeal's second day that the TV documentary is irrelevant, and that no actual evidence was destroyed by police as they prepared case papers."

      "text": "Around 1.2 million children attended school in England last week, Department for Education (DfE) figures show.\nOn 28 January, 15% of state school pupils were in class, up from 14% the week before, the data indicates. \nThe rise was driven by an increase in the number of children attending class in primary and special schools, while numbers in secondary schools remained stable.\nHead teachers described the rise in demand for places as \"worrying\".\nPupils in schools and colleges in England - except children of key workers and vulnerable pupils - have been told to learn remotely during the latest Covid-19 lockdown.\nThe DfE data shows more than a fifth (22%) of primary school pupils were on site last week - a rise on the week before, when 21% were in class.\nAttendance in special schools was 33% - up from 30% on 21 January. \nAround 70% - 850,000 - of the children in all schools last week were the children of key workers, up from 813,000 on 21 January, \nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"It is worrying that demand for school places is obviously rising during the course of the lockdown.\n\"Schools are being placed in the very difficult position of much higher demand than in the first lockdown and no guidance from the government about how many children should be in school at any one time.\n\"Many schools are having to juggle in-school teaching for quite large numbers of pupils with remote education for everyone else.\n\"It is very difficult to square this with the government's message to the public to stay home, protect the NHS, and save lives.\"\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the figures were a \"timely reminder that schools did not really close in the first place\". \nMr Whiteman said the government should scrutinise the infection rates and transmission within the minority of schools and communities where significant numbers of pupils and parents continued to meet daily. \n\"Understanding the level of risk presented by higher numbers of pupils in school would appear key to planning for a safe and sustainable return to school for all pupils.\"\nThe attendance figures came as a professor told the All-Party Group on Coronavirus that the current situation was having a \"devastating impact\" on children.\nProfessor Anthony Costello, of University College London's Institute for Global Health said: \"I think in terms of opening schools, it should be based on solid criteria of the risk from local community prevalence.\n\"In addition to all of that - even if we have to keep some schools shut longer than others - putting in place a proper plan to support all of the kids and all of the children who need access to online learning because I am in no doubt this is having a devastating impact on our children and we have got to do something to ameliorate that - whether we can open schools or not.\" \nThe latest government figures also show that 51,676  laptops and tablets have been delivered or dispatched by the government to help with remote learning in the past week.\nThe DfE figures suggest that 365,268 devices have been sent to councils, academy trusts, schools and colleges across England since the lockdown began on 4 January.\nIt means a total of 927,689 laptops and tablets have been delivered or dispatched to support pupils to access remote education since the scheme to provide devices for children from disadvantaged backgrounds began.

      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Boris Johnson,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for \"urgent action\" from the EU amid rising tensions over post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports.\nUK and EU leaders are to hold talks to try to resolve the trade issues between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nChecks on goods were suspended on Tuesday after threats to staff.\nThe UK government wrote to the European Commission overnight, calling for temporary lighter enforcement of the rules to be extended until early 2023.\nBut Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster, issued a warning against \"just kicking things down the road\", telling BBC Radio Ulster: \"We need to find solutions that are sustainable, that are workable and long lasting.\"\nOn Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the EU had \"undermined\" the Brexit deal by threatening emergency controls of Covid vaccine exports across the Irish border.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the threat had been a \"mistake that shouldn't have happened\".\nBut he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was a separate issue to address over trade rules, and it was Brexit \"causing all of this tension\" - not the measures being put in place.\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, who will be representing the UK government in talks with the EU Commission's Maros Sefcovic and Northern Ireland's devolved administration, said a three-month grace period with lighter enforcement of EU rules should be extended beyond March. \nThe UK government wrote to the European Commission on Tuesday night to outline the changes it wanted made, which would continue temporary exemptions for supermarket goods, pharmaceuticals, chilled meats and parcels crossing from GB to Northern Ireland. \nAccording to a copy of a letter seen by the BBC, the UK would want these exemptions to stay in place until 1 January 2023.\nIt comes after hauliers experienced problems transporting goods from Great Britain.\nSome parcel deliveries were stopped and supermarkets struggled to restock some products last month, although some of these problems have since been resolved.\n\"Trust has been eroded, damage has been done and urgent action is therefore needed,\" Mr Gove told the House of Commons on Tuesday, adding that supermarkets and other businesses needed to be sure they could continue to supply consumers.\nMr Gove has also asked the EU to examine its decision to ban the import into Northern Ireland of some items like seed potatoes, and the UK wants the Irish government to be able to negotiate a deal with the UK to remove barriers to pets being taken across the Irish Sea. \nAhead of the meeting, Mr Sefcovic tweeted that the protocol was \"a cornerstone\" of the agreement between the UK and EU, and \"the only way to protect Good Friday Agreement\".\nWhat happens to parcels or dogs moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland might sound like small issues.\nBut they are huge, because they threaten to break one of the things that was part of the promise in the post-Brexit protocol - that what happened would not disrupt the daily lives of people living in Northern Ireland.\nAnd, as we have seen in the past few days, this combination of all of these small changes could destabilise the very sensitive balance in Northern Ireland between the two different communities.\nThe government has no intention of ditching this protocol. That is not going to happen, even though the past few days have given the DUP and some Eurosceptics reason to call again for it to be abandoned. \nBut the government is really clear that they want to very quickly persuade the EU, as one minister put it to me, to start being pragmatic about this, rather than being purist. \nWhen the Brexit transition period ended in January, Northern Ireland remained in the EU single market while the rest of the UK left, meaning that checks had to be carried out on goods arriving from Great Britain.\nUnionists have criticised these rules, known as the Northern Ireland protocol, as damaging to trade and posing a risk to UK unity. In recent days, graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas, referring to staff carrying out checks on goods at ports as \"targets\".\nStormont suspended physical checks on food consignments at two ports on Tuesday amid the security concerns, although police said paramilitary groups are not involved.\nMr Johnson said on Twitter that his commitment to people of Northern Ireland and the union was \"unshakeable\".\nHe called for \"urgent action from the EU to resolve outstanding problems\" with the way the protocol was implemented, to preserve the Good Friday Agreement and ensure \"Northern Ireland benefits from Brexit just like every other part of our United Kingdom\".\nRecent moves by the EU had \"undermined the protocol and understandably provoked concern\", he said.\nIreland's Mr Coveney said \"elements of protocol are causing problems\" and the two sides \"need to focus on improving\" it, but he said Brexit was to blame for growing tensions in Northern Ireland, rather than the protocol itself.\nHe told Today: \"Senior political figures need to talk seriously now about trying to diffuse tension which is clearly there and need to talk about how we can make protocol work effectively.\n\"[The protocol] is an Irish and British and EU negotiated solution, an agreed solution to try to limit the disruptive impact of Brexit on Ireland and Northern Ireland. \n\"What is causing all of this tension is Brexit, not the protocol. The protocol is an attempt to try and reduce tension and solve problems linked to Brexit.\"\nAmid a dispute with manufacturers over supplies, the EU on Friday briefly threatened to use an emergency measure to override part of the deal and restrict the export of vaccines. \nIt was concerned that Northern Ireland could be used as a way to bypass export controls, using its place in the single market as a backdoor to the rest of the UK.\nThe dispute has intensified pressure among some unionist politicians to end the checks on goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, with the DUP saying it intends to work with other unionist parties to send a message that Northern Ireland must be \"freed from the protocol\".\nMs Foster, the party's leader, is due to meet Mr Johnson on Wednesday morning, to discuss her concerns before attending the talks with the EU Commission in the afternoon. \nAlso at the talks will be Michelle O'Neill, Sinn Fein's vice-president and Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, who said the DUP was  \"whipping up hysteria\" while others were \"calling for calm and resolution\".\nMr Coveney said the move by the Commission on Friday had been \"a mistake\", adding: \"It should not have happened and would not have happened if there had been the appropriate consultation.\"\nPart of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, the NI protocol guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products.\nIt was introduced to avoid creating a hard border on the island of Ireland.\nInstead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nThis is because Northern Ireland in effect remains part of the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left.\nHowever, Article 16 of the protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nThe EU announced it would trigger the clause to control exports of vaccines to Northern Ireland, but later reversed the decision.\nUnionist parties in NI have been pressing the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain."

      "text": "The government has been defeated in the House of Lords on its post-Brexit Trade Bill, with peers backing a move to stop the UK doing deals with countries that abuse human rights. \nThey supported an amendment giving the High Court the right to determine if genocide has been committed. \nIf it decided it had, the government would then have to hold a debate to set out what it proposed to do. \nMinisters say they are are committed to working with Parliament on a solution. \nThe House of Lords has been considering the Trade Bill for a second time after MPs overturned a series of changes peers made in January. \nThe legislation enables the UK to strike new trade deals with countries after leaving the EU.\nBut there is concern over the human rights records of current and potential trading partners, including China and its treatment of the Uighur people.\nThe government says it has spoken out strongly against human rights abuses in China and around the world.\nCrossbench peer Lord Alton, who brought forward the amendment, said it was time \"to speak and to act\". \nUnder his plans, the High Court would be given the right to make a preliminary judgement on genocide and ministers would then be obliged to have a debate in Parliament if such human rights abuses were found to have occurred.\nMinisters would have to set out what they planned to do \"within a reasonable time\". \nSpeaking in the debate, Lord Alton said it was an attempt to \"impose a limitation\" on ministers where genocide was shown to have taken place. \nPeers backed his amendment by 359 votes to 188.\nThe government also lost votes on two other amendments.\nOne by Conservative Lord Lansley would give Parliament the opportunity to set negotiating terms for trade deals. \nThe other, by Labour's Lord Collins, would compel ministers to report on human rights before trade deals are considered.\nInvestment minister Lord Grimstone insisted that \"trade does not have to come at the expense of human rights\". \nHe said genocide was \"notoriously hard to prove\", but the government had \"some sympathy\" with calls to give Parliament a greater role to scrutinise where there were \"credible concerns\".\nLord Grimstone indicated that, if a parliamentary select committee published a report on genocide and sought a debate, the government would facilitate one, adding that human rights abuses could not be \"swept under the carpet\". \nBut many Conservative backbench MPs are uneasy at the government's approach.\nIn January, the government narrowly avoided defeat in the Commons when 33 of them voted to outlaw trade deals with countries judged to have committed genocide. \nThe Trade Bill will now return to the Commons for MPs to vote on the amendments, in the latest series of parliamentary back-and-forth between the two Houses, known as ping-pong."

      "tags": "Keighley,Lewis Hamilton,Marston Moretaine,Captain Tom Moore,NHS,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The memory of Captain Sir Tom Moore is to be marked \"properly and appropriately\", the government said. \nThe 100-year-old, who raised almost \u00a333m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday.\nHealth secretary Matt Hancock said he had \"touched the hearts of the nation and we should remember that\".\nMeanwhile, dozens of tributes have been left outside the veteran's home in Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire.\nWhen announcing his death via a family statement, his daughters Hannah Ingram-Moore and Lucy Teixeira said they \"shared laughter and tears\" with their father in their final few hours together.\nThey said his final year of fundraising had been \"nothing short of remarkable\".\nHe tested positive for Covid-19 last week. His family said due to other medication he was receiving for pneumonia, he was unable to be vaccinated.\nMr Hancock said Capt Sir Tom had been \"a symbol of people's resilience during an incredibly difficult year\".\n\"When the NHS was under pressure during the first lockdown - he didn't just sit at home, he asked the question 'what can I do to help?',\" he said.\n\"We should find a way to make sure we mark the memory of Captain Tom and thank him for the contribution he made to the NHS.\n\"I will ensure that we mark his contribution properly and appropriately at the right moment.\n\"I think everybody would welcome that... he touched the hearts of the nation and we should remember that.\"\nThere was a one-minute silence in the House of Commons in honour of Capt Sir Tom, and all victims of the pandemic, ahead of Prime Minister's Questions. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced there would be a national clap for Capt Sir Tom and \"all those health workers for whom he raised money\" at 18:00 GMT.\nAsked by a newspaper journalist later if he supported calls for a statue of Captain Sir Tom, the prime minister said the idea was \"an excellent one\". \n\"We will be working with his family to see what they think is most appropriate,\" he added. \nThe Army veteran won the nation's hearts by walking 100 laps of his Bedfordshire garden last spring during the first coronavirus lockdown, raising money for NHS Charities Together.\nThe fundraising group said that \"when the time is right\" it will also \"put together a suitable tribute... in honour of everything he did for the NHS and NHS charities\".\nCapt Sir Tom, originally from Keighley in West Yorkshire, had initially set out to raise \u00a31,000 by walking 82ft (25m)-loops of his garden.\nBut he eventually raised \u00a332,794,701 from more than 1.5 million supporters and was knighted by the Queen in July.\nThe charity said the total amount would rise to \u00a339m when Gift Aid was taken into account.\nMarston Moretaine's retired vicar, the Reverend Gill Webb, said she remembered him as a \"lovely gentleman\". \n\"He didn't have a stress-free life... but his attitude was always put your best foot forward, lift your chin up and meet what comes,\" she said.\n\"He'll be with us in spirit urging us onwards.\" \nA notice placed in the village by Marston Moreteyne School said the children had been \"lucky enough to be living next door to their very own superhero\".\n\"We have watched as Captain Tom, in his quiet dignity and compassion, showed us how to live out our values - to take positive action to help others in our time of need,\" the message said.\n\"We won't remember a caped crusader but a superhero who showed us how to spread kindness and compassion to a whole world of people.\"\nKarl Clark, landlord of The Bell pub in the village, said: \"He was just a brilliant fellow, you looked at him and you just had to smile. He just cheered you up. If you were having a really bad day he just made you feel that little bit better,\" he said.\nThe village postmaster, Bill Chandi, said he had been \"shellshocked\" at the news of Capt Sir Tom's death and, having known him for more than 20 years, he counted him as \"a dear friend, not just a customer\".\nHe said the Post Office handled about a quarter of a million 100th birthday cards for Sir Tom last year, and had already received more than 100 cards addressed to the family on Wednesday.\nChief nurse at the Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Liz Lees, said it had been their \"immense privilege\" to care for Capt Sir Tom.\n\"We share our deepest condolences and sympathies with his family and loved ones at this incredibly sad time,\" a statement read.\n\"We'd also like to say thank you, and pay tribute to [him] for the remarkable contribution he has made to the NHS.\"\nA Facebook group called \"Clap for Captain Sir Tom this Thur 4th Feb 2021. 7pm\" has more than 85,000 members. \nA BBC News special, Captain Tom: We Salute You, presented by Michael Ball, is being broadcast tonight at 19:30 GMT on BBC One and will be available on the BBC iPlayer.\nHave you benefited from Captain Tom's fundraising?

      "text": "Thousands of armed forces personnel are living in sub-standard accommodation, according to a report by the government's spending watchdog.\nThe National Audit Office said barracks had suffered from \"decades of under-investment\" by the Ministry of Defence. \nIssues with basics such as heating and hot water were among the common complaints, the report said.\nThe MoD said it had invested \u00a31.2bn over the last decade in improving military housing. \nBut the watchdog said there was still a \u00a31.5bn backlog of repairs and the MoD was failing in its commitment to provide high-quality subsidised housing.\nAs of last year, more than half of the armed forces - nearly 80,000 people - were occupying single living accommodation blocks, either on a full or part-time basis. \nOf those, the NAO found more than a third - 36% - were living in \"poorer grade\" accommodation, while almost 2,400 were in housing considered such bad quality that they were not charged any rent. \nFewer than half - 49% - were satisfied with the overall standard of their accommodation, compared with 58% in 2015, according to the armed forces continuous attitude survey. \nOther common issues included a lack of cooking facilities, limited storage space and poor or expensive wifi, the NAO said. \nDespite the MoD planning to spend \u00a31.5bn on renovation work over the next 10 years, the NAO said it could be \"some time\" before significant improvements were seen because of long-term under-investment. \nGareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: \"Problems with heating and hot water are not conditions that [members of the armed forces] should have to tolerate. \n\"MoD needs to get this right if it is to retain service personnel in the long term.\"\nLabour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said delaying repairs until the last-minute meant the MoD \"faces a bigger bill to get things up to scratch\". \n\"In the meantime, thousands of members of our armed forces are left living in sub-standard accommodation,\" she said.\n\"These are the people we ask to go out and fight for our country. The least they should be able to expect is a hot shower and a decent roof over their heads.\" \nAn MoD statement said: \"Our armed forces personnel are at the heart of everything we do and it is only right they are provided good quality and affordable living accommodation.\n\"We have invested \u00a31.2bn over the last decade on construction and upgrades of our accommodation and continue to invest in a range of new-build and renovation projects.\"\nThe department would \"carefully consider\" the NAO's recommendations, the statement added.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. \nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK are being offered alternative vaccines.\nSome recently immunised people have suffered unusual clots, including a type in the brain called cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). \nThis is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. \nExperts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, but is more finely balanced for younger adults. \nAs a precaution, regulators are continuing to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.\nAnd adults under 40 in the UK will be offered a different Covid vaccine.\nSafety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. \nThe principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.\nIf the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. \nThat means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.\nHalf are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. \nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. \nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nApproval is only given in the UK if the regulator is happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. \nIndependent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it.\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. \nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. \nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). \nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. \nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. \nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. \nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example.

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's youngest pupils are likely to return to the classroom full time from 22 February as schools start a phased reopening.\nThe move will include all pupils in P1-P3 as well as pre-school children.\nThere will also be a part-time return, but on a very limited basis, for senior secondary pupils to allow them to complete work for national qualifications. \nA final decision will be taken on the partial reopening in a fortnight. \nFurther details of the next phase of the gradual return to schools will also be set out at that point, alongside a timescale for the return of in-person learning for colleges and universities.\nScotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, questioned why the first minister had not mentioned any need for P1-P3 pupils to socially distance, and said it wanted to see the scientific evidence to justify the approach. \nThe union added: \"Clearly, any school return remains contingent upon continued progress on community suppression of the virus and that is not a given so we need to see infection levels coming down substantially before the return date can be confirmed.\"\nAll of the country's other lockdown restrictions will remain in place until at least the end of the month, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. \nBut she said she was \"cautiously optimistic\" that some gradual easing of the rules could be possible from early March. \nThe first minister also announced that travellers coming to Scotland from any country may be asked to quarantine in a hotel - which goes further than systems announced in the rest of the UK.\nBusiness groups have called on the Scottish government to provide firms with a route map out of lockdown. \nMs Sturgeon said the government intended to allow \"small increases\" in existing provision for children and young people with significant additional support needs from 22 February.\nAnd she said there would be a \"significant expansion\" of testing in schools and nurseries in the coming weeks, with tests available for both staff and senior secondary pupils.\nThe first minister said older pupils will only be able to return after 22 February to ensure practical work important to achieving qualifications is completed.\nOnly between 5% and 8% of a secondary school's pupil roll will be able to be present at any one time.\nMs Sturgeon also stressed that the schools announcement was dependent on the virus continuing to be suppressed.\nSchools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since the Christmas holidays, with learning being done at home and online. \nHealth experts have warned that the country risks facing a \"lost generation\" unless a way can be found to get young people back to some sort of normality. \nInterim Scottish Labour leader Jackie Baillie said that most children will have missed more than half a year of normal, in-person schooling as she called for greater investment to be put in place \"for some time to come\" to help them catch up.\nAnd the Scottish Conservatives accused the government of failing to get the proper digital support in place for home learning, which it said would further widen the attainment gap between wealthier and less well off pupils.\nThe current stay-at-home lockdown, like the last one, is a long slog. It will last what's left of the winter. But as we move into spring, change is coming.\nPlans to re-open nurseries and schools from 22 February for the youngest children will not only restore their full time education but will allow some parents to resume work.\nHowever, the phased return of schools could add to the burden some families have to carry.\nIf, for instance, you have a young child to get to school and an older pupil to organise for online learning at home, that could be harder to manage than either having both at home or both in school.\nIt is not clear how quickly full time schooling will resume for all age groups.\nIt will be another fortnight before the first minister sets out how wider restrictions might be eased from the beginning of March.\nIt is already clear that process will be gradual and that some measures like social distancing, wearing face coverings and avoiding international travel will not be lifted anytime soon.\nMs Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that she wanted to see children back in full-time, face to face education as quickly as possible.\nAnd she said she was acutely aware of the wider health, developmental and social harms being experienced by young people while they were not in school, and of the pressure school closures was putting on working parents and family life. \nBut she said the current state of the pandemic and the need to protect the country as much as possible from the virus meant that her options for reopening schools were limited.\nShe added: \"The judgment the Cabinet arrived at this morning, based on the advice of our expert advisers, is that if we all agree to abide with the lockdown restrictions for a bit longer - so that our progress in suppressing the virus continues - we can begin a phased, albeit gradual, return to school from 22 February.\"\nAll of mainland Scotland and some islands are currently under the country's toughest level four restrictions, with non-essential shops closed and strict travel rules in force. \nAnd there has been growing concern in recent days that Scotland's vaccination programme is lagging behind the rest of the UK.\nThe country had vaccinated the lowest percentage of its adult population - 13.4% - of all of the four UK nations by Tuesday.\nThe figure for England stood at 18.4% while it was 17% in Wales and 15.6% in Northern Ireland.\nThe UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has written to Ms Sturgeon offering the help of the English health department and the Ministry of Defence to accelerate the rollout in Scotland.\nMr Jack said: \"I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as  closely as possible.\"\nA further 34,881 people were given their first does of the vaccine in Scotland since Monday, the highest daily total so far.\nThe country will need to average about 40,000 a day if it is to hit its target of vaccinating everyone over the age of 70 and the extremely clinically vulnerable by the end of next week.\nIt brings the total number of people to have received the vaccine in Scotland, which has about a twelfth of the UK population, to 610,778.\nThe UK as a whole had vaccinated just over 9.6 million people by Tuesday. \nCovid-19 prevalence in Scotland has fallen under the lockdown regulations from 302 per 100,000 in the week ending 8 January to 136 per 100,000 last week.\nTest positivity has also reduced to an average of 6.6% in the seven days up to 29 January - still higher than the 5% that the World Health Organisation considers to be indicative of an outbreak being under control.\nMs Sturgeon said: \"Pressure on our NHS continues to be severe. The number of Covid patients being treated in hospital remains around 30% above the high point of the first wave last April.\n\"However, hospital admissions in this wave appear to have peaked on January 12. They have now stabilised and are starting to reduce, albeit slowly.\"\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

He warned that the only alternative would be to hold early elections but that would leave the country in a state of uncertainty, eAnsa news agency reports. \nItaly's 5-star movement says it will not back a government led by Mr Draghi, a senior party source told Reuters news agency. \nDuring Mr Draghi's eight years at the European Central Bank (ECB), he steered the eurozone through the financial crisis.\nHe has not commented on Wednesday's meeting which was scheduled shortly after talks with the former coalition government fell apart. \nThe government was sent into chaos after former PM Matteo Renzi pulled his small, liberal Italia Viva party out of the coalition over Mr Conte's plans for spending EU recovery funds. He said he would only return if Mr Conte accepted a list of demands. \nMr Conte survived a vote of confidence in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, last week. He then won a Senate vote, but without an absolute majority.\nLast week, he resigned in the hope of forming a stronger coalition government."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has signed three executive actions seeking to reunite migrant families split up by a Trump-era policy and ordering a review of his predecessor's wider immigration agenda.\nIn an attempt to deter illegal immigration, President Donald Trump's administration separated undocumented adults from children as they crossed the US-Mexico border.\nMr Biden's orders will set up a task force to try to reunite the estimated 600-700 children who are still apart from their families.\nThe Trump administration split up at least 5,500 children from adults along the border between 2017-18.\nThe administration of US President Barack Obama - whom Mr Biden served as vice-president - also separated undocumented children from adults at the border, though much more rarely, say activists.\nOne of Mr Biden's orders will set up an inter-agency task force - led by the newly confirmed Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas - to oversee family reunifications\nMr Biden's second and third orders signed on Tuesday order a review of Mr Trump's immigration policies that curtailed asylum, slowed legal immigration into the US, and cancelled funding to foreign countries.\nSpeaking at the White House, Mr Biden said: \"We're going to work to undo the moral and national shame of the previous administration that literally not figuratively ripped children from the arms of their families, their mothers and fathers, at the border and with no plan, none whatsoever, to reunify the children who are still in custody and their parents.\"\nMr Biden has also proposed legislation to grant legal status and a path to citizenship to all of the estimated 11 million undocumented people in the US.\nBut analysts say the new president has so far avoided reversing Mr Trump's hardline policies in order to avoid a surge in illegal immigration at the southern border. \nAt Tuesday's White House briefing, press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration was committed to building a \"moral\" and \"humane\" immigration system. But until that happened, she added, now was \"not the time to come to the United States\". \nBy Patricia Sulbar\u00e1n Lovera, BBC Mundo\nNine-year-old Luisa, from El Salvador, is currently the migrant child who has spent the longest time in the custody of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to legal aid organisations. \nLuisa sometimes sounds wise beyond her years. She has had to write letters to legislators, asking authorities to release her and Ariana, her mother, from a US migrant detention centre in Dilley, Texas.\nLuisa is tired of her situation. \"I have spent two Christmases here,\" she says. \"I miss cooking food. I would like to cook my own food. I have learned a little bit of English. I want to learn more at school, but away from here.\"\nHer mother says the girl does not like the food at the detention centre, and that her behaviour has changed as time goes by. \"She only eats fruit, and sometimes not even that,\" she adds.\nAriana, 31, adds that she herself has fallen ill from anxiety. \n\"I am taking pills, and some time ago I experienced an attack. I did not know what it was. The paramedics told me it was an anxiety attack.\n\"I sometimes feel like it is not me who is in there.\"\nBy Ang\u00e9lica M Casas, BBC News\nAs President Biden starts chipping away at Trump-era immigration policies through a series of executive orders, it's still difficult for some immigration advocates to celebrate.\n\"The expectation is that this administration take bold, decisive action by swiftly reversing policies,\" says Alejandra Gomez, the co-executive director of Living United for Change in Arizona, a grassroots organisation. \n\"It's a good first step. But while review of Trump's immigration policies is important, we need action. That's why those of us who can vote elected him.\"\nSo far, none of President Biden's orders have directly reversed any Trump immigration policies.\n\"Our immigrant community experienced a lot of suffering over the last four years,\" says Ms Gomez.\nShe says Mr Biden knows what the immigrant community wants. \n\"We ultimately are seeking to defund Immigration and Customs Enforcement and we are looking for relief and a path to citizenship for 11 million people.\"\nUnder a \"zero-tolerance\" immigration policy adopted in April 2018, adult undocumented migrants crossing the US-Mexico border were criminally charged and jailed.\nThese offences had previously been treated as civil violations.\nBecause the children of prosecuted migrants could not legally be charged with any crime, they were not permitted to be jailed with their parents, which led to the youngsters being placed in shelters or foster care.\nImages and videos of children on sleeping mats in crowded detention facilities sparked a nationwide furore, leading Mr Trump to halt the policy that June.\nLast week, the Biden justice department formally revoked the dormant policy.\nHowever, the chain-link enclosures where some of the children were detained were built during the Obama presidency. Some 60,000 unaccompanied minors stopped at the southern border were detained in these cells during one summer alone back in 2014.\nObama-era officials have said migrant family separations were unusual during his presidency, for example, in cases where there was reason to suspect trafficking, though the exact numbers are unclear.\nMr Obama's top immigration adviser Cecilia Munoz - who in 2011 defended the migrant family separations as the inevitable result of a \"broken system\" - served on Mr Biden's presidential transition team."

      "tags": "Public health,Cardiff,Cardiff University,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The manager of Cardiff University's Covid testing system quit because he thought it was \"fatally flawed\".\nNeil Evans said he thought results were not reliable before the system's launch and the university wanted to start it too quickly ahead of the autumn term. \nHe left his role on 23 September and the system was rolled out in October.\nThe university said it \"completely rejects\" Mr Evans's claims and that the system led to \"hundreds\" of asymptomatic cases being identified.\nAllan Wilson, the president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said he had some concerns with the system. \nCardiff University said it had carried out about 25,000 tests since the system was launched and that the programme helped to identify \"a few hundred\" asymptomatic positive cases. \nIt said these people then self-isolated rather than \"unknowingly spreading infection\". \nThe system involved students and staff giving a saliva sample, which then underwent a PCR test. \nPeople who tested positive were then told to get a confirmatory NHS swab test. \nThe university \"estimates concordance with the NHS test at around 90%\".\nMr Evans worked as a service manager at the facility in August and September while the system was being developed, before resigning on 23 September, two weeks before the programme was launched. \nHe said he was happy to get the job as he felt the service could help staff and students return safely to campus in the autumn. \nBut he said he became concerned at what he saw as the university's desire to introduce the service \"at pace\" when he felt more time was needed to validate the system by testing its results against known samples from an NHS laboratory.\nHe said: \"It was fatally flawed for various reasons.\n\"You couldn't trust the test results, fundamentally there's no trust in any of the test results,\" he added.\n\"So all of those students will be giving saliva under false pretences that you get a result back either positive or negative.\n\"But for me at that point, I couldn't have signed off on those results, because I wouldn't have been happy with the validation of the process. \n\"The whole process needed a few more months and a bit more validation, a bit more accreditation, a bit more forethought and then, yes, it would have been a really good service.\"\nMr Evans said Public Health Wales (PHW) shared his concerns about the risk of false results. \n\"PHW didn't want it to happen at all and they saw it as more of a hindrance than a help,\" he said.\nWhat has the university said? \nA Cardiff University spokesman said: \"We completely reject the claim that our screening service was not ready to go live. \n\"We have been clear throughout that our screening service is not (currently) accredited by the regulatory authorities. \n\"However, our screening service has been recognised by relevant authorities and we have responded to requests such as those to test students on NHS placements ahead of the Christmas break.\n\"During the early stages of the project, we took advice from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on all control and process requirements. \n\"Any positives identified by our in-house screening service in partnership with PHW are subject to confirmatory testing through an NHS swab test.\n\"Very few other national testing programmes had this level of cross-test validation in place.\n\"We also completely reject the claim that there was insufficient validation to have confidence in the results. \n\"Our validation processes are vigorous and thorough.\" \nMr Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said: \"My primary concern is the use of saliva as a sample for a PCR. \n\"This is unusual practice within the UK and as far as I'm aware is not used in any other diagnostic laboratory setting. \nHe said advising positive cases to get a confirmatory test was a \"reasonable step\" but added he was concerned over \"what confidence we can have in negative results without validation\".\n\"I think the issue of giving negative results out without that confidence is potentially the actions of individuals that think they're negative when, in actual fact, could be positive for the disease,\" he added. \nIn response to Mr Wilson's concerns over saliva samples, the university said: \"This was unusual practice for the UK before the Covid-19 pandemic, but in line with some other university Covid-19 screening services and is increasingly seen as a valid sample for PCR diagnostics. \n\"Saliva is used routinely in Covid-19 screening elsewhere in the world. \n\"The Cardiff University screening service is not a clinical diagnostic test. All positive results must undergo further validation. In order to do this, all staff and students returning a positive or inconclusive test result will be instructed to book a confirmatory test through NHS Wales.\"\nOn the validation process, it said it has not requested negative samples externally analysed by PHW \"as we are mindful of the pressures on their services\". \nA PHW spokeswoman said: \"Public Health Wales was not a delivery partner in coronavirus testing set up by Cardiff University and so we are not able to comment further.\"\nCardiff University said it has an \"excellent working relationship with PHW\" and that senior representatives \"have acknowledged the university's screening service and its contribution to ensuring a safe campus\".\nYou can see more on this story on Wales Live tonight at 10.35 on BBC One Wales"

      "tags": "Blaenavon,Endometriosis,Women's health,Welsh government,Periods",
      "text": "A woman who had to wait 11 years before an endometriosis diagnosis has joined calls for menstrual wellbeing to be taught in schools. \nCharl Davies, of Blaenavon, Torfaen, said she had to \"suffer in silence\".\nMember of the Senedd Suzy Davies, who has also suffered, has called for the topic to be compulsory in schools. \nThe Welsh Government said it expected one of the groups working on the new curriculum to consider topics like menstrual wellbeing in more detail. \nCharity Endometriosis UK said this provided hope, but not certainty, to those struggling with the condition.\nIt said women in Wales were waiting on average for nine years for a diagnosis, compared to a UK average of eight years. \nIt also said women were now having to wait longer because of delays related to coronavirus - but said a greater awareness of the condition from a younger age could help reduce diagnosis times.  \nEndometriosis is a condition where tissue, like that in the lining of the womb, grows elsewhere in the body, often around reproductive organs, the bowel and bladder.\nLike the womb lining, it builds up and bleeds every month, but with no way of escape, blood becomes trapped and causes inflammation, pain and the formation of scar tissue. \nThe condition, which affects one in 10 women in the UK, can cause pain, heavy periods and infertility. \nThere is no cure, but treatments can reduce symptoms. \nCharl Davies, 28, started to experience symptoms of the condition at the age of 10 and said the pain was so bad it would cause her to become breathless and faint. \nShe said she spent \"most of her time as a child\" crying over the disease and would tell her mother she was in so much pain she could not go to school. \nLast year, 17 years after her symptoms started and 11 after she began looking for a diagnosis, she got one after two laparoscopies on the NHS and a private consultation. \nIt was a \"bittersweet moment\", she said.\n\"In that moment I felt like, wow, all these years. Nobody listened to me. And I felt really emotional.\"\nShe thinks she would have found a correlation between her symptoms and the condition if she had been taught about it in school, but instead was left to \"suffer in silence\". \n\"I feel like it would benefit so many people and stop endometriosis in its tracks rather than letting it progress over the years, attaching to other organs, it takes years for it to do that,\" she said. \nRowan Walsh, from Monmouthshire, was diagnosed with endometriosis in 2017.\nShe said her symptoms started aged 11 when her periods started: \"I knew my periods weren't normal, they were just so heavy,\" she said.\n\"It is debilitating every single day, not just during your period like some people think - it is every day.\" \nShe told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales if she had been told about it in school it would have helped: \"Having that education in school would have made such a massive difference in terms of knowing what to fight for.\"\nFair Treatment for the Women of Wales, a patient-led women's health equality charity, has been campaigning for menstrual wellbeing education in Wales for the last two years and is urging the government to act.\nIn a statement, the group said: \"We believe that menstrual wellbeing needs to be on the curriculum in Wales to ensure that we overcome taboos and misconceptions which see periods and associated issues like heavy bleeding and pain either go unspoken or dismissed as being 'normal'.\n\"Far too many pupils are not getting the best out of their education as a result of their periods, and future health and prospects are also affected.\"\nSuzy Davies, the education spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives' Senedd group, said she was diagnosed with endometriosis in her late 40s. \nShe proposed an amendment to make menstrual wellbeing a mandatory part of the new curriculum, as it was in England in 2020, but this was rejected by a majority of the Children, Young People and Education Committee. \nMs Davies said she was told \"it's a mess in there\" when she was diagnosed, but said it helped to explain the \"nasty\" symptoms she had experienced for two years. \nShe said: \"There were times when I was on the verge of fainting in work, which I just put down to something else completely and it's not. It turns out to be endometriosis and the effect it has on you.\" \nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams told the committee she agreed it was an important topic and she would work with one of the groups developing the curriculum guidance to see what opportunities there were to include it.  \nMs Davies said she planned to bring back the amendment at a later stage of the curriculum bill. \nThe Welsh Government said: \"Growing up has a critical impact on learners' health and wellbeing. The expectation within the new curriculum is that schools consider a range of issues that affect learners' physical health and help them understand and manage developmental changes, including puberty and conditions such as endometriosis.\n\"The Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) working group is currently developing draft guidance which will form part of the Curriculum for Wales framework. We expect the group to consider topics such as menstrual wellbeing in more detail.\"  \nYou can see more on this story on Wales Live at 22:35 GMT on Wednesday on BBC One Wales, and on the BBC iPlayer"

      "tags": "Harry Dunn crash,Croughton",
      "text": " The woman accused of killing Harry Dunn was \"employed by an intelligence agency in the US\" at the time of the crash, a court has heard.\nMr Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike was in a crash with a car near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire in 2019.\nSuspect Anne Sacoolas returned to the US, claiming diplomatic immunity, and an extradition request was blocked.\nA court in Virginia has heard her work was \"especially a factor\" in her leaving the UK.\nHer barrister told the court she fled the UK for \"security issues\" and feared she would \"not get a fair trial\" if she returned.\nThe comments about her role were made at a court in the state, where an application to dismiss a civil claim for damages submitted by Mr Dunn's family is being heard.\nWhen asked by the judge why Mrs Sacoolas had \"fled\" the UK, her barrister John McGavin said he could not respond \"completely candidly\".\n\"I know the answer but I cannot disclose it,\" he said.\nThe statement in a US court that Anne Sacoolas was a US intelligence official is a potentially enormous and important twist in the family's fight for justice - and it raises further questions about what the Foreign Office knew about her status in the UK. \nThe US long ago signed an agreement that its staff at RAF Croughton could not claim diplomatic immunity for actions beyond their duties. In other words, they could be potentially prosecuted for a crime. \nBut the High Court ruled last year that Ms Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity because that deal - known as a waiver - did not include the dependants of US staff. \nIt was an extraordinary and unintended loophole that has now been closed under a revised agreement between the countries. \nIf Ms Sacoolas did indeed work for US intelligence, that could mean the US had no right to claim in 2019 that she had immunity in the first place. Her actions may have been covered under the Croughton waiver, or another US-UK agreement that we don't know about. \nAnd that's why the family now want the Foreign Office to clarify what her status was.\nSpeaking after the hearing, family spokesman Radd Seiger called on the UK government to \"urgently reinvestigate\" whether Mrs Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity, given \"the admission in open court by Mrs Sacoolas's counsel that she was employed by US intelligence services at the time of the crash\".\nUnder the agreements at RAF Croughton dating back to 1995, anyone working at the base from the US as part of the \"administrative and technical staff\" would have their immunity pre-waived, meaning they would not be immune from criminal jurisdiction.\nThe Dunn's barrister Agnieszka Fryszman had earlier told the court the British government had endorsed the civil claim and called on the judge not to dismiss it.\nMrs Sacoolas, whose husband was based at RAF Croughton, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving after the crash.\nA Home Office extradition request was refused by Donald Trump's secretary of state Mike Pompeo in January 2020 and last week the new Biden administration said the decision was final.\nThe judge said he would decide on the application ahead of a further hearing at the same court on 17 February.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "I was out walking my dog last March when I received a text telling me I was clinically vulnerable and needed to start shielding immediately.\nBeing totally honest, I burst into tears when I saw it - knowing I wouldn't be able to go out for a walk or a run, or even go to the supermarket.\nI've had an auto-immune disease since the age of ten and take immunosuppressants, which have controlled it really well and let me lead a relatively normal life.\nBut one thing I've always struggled with is my weakened immune system. Before lockdown I'd get common colds that would knock me out for weeks and constantly need antibiotics for various infections I pick up.\nI'd certainly let myself wonder about what would happen to me if I did catch coronavirus and working as a journalist every day certainly didn't help that feeling of anxiety.\nSo when I got a text last week offering me the chance to book in my first vaccine, I was absolutely overjoyed.\nI immediately texted my parents, my sister and my friends - it felt like the biggest thing that had happened to me in a long time.\nAs I walked to the vaccine centre on Saturday morning (in my new trainers and a full face of make-up, because why not?), I allowed myself to dream.\nI thought about all the things I used to take for granted, but now miss so much.\nSpontaneously planning a night out three hours in advance. The excitement you get before going to a gig. The countdown and frantic packing days before a holiday. Not that we can do any of that just yet - but still, it's good to dream.\nA paramedic gave me the jab and handed me a card with my batch number on, which now felt like the most precious thing I owned.\nIt was my ticket to a return to normal life. \nI called some fellow twentysomethings who've also had to shield and have got the jab.\nEl Afzal is a 24-year-old from Manchester, whose severe asthma and skin condition have meant she's also had to shield.\n\"Everyone's struggled with lockdown but when you're clinically vulnerable there's a different stress level,\" she says.\n\"I was getting all the texts and letters from the government telling me I was more likely to get severe Covid and that's been really hard in terms of anxiety.\"\nEl found it very tough seeing her friends going out - even in a limited, socially-distanced way.\n\"It feels like a big kick in the face when you're sat at home and you can't even go to the shop.\"\nShe says her experience of trying to get the vaccine was tough at first because her health conditions meant she couldn't receive the Pfizer jab.\n\"I've had the Oxford one now and I'm really grateful that I've been able to have it at this point and at least get my first jab.\n\"There's a sense of relief and I can sleep through the night and actually know I've done everything that I possibly can to ensure I'm as safe as possible,\" she says.\n\"I remember sitting down with my family eating lunch and my mum looked at her phone and she'd got the text - I had my phone charging in the other room and I went to grab it.\n\"It was incredible to see that message - I was absolutely buzzing.\"\nGeorgie Hodges is a 20-year-old student from London who has been shielding since the start of the pandemic due to a genetic condition. She says lockdown's had a really bad impact on her education and social life.\n\"My attention span has completely dropped in the last year and I can't sit down and focus - I also have joint pain and mobility issues,\" she says.\nGeorgie, along with her key worker parents, has received the first dose of the vaccine  but doesn't expect her life to suddenly change, even when restrictions are relaxed.\n\"I won't be going out as normal until I get the second part but I'm actually quite overwhelmed with what to do,\" she says.\n\"I find going out for a walk quite overwhelming at the moment, so as much as I'd love to say I'll be going out with my friends, I don't know what I'll do.\"\nBut Georgie says she \"can't put into words\" how it feels to know that she's on her way back to a normal life.\n\"It's finally light at the end of the tunnel.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "text": "It is \"not practical\" to completely close the UK's borders given the amount of medicines and food imported into the country, the prime minister has said. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for tougher restrictions to prevent new coronavirus variants entering the UK.\nBoris Johnson said the government had already tightened travel restrictions to reduce the spread of the virus.\nHe said it would be going ahead with its plan for quarantine hotels for people arriving from Covid hotspots.\nIt is not yet clear when the scheme - announced a week ago - will start or when there will be further details.\nSpeaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said government scientists had recommended \"a complete pre-emptive closure of borders\".\nIn response, Mr Johnson said: \"Actually, Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies) did not recommend a complete ban and they say travel bans should not be relied upon to stop the importation of new variants.\n\"But we do have one of the toughest regimes in the world.\"\nRules around international travel were tightened last month, meaning all travellers must self-isolate for 10 days when they return to the UK.\nThe government also announced plans to make people quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels when arriving in the UK from certain \"high risk\" countries, where new coronavirus variants have been identified.\nThe prime minister said at Wednesday evening's Downing Street briefing that Health Secretary Matt Hancock would make a statement on Thursday to give further details, although No 10 later clarified to say this was not happening.\nLabour chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee Yvette Cooper tweeted in response: \"Oh for heaven's sake. Who is in charge of this borders policy? When will we get details? Does anyone have a grip?\"\nThe UK has placed 33 high-risk countries on a so-called \"red list\", including most of South America, southern Africa and Portugal.\nScotland has announced it will extend the measures to all travellers.\nSir Keir said the government's new border arrangements were \"still weeks away\" from being introduced and would only affect direct flights from some countries.\nHe asked whether the prime minister was saying that \"quarantining all arrivals would make no difference to fighting new variants of the virus\", or that it was \"too difficult to do it\". \nMr Johnson responded by saying that 75% of the UK's medicines come into the country from the European mainland, 45% of food, while 250,000 businesses rely on imports. \n\"It is not practical to completely close off this country as he seems to be suggesting,\" he said.\nIntroducing quarantine hotels is a logistical challenge. \nThe government needs to make sure hotels are ready. That doesn't just mean securing enough rooms and making sure all the guests can have meals delivered, but also coming up with policies around things like security if a guest tries to leave early. \nThe government could use existing guidelines written up by countries such as New Zealand as a template. \nAirlines and airports also have questions about how this will work and some areas are complicated. For instance, the policy currently only applies to arrivals from 33 countries - all of whom will arrive on indirect flights.\nShould airlines separate passengers from low and high-risk countries onboard? \nBut the policy also requires compliance from passengers. If passengers split their tickets and don't declare they've been in one of the 33 high-risk countries, how will the government keep track? \nThere are plenty of questions from all quarters about how to make this policy effective. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps also defended the government's decision not to extend the hotel quarantine policy to arrivals from all countries. \nHe told the Commons Transport Committee: \"The idea that the UK could completely batten down its hatches and remain battened down for a year is mistaken. But also the evidence that that is the only thing you need to do, or primary thing you need to do, is pretty shaky.\"\nMr Shapps also said the hotel quarantine scheme would not affect many people. \n\"The 33 countries on the so-called red list do not have direct flights\u2026 so the numbers we would expect to see returning would be quite low,\" he said."

      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Perth,Western Australia,Australia climate,Coronavirus pandemic,Australia",
      "text": "Hundreds of Australians have fled to evacuation centres as a bushfire on the outskirts of the locked-down city of Perth continues to grow and threaten communities.\nThe blaze - the largest the city has seen in years - has burnt through 9,000 hectares, destroying 71 homes. Six firefighters have suffered injuries.\nFire services were expecting further challenging conditions on Wednesday.\nThey urged communities near the blaze to prepare to leave or take shelter.\nThe Western Australia (WA) capital is in the middle of a coronavirus lockdown, complicating safety advice messages for Perth's two million residents.\nState officials have urged people to prioritise their immediate safety over the virus risk, which is considered very low. Perth entered a five-day lockdown - due to end Friday - over just one locally acquired infection.\n\"The important thing is the preservation of life. So, if you're quarantining and you're required to evacuate, you should just evacuate,\" said WA fire commissioner Darren Klemm.\nOfficials have urged people to wear masks and self-isolate where possible at evacuation centres.\nThe Wooroloo fire, which started on Monday, has a 100km (62 miles) perimeter and is burning about 30km (18.5 miles) east of central Perth. \nStrong winds on Tuesday caused it to spread rapidly and made it \"near impossible\" for firefighters to suppress, official said. Embers were reported 5km ahead of the firefront.\nThe winds were forecast to return to highs of 75km/h later on Wednesday, potentially driving the already \"erratic\" blaze to new populated areas.\nEvacuation warnings have been issued for communities north and north-east of Perth - including the suburbs of Shady Hills, Bullsbrook, The Vines and Aveley.\nOn Tuesday, Perth was also smothered in smoke which turned skies a hazy orange and at times rained ash over suburban homes.\nParts of the city were rated the worst in Australia for air quality. Officials issued public health warnings urging people to stay inside and avoid inhaling the smoke.\nPerth has endured days of temperatures over 30C (86F) as well as extended dry conditions. \nOn Wednesday, WA Premier Mark McGowan said the state faced an unprecedented situation: \"A full lockdown and raging bushfires. It will test us all.\"\nResidents not near the fire have been urged to follow health orders and stay at home.\nThe city entered a snap lockdown on Sunday after Western Australia's first local infection in 10 months. No new cases have been reported since then.\nAustralia suffered extreme bushfires in its most-populated eastern states last summer, but those areas have largely experienced cooler and wetter conditions this year - influenced by a La Nina weather phenomenon.\nAuthorities had predicted that the other side of the country - Western Australia - would see the greatest fire danger this summer.\n\"Western Australia has largely missed out on the rainfall in 2020 and conditions are very dry, with parts of the south and south west coasts expecting above normal fire conditions through summer,\" warned the Bushfires and Natural Hazards Central Resource Centre last December.\nOn Tuesday, deputy fire commissioner Craig Waters said the area had not seen such large fires historically but \"in the last few years, we have seen increased fire behaviour with rapid escalation overnight\".\n\"The changing climate... and moisture deficit in the soil is impacting how the fire behaves,\" he said.\nAustralia has warmed on average by 1.4C since national records began in 1910, according to its science and weather agencies.\nThat's led to an increase in the number of extreme heat events, as well as increased fire danger days."

      "tags": "Marston Moretaine,Captain Tom Moore,NHS,British Army,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Captain Sir Tom Moore won the nation's hearts with his extraordinary fundraising efforts for National Health Service charities.\nThe retired Army officer served in India and Myanmar, also known as Burma, during World War Two but it was by walking laps around his garden that he became known to millions.\nWhen he was 99, he was catapulted into the global spotlight with his attempt to raise an initial \u00a31,000 for charity.\nEarly in April 2020, with the aid of his walking frame and a steely determination, he vowed to complete 100 laps of his patio before his 100th birthday at the end of that month.\nThe war veteran was inspired to help the health service after receiving treatment for skin cancer of the head, and a broken hip after a fall in 2018.\nHe described the NHS staff who helped him through this as \"marvellous\", and pledged to help those same \"super\" people who were working on the front line during the coronavirus pandemic.\nHis family thought reaching the \u00a31,000 mark would be \"a real stretch\" but, as press coverage of his efforts increased, so did the donations.\nBy the time he completed his 100 laps - on 16 April 2020 - Captain Tom, as he had become affectionately known, had raised more than \u00a312m for NHS Charities Together.\nIn 2007, he had moved from Kent to Bedfordshire to be with his youngest daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, and her family.\nIt was here, in Marston Moretaine, that the idea of raising relatively modest funds for a charity supporting the NHS was hatched.\nCapt Sir Tom began walking - planning on 10 laps at a time of the 25-metre (82ft) loop in his back garden - and the donations began mounting up.\nEvery million was another milestone, but the veteran, who became a well-known face on national television, took it all in his stride.\nEver modest about the challenge he had set himself, Capt Sir Tom was nevertheless astounded by the generosity of donors, describing it as \"completely out of this world\".\n\"It's all for the sake of the nurses and the NHS we have, because they are doing such a magnificent job,\" he said at the time.\n\"Every penny that we get, they deserve every one of it.\"\nHe was described as a \"one-man fundraising machine\" by the Duke of Cambridge, while both the prime minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Capt Sir Tom was \"an inspiration\" to everyone.\nNot only did his efforts encourage thousands to donate to the fundraising appeal, but he inspired many to join his campaign to raise both awareness and money for those working in, and supporting, the NHS.\nFrom a teenage girl learning to walk again on a treadmill as part of her recovery from a stroke, to a non-verbal boy with autism - who wrote \"He is a hero to us,\" as he embarked on his own challenge to walk for the NHS - people set themselves their own challenges, buoyed by the former soldier.\nAge, it seemed, was no barrier - as Capt Sir Tom was proving.\nDozens dusted off their own walking frames and took to the streets to prove they could play their own part in the drive to raise funds.\nOne woman completed a marathon by walking laps near her Berkshire home, at the age of 104.\n\"Tom, I've done it,\" she laughed, as she finished her challenge.\nA week before his 100th birthday, Capt Sir Tom became the oldest person ever to get to number one in the UK singles charts when his duet of You'll Never Walk Alone - with singer Michael Ball - took the top spot.\nHis 100th birthday on 30 April 2020 was marked with an RAF flypast, personal birthday greetings from the Queen and prime minister, and he was made an honorary colonel of the British Army.\n\"I'm still Captain Tom, that's who I really am but if people choose to call me colonel, well, thank you very much,\" he replied.\nThe following month it was announced he would be awarded a knighthood for his fundraising efforts and would be known as Captain Sir Thomas Moore \"under Ministry of Defence protocol\".\nOn 17 July 2020, he was knighted in the grounds of Windsor Castle, in the Queen's first official engagement in person since the lockdown period began in March.\nHis youngest daughter said at the time of his fundraising efforts that her father had become a \"beacon of hope\" during challenging times.\nAnd indeed, Capt Sir Tom always seemed to know just the right thing to say to buoy the nation's spirits as the public tried to abide by government regulations to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"To all those people who are finding it difficult at the moment, the sun will shine on you again, and the clouds will go away,\" he said.\n\"Tomorrow will be a good day\" - another example of his positivity - became a hashtag on social media posts.\nThe proud Yorkshireman completed his 100 laps of his garden live on television in April 2020, with a Guard of Honour from 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment and a rousing round of applause from his family.\nBy the time he closed his fundraising page at midnight on his 100th birthday, Capt Sir Tom had raised \u00a332,794,701 for charities supporting the NHS, from more than one-and-a-half-million global donors.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "The Hollywood film Contagion showed the importance of securing enough Covid vaccines for use once they had been approved, the health secretary said.\nMatt Hancock said he had watched the film - which is about a deadly virus - and insisted the UK ordered enough jabs for its population.\nHe told LBC Radio the 2011 movie also shows there is a \"huge row\" about who should be given the vaccine first.\nIt led to the UK setting out early its \"order of priority\" for the jabs.\nContagion, which stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Matt Damon, looks at what would happen in the event of a virus spreading around the world.\nMr Hancock said in the film it shows the \"highest stress\" around the vaccine programme is after it starts getting rolled out.\nHe said the movie was not his \"primary\" source of advice but he knew when the vaccine was approved the demand for it would be \"huge\".\n\"In the film it shows the moment of highest stress around the vaccine programme is not in fact before it's rolled out - when actually it's the scientist and the manufacturers working together at pace - it's afterwards when there's a huge row about the order of priority,\" he told the radio station.\n\"I insisted we ordered enough for every adult to have two doses but also we asked for that clinical advice on the prioritisation very early and set it out in public, I think for the first time in August or September, so that there was no big row about the order of priority.\"\nContagion was made in the hope that it might prevent a future worldwide pandemic like coronavirus, according to epidemiologist Dr Ian Lipkin.\nHe was the scientific adviser for the film and he said it took a \"long time to try and get all the details as accurate as we possibly could make them\".\nThe UK has secured 407 million doses of different coronavirus vaccines - more than enough for the entire population.\nThis includes 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine which was approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the UK's regulatory body, on 30 December.\nVaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first. A list of nine high-priority groups which covers about 32 million people is being followed.\nThe health secretary said he knew the UK would need to be ready to vaccinate \"every adult in the country\", adding: \"I wasn't going to settle for less in the same way that I wasn't going to settle for a contract that allowed for the Oxford vaccine to be delivered to others around the world before us.\"\n\"I was insisting we could keep the British public and all of the British public safe, as my primary responsibility as the UK health secretary is to the health of the nation,\" he added.\nEarlier this week, the EU was involved in a much-criticised row with both the UK and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca over vaccine shortages.\nIn particular it was condemned over its threat to put checks on the Northern Ireland border to prevent vaccines produced in the EU from reaching the UK.\nAstraZeneca had said it could deliver only a fraction of the doses it promised for the first quarter of the year - blaming production issues at European plants. \nThe EU had said doses made elsewhere should make up the shortfall."

      "text": "The Conservative peer who is the government's preferred choice to chair the Office for Students (OfS) watchdog has suggested he could continue taking his party's whip at the same time as being an independent regulator.\nLord Wharton was asked by MPs about a conflict of interest.\nHe said that party whips, who organise how peers and MPs vote, would give him more \"latitude\".\n\"I can assure you I won't be hesitant to speak out,\" said Lord Wharton.\nMPs on the education select committee were questioning him in a pre-appointment hearing for the new chair of the OfS, an independent watchdog for higher education in England, representing the interests of students.\nThe job advert for the role offered \u00a359,000 per year for two days per week.\nThe preferred candidate is Lord Wharton, a former Conservative MP and former manager of Boris Johnson's leadership campaign.\nDavid Simmonds, a Conservative MP on the committee, asked Lord Wharton about a potential conflict if he was voting in the House of Lords on legislation in areas on which he would also be regulating.\n\"You're a Conservative peer - and the question has to be asked: 'Are you going to retain the Conservative party whip or are you proposing to step away from it?'\" asked Mr Simmonds.\nLord Wharton said he had an \"open mind\".\nBut he told MPs his party whips in the House of Lords had said \"they would give me more latitude and understand that I may need to vote against or speak against some of the things the party in government could bring forward\".\n\"I can absolutely assure the committee that I recognise the crucial importance of the regulator being independent.\"\nThe OfS is responsible for independently regulating issues such as making sure students get value for money for their tuition fees.\nThese fees are decided by the government, dependent on votes by MPs and peers - and ministers are currently considering a review calling for fees to be reduced.\nThe regulator also considers the quality of what students are offered and fair access.\nLabour's Fleur Anderson asked whether Lord Wharton, while continuing to hold his party's whip on policy issues such as education, could also really be independent as a regulator.\n\"All I can assure you is that I will be independent and open and say what I think when issues arise. And if that brings me into conflict with government then so be it. And if it doesn't, it doesn't,\" said Lord Wharton.\nLord Wharton also suggested that if he became chair of the OfS it would consider whether the process for students seeking tuition fee refunds was \"fit for purpose\".\n\"I think the truth is that the process currently is bureaucratic and cumbersome and slow,\" he said."

      "text": "Extra Covid tests are taking place across England and Scotland in areas where new variants have been found.\nThis is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage.\nIncreased testing and enhanced contact tracing is carried out in very specific locations - local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets.\nSome of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not have Covid symptoms.\nThe testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants.\nSurge testing is currently taking place in areas of England where the new Delta variant - first identified in India - is spreading fastest.\nEast\nNorth West\nWest Midlands\nSouth East\nSurge testing is also currently being carried out in specific and targeted locations within the following local authority areas:\nLondon\nSouth East\nNorth West\nYorkshire and the Humber\nTargeted community testing is also taking place in various health board areas across Scotland. \nScientists have identified a number of \"variants of concern\" - these are  newly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. \nAlso, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines.\nThe Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). \nThe variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming system which uses Greek letters instead. \nThe PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test \nPeople tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. \nThis involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis.\nIt is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result.\nThe lateral flow test \nThis also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes.\nWherever you are in the UK, if you have symptoms you should book a free test online. You will be sent to a testing site or have a testing kit sent to your home. \nIf you have problems booking, call 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland. \nAnyone in England can now get free lateral flow tests each week - even if they do not have symptoms. These can be ordered online, by calling 119, or can be collected from test centres and pharmacies. \nAnyone in Scotland can also order free lateral flow tests online, or collect them from test centres.\nAnyone who gets a positive result test must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. NHS Test and Trace will tell their contacts to isolate if necessary.\nSelf-isolating means not leaving home for exercise or even to buy food, medicines or other essentials.\nPeople in England who fail to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to \u00a310,000.\nAnyone on a low income who has been told to self-isolate can claim a \u00a3500 payment."

      "text": "About 3,500 cancer patients are \"missing\" from treatment services since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a charity.\nMacmillan said stronger messaging was needed to tell the public the NHS was open to get symptoms checked.\nAnother charity, Tenovus, said it had faced \"push back\" from ministers over a recovery plan for cancer services.\nThe Welsh Government says a \"national meeting\" will be held in the coming weeks to discuss them.\nCancer screening services were paused from the start of the pandemic until the end of June 2020 to ensure the safety of staff and patients and so resources could be redeployed to tackle the virus. \nOpposition parties called on the Welsh Government to come up with a plan to tackle the problem.\nThe national cancer clinical director for Wales, Tom Crosby, said the number of suspected cancer patients fell by about 75% at the start of the pandemic. \nHe said they have since picked up, but not returned to their previous level.\nHe told BBC Radio Wales's Eye on Wales programme: \"I think it's fair to say there was some thousands of patients with a cancer diagnosis that we would have expected to present last year and haven't.\"\nMacmillan's calculations, based on how many people have been diagnosed during the pandemic compared to previous years, estimate around 3,500 people could have missed a cancer diagnosis between March and November 2020.\nRichard Pugh, from Macmillan in Wales, said: \"We also know that since that date, Wales has entered a national lockdown and that our health services have had to cope with the highest levels of coronavirus infection Wales has seen since the pandemic began.  \n\"The worry is that the current situation could be even worse than suggested.\n\"We've had a very successful public health campaign: 'Stay home, stay safe, protect the NHS.' \n\"Unfortunately, there are people sitting at home with symptoms at the moment who have got cancer.\n\"What we desperately need to see now is a renewed confidence in people's local health care services.  Whether it is a cough, a lump or unexplained bleeding, please contact your GP if you have any new, or persistent changes to your health.  They are still there to help you.\"\nProf Crosby said cancer services post-Covid would need to run at \"120% to 130%\" of their previous capacity for a couple of years to deal with an increased number of patients, some with cancer in a later stage than it would have been had they sought medical advice earlier.\nCancer charities say a national plan is needed to co-ordinate health boards' response to tackling the backlog of cancer cases, once the pressure on NHS resources from coronavirus begins to ease.\nMr Pugh said: \"You cannot furlough cancer and it feels like we're being furloughed at the moment. We are parking a risk that's going to come back.\n\"Because an election is due, it shouldn't stop us planning a way out of this and sadly I think that is the case at the moment.\"\nJudi Rhys, chief executive of Tenovus Cancer Care, said: \"There's definitely a push-back from Welsh Government to this collective plea to get a cancer strategy in place.\"\nA Welsh Government spokesman said: \"As the vaccine is rolled out and as the public health situation improves, we will be focusing on the recovery of NHS services. \n\"A national meeting will be held in the coming weeks to discuss cancer services.\"\nAngela Burns, health spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives, called for an action plan to tackle the backlog.\n\"The people of Wales need the reassurance from Labour that this potential hidden pandemic will be tackled now and as a priority - not 'in a few weeks',\" she said.\nRhun ap Iorwerth of Plaid Cymru said it was not the time for the Welsh Government to be without a cancer delivery plan.\nHe said: \"Wales already has one of the worst cancer outcomes in Europe, and the impact of the pandemic has and will continue to exacerbate this.\"\nEye on Wales is available online and on the BBC Sounds app and is broadcast at 18:30 GMT on Wednesday 3 February 2021 on BBC Radio Wales"

      "tags": "Russia,St Petersburg,Alexei Navalny,Moscow,Vladimir Putin",
      "text": "More than 1,400 people were detained in Russia during Tuesday's protests in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, rights monitors say.\nIn Moscow, riot police were filmed beating demonstrators with batons.\nNavalny, 44, was earlier jailed for three-and-a-half years for violating the conditions of a suspended sentence. He says the case was fabricated.\nHe returned to Russia in January after being treated in Germany for a near-fatal nerve agent attack last August.\nNavalny says Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the attack with the Novichok agent, describing him as a \"poisoner\". The Kremlin denies the allegation and its spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the police response to Tuesday's \"unauthorised\" protests was justified.\nThe EU, the US and the UK have all condemned Tuesday's court verdict, demanding the opposition leader be immediately released. The German government said it would discuss further steps with its EU partners, adding that new sanctions could not be ruled out.\nNavalny has already served time under house arrest and his lawyer says he faces two years and eight months in prison.\nHundreds of protesters gathered in central Moscow after the court's decision.\nSoon there were violent scenes in the capital, with video on social media showing police beating and arresting those who came out to support Alexei Navalny. One journalist was seen being hit on the head with a baton by a police officer.\nRussia's OVD-Info human rights monitors said 1,170 people were detained on Tuesday in Moscow, and 251 in St Petersburg, the country's second-largest city.\nAnother 17 people were held in smaller Russian cities.\nThe authorities have not commented on the reported numbers.\nLast month, thousands of people were detained during two days of protests across the country.\nOn Tuesday night, security forces \"took\" the centre of Moscow, arrest squads deployed in vast numbers to all the main roads and squares. \nIn body armours and helmets, they formed long lines beneath the multicoloured street lights still hanging up from New Year. Protesters were massively outnumbered. \nThe official show of force was like a postscript to the message sent by imprisoning Alexei Navalny: the Kremlin is fully ready to crush those who challenge its authority. \nBut Navalny's supporters refuse to be silent. \nHundreds were detained tonight, and judging by the honking car horns in central Moscow - a new phenomenon - many more people are angered by what happened on Tuesday than are ready to risk taking to the streets in open protest.\nNavalny has been accused of breaking the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence for embezzlement that required him to report regularly to Russian police. \nHis lawyers say the accusation is absurd as the authorities knew he was recovering in Berlin from the nerve agent attack that nearly killed him in Russia.\nAddressing the court shortly before the sentencing, Navalny said the case was being used to frighten the opposition: \"This is how it works: they send one to jail to intimidate millions.\" \nOn the Novichok chemical attack, he said: \"Using the FSB [Federal Security Service of Russia], Putin attempted to commit murder. I'm not the only one - many know this already and many others will. And this is driving the thieving little man in the bunker crazy.\n\"No matter how much he tries to look like a geopolitician, he took offence at me because he will go down in history as a poisoner.\"\nAlexei Navalny's arrest after his return to Russia on 17 January triggered mass protests in support of him, many demonstrators young Russians who have only ever experienced President Putin's rule. \nThe Kremlin has denied any involvement in the attack on him, and rejects the conclusion by Western experts that Novichok - a Russian chemical weapon - was used.\nStrong international reaction to the sentence came quickly, with the Council of Europe - the continent's leading human rights body - saying the judgement \"defied all credibility\".\n\"With this decision, the Russian authorities not only further exacerbate human rights violations as already established by the European Court of Human Rights, they also send a signal undermining the protection of the rights of all Russian citizens,\" said the council's human rights commissioner, Dunja Mijatovic, in a statement.\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described the ruling as \"perverse\", and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the verdict was a \"bitter blow to firmly established civil liberties and the rule of law\".\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for Navalny's immediate and unconditional release, and said he would work closely with allies to hold Russia accountable for \"failing to uphold the rights of its citizens\".\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova responded by telling Western countries to focus on their own problems.\n\"You should not interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state,\" she said on Russian TV.\nAsked whether Mr Putin himself had reacted to the sentence, the Kremlin spokesman said on Wednesday it would have \"probably been foolish if instead he were to listen to statements by convicts\" rather than matters concerning millions of Russians.\nAlexei Navalny accuses Mr Putin of running an administration riddled with corruption, and recently released a YouTube video featuring an opulent Black Sea palace which, he alleged, was a Russian billionaire's gift to the president. More than 100 million people have watched the video.\nOn Saturday Arkady Rotenberg, a billionaire businessman close to Mr Putin, said he owned the palace and had bought it two years ago.\nBut on Sunday some protesters brandished gold-coloured toilet brushes, a symbol of their anger about the palace. For a second weekend, crowds defied bitter cold and a massive deployment of riot police, and more than 5,000 were arrested, according to OVD-Info group.\nOVD-Info says it is an independent Russian media project, which gets crowdfunding in Russia and its donors include the Memorial human rights group and the European Commission.\nNavalny was already serving a 30-day sentence in connection with the embezzlement case, which he denounces as politically motivated.\nIn recent days police have arrested many of Navalny's top aides, who assist him in his Anti-Corruption Network (FBK).

The film gained a cult following after its release and has spawned a handful of sequels and remakes.\nUS media reports suggest the fake warning message was sent out three times via email. \nThe Amber Alert system was first developed in the US in 1996 - seeking to send vital information out fast so that the public can help assist and identify children in immediate danger. \nThe warnings are sent out to local media outlets as well as directly to the public through social media and messaging systems.\nYou may also be interested in:"

      "text": "Public Health England is investigating cases of coronavirus with 'worrying' new genetic changes that have been found in some regions of the UK. \nTests show they have a mutation, called E484K, that is already seen in the South Africa variant. \nAlthough this change may reduce vaccine effectiveness, the current ones in use should still work, say experts.\nThere have been 11 cases in Bristol and a cluster of 32 cases in Liverpool. \nUrgent testing for the South Africa variant is already starting in parts of England and could be rolled out to other areas seeing different variants with the same E484K mutation. \nScientists working with Public Health England found a small number of cases of the UK 'Kent' variant with the E484K mutation - it was seen in 11 out of 214,159 samples that they tested, and predominantly from the South West of England.\nIt is likely there may be more cases that haven't yet been found. The Liverpool area has seen 32 cases of original coronavirus that have the E484K mutation too.\nIt's not unexpected that variants are appearing or that they will continue to change - all viruses mutate as they make new copies of themselves to spread and thrive.\nDr Julian Tang, a virus expert at the University of Leicester, described the finding as \"a worrying development, though not entirely unexpected\".\nHe said it was important people follow the lockdown rules and get cases of coronavirus down to prevent opportunities for the virus to mutate further. \n\"Otherwise not only can the virus continue to spread, it can also evolve.\"\nHe said that allowing spread could allow a \"melting pot\" for different emerging variants. \nScientists have already been checking what these new mutations might mean for existing coronavirus vaccines that were designed around earlier versions of the virus that started the pandemic. \nSome research appears to show E484K may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies.\nBut early results from Moderna suggest its vaccine is still effective against variants with this mutation - although the body's immune response may not be as strong or prolonged.\nTwo new coronavirus vaccines that could be approved soon - one from Novavax and another from Janssen - also appear to offer good cover against variants, protecting against serious illness. \nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts.\nA silver lining may be that the variants are mutating in a similar way rather than diverging from each other. \nProf Ravi Gupta from the University of Cambridge said: \"This gives us a sign that it has certain favoured routes - and we can work to block those off with a vaccine.\"\nFormer UK health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the race was on to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible in order to keep a step ahead of the virus.\nMeasures such as washing your hands, keeping your distance from other people and wearing a face covering will still help prevent infections."

      "text": "The French health authority has said AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine should only be given to people aged under 65. \nIt is the latest recommendation from an EU member state approving the jab with such restrictions, citing insufficient data on its efficacy for older people.\nThe EU drugs regulator has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults, but it is up to each member to set its own rollout policy.\nGermany and Austria have already recommended it be limited to under-65s.\nThere has been criticism of the slow pace of vaccinations in the EU and the campaign has been hit by delays to deliveries of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines, among others.\nThe European Commission - the EU executive - was caught up in a row with AstraZeneca last week, after the company said it could not supply the expected doses on time.\nThe president of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in particular, has been under fire for her own handling of the rollout, but she defended her stance on Tuesday. \"I am convinced that the European strategy on vaccination is the right one,\" she told France's Le Monde. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel also backed the EU's approach in a TV interview.\nThe health regulator said there was still not enough data about the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine for patients over 65 years of age.\n\"These data will arrive in the coming weeks. In the meantime we recommend its use for people under 65 years old,\" it said.  It recommended the vaccine for health workers and vulnerable people between the ages of 50 and 65.\nMore than 1.5 million people have received a Covid vaccine so far in France. In the UK, which has a similar population, more than 10 million doses have been given.\nEuropean Affairs Minister Cl\u00e9ment Beaune told French radio on Monday that the British were \"taking a lot of risks in this vaccination campaign\" by spacing delays between two injections.\n\"Here scientists say we shouldn't do this,\" he added. UK health officials have defended the plan, despite criticism.\nLast week Germany's vaccine commission said it could not recommend the use of the jab in people aged over 65.\nOn Tuesday health authorities in Sweden and Poland made similar announcements and Belgium's health minister said the vaccine, for the moment, would only be given to people below the age of 55. Italy's medicines agency on Saturday also approved the jab for all adults under 55.\nScientists at Oxford University, meanwhile, have said the vaccine could lead to a \"substantial\" fall in the spread of the virus, in a study yet to be formally published. \nIndividual EU countries are free to decide who vaccines should be given to once they have been approved at EU level. \nIn her TV interview on Tuesday, the German chancellor said \"every vaccine is welcome in the European Union\", adding that good data had emerged for the Russian Sputnik V vaccine.\nIn her interview with Le Monde, Ursula von der Leyen admitted that the EU had made missteps.\n\"When you make urgent decisions - and in this year of crisis we've taken around 900 - there's always the chance of missing something,\" she said.\nBut she said 18 million vaccine doses had been delivered across the EU so far and many more would follow over the next two months. \"We are on the right track,\" she said.\nMs van der Leyen also implied that the UK's early success in its vaccination programme came as the result of readiness to compromise on safety standards.\nCountries which started vaccinating people ahead of the EU \"resorted to emergency authorisation procedures\", she said. \n\"The commission and member states agreed not to compromise on safety and efficacy requirements.\"\nBritain has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme for weeks.\nUK health officials say it is safe and provides \"high levels of protection\" for all ages. Research has shown it is highly effective.\nNo-one who received the Oxford vaccine in trials was hospitalised or became seriously ill due to Covid.\nThe vaccine is given via two injections to the arm, the second between 4 and 12 weeks after the first.\nWhen it approved it last week, the EU's European Medicines Agency (EMA) noted that most participants in test studies were under 55 years of age.\nIt said that while there were not yet enough results to show how well the vaccine will work in older people, \"protection is expected, given that an immune response is seen in this age group and based on experience with other vaccines\".\nAstraZeneca has said a US study will shortly provide additional data on the vaccine's efficacy in older adults.

      "text": "People who want to swap broadband providers should be able to do so more simply, regulator Ofcom has said.\nIt follows its own research suggesting 40% of people are put off switching because it is considered too complex.\nUnder its proposals, customers would just contact their chosen new provider and the switch would happen automatically.\nThere is currently a mismatch between the number of superfast connections available and those taking them up.\nWhile 96% of UK homes can now get superfast broadband, offering speeds of at least 30Mbps (megabits per second), Ofcom estimates that only 60% have such services.\nThis means around 11 million homes could upgrade to a faster service.\nPart of the reason they haven't done so could be down to what Ofcom describes as \"the hassle of having to deal with more than one provider\". \nCurrently, if someone wants to swap providers and both firms use the Openreach network - for instance Sky and TalkTalk - the new company manages the switch.\nBut if someone wishes to switch from a provider using Openreach to Virgin Media or another one like CityFibre or Hyperoptic, they would have to contact both their existing and new firms.\nCharles Davies, managing director of provider Hyperoptic's ISP division, said: \"These proposals, if introduced, will shift the power to shop around decisively in the customer's favour. \n\"It will also ensure that all of the investment being made to upgrade the UK's networks to full fibre is supported by properly functioning competition in the market.\"\nIn 2019, Ofcom changed the rules around mobile switching, so that customers can now swap operators by simply sending a free text message.\nLindsey Fussell, Ofcom's networks and communications group director, admitted the broadband landscape can be confusing. \"There are lots of different offers out there from a wide range of broadband and landline providers.\n\"We want to make it even easier for people to get a better deal or upgrade to a faster, more reliable service. Our proposals today aim to make the process as seamless as possible, for everyone.\"\nOfcom will consult on the proposals until the end of March, with a decision due in the summer.\nRichard Neudegg, head of regulation at broadband comparison site Uswitch.com, said the proposals could help \"build consumer confidence\".\n\"Switching broadband can feel like a complicated process and can put some consumers off searching for a better deal, potentially costing them \u00a390 a year as they sit out of contract with their existing provider,\" he said.\n\"Making things easier for consumers will become especially important in the future... so consumers can move to next generation services with minimal fuss.\""

      "text": "Filters should not be applied to social media adverts if they exaggerate the effect of the product, the Advertising Standards Authority has ruled.\nThe ASA was responding to the #filterdrop campaign that called for it to be compulsory for influencers to state when they use a beauty filter to promote skincare or cosmetics. \nSasha Pallari, who started the campaign, said she was \"over the moon\".\nThe ASA said filtered beauty content could be \"misleading\". \nMiss Pallari, 29, from Weston-super-Mare, said she started #filterdrop in July 2020 in the hope of seeing \"more real skin\" on Instagram.\nThe use of filters on social media is a widely debated issue, attracting the attention of not only celebrities and social media influencers but also MPs. \nThe ASA examined two examples of where filters had been added to videos shared by influencers advertising tanning products, adding that the outcome of these rulings would apply to all UK brands, influencers and celebrities.\nThey were: two Instagram stories for Skinny Tan Ltd and one for Tanologist Tan which was banned for applying a filter that \"misleadingly exaggerated the effect the product was capable of achieving\".\nIt ruled the ads in both cases were likely to have misled consumers.\nIt said the ruling means that brands, influencers and celebrities should not apply filters to photos that promote beauty products if the filters are likely to exaggerate the effect the products are capable of achieving.\nThe ASA said that filtered beauty content could still be misleading, even if the name of the filter was referenced in the Instagram story.\nAds that break these rules would be taken down and prohibited from appearing again, which was likely to damage the advertiser and influencer's reputation, the ASA said.\nA spokesman said: \"An ongoing focus of our work in this area continues to be on raising awareness of the rules and supporting influencers with the guidance and tools they need to help get their ads right. \n\"We're also working closely with the social media platforms who can and will enforce our rulings where an advertiser is unwilling or able to work with us.\"\nMiss Pallari said: \"I feel like the detrimental effect this is having on social media users has finally been taken seriously and this is a huge step in the right direction for how filters are used and the way cosmetics are advertised online.\" \nShe said it was an issue she had been passionate about for a long time and she received messages \"every day\" from women struggling to match the beauty standards in real life that they see online. \n\"I can now help make a difference to how these women view themselves in the mirror and that's amazing,\" she said.\nMolly Nutt, 20, has been following Miss Pallari's campaign and welcomed the ruling, adding that much of her life has \"revolved around filters\".\n\"Filters with names like 'Pretty Girl', with blue eyes, bigger lips and a smaller nose, that just implies what you should look like, and not everybody is going to look like that,\" she said.\n\"Not everyone is an expert at make-up... and then with the filters as well it enhances it even more... I can't match up to how they look on Instagram. \n\"Most days I couldn't even leave the house without putting on make-up, but now I don't care as much... Sasha has made me feel more at ease with who I am and that I'm not an alien because of the way I look.\"\nWith more than 900,000 followers on Instagram, model and influencer Rahi Chadda, said he \"completely agrees\" with the ruling but is concerned about how it will be policed. \n\"Having this ruling is a step in the right direction,\" he said.\n\"The logistics though will definitely be a point of concern for the majority of influencers, because what is the definition of a filter?\n\"When we are talking about filters, are we talking about lighting, special effects, make-up before promoting a product... in that way most pictures on social media will be naturally filtered... you have already glorified the product in such a way before it is reaching the audience. \n\"They are going to have to be a lot clearer about what they mean by a filter and where we draw the line.\"\nWhen Miss Pallari set out on her campaign, she said she wanted to see three outcomes: to encourage as many women as possible to not depend on filters, for the ASA to demand that social media influencers and celebrities must state if they have used a filter when promoting cosmetics and to get face-changing and morphing filters removed from Instagram.\nShe said with two of her aims achieved, she would fight to get face-altering filters removed from Instagram altogether.\n\"There's no point coming this far, to only come this far,\" she said.\n\"How can Instagram agree to remove filters that promote plastic surgery, but not filters that alter your shape - how else are we going to alter our face without plastic surgery?\"\nThe most recent celebrity to speak out about face-altering filters is former Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson.\nShe took to her Instagram feed on Tuesday to encourage her 7.6m followers to embrace their natural looks.\nThe 29-year-old said while she \"loves a little Instagram filter that makes you look a bit more tanned or your skin a bit fresher\", she does not understand why most filters alter her appearance, giving her a \"tiny nose and huge lips\".\nShe went on: \"I don't understand why Instagram feels the need to squash your nose and make it really skinny. What's wrong with a standard nose? \n\"I'm so confused why whoever makes these filters think that is what beauty is?\"\nResponding to the ASA ruling, Skinny Tan said it had since reviewed its guidelines on the user-generated content it chose to share on social media.\n\"We do not encourage the use of beauty filters that exaggerate or provide a misleading impression of the results our products can achieve,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\"Whilst we were disappointed with the ASA ruling, as the intention behind the particular Instagram stories in question was not to mislead but rather to share her positive comments and experience with using our products, we do fully understand our responsibility as a brand to protect consumer interests. \nA spokesperson for Tanologist said it was disappointed but respected the ASA's ruling, although it had not used the content on its brand account.\n\"The influencer content in question demonstrated before and after self-tan product results. \n\"The 'after' content - which depicted the results of the self-tan product - did not have a filter applied.\"\nWhen approached for comment about the #filterdrop campaign and the ASA ruling, Instagram declined to comment, but the BBC understands that brands, celebrities and influencers are asked to comply with CMA and ASA guidance on sponsored social media posts.

      "tags": "Aung San Suu Kyi,Myanmar coup ,Myanmar",
      "text": "Resistance to Monday's army takeover in Myanmar is growing, with residents of the biggest city Yangon banging pots and pans, and honking car horns.\nMedical staff in several major cities are planning strikes, while activists are calling for a campaign of civil disobedience.\nHowever, correspondents say the military appears firmly in control.\nCalls are growing for the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has not been seen since her detention.\nOver 100 lawmakers had been confined by the military in their accommodation in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, but have now been told they can leave.\nThe military took power in the early hours of Monday and declared a year-long state of emergency after accusing Ms Suu Kyi's party of fraud over its recent election win.\nHer National League for Democracy (NLD) has demanded her immediate release. It also called upon the military to accept the results of the November election, which saw the NLD win more than 80% of the votes. \nHowever, the military has appointed a new election commission and chief of police. The previous commission found no evidence of election fraud.\nMyanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces until 2011, when a nominally civilian government was sworn in.\nThe country was calm in the aftermath of the coup, with troops patrolling all major cities and a night-time curfew in force. Communications systems disrupted by the coup returned by Tuesday morning. \nBut as night fell on Tuesday, car horns and the banging of cooking pots could be heard in the streets of Yangon in a sign of protest. \nYouth and student groups also called for civil disobedience campaigns, and a Facebook page for the campaign gained over 100,000 likes.\nDoctors working in government hospitals said they would stop work from Wednesday to push for Ms Suu Kyi's release. \nSome medics are resorting to wearing symbols in silent protest. \nAt least one doctor has quit in protest, saying \"such coups cannot be tolerated at all\". \nDr Naing Htoo Aung, a 47-year-old anaesthesiologist at Mongywa Hospital in Sagaing Region, told BBC Burmese: \"I resigned because I couldn't work under a military dictator who did not care about the country and the people. This is the best response I can give to them.\"  \nAnother doctor involved in the campaign, Myo Thet Oo, told Reuters news agency: \"We cannot accept dictators and an unelected government.\n\"They can arrest us anytime. We have decided to face it... All of us have decided not to go to the hospital.\"\nPower has been handed over to commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. Eleven ministers and deputies, including those in finance, health, the interior and foreign affairs, were replaced. \nIn the first meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing repeated that the takeover had been \"inevitable\" after the military made allegations of electoral fraud.  \nThere have been no official statements on Ms Suu Kyi's exact whereabouts since she was detained in pre-dawn raids on Monday.\nBut unnamed sources from within the NLD have said both she and President Win Myint were being held under house arrest.\nMs Suu Kyi - who spent nearly 15 years in detention between 1989 and 2010 - has urged her supporters to \"protest against the coup\" in a letter written before she was detained. It warned the military's actions would put the country back under a dictatorship.\nShe was barred from becoming president because she has children born to a foreign national. But since the NLD's decisive election victory in 2015 she has been widely seen as de facto leader. \nMyanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China. Thailand and Laos.\nIt was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011.\nNearly all expressions of dissent were banned and accusations of severe human rights abuses led to international condemnation and sanctions.\nAung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence.\nA government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh and triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community.\nShe has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more.\nUS President Joe Biden has threatened to reinstate sanctions on Myanmar. He said the military should not \"overrule the will of the people\". Later the State Department declared events in Myanmar to be a coup and said it would review foreign aid to the country.\nAlong with the US, the United Nations, the UK and the EU have also condemned the military takeover. \nUK Foreign Office minister Nigel Adams said he hoped a phone call planned with Ms Suu Kyi later this week would go ahead to confirm her safety.\nIt is unclear though how much effect the warnings from Western countries will have. The coup leaders will have expected sanctions and factored those into their plans. \nChina, which has previously opposed international intervention in Myanmar, urged all sides in the country to \"resolve differences\". China's Xinhua news agency described the changes as a \"cabinet reshuffle\". \nOther countries in the region, including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines, have said it is an \"internal matter\"."

      "tags": "Noise pollution,Wildlife,Animals,Environment,Birds",
      "text": "A test of songbirds' problem-solving skills has revealed how traffic noise impairs the animals' abilities. \nScientists set zebra finches a \"battery of foraging tasks\" in the presence or absence of the noise. \nThey found that the sound of passing cars diminished the birds' ability to find food. \nThe results, published in the journal Proceedings B, suggest that noise pollution has \"previously unconsidered consequences for wildlife\".\nProf Christopher Templeton from Pacific University in Oregon, US, led the study, which he carried out in a behavioural lab with zebra finches. The researchers set the birds the tasks both in a quiet setting and while a recording of road traffic was played. \n\"Just hearing a car drive by is enough to really affect their performance,\" explained Prof Templeton.  \nThe tasks were designed to mimic problem-solving and foraging (finding and gathering food) in the wild. One involved retrieving food from beneath leaf-like \"lids\" that the birds had to flip over to reveal the reward. \nIn another test, the birds had to work out the way into a cylinder that had a piece of food inside.\n\"They're almost twice as likely to do [the foraging tasks] correctly if they don't hear traffic noise,\" explained Prof Templeton. \n\"I think these results are going to be pretty widely applicable to other species,\" he continued. \"While the zebra finches might live in a lab, it's anything but quiet. You can imagine a colony of a whole bunch of birds making sounds all the time - it's pretty noisy.\" \nThere is mounting evidence that human-made noise has a variety of negative effects on wildlife. \nOne study found that birds have actually changed their songs during the relatively quiet period of lockdown. And even in the deep ocean, the noise of sonar, seismic surveys and shipping can disrupt animal communication. \nIn another study published this week, researchers demonstrated the impact of traffic noise on crickets; the sound of road vehicles impairs the insects' ability to differentiate between potential mates based on their courtship songs.\nDr Adam Bent, a zoologist from the University of Cambridge, told BBC News: \"This is causing a massive disruption to mate choice systems that have been in place for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\"That affects how a species will evolve, develop and adapt over time. \nDr Sophie Mowles from Anglia Ruskin University,  in Cambridgeshire, added that humans were \"continually changing the characteristics of environments, including through the production of anthropogenic noise\". And protecting natural environments from that noise, say scientists, will be a challenge. \n\"It's quite sad,\" said Prof Templeton. \"It's getting really, really difficult to find totally quiet environments not touched by human noise.\n\"But we can change road surfaces, think about redesigning a vehicle's tyres. I think there's great scope for trying to reduce noise - we just have to be clever with our engineering.\"\nFollow Victoria on Twitter\nHear more about how noise pollution is impacting the natural world on the  Inside Science podcast on BBC Sounds"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The Hollywood film Contagion showed the importance of securing enough Covid vaccines for use once they had been approved, the health secretary said.\nMatt Hancock said he had watched the film - which is about a deadly virus - and insisted the UK ordered enough jabs for its population.\nHe told LBC Radio the 2011 movie also shows there is a \"huge row\" about who should be given the vaccine first.\nIt led to the UK setting out early its \"order of priority\" for the jabs.\nContagion, which stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Matt Damon, looks at what would happen in the event of a virus spreading around the world.\nMr Hancock said in the film it shows the \"highest stress\" around the vaccine programme is after it starts getting rolled out.\nHe said the movie was not his \"primary\" source of advice but he knew when the vaccine was approved the demand for it would be \"huge\".\n\"In the film it shows the moment of highest stress around the vaccine programme is not in fact before it's rolled out - when actually it's the scientist and the manufacturers working together at pace - it's afterwards when there's a huge row about the order of priority,\" he told the radio station.\n\"I insisted we ordered enough for every adult to have two doses but also we asked for that clinical advice on the prioritisation very early and set it out in public, I think for the first time in August or September, so that there was no big row about the order of priority.\"\nContagion was made in the hope that it might prevent a future worldwide pandemic like coronavirus, according to epidemiologist Dr Ian Lipkin.\nHe was the scientific adviser for the film and he said it took a \"long time to try and get all the details as accurate as we possibly could make them\".\nThe UK has secured 407 million doses of different coronavirus vaccines - more than enough for the entire population.\nThis includes 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine which was approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the UK's regulatory body, on 30 December.\nVaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first. A list of nine high-priority groups which covers about 32 million people is being followed.\nThe health secretary said he knew the UK would need to be ready to vaccinate \"every adult in the country\", adding: \"I wasn't going to settle for less in the same way that I wasn't going to settle for a contract that allowed for the Oxford vaccine to be delivered to others around the world before us.\"\n\"I was insisting we could keep the British public and all of the British public safe, as my primary responsibility as the UK health secretary is to the health of the nation,\" he added.\nEarlier this week, the EU was involved in a much-criticised row with both the UK and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca over vaccine shortages.\nIn particular it was condemned over its threat to put checks on the Northern Ireland border to prevent vaccines produced in the EU from reaching the UK.\nAstraZeneca had said it could deliver only a fraction of the doses it promised for the first quarter of the year - blaming production issues at European plants. \nThe EU had said doses made elsewhere should make up the shortfall."

      "tags": "Social networks",
      "text": "Bebo's co-founder plans to relaunch the social network with a focus on profiles and \"real-time\" interactions between friends rather than the news feeds at the core of Twitter and Facebook.\nMichael Birch says his aim is to provide a \"refreshing break\" from the misinformation spread elsewhere.\nIn an exclusive interview, he told the BBC he was coding the effort himself. \nAnd while he has high hopes, he acknowledges the odds are stacked against him.\nBebo - an acronym for \"blog early, blog often\" - was once the most popular network in the UK, as well as being big in Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. At its peak it had more than 40 million members.\nIn, 2008 Mr Birch and his wife Xochi sold the site to AOL for $850m (\u00a3623m).\nThey later bought it back for $1m and tried to revamp it in several ways, most recently as an e-sports streaming service, before finally selling the business on to Amazon's Twitch in 2019 for $25m.\nHowever, the couple retained the rights to the brand. \nAnd with time on his hands during the coronavirus pandemic, Mr Birch began thinking about what kind of gap there might be in the market.\n\"We're calling it live social networking - when you're logged into Bebo, you are aware of which other friends are online,\" he says, explaining his plan from his home in the British Virgin Islands.\n\"You can interact with them in real-time. You can comment on their photo on their profile. They'll get notified, they'll come to the photo, and they may even have a conversation under the photo.\n\"It's an experiment, we'll see how it how it actually does. But we think it's a more exciting way of actually connecting.\"\nEven before he had announced plans for a relaunch, Mr Birch said Bebo's web address was attracting about one visit every three seconds despite the service being offline. \nHe hopes a mix of nostalgia and curiosity will attract enough early adopters to let people find friends on the regenerated site to interact with.\nHowever, some of those familiar with the original Bebo are sceptical about its prospects.\n\"It's probably brave to launch a new social network in this climate when there are concerns about potential harms from misinformation spread on social media, so I hope Bebo will take its responsibilities to look after its members and their data seriously,\" says Kate Bevan, computing editor at Which?.\n\"But there's also something delightfully optimistic about this plan.\"\nMr Birch is not yet willing to share screenshots of the new Bebo, and for now its only online presence is a \"coming soon\" page advising prospective users that they will not be able to access their old accounts, and a promise that Donald Trump will be banned.\nBut the entrepreneur says he is spending about 100 hours a week coding the platform, and plans to let the first invite-only members start trying it out before the month's end.\nThe following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity:\nHow will Bebo distinguish itself?\nNow is a good time to launch another social network. Covid has had a lot of detrimental effects, but I think it sort of opened people's eyes to new things in new ways. And people are craving interaction.  \nWe're going to do some nods to the past, but you're not going to log in and see the original Bebo as it was. But what we want to do is go back a little bit to this idea of a profile. That you have an identity you sort of take pride in. That you can visit a profile and see things that aren't just the latest news articles being shared.\nOn Facebook, if someone posts something to their news feed, they may have done it one minute ago - but you don't feel you're online, in this experience with that person. And that's what we're trying to achieve.\nIn its heyday, Bebo was the UK's biggest social network. Are you aiming for that kind of scale again?\nAt the moment, I'm the only one coding it. This started as a fun lockdown project to give me something to do. It certainly didn't start out as can it become as big as we used to be. \nBut you know, in the back of my mind is that a possibility? Of course it is. And it's a fun thing to contemplate. Do I realistically think that's going to happen? No, I don't. But it is more fun trying a thing sometimes than necessarily achieving it.\nSocial media is in a very different place than when Bebo was first about. There's been privacy and hate speech scandals. There's lots of talk of regulation. If this takes off, do you really want to have to deal with those kinds of headaches?\nThat does not look like fun. Do I want to do that part of it? No. But do I have to do that part of it? Yes.\nWhen we first did Bebo, I spent 95% of my media time talking to journalists about privacy and bullying. And those issues are still obviously as relevant today. But I think one of the most damaging things has been the spread of misinformation and people sharing things similar to what their friends believe, which self-reinforces and doesn't allow for different perspectives to be put in front of people. \nWe're not focusing on new sharing. But were we to go down that road and explore that, I think we'd have to think long and hard about how to avoid some of the pitfalls. For now, people may think it's a refreshing break for Bebo not to be another news feed of misinformation.\nDo you think social media has done more harm than good?\nI think it's possibly true. Yeah, I do. \nI think social media companies are in a difficult position. Could they have handled things better? Probably. Are things easy for them to handle, and are they entirely responsible? Probably not. Some of the repercussions of social media were not obvious at the beginning.\nYou sold Bebo for $850 million. But Mark Zuckerberg had proposed you sell it to Facebook for stock options. Do you ever regret not having taken him up on that offer and maybe becoming one of Facebook's senior executives?\nI wouldn't want to be working at Facebook. Not that it's not a great place to work. But that would be quite a stressful job. \nI've been very happy with the path that we followed. Would it have been worth more money? Almost certainly. But I've enjoyed the freedom of being able to start new things on my own and having my own path.\nI'm excited to have the opportunity to do Bebo again. It's very rare that you get to start something with a blank sheet of paper and rethink it from the ground up. You normally have so much legacy. In many ways it's harder to reboot a company than it is to start over.\nBut because such a long period of time has elapsed, we're sort of getting closer to a start-over than a reboot."

      "text": "Canada has designated the far-right group Proud Boys as a terrorist entity.\nPublic Safety Minister Bill Blair said the decision was influenced by the group's \"pivotal role\" in the 6 January riots at the Capitol in Washington, DC.\nThe designation allows the Proud Boys' assets to be frozen, and members of the groups could be charged with terrorist offences if they commit violent acts.\nThe group is all-male and anti-immigrant, and has a history of violent political confrontations.\nIt was founded in 2016 by Gavin McInnes, the Canadian co-founder of Vice Media. Vice has since worked to distance itself from Mr McInnes and the Proud Boys\nThe Proud Boys' platform includes ideas espoused by former US President Donald Trump, libertarianism and traditional gender roles.\nThe group was mentioned by Mr Trump during the first US presidential debate last October. \nResponding to a question about white supremacist and militia groups, he said, \"Proud Boys - stand back and stand by\", which members of the group online took as a call to prepare for action. Mr Trump later distanced himself from them.\nThe announcement in Canada comes one week after the US Department of Homeland Security warned of a \"heightened threat\" of domestic terrorism from violent extremists unhappy with the outcome of the presidential election. \nAnd just hours after the announcement, the US Justice Department announced it had arrested and charged a top member of the group's Seattle chapter. Ethan Nordean, 30, who is also known as Rufio Panman, is at least the eighth group member to be charged in connection with the Capitol riots. \nIn Canada on Wednesday, Mr Blair described a \"growing threat of ideologically motivated violent extremism\". He did not specify how many Proud Boy chapters are currently in Canada.\nThe Canadian Proud Boy groups had previously been thought of as disparate and disorganised, but the new designation suggests their perceived threat has been elevated. \nThe decision was made based on \"a trove of new information\", Mr Blair said. \"Over the past several months, basically since 2018, we have seen an escalation towards violence for this group [the Proud Boys].\" \nThe escalation has continued since the US presidential election, he added. \nIn his announcement, Mr Blair referenced \"several different occasions\" of attacks in Canada from those with far-right and extremist ideologies. Last week, the country marked the four-year anniversary of a mass shooting in a Quebec mosque that killed six people and injured 19. \nDespite strict travel restrictions between the US and Canada, at least two Canadians later identified in media reports made it to Washington for last month's storming of the Capitol. And images and video of the 6 January riots show at least one Canadian flag held by someone in the crowd. \nCanada is the first country to give the Proud Boys a terrorist designation. \nTwo other far-right US groups - Atomwaffen Division and the Base - have also been designated by Canada as terrorist entities, along with several affiliates of the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda.\nA total of six white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups have been designated by terrorist entities in Canada. Prior to 2018, no such groups were listed as a terrorist threat. "

There is some evidence that it can spread more easily, and that vaccines - although still effective - may not work quite as well against it.\"\nMr Gething told a press conference that in the three cases of the variant being investigated \"there is currently no clear evidence of how they may have caught the virus\".\nThe two cases in north Wales had the \"same genetic sequence and they were tested on the same day in the same laboratory\".\n\"Public Health Wales is carrying out a detailed and forensic investigation into each of these cases to discover when and how each person became infected with the South African variant strain and whether there is any evidence of wider community spread,\" the health minister said.\nHe said investigations would look at whether those who got the variant \"came into contact with other people\".\nBut he explained that ministers were not \"going to look to an approach that has whole community testing across a whole local authority area\".\n\"We're looking at targeted testing. That's why the backward contact tracing is really important to understand who those people may have been in contact with,\" he added.\nProfessor Helen Rees, a member of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Covid-19 Emergency Committee, said she is concerned about whether the South African variant could be \"less sensitive\" to vaccines. \nSpeaking to BBC Wales Live from Johannesburg, Prof Rees said that some clinical tests had been done on the Novavax vaccine and the Johnson vaccine. \n\"In both cases it does look like the vaccine might have a reduced impact at a clinical level,\" she said.\nThe expert said the \"critical\" thing to do was to get as many people vaccinated as possible. \n\"The more people who have the infection, the more likely that we are to see the emergence of new variants,\" she added.\nFor the Welsh Conservatives, Janet Finch Saunders said the Welsh Government should consider \"door-to-door testing\" in the parts of Wales where the South African Covid variant had been identified. \nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there should be \"whole-community testing\" in the three areas.\nThere is relatively encouraging news in the detail released on the three cases not linked to international travel.\nBoth the cases in Conwy and Anglesey were found through investigations into clusters of infections - but no other examples of the variants have been found in those groups.\nThe individual in Conwy has also recovered. No other variant case has been associated with the person affected in Neath Port Talbot, who was already self-isolating while unwell. \nWork is continuing to find out how this Covid variant got to these individuals in the first place if they had not been abroad.\nThe real concern with the South African variant is whether it is more resistant to Covid vaccines - although the mutations we are seeing at this stage of the evolution are very unlikely to make a vaccine completely ineffective.\nBut the truth is mutating and changing is how viruses survive, and the challenge to science is to keep responding with new treatments and tweaked vaccines.\nThat will be the reality of the next period of Covid, but that doesn't mean there isn't hope of brighter days ahead.\nDuring the press conference Mr Gething said it was \"too uncertain\" to say that people would be able to enjoy a summer holiday abroad this year.\n\"I'm optimistic that people will be able to have a holiday break of some kind over the summer, I wouldn't want to forecast where that would be though,\" he said.\n\"We know many people are opting to stay within Wales or the UK but the challenge is that we know that from this summer, international travel to mainland Europe caused lots of mixing and a reintroduction of coronavirus into the UK.\n\"It helped to promote the growth of the virus through the autumn. So we're all still going to need to make responsible choices.\"\nThe case rate in Wales has fallen from about 700 per 100,00 people over seven days before Christmas to 127 - the lowest of the UK nations.\nBut Mr Gething said Wales was unlikely to see a \"radical and significant\" easing of lockdown this month.\nHe said there would need to be \"continued\" reductions before the rules could be eased, and any available \"headroom\" would be used to help children go back to school.\nA decision is expected on Friday about whether children aged seven and younger can return to primary school this month."

      "text": "Ryanair has been told to remove \"irresponsible\" adverts depicting misleading claims about coronavirus vaccinations.\nThe Advertising Standards Authority said it got 2,370 complaints - the third highest ever received for an advert. \nThey encouraged people to book holidays with Ryanair after having vaccinations, suggesting consumers could \"Jab & Go\".\nThe airline has stopped the adverts, but said it disagreed with the rulings.\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) looked into three issues after getting the complaints about adverts in late December and early January. Two of the issues were upheld, but a third, that Ryanair trivialised lockdown restrictions, was not.\nA number of complainants felt that the Jab & Go adverts implied that most of the UK population would be successfully vaccinated against Covid-19 by the spring or summer this year and would be able to go on holiday.\nOn this point, the ASA concluded that the adverts were misleading. \nThe watchdog said that, given the complexity and fast-changing situation, it was \"important that advertisers were cautious when linking developments in the UK's response to the pandemic to specific timeframes around which life might return to some level of normality, particularly when linking it to how confident consumers could be when making purchasing decisions\".\nThe ASA also rapped Ryanair after people complained that the adverts were irresponsible.\nHowever, complaints that the adverts trivialised the impact of the pandemic on society and were offensive were not in breach of the advertising code, the ASA said. \n\"Whilst we acknowledged that many viewers had found the tone of the ads distasteful we considered they were unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence,\" it concluded.\nThe ASA said the Ryanair adverts had, in general, \"over-claimed on this occasion\".\nIt said: \"The ads misleadingly provided consumers with a reassurance that being vaccinated against Covid-19 was likely to allow them to go on holiday without restrictions.\n\"It's important that all travel companies take particular care, at a time of significant uncertainty about when lockdown restrictions will end, not to mislead or over exaggerate when it will be possible for people to go on holiday,\" the regulator said.\nAlthough the ASA did not publish its findings until Wednesday, Ryanair pulled the adverts last week. In a sign the airline was expecting the ASA to rule against it, Ryanair said last week it \"disagrees\" with the complainants. \nOn Wednesday, an airline spokesperson said: \"The ASA's ruling flies in the face of the UK's successful vaccine rollout, however even though this ruling is baseless, Ryanair will comply with it and the Jab & Go adverts will not run again.\""

      "text": "The UK is \"past the peak\" of the current wave of the pandemic but infection rates are still high, England's chief medical officer says.\nProf Chris Whitty said the number of cases, hospitalisations and deaths were on a \"downward slope\" but that did not mean there would not be another peak. \nBoris Johnson praised the \"colossal\" effort to vaccinate 10 million people, including 90% of those aged over 75.\nBut the NHS was still under \"huge pressure\", the prime minister said.\nSpeaking at a Downing Street briefing, Prof Whitty said while the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 had reduced \"quite noticeably\", it was still above that of the first peak in April 2020.\n\"So this is still a very major problem, but it is one that is heading the right way,\" he said.\nProf Whitty said infection rates were \"coming down but they are still incredibly high\".\nIf the rate was to increase again \"from the very high levels we are at the moment the NHS will get back into trouble extraordinarily fast\", he added.\nHis comments were echoed by the prime minister, who warned the level of infection was still \"forbiddingly high\" and that it was too soon to relax current restrictions.\nOn Wednesday the UK recorded a further 1,322 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, bringing the total number of people who have died by this measure to 109,335, while a further 19,202 new cases were recorded.\nMr Johnson told the briefing: \"Though today there are some signs of hope - the numbers of Covid patients in hospital are beginning to fall for the first time since the onset of this new wave - the level of infection is still alarmingly high.\"\nThere are also about 32,000 Covid patients in hospital, he added.\nThe prime minister said he hoped schools in England would be able to begin reopening from 8 March, as evidence showed the coronavirus vaccines reduced \"death and serious illness\" from the main strains of the disease.\nBut he insisted the government would not be opening schools any earlier than this date, despite First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying that schools in Scotland would begin a phased reopening from 22 February.\nElsewhere, the Welsh government is due to make a decision by the end of the week on whether to reopen its schools after the February half-term.\nProf Whitty said schools in England had been managing to \"hold the line\" and remain open up until the new, more transmissible variant of the virus hit.\nHe said it was up to ministers to decide the opening dates for schools but that he was confident the risk to children of getting Covid-19 was \"incredibly low\".\nMeanwhile, he warned that predictions that every adult could offered a first dose of a vaccine by May and a second by August were \"at the very optimistic end\" due to supply constraints.\nMr Johnson said at the news conference the government would be sticking with its \"cautious\" approach.\nHe said ministers would outline a \"route map\" out of lockdown on 22 February and that the country would be in \"a very different situation\" to last summer, when disease levels had been reduced but there was no vaccine.\nVaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first. A list of nine high-priority groups which covers about 32 million people - including 90-99% of those most at risk of dying - is being followed, with an aim to vaccinate the first four by 15 February.\nThere is a lot to be hopeful for. The vaccine rollout is going well. Infection levels and the numbers in hospital are coming down - and there are early signs the same is happening with deaths.\nProgress should continue in the coming weeks as the impact of vaccination starts to kick in - deaths could then start falling rapidly.\nBut the great unlocking will have to be slow. \nWhy? While the numbers in hospital are coming down, it's from an incredibly high base. There are still 50% more patients in hospital now than there were during the first peak.\nThe pressures are going to be severe for some time.\nWhat is more, come mid-February when all the over 70s will have been offered the jab, there will still be significant numbers at risk of hospitalisation if they are infected. \nMost deaths are in the over-70s, but close to half of hospital cases are in the under-70s. A delicate balance will have to be struck until the over-50s are protected.\nEarlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock hailed the results of a study which showed the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might reduce the spread of coronavirus as \"absolutely superb\".\nThe researchers behind the jab have also said that a vaccine to tackle variants of the virus could be ready to deploy by the autumn should they be needed.\nA \"small number\" of cases of the coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa have been found in Birmingham as well as three cases without any travel history in Wales. \nIt comes after door-to-door testing has been launched to detect the mutation, which is thought to be more infectious but not necessarily more deadly.\nThe prime minister also led a clap for fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore.\nThe 100-year-old, who raised almost \u00a333m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A vaccine to tackle the coronavirus variants could be ready to deploy by the autumn should it be needed, the Oxford-AstraZeneca team says.\nProf Andy Pollard, from Oxford University, said tweaking a vaccine was a relatively quick process and would only need small trials before roll-out.\nIt comes as the UK announced more than 10 million people had received a jab.\nThere is still strong evidence existing vaccines work well against the mutations that have emerged.\nAlthough their overall effectiveness may be weakened a little.\nThe comments came after results released by the team showed the first evidence the vaccine can reduce the chances of people catching and passing on the virus, which has always been uncertain. \nThe data, which has not yet been published or reviewed, showed vaccination with the Oxford-AZ jab could cut transmission by up to 67%. \nThis means the vaccine could significantly slow the spread of the virus, potentially allowing restrictions to be lifted more quickly, as well as protect people from becoming seriously ill and dying with Covid-19.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the results were \"absolutely superb\" and showed vaccines are \"the way out of this pandemic\" but that the \"on-going challenge\" would be for vaccine manufacturers to keep up with what the virus is doing.\nHe described the fact that 10 million people had received their first dose of a vaccine as a \"hugely significant milestone\" and said \"every jab makes us all a bit safer\".\nThere is most concern about the South African variant, which shows signs of being able to escape some of the protective effect of the vaccines. There are already signs this has begun circulating in some parts of the UK, prompting surge testing to be introduced into parts of London, Surrey, Kent, Hertfordshire and Southport.\nThe mutation behind this variant - called E484K - has also been detected in some of the infections caused by UK strains that are circulating in parts of Bristol and Liverpool.\nProf Pollard said his team were already looking at updating the vaccine to make it more effective against the mutations that are being seen.\n\"I think the actual work on designing a new vaccine is very, very quick because it's essentially just switching out the genetic sequence for the spike protein.\n\"And then there's manufacturing to do and then a small scale study. So all of that can be completed in a very short period of time, and the autumn is really the timing for having new vaccines available for use,\" he said.\nIt's not yet clear how the new vaccine would be given to people, but it is possible it could take the form of a one-dose booster which is updated and rolled out every year or so.\nSir Mene Pangalos, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals research and development at AstraZeneca, added: \"Our ambition is to be ready for the next round of immunisations that may be necessary as we go into next winter. That's what we're aiming for.\"\nHe added the manufacturing process would also be easier as plants would be fully up to speed by then.\nThe trials that would need to be run are only likely to involve a few hundred people as the team would only need to check safety and that a good immune response is generated by carrying out blood tests.\nThere were a further 1,322 deaths in the UK reported on Wednesday within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, bringing the total number of people who have died by this measure to 109,335.\nIn other developments: "

Obviously, we've still got the pandemic going on, but unfortunately the debt incurred during this period isn't going to go away overnight.\n\"The sooner people can start to obtain help with the money worries they have, the better it'll be for their financial health and their mental health.\"\nRose, not her real name, is a mother of two from Caerphilly county. \nShe has struggled financially for a number of years, but said her debt spiralled out of control since losing her mother to Covid-19 last April. \nRose said: \"I struggled to come to terms with losing her. It was hard enough dealing with home-schooling my 15-year-old and 12-year-old while she was ill in hospital, but since we lost her, my mental health has really suffered. \n\"As I tried to grieve, Covid kept making things harder. My bills were going up because there was extra food to buy as the children were not eating in school. The heating and electricity costs went up and everything just got on top of me. \n\"The worry about the effect it is having on my children's education because they don't have a laptop each to do their schooling has made me so low. Being stuck at home because of Covid has made me and the children feel isolated. I had nobody to talk to and I couldn't face my debts.\"\nRhiannon Evans, head of policy and campaigns at Citizens Advice Cymru, said: \"We're really concerned that we're building up a debt time-bomb for people. \n\"There are various schemes in place to help people but as the pandemic progresses and we move out of those schemes, people will find themselves with a lot of debt they can't pay off. \n\"We've also seen worrying reports that some councils have started debt collection practises for council taxes again, even during lockdown.\"\nA recent report by UK debt advice charity Stepchange said a \"personal debt crisis\" was emerging as a result of the pandemic. \nDirector Richard Lane said: \"In Wales, much like the rest of the UK, we're seeing worrying levels of financial vulnerability concentrated among those hardest hit by the pandemic. \n\"In total \u00a310.3bn of debt and arrears attributable to Covid has been built up across the UK, most often by those who were already struggling before the pandemic, such as renters, young people, single parents and low earners.\"\nEarlier this week the Welsh Government minister for mental health and wellbeing, Eluned Morgan, said more than \u00a310million had been made available through the Single Advice Fund to help resolve problems, which include debt and employment. Ms Morgan said more than 115,000 have already benefitted from the fund.\nThe Welsh Government is also piloting a scheme to refer people to Citizens Advice if they are in extreme need of help due to debt problems.\nHM Treasury said it had invested more than \u00a3280bn throughout the crisis to protect jobs and businesses and provided the Welsh Government with an additional \u00a35.2bn to respond the pandemic.\nA spokesperson said: \"As the Chancellor has set out, the Budget will be the moment to take decisions in the round and outline the next stages of our plan for jobs to support businesses and families. \n\"That has been our priority throughout the past year and it will be the priority for the year to come.\"\nYou can find information on organisations that may be able to help with debt problems on the BBC Action Line"

Reports the two men continued the row afterwards were played down by Labour.\nBut the party has now issued a statement to say Sir Keir had \"misheard\" the prime minister.\nSir Keir thought the PM had \"falsely\" accused him of wanting the UK to be part of the EU's vaccine scheme, which the party said was not the case.\nBut it acknowledged that the Labour leader had previously expressed support for the European Medicines Agency.\nThe EMA is an EU body which evaluates new medicines and authorises the use of vaccines. However, individual countries within the EU can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine for temporary use in their domestic market without EMA approval.\nThe exchange between the pair followed concerns from Sir Keir that the restrictions at the border are not strong enough to prevent new variants of Covid coming into the UK.\nMr Johnson defended the policy and said it had allowed the UK to get on with the vaccination programme.\n\"If we had listened to [Sir Keir] we would still be at the starting blocks,\" he said suggesting that membership of the EMA would have slowed down the UK's vaccine programme. \nBy Reality Check\nIn an exchange over coronavirus, Boris Johnson said that, when it came to vaccinations, Sir Keir Starmer \"wanted to stay in the European Medicines Agency [EMA] and said so four times from that dispatch box\".\nThe EMA has been slower to approve Covid vaccines for the EU than UK regulators.\nThe Labour leader denied this: \"The prime minister knows I've never said that from this dispatch box or anywhere else, but the truth escapes him.\"\nWe've found two occasions when he did speak up in favour of the EMA. They were from 2017 and made in the context of the ongoing Brexit debate back then.\nFor example in January 2017, Sir Keir he said in a parliamentary speech: \"Why would we want to be outside the European Medicines Agency, which ensures that all medicines in the EU market are safe and effective?\"\nAfter Prime Minister's Questions, a Labour spokesperson said: \"On a number of occasions the prime minister has wrongly claimed that Labour wanted to join the EU's vaccine programme. \nThat is inaccurate and the claim has been found to be untrue.\"\nSir Keir had \"assumed\" the prime minister was \"making the same false accusation again,\" the statement added.\n\"Keir accepts that, on this occasion, the prime minister was referring to old comments about the European Medicines Agency and Keir admits he was wrong and made a mistake in his response.\"\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth praised his leader for acknowledging the error, saying: \"I think it's a good thing that if a politician makes a mistake he holds his hand up... I think it's refreshing, I wish more politicians would do that.\"\nThere have been reports that Sir Keir and Mr Johnson got involved in an altercation on the subject after leaving the Commons chamber but Labour MP Chris Matheson, who was with his party leader, said \"there was a brief chat... nothing more to it than that.\"\nAnd a Labour source told the BBC: \"They had a perfectly reasonable conversation as they often do after PMQs.\"\nAsked about the alleged incident, Mr Johnson's press secretary Allegra Stratton said: \"I have seen the reports but I haven't seen the prime minister since he went to the Chamber so I can't confirm or deny that.\" "

According to the document, Mariah had publicly acknowledged her sister, or \"ex-sister\", to be a \"deeply wounded\" person.\nThe BBC has asked the singer's representatives for a comment.\nAlison dropped in and out of Mariah life, through teenage pregnancy, drug dependency and suicidal thoughts, the performer wrote. Although they shared some tender moments, the singer depicted several occasions when she believes Alison put her at risk.\nOne story involved her sister's boyfriend, who - Carey says she later realised - was running a prostitution ring. Aged 12, she claimed she was tricked into spending a night alone with him, ending up at a card game and a drive-in movie, where \"almost immediately\" he put his arm around her.\nImmobilised and terrified by the \"handgun resting against his thigh\", Carey said she only escaped after another car pulled up alongside them, prompting John to leave and drive home \"in silence\".\nThe singer believes she was at risk of being pimped, reasoning: \"Dysfunctional families are ideal prey for abusers, the exposed little ones vulnerable to being picked off.\"\nSpeaking to The Sun when the book was published, Alison denied the claims and said she was shocked and appalled that Mariah would accuse her of pimping her out.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Social networks",
      "text": "Bebo's co-founder plans to relaunch the social network with a focus on profiles and \"real-time\" interactions between friends rather than the news feeds at the core of Twitter and Facebook.\nMichael Birch says his aim is to provide a \"refreshing break\" from the misinformation spread elsewhere.\nIn an exclusive interview, he told the BBC he was coding the effort himself. \nAnd while he has high hopes, he acknowledges the odds are stacked against him.\nBebo - an acronym for \"blog early, blog often\" - was once the most popular network in the UK, as well as being big in Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. At its peak it had more than 40 million members.\nIn, 2008 Mr Birch and his wife Xochi sold the site to AOL for $850m (\u00a3623m).\nThey later bought it back for $1m and tried to revamp it in several ways, most recently as an e-sports streaming service, before finally selling the business on to Amazon's Twitch in 2019 for $25m.\nHowever, the couple retained the rights to the brand. \nAnd with time on his hands during the coronavirus pandemic, Mr Birch began thinking about what kind of gap there might be in the market.\n\"We're calling it live social networking - when you're logged into Bebo, you are aware of which other friends are online,\" he says, explaining his plan from his home in the British Virgin Islands.\n\"You can interact with them in real-time. You can comment on their photo on their profile. They'll get notified, they'll come to the photo, and they may even have a conversation under the photo.\n\"It's an experiment, we'll see how it how it actually does. But we think it's a more exciting way of actually connecting.\"\nEven before he had announced plans for a relaunch, Mr Birch said Bebo's web address was attracting about one visit every three seconds despite the service being offline. \nHe hopes a mix of nostalgia and curiosity will attract enough early adopters to let people find friends on the regenerated site to interact with.\nHowever, some of those familiar with the original Bebo are sceptical about its prospects.\n\"It's probably brave to launch a new social network in this climate when there are concerns about potential harms from misinformation spread on social media, so I hope Bebo will take its responsibilities to look after its members and their data seriously,\" says Kate Bevan, computing editor at Which?.\n\"But there's also something delightfully optimistic about this plan.\"\nMr Birch is not yet willing to share screenshots of the new Bebo, and for now its only online presence is a \"coming soon\" page advising prospective users that they will not be able to access their old accounts, and a promise that Donald Trump will be banned.\nBut the entrepreneur says he is spending about 100 hours a week coding the platform, and plans to let the first invite-only members start trying it out before the month's end.\nThe following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity:\nHow will Bebo distinguish itself?\nNow is a good time to launch another social network. Covid has had a lot of detrimental effects, but I think it sort of opened people's eyes to new things in new ways. And people are craving interaction.  \nWe're going to do some nods to the past, but you're not going to log in and see the original Bebo as it was. But what we want to do is go back a little bit to this idea of a profile. That you have an identity you sort of take pride in. That you can visit a profile and see things that aren't just the latest news articles being shared.\nOn Facebook, if someone posts something to their news feed, they may have done it one minute ago - but you don't feel you're online, in this experience with that person. And that's what we're trying to achieve.\nIn its heyday, Bebo was the UK's biggest social network. Are you aiming for that kind of scale again?\nAt the moment, I'm the only one coding it. This started as a fun lockdown project to give me something to do. It certainly didn't start out as can it become as big as we used to be. \nBut you know, in the back of my mind is that a possibility? Of course it is. And it's a fun thing to contemplate. Do I realistically think that's going to happen? No, I don't. But it is more fun trying a thing sometimes than necessarily achieving it.\nSocial media is in a very different place than when Bebo was first about. There's been privacy and hate speech scandals. There's lots of talk of regulation. If this takes off, do you really want to have to deal with those kinds of headaches?\nThat does not look like fun. Do I want to do that part of it? No. But do I have to do that part of it? Yes.\nWhen we first did Bebo, I spent 95% of my media time talking to journalists about privacy and bullying. And those issues are still obviously as relevant today. But I think one of the most damaging things has been the spread of misinformation and people sharing things similar to what their friends believe, which self-reinforces and doesn't allow for different perspectives to be put in front of people. \nWe're not focusing on new sharing. But were we to go down that road and explore that, I think we'd have to think long and hard about how to avoid some of the pitfalls. For now, people may think it's a refreshing break for Bebo not to be another news feed of misinformation.\nDo you think social media has done more harm than good?\nI think it's possibly true. Yeah, I do. \nI think social media companies are in a difficult position. Could they have handled things better? Probably. Are things easy for them to handle, and are they entirely responsible? Probably not. Some of the repercussions of social media were not obvious at the beginning.\nYou sold Bebo for $850 million. But Mark Zuckerberg had proposed you sell it to Facebook for stock options. Do you ever regret not having taken him up on that offer and maybe becoming one of Facebook's senior executives?\nI wouldn't want to be working at Facebook. Not that it's not a great place to work. But that would be quite a stressful job. \nI've been very happy with the path that we followed. Would it have been worth more money? Almost certainly. But I've enjoyed the freedom of being able to start new things on my own and having my own path.\nI'm excited to have the opportunity to do Bebo again. It's very rare that you get to start something with a blank sheet of paper and rethink it from the ground up. You normally have so much legacy. In many ways it's harder to reboot a company than it is to start over.\nBut because such a long period of time has elapsed, we're sort of getting closer to a start-over than a reboot."

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine could lead to a \"substantial\" fall in the spread of the virus, say scientists. \nThe impact of Covid vaccines on transmission has been a crucial unknown that will dramatically shape the future of the pandemic.\nThe study, which has not been formally published, also showed the vaccine remained effective while people waited for a second dose. \nIt was 76% effective during the three months after the first shot.\nThe impact on transmission is critical. \nIf a vaccine only stops you getting severely ill, but you can still catch and pass on the virus, then everyone will need to be immunised to be protected.\nBut if it also stops you spreading the virus then it would have a far greater impact on the pandemic as each person who is vaccinated indirectly protects other people too. \nThe study by the University of Oxford swabbed participants every week to test them for the presence of the virus. \nIf there is no virus then they cannot spread it. In the study, the numbers testing positive halved in people once they had been given two doses of the vaccine. \n\"The data indicate that [the vaccine] may have a substantial impact on transmission by reducing the number of infected individuals in the population,\" the report said. \nThe UK, amid global debate and in sharp contrast to other countries, is prioritising giving the first dose to as many people as possible. \nThe idea is to save more lives by giving more people some protection, but it means people will have to wait around three months for the booster instead of three weeks. \nThis study - on 17,000 people in the UK, South Africa and Brazil - showed protection remained at 76% during the three months after the first dose.\nThis rose to 82% after people were given the second dose. \nProf Andrew Pollard, from the Oxford Vaccine Trial, said: \"These new data provide an important verification of the interim data that was used by more than 25 regulators including the MHRA and EMA to grant the vaccine emergency use authorisation.\n\"It also supports the policy recommendation made by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation for a 12-week prime-boost interval, as they look for the optimal approach to rollout.\"\nThe report does not tackle the impact of the new variants on how well the vaccines work. \nProf Stephen Evans, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: \"The data definitely provide some evidence to suggest that the eventual protection from two doses of this vaccine are not worsened by having a longer than 28 or 42 day period between doses, and tend to confirm what had been shown before, that if anything the eventual efficacy was better.\" \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the study was \"hugely encouraging\", adding that it \"further reinforces our confidence that vaccines are capable of reducing transmission and protecting people from this awful disease\".\nHe said: \"This report shows the Oxford vaccine works and works well.\n\"More than 9.6 million people have already received the first dose of their Covid-19 vaccine and the NHS is working tirelessly to vaccinate as many people as possible in every part of the UK.\""

      "text": "It is \"not practical\" to completely close the UK's borders given the amount of medicines and food imported into the country, the prime minister has said. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for tougher restrictions to prevent new coronavirus variants entering the UK.\nBoris Johnson said the government had already tightened travel restrictions to reduce the spread of the virus.\nHe said it would be going ahead with its plan for quarantine hotels for people arriving from Covid hotspots.\nIt is not yet clear when the scheme - announced a week ago - will start or when there will be further details.\nSpeaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said government scientists had recommended \"a complete pre-emptive closure of borders\".\nIn response, Mr Johnson said: \"Actually, Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies) did not recommend a complete ban and they say travel bans should not be relied upon to stop the importation of new variants.\n\"But we do have one of the toughest regimes in the world.\"\nRules around international travel were tightened last month, meaning all travellers must self-isolate for 10 days when they return to the UK.\nThe government also announced plans to make people quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels when arriving in the UK from certain \"high risk\" countries, where new coronavirus variants have been identified.\nThe prime minister said at Wednesday evening's Downing Street briefing that Health Secretary Matt Hancock would make a statement on Thursday to give further details, although No 10 later clarified to say this was not happening.\nLabour chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee Yvette Cooper tweeted in response: \"Oh for heaven's sake. Who is in charge of this borders policy? When will we get details? Does anyone have a grip?\"\nThe UK has placed 33 high-risk countries on a so-called \"red list\", including most of South America, southern Africa and Portugal.\nScotland has announced it will extend the measures to all travellers.\nSir Keir said the government's new border arrangements were \"still weeks away\" from being introduced and would only affect direct flights from some countries.\nHe asked whether the prime minister was saying that \"quarantining all arrivals would make no difference to fighting new variants of the virus\", or that it was \"too difficult to do it\". \nMr Johnson responded by saying that 75% of the UK's medicines come into the country from the European mainland, 45% of food, while 250,000 businesses rely on imports. \n\"It is not practical to completely close off this country as he seems to be suggesting,\" he said.\nIntroducing quarantine hotels is a logistical challenge. \nThe government needs to make sure hotels are ready. That doesn't just mean securing enough rooms and making sure all the guests can have meals delivered, but also coming up with policies around things like security if a guest tries to leave early. \nThe government could use existing guidelines written up by countries such as New Zealand as a template. \nAirlines and airports also have questions about how this will work and some areas are complicated. For instance, the policy currently only applies to arrivals from 33 countries - all of whom will arrive on indirect flights.\nShould airlines separate passengers from low and high-risk countries onboard? \nBut the policy also requires compliance from passengers. If passengers split their tickets and don't declare they've been in one of the 33 high-risk countries, how will the government keep track? \nThere are plenty of questions from all quarters about how to make this policy effective. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps also defended the government's decision not to extend the hotel quarantine policy to arrivals from all countries. \nHe told the Commons Transport Committee: \"The idea that the UK could completely batten down its hatches and remain battened down for a year is mistaken. But also the evidence that that is the only thing you need to do, or primary thing you need to do, is pretty shaky.\"\nMr Shapps also said the hotel quarantine scheme would not affect many people. \n\"The 33 countries on the so-called red list do not have direct flights\u2026 so the numbers we would expect to see returning would be quite low,\" he said."

      "tags": "Woking,Broxbourne,West Ealing,Hanwell,Coronavirus testing,Walsall,Southport,Mitcham,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It is \"critical\" that people in areas singled out for enhanced testing for the South African variant stay at home, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. \nHe told MPs there were other \"mutations of concern\" in Bristol and Liverpool, and people there should also only go out when \"absolutely essential\". \nThe government is expected to announce surge testing in certain postcodes of the two cities. \nHome testing kits are already being deployed in a number of other areas. \nOn-the-spot doorstep tests and mobile testing units are also being used with the aim of reaching 80,000 people, amid fears the more infectious variant may be spreading in communities in England.\nGene sequencing has so far uncovered 105 cases of the South African variant, which - like the variant previously discovered in Kent - is thought to be more contagious although not more deadly. \nEleven of the cases of the South African variant had no link to foreign travel, prompting concerns it is spreading in the community.\nOver-16s who live or work in these areas will now be asked to take tests whether or not they have symptoms, as part of \"surge testing\":\nIn most of the areas, the home testing kits are being delivered and collected, while some local authorities are also providing mobile testing sites. The tests will be PCR ones, which involve swabbing the nose or throat and are regarded as the most reliable.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, the health secretary said: \"We have also seen 11 cases of mutations of concern in Bristol and 32 in Liverpool, and are taking the same approach. \n\"In all these areas it is imperative that people must stay at home and only leave home where it is absolutely essential.\"\nHe also urged people to take a test if offered one by their local authority. \nPublic Health England (PHE) later confirmed that the 11 cases in Bristol were the new Kent variant with the E484K mutation, which has already been seen in the South African and Brazilian variants. \nThe 32 cases in Liverpool are the original version of Covid-19 but also have the new E484K mutation.\nThere is some concern this mutation might make vaccines less effective.\nA PHE spokesman said it was \"monitoring the situation closely and all necessary public health interventions are being undertaken, including enhanced contact tracing and control measures\". \nA spokesman for Bristol City Council said local public health teams would begin to plan for extra testing in the area, with details released when approved. \nThe news on mutations has obviously caused alarm. \nWhat is more, there are likely to be more out there - the ones detected so far come from random sampling of between 5% and 10% of positive cases.\nBut that should not detract from the progress that is being made in terms of spread of the virus.\nThis is the second day in a row that cases have been below 20,000.\nAt the start of the year around 60,000 new cases a day were being diagnosed.\nThis drop has now started to translate to significantly fewer admissions to hospital - the numbers have dropped by nearly a quarter in the past week.\nThis will mean deaths will soon start falling - in fact it already looks as if the peak may have been passed last week.\nLater in the month it would be hoped the impact of vaccinations would be felt, which could result in a quite marked drop in deaths.\nThe mutations require vigilance, but the bigger picture shows real progress is being made.\nMeanwhile, tougher quarantine restrictions will be extended to all travellers arriving directly into Scotland, to minimise the risk of new variants entering the country, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. \nThe four UK nations have already agreed that people arriving from high risk countries under travel bans will have to isolate in hotels rather than at home, with the measure due to be introduced in the coming weeks.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said this did \"not go far enough\" and her government intended to implement \"managed quarantine\" for anyone who arrives directly in Scotland. \nShe added that five cases of the South African variant had been identified in Scotland but they were all linked to travel. \nLabour has also called for hotel quarantine to apply to all UK arrivals. \nIn December, the discovery of the new variant prompted a ban on foreign nationals travelling into the UK from South Africa and later from southern African countries.\nIt comes as the latest figures show the UK has given out more than 10 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, including more than 9.6 million first doses. \nThe number of daily coronavirus cases recorded in the UK continues to fall, with 16,840 cases recorded on Tuesday - the lowest daily figure since 9 December. \nThere have also been a further 1,449 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government figures. \nIt compares to 1,631 deaths recorded last Tuesday and means the number of deaths has fallen for seven days in a row, compared to the same day the previous week. \nIn other developments: \nDo you live in an area where the South Africa variant is suspected?

He was released in 2016.\nThe MoJ imposed new conditions on Latif's licence after Usman Khan's murderous London Bridge attack while on licence following his early release.\nLatif claimed the MoJ acted unlawfully.\nThe MoJ is defending itself against Latif's claim and argues the additional licence conditions imposed on him are lawful.\nThe nine men jailed in 2012, which included Khan, had also tried to raise funds to build a terrorist training camp in Pakistan and recruit British people to attend.\nLatif, now 36, was 28 when he was jailed for 10 years and four months for attending meetings with the intention of assisting others to prepare or commit acts of terrorism.\nLatif was automatically released from prison halfway through his sentence in February 2016, but was recalled to prison the following September over allegations he tampered with his electronic monitoring tag.\nLatif, who said the damage to his tag most likely occurred when he was playing football, was again released on licence in May 2018 on terms set by the Parole Board.\nOn 29 November 2019, Khan fatally stabbed Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, during a prisoner rehabilitation event at Fishmongers' Hall, near London Bridge, in central London while out on licence.\nKhan had been released from jail on licence in 2018, halfway through a 16-year sentence for terrorism offences.\nFive days later, Latif, who maintains he had \"no contact\" with Khan since they were in the same prison in 2016, was told that \"senior officials\" at the MoJ had imposed new conditions on his licence.\nHis lawyers say the additional conditions, which prevent him from attending \"any meetings or gatherings of more than 50 people\", or entering the City of London without prior permission, are unlawful.\nAt a High Court hearing on Wednesday, Dan Squires QC said Justice Secretary Robert Buckland appeared to have \"personally\" requested additional licence conditions for all terrorist offenders following the London Bridge attack.\nMr Squires argued the MoJ \"has no power unilaterally to add to or vary conditions on [Latif's] licence without the approval of the Parole Board,\" meaning the new conditions were unlawful.\nLatif \"had no involvement in, or prior knowledge of, the London Bridge attack\" and was \"horrified to hear of the attack and the role of Khan in it\", Mr Squires said.\nThe hearing before the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and Mr Justice Swift is expected to conclude on Thursday morning."

      "tags": "Aung San Suu Kyi,Myanmar coup ,Myanmar",
      "text": "China has blocked a UN Security Council statement condemning the military coup in Myanmar. \nThe military took power in the South East Asian nation on Monday after arresting political leader Aung San Suu Kyi and hundreds of other lawmakers. \nThe coup leaders have since formed a supreme council which will sit above the cabinet. \nIn Myanmar's biggest city Yangon though, signs of resistance and civil disobedience have been growing. \nDoctors and medical staff in dozens of hospitals across the country are stopping work in protest against the coup and to push for Ms Suu Kyi's release.\nThe United Nations Security Council met on Tuesday but failed to agree on a joint statement after China did not support it. China has the power of veto as one of five permanent members of the council. \nAhead of the talks, the UN's Special Envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner, strongly condemned the military takeover which came after the army refused to accept the outcome of general elections held in November.\nShe said it was clear that \"the recent outcome of the election was a landslide victory\" for Ms Suu Kyi's party. \nIn further criticism, the Group of Seven major economic powers said it was \"deeply concerned\" and called for the return of democracy. \n\"We call upon the military to immediately end the state of emergency, restore power to the democratically-elected government, to release all those unjustly detained and to respect human rights and the rule of law,\" the statement released in London said.  The G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. \nChina has been warning since the coup that sanctions or international pressure would only make things worse in Myanmar. \nBeijing has long played a role of protecting the country from international scrutiny. It sees the country as economically important and is one of Myanmar's closest allies. \nAlongside Russia, it has repeatedly protected Myanmar from criticism at the UN over the military crackdown on the Muslim minority Rohingya population.\n\"Beijing's stance on the situation is consistent with its overall scepticism of international intervention,\" Sebastian Strangio, author and South East Asia editor at The Diplomat, told the BBC. \nWhile China does benefit strategically from Myanmar's alienation from the west, this does not mean that Beijing is happy with the coup, he cautions. \n\"They had a pretty good arrangement with the NLD and invested a lot to build a relationship with Aung San Suu Kyi. The return of the military actually means that China now has to deal with the institution in Myanmar that historically is the most suspicious of China's intentions.\"\n\"Through this foreign policy equivalent of gaslighting, China seems to be signalling its tacit support, if not emphatic endorsement, for the generals' actions,\" Myanmar expert Elliott Prasse-Freeman, of the National University of Singapore, told the BBC.\n\"China seems to be proceeding as if this is Myanmar's 'internal issue' in which what we are observing is a 'cabinet reshuffle,' as China's state media put it.\"\nWhile he thinks a UN statement would not have made an immediate difference, it would still serve as \"a first step for cohering an international response. That appears to not be forthcoming\".\nAung San Suu Kyi, who led the now-ousted elected government, has not been seen since she was detained by the military on Monday morning. \nDozens of others also remain detained, including President Win Myint, members of her party's central committee and her personal attorney. They are reportedly being held under house arrest.\nHer National League for Democracy (NLD) demanded her immediate release on Tuesday. It has also called upon the military to accept the results of the November election, which saw the NLD win more than 80% of the votes.\nMeanwhile, the United States said it had been unsuccessful in contacting the Myanmar military and has formally declared the takeover to be a coup d'etat. This means the US cannot directly assist the government, though most of its assistance goes to non-governmental entities. \nThe EU, UK, Australia and others have also condemned the takeover. \nMyanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces until 2011, when a nominally civilian government was sworn in.\nPower has been handed over to commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. Eleven ministers and deputies, including those in finance, health, the interior and foreign affairs, were replaced.\nIn the first meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing repeated that the takeover had been \"inevitable\".\nThe country was calm in the aftermath of the coup, with troops patrolling all major cities and a night-time curfew in force. \nMyanmar has a long history of military rule and many people can still remember the terror of previous coups. \nBut on Tuesday evening, car horns and the banging of cooking pots could be heard in the streets of Yangon in a sign of protest.\nActivist groups have called for civil disobedience campaigns, setting up a Facebook group to organise their efforts. \nStaff at 70 hospitals and medical departments across the country have reportedly stepped away from all non-emergency work.\nHundreds of healthcare workers, including senior doctors, have participated in the \"Red Ribbon movement\", with many donning a red ribbon on their clothes to show they were against the coup. Online, many changed their social media profile pictures to one of just the colour red. \nSome medics are also wearing symbols like black ribbons in silent protest.\nMyanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Laos.\nIt was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011, leading to international condemnation and sanctions.\nAung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence.\nA government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh and triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community.\nShe has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the November 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more."

The star also has a third nomination, as a producer of the Borat sequel.\nTaylor-Joy, meanwhile, was shortlisted for Netflix's chess drama The Queen's Gambit and for the Jane Austen film adaptation Emma.\nColman, who won best actress in a TV drama for playing the Queen in Netflix's The Crown last year, could repeat that this year, and is also shortlisted for her forthcoming film The Father.\nFour of Colman's The Crown co-stars were also nominated - Emma Corrin (Princess Diana), Josh O'Connor (Prince Charles), Gillian Anderson (Margaret Thatcher) and Helena Bonham Carter (Princess Margaret).\nBookmakers have made the show's fourth season the favourite to win best TV drama ahead of Lovecraft Country, The Mandalorian, Ozark and Ratched. That's all despite a row over how the show portrays the Royal Family.\nSeries creator Peter Morgan said everyone involved in the Netflix series was \"thrilled to be recognised in this way\".\n\"This season really seems to have resonated with audiences of all generations all around the world,\" he said. \"We could not be more grateful or more proud.\"\nBritish stars Riz Ahmed, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman will compete for best actor in a film drama for Sound of Metal, The Father and Mank.\nThey are joined by the late Chadwick Boseman, recognised posthumously for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, and French-Algerian actor Tahar Rahim, nominated for The Mauritanian.\nVanessa Kirby and Carey Mulligan are both in the running for best actress in a film drama for Pieces of a Woman and Promising Young Woman respectively.\nSmall Axe, the landmark series of BBC films that director Steve McQueen has billed as \"love letters to black resilience and triumph in London's West Indian community\", received a nomination for best limited series or TV movie. And John Boyega, who played a pioneering police officer in one instalment, was nominated for best supporting TV actor.\nMcQueen told Entertainment Weekly the nominations were \"incredible\", adding: \"I think what's wonderful about it is that something so modest in what we tried to do has gotten recognised in this way.\"\nOther British stars on the shortlists include Rosamund Pike, Dev Patel, Daniel Kaluuya, Jodie Comer, Matthew Rhys and Nicholas Hoult.\nHugh Grant was nominated for best actor in a TV limited series for The Undoing, the same award he won in 2019 for A Very English Scandal. His co-star Nicole Kidman is up against Daisy Edgar-Jones, star of the BBC's Normal People, for the female equivalent.\nLily Collins was nominated for Netflix hit Emily In Paris - but there was no space for Michaela Coel or her acclaimed BBC drama I May Destroy You.\nEmerald Fennell will be familiar to The Crown viewers for playing Camilla Parker-Bowles. The Brit wasn't nominated for her acting - but was nominated for Promising Young Woman, her first feature film as director.\nShe was also nominated for best screenplay for writing the dark comic thriller, and was previously chief writer on the second series of Killing Eve.\nFilm and TV fans will also know Regina King, who won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for acting in 2018's If Beale Street Could Talk, and has now moved behind the camera with One Night in Miami.\nAnd Chinese director Chloe Zhao has become the first woman of Asian descent to be up for the Golden Globes' best director prize, for Nomadland.\nThe last female director to be nominated for best director was Ava DuVernay for Selma in 2014, and the only woman ever to have won is Barbra Streisand for Yentl in 1984.\nNomadland and Promising Young Woman are also nominated for best film drama alongside Mank, The Trial of the Chicago 7 and The Father.\nThe Globes split most awards between dramas and musicals/comedies, and the nominees for best musical/comedy film include Music, the directorial debut of pop star Sia.\nBut her film has attracted controversy for its casting of dancer Maddie Ziegler as a young girl on the autism spectrum.\nActress Ruth Madeley, who has spina bifida, expressed solidarity with \"every #ActuallyAutistic person who is rightly devastated to see #Sia\"s Music nominated\".\n\"Disabled people are needed in the industry now more than ever to help change the narrative we're all so sick of,\" she wrote on Twitter.\nMusic is up against the Borat sequel, the Disney+ recording of Broadway hit Hamilton, time loop comedy Palm Springs and Netflix film The Prom.\nJames Corden was a surprise nominee for best actor in a musical or comedy for The Prom, after he was criticised for taking on a character who is, by his own admission, \"as a gay as a bucket of wigs\".\nWith the cinema shutdown and delays to many films, streaming has gained the upper hand over the past year. As a result, Netflix leads the Golden Globes field with 22 out of the 70 film nominations and 20 out of 54 film nominations - giving the streaming giant one third of all nominations in total.\nYet there was no room for its period drama Bridgerton, despite the show becoming the service's \"biggest series ever\".\nPresented annually by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the Golden Globes are the most prestigious movie awards behind the Oscars.\nThis year's winners will be announced at the end of this month in a bi-coastal ceremony hosted by Tina Fey in New York and Amy Poehler in Los Angeles.\nIn a normal year, many of the nominees would be expected to be among the Academy Award nominations. But this is not a normal year. The Oscars will take place two months later than normal, having been put back from the date - 28 February - that the Globes ceremony now occupies.\nThe eligibility period for this year's Oscars has been extended by two months, meaning films released in cinemas or online before the end of February could be in contention.\nThis may not end up making much of a difference - although it could mean that the Globes' traditional role as an awards season indicator may not be as reliable as it sometimes has been.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Aung San Suu Kyi,Myanmar coup ,Nay Pyi Taw,Myanmar",
      "text": "Police in Myanmar, also known as Burma, have filed several charges against the elected civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi following Monday's military coup. \nShe has been remanded in custody until 15 February, police documents show. \nThe charges include breaching import and export laws, and possession of unlawful communication devices. \nHer whereabouts are still unclear, but it has been reported that she is being held at her residence in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw. \nDeposed President Win Myint has also been charged, the documents show - in his case with violating rules banning gatherings during the Covid pandemic.  He has also been remanded in custody for two weeks. \nNeither the president nor Ms Suu Kyi have been heard from since the military seized power in the early hours of 1 February.\nThe coup, led by armed forces chief Min Aung Hlaing, has seen the installation of an 11-member junta which is ruling under a year-long state of emergency. \nThe military sought to justify its action by alleging fraud in last November's elections, which Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won decisively. \nThe accusations are contained in a police document - called a First Initial Report - submitted to a court. \nIt alleges that Ms Suu Kyi illegally imported and used communications equipment - walkie-talkies - found at her home in Nay Pyi Taw.  \nShe was remanded in custody \"to question witnesses, request evidence and seek legal counsel after questioning the defendant\", the document says. \nMr Win Myint is accused, under the National Disaster Management Law, of meeting supporters in a 220-vehicle motorcade during the election campaign in breach of Covid restrictions. \nGiven the gravity of the military's power grab, claiming that Myanmar's national unity was at stake, and the storm of international condemnation that's followed, these charges seem comically trivial. \nBut they may be enough to secure the military's objective of barring Aung San Suu Kyi from political office, as members of parliament cannot have criminal convictions. \nFor 32 years the generals have tried, and failed, to neutralise the threat posed by Aung San Suu Kyi's enduring popularity. She has won every election she's been allowed to contest by a wide margin. \nThe only election she did not win was one held by the military government 10 years ago - back then she was also barred from contesting by a bizarre criminal conviction which was imposed on her after an American man managed to swim across a lake in Yangon to her home, where she was being held under house arrest.\nActivists in Myanmar are calling for civil disobedience. \nMany hospital medics are either stopping work or continuing but wearing symbols of defiance in simmering anger over the suppression of Myanmar's short-lived democracy. \nProtesting medical staff say they are pushing for the release of Ms Suu Kyi. \nThey are wearing red, or black, ribbons and pictured giving the three-fingered salute familiar from the Hunger Games movies and used by demonstrators last year in Thailand. \nOnline, many changed their social media profile pictures to one of just the colour red. \n\"Now young people in Myanmar... have digital power, we have digital devices and we have digital space so this is the only platform for us\" Yangon Youth Network founder Thinzar Shunlei told AFP. \n\"So we've been using this since day one, since the first few hours that we are opposing the military junta.\"\nA Facebook group has been set up to co-ordinate the disobedience campaign. \nBut there have been few signs of major protest. On Tuesday night, drivers honked their horns in the main city, Yangon (also known as Rangoon), and residents banged cooking pots. \nMyanmar has been mainly calm following the coup, with troops on patrol and a night-time curfew in force. \nThere have also been demonstrations in support of the military - one attracted 3,000 people, AP news agency reports. \nHundreds of MPs were also detained by the military but were told on Tuesday they could leave their guest houses in the capital. \nAmong them is Zin Mar Aung, an NLD MP who spent 11 years in jail on political charges under military dictatorship.  \nShe told BBC Burmese she had now been given 24 hours to leave the MPs' compound.  \n\"Currently the situation is very very tough and challenging,\" she said. \"Under the military coup it's very dangerous if we speak out about what will be our next steps... only thing that I can say is that the MPs of parliament will stand with our people and vote.\" \nThe Group of Seven major economic powers said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the coup and called for the return of democracy. \n\"We call upon the military to immediately end the state of emergency, restore power to the democratically-elected government, to release all those unjustly detained and to respect human rights,\" the statement released in London said.  The G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. \nBut efforts at the United Nations Security Council to reach a common position came to nought as China failed to agree. China is one of five permanent members with a right of veto in the council - the UN body responsible for maintaining peace. \nChina has been warning since the coup that sanctions or international pressure would only make things worse in Myanmar. \nBeijing has long played a role of protecting the country from international scrutiny. It sees the country as economically important and is one of Myanmar's closest allies. \nAlongside Russia, it has repeatedly protected Myanmar from criticism at the UN over the military crackdown on the Muslim minority Rohingya population."

      "tags": "FGM,Iran,Brits abroad",
      "text": "A British-Iranian academic facing nine years in jail in Iran has told the BBC how he escaped on foot over mountains to start a new life in the UK.\nKameel Ahmady was convicted two months ago of collaborating with a hostile government. He denies the charge.\nHe decided to try to flee while on bail and appealing against the sentence.\nMr Ahmady trekked over a mountainous border to escape the Revolutionary Guards - a journey he described as \"very long, very dark and very scary\".\nMr Ahmady was born of Kurdish stock in western Iran. But his parents sent him to Britain when he was 18 for his education. \nHe remained there many years, studying at the University of Kent and the London School of Economics. Such was his affection for Britain that he applied for British citizenship before returning to Iran as an anthropologist.\nHis research focuses on child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) in Iran. This brought him to the attention of the authorities because he campaigned to raise the age at which girls can marry, which is currently set at 13 years old.\nOne morning in August 2019, a man came to his door in Tehran saying he was a postman. Mr Ahmady opened the door and 16 Revolutionary Guards stormed in. He was arrested and taken to the notorious Evin prison.\nMr Ahmady said he had been targeted not just because he was a dual national, but also because Iran wanted to retaliate after Britain seized an Iranian oil tanker off Gibraltar that was suspected of breaking EU sanctions.\n\"Being a dual national, you are always a potential case,\" he told the BBC.\n\"My chief interrogator said, 'You're very delicious,' a) because I was Kurdish; b) I was coming from a Sunni religious background as opposed with the majority of the Shia in Iran; and c) I was a researcher who was digging up sensitive issues. And I wasn't only a simple researcher, I was actually acting on my research and using it for awareness raising.\"\nHe spent three months at Evin prison where, he said, his interrogators played mind games with him.\n\"They treated me, on a human level, well. But don't underestimate the concept and the seriousness of so-called 'white torture' - the psychological pressure they put on you. And all these games are played stage by stage, and they're very well trained as to how to put a little bit of extra pressure on you when it's needed.\"\n\"There are all sorts of mind games, it's almost like a trade. You give me this, I'll give you that - a minute of a phone call needs all sorts of negotiation with your interrogators. Five minutes more extra fresh air than the half an hour that you're entitled to. And it is becoming really sad and petty because you want to be interrogated even more, not going back to the cell, which is almost like a grave.\"\nAfter three months he was released ahead of the trial but monitored closely. \nLast December, Mr Ahmady was convicted of collaborating with a hostile government, something he denies, after prosecutors claimed that a charity he had once done some work for had once received some funding from the United States. He also faced various other charges, including promoting homosexuality in his research.\nHe was sentenced to more than nine years in jail and given a fine of more than \u00a3500,000 ($683,000). But while out on bail, he decided to flee Iran.\nHe said: \"The appeal was overturned. That was the moment that I decided to escape because I couldn't see myself staying in prison for 10 years and watching my son from a distance growing up. By the time I would have been released - if I was released - my son would have been 15.\"\nSo, without telling anyone but his immediate family, Mr Ahmady fled in secret, travelling over the mountains on foot to escape.\n\"I just simply left. I packed my bag with a shaving kit, a few books of mine, and a laptop.\"\n\"And warm clothes, because I knew I had to smuggle myself out of that train in the mountains. It was very cold, very long, very dark and very scary.\"\n\"I had to leave behind everything I loved, I worked for, all my human connections. It was so sad and scary. If I got arrested, I would have been back before the judge, and God knows what other scenarios that would be. \n\"It was a very hard and difficult decision. It was emotionally difficult. It was physically, mentally difficult. It was a move a made against my will. They pushed me out. And that was just so sad.\"\nLast September Mr Ahmady was accused of sexual misconduct towards female colleagues. The allegations were anonymous, and emerged shortly before his court hearing. But the Iranian Sociological Association revoked his membership. Mr Ahmady denied both the allegations and the suggestion they played a role in his decision to leave. \nMr Ahmady said: \"I find these allegations very upsetting. As I said at the time I take full responsibility for my actions and I find the sociological association's decision rushed and unfair. I do not accept any of these allegations. They are not related to the charges brought against me by the court which led me to escape, to restart my life in safety with my family.\"\nMr Ahmady now faces an uncertain future in Britain, without a job.\n\"I had to do what I needed to do. I couldn't stay and spend 10 years [in prison]. I can be much more useful outside and I have a responsibility towards my family.\"\nThe question now is how Tehran might respond and what impact may be felt by other British-Iranian dual nationals."

      "tags": "Ofcom,Broadband",
      "text": "People who want to swap broadband providers should be able to do so more simply, regulator Ofcom has said.\nIt follows its own research suggesting 40% of people are put off switching because it is considered too complex.\nUnder its proposals, customers would just contact their chosen new provider and the switch would happen automatically.\nThere is currently a mismatch between the number of superfast connections available and those taking them up.\nWhile 96% of UK homes can now get superfast broadband, offering speeds of at least 30Mbps (megabits per second), Ofcom estimates that only 60% have such services.\nThis means around 11 million homes could upgrade to a faster service.\nPart of the reason they haven't done so could be down to what Ofcom describes as \"the hassle of having to deal with more than one provider\". \nCurrently, if someone wants to swap providers and both firms use the Openreach network - for instance Sky and TalkTalk - the new company manages the switch.\nBut if someone wishes to switch from a provider using Openreach to Virgin Media or another one like CityFibre or Hyperoptic, they would have to contact both their existing and new firms.\nCharles Davies, managing director of provider Hyperoptic's ISP division, said: \"These proposals, if introduced, will shift the power to shop around decisively in the customer's favour. \n\"It will also ensure that all of the investment being made to upgrade the UK's networks to full fibre is supported by properly functioning competition in the market.\"\nIn 2019, Ofcom changed the rules around mobile switching, so that customers can now swap operators by simply sending a free text message.\nLindsey Fussell, Ofcom's networks and communications group director, admitted the broadband landscape can be confusing. \"There are lots of different offers out there from a wide range of broadband and landline providers.\n\"We want to make it even easier for people to get a better deal or upgrade to a faster, more reliable service. Our proposals today aim to make the process as seamless as possible, for everyone.\"\nOfcom will consult on the proposals until the end of March, with a decision due in the summer.\nRichard Neudegg, head of regulation at broadband comparison site Uswitch.com, said the proposals could help \"build consumer confidence\".\n\"Switching broadband can feel like a complicated process and can put some consumers off searching for a better deal, potentially costing them \u00a390 a year as they sit out of contract with their existing provider,\" he said.\n\"Making things easier for consumers will become especially important in the future... so consumers can move to next generation services with minimal fuss.\""

      "tags": "Alphabet,Amazon,Google",
      "text": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is to step down as chief executive of the e-commerce giant that he started in his garage nearly 30 years ago.\nHe will become executive chairman, a move he said would give him \"time and energy\" to focus on his other ventures.\nMr Bezos, who has a fortune of almost $200bn, will be replaced by Andy Jassy, who currently leads Amazon's cloud computing business.\nThe change will take place in the second half of 2021, the company said.\n\"Being the CEO of Amazon is a deep responsibility, and it's consuming. When you have a responsibility like that, it's hard to put attention on anything else,\" Mr Bezos said in a letter to Amazon staff on Tuesday.\n\"As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions.\" \n\"I've never had more energy, and this isn't about retiring. I'm super passionate about the impact I think these organisations can have,\" he added.\nMr Bezos, 57, has led Amazon since its start as an online bookshop in 1994. The firm now employs 1.3 million people globally and has its hand in everything from package delivery and streaming video to cloud services and advertising. \nHe's amassed a fortune of $196.2bn, according to Forbes' list of billionaires., making him the world's richest man. However, Bloomberg's billionaire index puts Tesla boss Elon Musk just ahead of him.\nAmazon saw its already explosive growth skyrocket last year, as the pandemic prompted a surge in online shopping.\nThe firm reported $386bn (\u00a3283bn) in sales in 2020, up 38% from 2019. Profits almost doubled, rising to $21.3bn.\nIn announcing the plans, Mr Bezos said he would continue to focus on new products and initiatives.\n\"When you look at our financial results, what you're actually seeing are the long-run cumulative results of invention,\" he said. \"Right now I see Amazon at its most inventive ever, making it an optimal time for this transition.\"\nThe shake-up comes as Mr Bezos has developed an increasingly public profile. \nHe has endured a public divorce, become a target for labour and inequality activists, and poured his wealth into other businesses, such as space exploration firm Blue Origin and the Washington Post newspaper. \nAmazon also faces increasing scrutiny from regulators, who have questioned its monopoly power. And its dominance in cloud computing is being increasingly challenged by other tech firms, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube.\nMr Bezos's decision to hand over the day-to-day operation of the company came as a surprise. But investors appeared unfazed, with little change in the firm's share price in after-hours trade.\nIn a call with analysts to discuss the firm's financial results, Amazon chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said: \"Jeff is not leaving, he is getting a new job... The board is super active and important in Amazon's success story.\"\u00a0\nMr Jassy, a Harvard graduate, has been with Amazon since 1997 and helped develop Amazon Web Services, which has long been seen as the profit engine of the company.\nThe division provides cloud computing and storage for governments and companies including McDonald's and Netflix. \n\"Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have. He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence,\" Mr Bezos said.\nSophie Lund-Yates, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was \"no accident\" that Amazon is tapping the head of the cloud business to lead the company. \nThis is a real surprise. But you have to remember that Jeff Bezos himself is worth nearly $200bn. \nAnd when you're that rich imagine what you can do. Jeff Bezos has some pretty lofty ambitions outside of Amazon. \nHis Blue Origin company wants to \"build a road to space\". He's also sunk $10bn into Earth Fund, designed to help combat the effects of climate change. \nOh, and he also owns the Washington Post. \nHow will Amazon cope? Well, importantly, he's not leaving. As executive chair and founder he'll still exercise huge power over the company. \nHowever, stepping back will inevitably mean less influence.\nHis replacement - Andy Jassy - has been running Amazon Web Services, Amazon's booming cloud business division. \nHis rise to the top underscores how important this business has become to Amazon.\nAnother top executive, Jeff Wilke, who led the firm's consumer business, announced his retirement last year.\nAmazon Web Services \"continued to shine in [its most recent] quarter, and now accounts for a more meaningful chunk of sales. The potential here is huge, and the scalable benefits that come with it should have ears pricking up,\" she said.\nOverall sales at the company rose 44% in the last three months of the year to $125.6bn, boosted in part by renewed lockdowns in some parts of the world as well as a later date for the firm's \"Prime Day\", when the firm drives sales with a slew of discounts.\nAmazon Web Services saw sales rise 28% to $12.7bn.\nCarolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, wrote on Twitter that the \"huge\" announcement showed how central cloud services are to Amazon's business.\nBut she added that she did not think Bezos was \"done making an impact on the future of the company\". \nCritics of the firm reacted to the announcement similarly. \n\"Do not be fooled by Amazon. Jeff Bezos is still in a position of immense power as executive chair,\" said Public Citizen, a US-based consumer rights activist group. \"This abusive, predatory monopoly still needs a complete overhaul.\""

      "text": "Boris Johnson has said he was not aware of a Covid outbreak at a vaccine factory ahead of his visit last week.\nThe prime minister toured the Valneva vaccine factory in Livingston as part of a trip to Scotland. \nThe company has now said that a number of coronavirus cases had been reported among staff at the site earlier in January. \nBut Valneva has insisted that Mr Johnson's tour of the factory last Thursday was \"Covid secure\". \nMr Johnson told the House of Commons that \"nobody raised that issue with me before or since\".\nBut Downing Street later admitted it had been told in advance of the visit. \nThe prime minister's official spokesman said: \"Valneva made us aware that some Covid cases had been reported and they had brought in some Covid secure procedures. \n\"The site director has said if there had been any risk they would not have allowed the visit to go ahead.\"\nMr Johnson said it was his job to visit every part of the country and \"nothing or no one is going to stop me\". \nAnd he said there are \"few things more important\" than the vaccination programme and recognising the work of the scientists involved.\nHis visit to Scotland had already proved controversial, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon questioning at the time whether it was genuinely \"essential\" for the prime minister to travel during the current lockdown restrictions.\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions, the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the visit was \"utterly, utterly reckless\" and an \"absolutely shocking error of judgment\".\nHe also accused Mr Johnson of putting \"politics before public health\".\nMr Blackford added: \"What an absolute shambles, that he's gone to a plant where there was a Covid outbreak.\n\"The Daily Record story is very clear, the PM and his advisers knew there was a serious Covid outbreak at this plant, they knew the visit posed a risk but he made a deliberate choice, they made the irresponsible choice.\"\nMr Johnson replied: \"I think what the people of Scotland want to see is the whole country pulling together and working to develop the vaccine as that fantastic plant in Scotland is doing.\n\"One of the advantages of the Valneva vaccine is that it may be able to combat all sorts of variants in a very comprehensive way. It's amazing, wonderful to see Scottish scientists working to do that. I had a fantastic time.\n\"Nobody, by the way, raised that issue with me before or since and it is my job to visit every part of this country, nothing and no-one is going to stop me and I am very, very proud of the record of the government in rolling out the vaccine.\"\nIn a statement, Valneva said \"a number of coronavirus cases were reported among staff\" at the Livingston site last month.\nIt said staff who may have been affected had been self-isolating and that the prime minister's visit was Covid-compliant. \nThe Daily Record quoted Valneva's chief financial officer, David Lawrence, as saying that Downing Street was informed of the outbreak ahead of the trip.\nMr Johnson also visited the Lighthouse Laboratory at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus in Glasgow, where coronavirus tests are processed, and met troops setting up a vaccination centre in Castlemilk.\nI was not aware of Covid cases among workers at Valneva when I visited the site to interview the prime minister on behalf of UK broadcasters last week. \nBoris Johnson made no reference to a Covid outbreak. Neither did anyone from his Downing Street team or from the company. It was simply not mentioned. \nHowever, Valneva appeared to be a highly Covid conscious company on the occasion of the prime minister's visit. \nI was required to fill out a form to confirm details of my health and travel history. I had to wear personal protective equipment including a lab coat, plastic shoe coverings and an industrial grade face covering. As did the PM. \nDowning Street has now confirmed it had been made aware of the cases before Mr Johnson's visit. \nRemarkably, it does not appear to have told the prime minister, having been advised by Valneva it had Covid-secure procedures in place. \nWith the Scottish government facing questions about the progress of the vaccine rollout north of the border, Mr Johnson has repeated the UK government's offer to \"help Scotland with the rollout of vaccines\".\nThe British Army is to start administering the coronavirus vaccine in Scotland for the first time, with 57 personnel deploying on Thursday to help health boards with the vaccine rollout.\nThe medics and management staff will make up a \"vaccine quick reaction force\" which will see five teams of 10 able to deploy across Scotland at short notice.\nThey will be in addition to the 98 members of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards who are already supporting the vaccine effort.\nScotland has been lagging behind the other three UK nations in the overall percentage of people it has vaccinated, with Scotland's health secretary and national clinical director admitting on Tuesday that it needed to speed up the rollout. \nBut at Holyrood, Nicola Sturgeon said more than 38,000 people had received their first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday - the highest daily total so far. \nShe said the Scottish government had focused on getting the most vulnerable vaccinated first, and that the programme was now accelerating. \nThe Scottish Conservatives' Ruth Davidson called for the Scottish government to publish daily breakdowns of vaccination figures for each health board area. \nAnd Scottish Labour's Jackie Baillie raised concern that there was a \"growing postcode lottery in vaccine rollout\", which Ms Sturgeon denied. \nAfter outlining cases brought to her attention of people not being told when they will receive their first dose, she told the first minister: \"These examples aren't a one-off but they are part of a growing postcode lottery in vaccine rollout, and it's slowing Scotland's recovery from Covid-19.\n\"The weekly Public Health Scotland figures show a huge variation across the country in the proportion of the population receiving the vaccine.\"\nMs Sturgeon insisted: \"People are not being penalised because of where they live.\n\"There will be differences in speed because of geographies, because of how different health boards are organising this to take account of the differences between urban areas and rural areas, the different sizes of communities, but all health boards are making progress.\""

      "text": "Two cases of the South Africa coronavirus variant have been detected in Birmingham.\nThose 18 and over in the Frankley Great Park ward and part of south Northfield area are being asked to take tests, even if they do not show symptoms.\nHealth officials said the cases were from a family living in neighbouring homes and were not linked to international travel.\nThe discovery comes after the variant was detected in nearby Walsall.\nBirmingham City Council said the two people tested positive in early January, but it was not until Friday when random tests picked up the variant.\nThe local authority said testing would be significantly increased in the areas affected.\nDr Justin Varney, director of public health in Birmingham, said the new variant presented a \"new risk\" and urged all adults to get tested \"to minimise the risk of spreading the virus\".\nHe called on people to follow the current lockdown rules and only leave the home if it was essential.\nThe South African variant, one of thousands since Covid-19 emerged, is not thought to be any more dangerous than others circulating in the UK. \nBut there are concerns it can spread more readily and vaccines may not work quite as well against it.\nThe Conservative MP for Birmingham Northfield, Gary Sambrook, said he had been working closely with public health officials and that the group intended \"to hold an online public meeting in the coming days\".\nDrive-through tests will be available with no appointment for people without symptoms at the St Modwen site on Longbridge Business Park on Thursday.\nA further mobile test site will be opened on Friday.\nThe council said it would also open several designated sites for residents to collect home testing kits.\nBusinesses have been approached to make testing available to their staff.\nA roll-out of enhanced testing has already started in eight areas in England, including Walsall, using mobile sites to trace any further transmission.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Boris Johnson,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for \"urgent action\" from the EU amid rising tensions over post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports.\nUK and EU leaders are to hold talks to try to resolve the trade issues between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nChecks on goods were suspended on Tuesday after threats to staff.\nThe UK government wrote to the European Commission overnight, calling for temporary lighter enforcement of the rules to be extended until early 2023.\nBut Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster, issued a warning against \"just kicking things down the road\", telling BBC Radio Ulster: \"We need to find solutions that are sustainable, that are workable and long lasting.\"\nOn Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the EU had \"undermined\" the Brexit deal by threatening emergency controls of Covid vaccine exports across the Irish border.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the threat had been a \"mistake that shouldn't have happened\".\nBut he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was a separate issue to address over trade rules, and it was Brexit \"causing all of this tension\" - not the measures being put in place.\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, who will be representing the UK government in talks with the EU Commission's Maros Sefcovic and Northern Ireland's devolved administration, said a three-month grace period with lighter enforcement of EU rules should be extended beyond March. \nThe UK government wrote to the European Commission on Tuesday night to outline the changes it wanted made, which would continue temporary exemptions for supermarket goods, pharmaceuticals, chilled meats and parcels crossing from GB to Northern Ireland. \nAccording to a copy of a letter seen by the BBC, the UK would want these exemptions to stay in place until 1 January 2023.\nIt comes after hauliers experienced problems transporting goods from Great Britain.\nSome parcel deliveries were stopped and supermarkets struggled to restock some products last month, although some of these problems have since been resolved.\n\"Trust has been eroded, damage has been done and urgent action is therefore needed,\" Mr Gove told the House of Commons on Tuesday, adding that supermarkets and other businesses needed to be sure they could continue to supply consumers.\nMr Gove has also asked the EU to examine its decision to ban the import into Northern Ireland of some items like seed potatoes, and the UK wants the Irish government to be able to negotiate a deal with the UK to remove barriers to pets being taken across the Irish Sea. \nAhead of the meeting, Mr Sefcovic tweeted that the protocol was \"a cornerstone\" of the agreement between the UK and EU, and \"the only way to protect Good Friday Agreement\".\nWhat happens to parcels or dogs moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland might sound like small issues.\nBut they are huge, because they threaten to break one of the things that was part of the promise in the post-Brexit protocol - that what happened would not disrupt the daily lives of people living in Northern Ireland.\nAnd, as we have seen in the past few days, this combination of all of these small changes could destabilise the very sensitive balance in Northern Ireland between the two different communities.\nThe government has no intention of ditching this protocol. That is not going to happen, even though the past few days have given the DUP and some Eurosceptics reason to call again for it to be abandoned. \nBut the government is really clear that they want to very quickly persuade the EU, as one minister put it to me, to start being pragmatic about this, rather than being purist. \nWhen the Brexit transition period ended in January, Northern Ireland remained in the EU single market while the rest of the UK left, meaning that checks had to be carried out on goods arriving from Great Britain.\nUnionists have criticised these rules, known as the Northern Ireland protocol, as damaging to trade and posing a risk to UK unity. In recent days, graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas, referring to staff carrying out checks on goods at ports as \"targets\".\nStormont suspended physical checks on food consignments at two ports on Tuesday amid the security concerns, although police said paramilitary groups are not involved.\nMr Johnson said on Twitter that his commitment to people of Northern Ireland and the union was \"unshakeable\".\nHe called for \"urgent action from the EU to resolve outstanding problems\" with the way the protocol was implemented, to preserve the Good Friday Agreement and ensure \"Northern Ireland benefits from Brexit just like every other part of our United Kingdom\".\nRecent moves by the EU had \"undermined the protocol and understandably provoked concern\", he said.\nIreland's Mr Coveney said \"elements of protocol are causing problems\" and the two sides \"need to focus on improving\" it, but he said Brexit was to blame for growing tensions in Northern Ireland, rather than the protocol itself.\nHe told Today: \"Senior political figures need to talk seriously now about trying to diffuse tension which is clearly there and need to talk about how we can make protocol work effectively.\n\"[The protocol] is an Irish and British and EU negotiated solution, an agreed solution to try to limit the disruptive impact of Brexit on Ireland and Northern Ireland. \n\"What is causing all of this tension is Brexit, not the protocol. The protocol is an attempt to try and reduce tension and solve problems linked to Brexit.\"\nAmid a dispute with manufacturers over supplies, the EU on Friday briefly threatened to use an emergency measure to override part of the deal and restrict the export of vaccines. \nIt was concerned that Northern Ireland could be used as a way to bypass export controls, using its place in the single market as a backdoor to the rest of the UK.\nThe dispute has intensified pressure among some unionist politicians to end the checks on goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, with the DUP saying it intends to work with other unionist parties to send a message that Northern Ireland must be \"freed from the protocol\".\nMs Foster, the party's leader, is due to meet Mr Johnson on Wednesday morning, to discuss her concerns before attending the talks with the EU Commission in the afternoon. \nAlso at the talks will be Michelle O'Neill, Sinn Fein's vice-president and Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, who said the DUP was  \"whipping up hysteria\" while others were \"calling for calm and resolution\".\nMr Coveney said the move by the Commission on Friday had been \"a mistake\", adding: \"It should not have happened and would not have happened if there had been the appropriate consultation.\"\nPart of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, the NI protocol guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products.\nIt was introduced to avoid creating a hard border on the island of Ireland.\nInstead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nThis is because Northern Ireland in effect remains part of the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left.\nHowever, Article 16 of the protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nThe EU announced it would trigger the clause to control exports of vaccines to Northern Ireland, but later reversed the decision.\nUnionist parties in NI have been pressing the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Pfizer,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Russia,Alexei Navalny,Vladimir Putin",
      "text": "A Moscow court has jailed Putin critic Alexei Navalny for three-and-a-half years for violating the conditions of a suspended sentence.\nHe has been in detention since returning to Russia last month. He was treated in Germany for a near-fatal nerve agent attack on him in August. \nThere have been violent scenes in Moscow - video on social media show police beating and arresting protesters who came out to support Mr Navalny.\nThousands have rallied across Russia.\nMr Navalny's suspended sentence for embezzlement has been converted into a jail term. He has already served a year under house arrest which will be deducted from the total.\nMr Navalny greeted the news with a resigned shrug, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow reports. In court he called President Vladimir Putin a \"poisoner\", blaming him for the attack.\nHis supporters called for an immediate protest, and hundreds gathered in central Moscow and St Petersburg despite a heavy police presence. More than 850 have been detained in Moscow alone, according to monitors.\nMr Navalny's lawyer said they would appeal against Tuesday's ruling.\nOn Tuesday night, security forces \"took\" the centre of Moscow, arrest-squads deployed in vast numbers to all the main roads and squares. \nIn body armours and helmets, they formed long lines beneath the multicoloured street lights still hanging up from New Year. Protesters were massively outnumbered. \nThe official show of force was like a postscript to the message sent by imprisoning Alexei Navalny: the Kremlin is fully ready to crush those who challenge its authority. \nBut Mr Navalny's supporters refuse to be silent. \nHundreds were detained tonight, and judging by the honking car horns in central Moscow - a new phenomenon - many more people are angered by what happened on Tuesday, than those ready to risk taking to the streets in open protest.\nStrong international reaction to the sentence came quickly, with the Council of Europe - the continent's leading human rights body - saying the judgement \"defied all credibility\".\n\"With this decision, the Russian authorities not only further exacerbate human rights violations as already established by the European Court of Human Rights, they also send a signal undermining the protection of the rights of all Russian citizens,\" said the council's human rights commissioner, Dunja Mijatovic, in a statement.\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described the ruling as \"perverse\", and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the verdict was a \"bitter blow to firmly established civil liberties and the rule of law\".\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for Mr Navalny's immediate and unconditional release, and said he would work closely with allies to hold Russia accountable for \"failing to uphold the rights of its citizens\".\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova responded by telling Western countries to focus on their own problems.\n\"You should not interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state,\" she said on Russian TV.\nMr Navalny has been accused of breaking the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence for embezzlement that required him to report regularly to Russian police. His lawyers say the accusation is absurd as the authorities knew he was recovering in Berlin from the nerve agent attack that nearly killed him in Russia.\nAddressing the court before the sentencing, Mr Navalny said the case was being used to frighten the opposition: \"This is how it works: they send one to jail to intimidate millions.\" \nOn the Novichok chemical attack, he said: \"Using the FSB [Federal Security Service of Russia], Putin attempted to commit murder. I'm not the only one - many know this already and many others will. And this is driving the thieving little man in the bunker crazy.\n\"No matter how much he tries to look like a geopolitician, he took offence at me because he will go down in history as a poisoner.\"\nMr Navalny's return to Russia on 17 January triggered mass protests in support of him, many of them young Russians who have only ever experienced President Putin's rule. \nThe Kremlin has denied any involvement in the attack on him, and rejects the conclusion by Western experts that Novichok - a Russian chemical weapon - was used.\nMr Navalny accuses Mr Putin of running an administration riddled with corruption, and recently released a YouTube video featuring an opulent Black Sea palace which, he alleged, was a Russian billionaires' gift to the president. More than 100 million people have watched the video.\nOn Saturday Arkady Rotenberg, a billionaire businessman close to Mr Putin, said he owned the palace and had bought it two years ago.\nBut on Sunday some protesters brandished gold-coloured toilet brushes, a symbol of their anger about the palace. For a second weekend, crowds defied bitter cold and a massive deployment of riot police, and more than 5,000 were arrested, according to OVD-Info group.\nOVD-Info says it is an independent Russian media project, which gets crowdfunding in Russia and its donors include the Memorial human rights group and the European Commission.\nMr Navalny is already serving a 30-day sentence in connection with the embezzlement case, which he denounces as politically motivated.\nIn recent days police have arrested many of Mr Navalny's top aides, who assist him in his Anti-Corruption Network (FBK).
