      "text": "An investigation has been launched after a man died in a city centre gym.\nThe 52-year-old collapsed at the unstaffed PureGym in Newport on Wednesday night and waited 45 minutes for an ambulance to arrive.\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service said they have been under \"extreme pressures\" and \"some patients have waited a long time\" and will start an internal probe.\nFellow gym users used an on-site defibrillator on the man until the paramedics arrived.\nThe man collapsed and was \"complaining of chest pain and said he couldn't breathe\" at 23:35 BST at the gym in the Kingsway Shopping Centre at John Frost Square.\n\"The gentleman was on the floor because it was hot, one man was fanning him to cool him down because they thought he might just be overheated,\" one gym member told BBC Wales, who said the man initially \"seemed ok\". \n\"But then he was complaining of chest pain and said he couldn't breathe.\"\nThe ambulance was called at 23:41 and PureGym, whose 24-hour Newport site was unstaffed between 22:00 and 06:00, said paramedics arrived on site at 00:24. \n\"We are really sorry to hear about this patient's passing and would like to extend our thoughts and deepest sympathies to their loved ones,\" said Lee Brooks of the Welsh Ambulance Service.\n\"We have sought to be upfront with the public about the extreme pressures on our ambulance service this week, and as a result, some patients have waited a long time for our help.\n\"We are looking into the circumstances of what happened and will be reaching out to the patient's family directly.\"\nPureGym confirmed a man in their Newport gym had \"medical difficulties which tragically resulted in his death.\nThe firm said a manager was on the scene within 45 minutes and added: \"We extend our deep condolences to his family and friends.\n\"This gym is staffed from 0600 to 2200 but is unstaffed outside these hours when it is supported by our central support team including access to a help point and CCTV monitoring.\n\"This is in line with industry protocols and operating procedures.\n\"We appreciate how distressing this incident is for those members in the gym at the time and have contacted them to provide support\"."

It's that basic.\"\nHe said that prolific misinformation and conspiracy theories was making it hard to get things done and slowing down vaccinations.\nAt one point he directly referenced a Qanon conspiracy, expressing dismay that some members of the public believed that \"Biden is hiding people and sucking the blood of children.\"\nIn addition to fielding audience questions on policy, Mr Biden spoke about life in the White House.\nHe said he has asked the White House staff not to make him breakfast because he likes to wear his robe and walk around.\n\"I thank all of the help that's there providing meals,\" he said.\nThe president said he felt the true weight of the office for the first time when he visited Europe in June to attend the G7 summit and meet with world leaders.\n\"I was able to go to the G7 and change their mind on a whole load of things,\" he said. \"They never had included China in any criticism.\" \nHe said meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin further drilled home the importance of the role.\n\"Putin knows who I am. He knows I mean what I say, will do what I say. It's the first time I ever felt the notion that I am in the office as the leader of the free world.\""

      "tags": "NI Health,Abortion in Northern Ireland",
      "text": "Westminster has directed Stormont's Department of Health to set up full abortion services in Northern Ireland by no later than next March.\nThe government has intervened with a formal direction requiring Stormont to act.\nChanges to abortion laws took effect last year after Westminster acted during the absence of devolution.\nBut the commissioning of services has been stalled due to disagreement within the five-party executive.\nIn March, Mr Lewis took unprecedented powers allowing him to direct Stormont to act, but he had not used them until now.\nThe government had previously said it was required to uphold legal and human rights duties on Northern Ireland abortion services and would intervene if the delay at Stormont continued.\nIn a written statement to Parliament, Mr Lewis said he was issuing the direction to the Department of Health, Health Minister Robin Swann and to the Health and Social Care Board.\nHe added that while he recognised the strain Covid-19 had placed on healthcare, he remained \"extremely disappointed\" that full commissioning proposals have not progressed.\n\"This ongoing stalemate leaves me no choice but to issue a direction,\" he said.\n\"I have a legal and moral obligation to ensure the women and girls in Northern Ireland are afforded their rights and can access the healthcare.\"\nHe also said he \"acknowledges and respects the deeply held views that individuals hold\" on abortion laws.\n\"However, it is the clear will of Parliament that the rights of women and girls in Northern Ireland are properly upheld.\"\nThe secretary of state said he was also directing Stormont's first and deputy first ministers that \"once proposals are brought forward by the Department of Health, they must be included on the agenda\" at the next executive meeting.\nIt is understood Mr Lewis has told the Stormont parties that he believes costs of the commissioned abortion services should be met by the executive through its block grant.\nThe Department of Health and Executive Office have been asked for comment.\nThis significant move is likely to face criticism from some of the parties in Northern Ireland, who accused Mr Lewis of breaching devolution when he initially intervened earlier this year. \nThe details are set out in a written statement to Parliament but the Stormont parties have already been informed of the development.\nAbortion is a devolved matter, but services have not been fully set up as the parties in the executive remain deadlocked.\nThe government has also directed that there should be \"immediate support\" for interim early medical abortion services in Northern Ireland.\nIt's the second significant intervention by Brandon Lewis on Northern Ireland in just over a week.\nBut unlike when the Stormont parties united against the proposals on legacy, there will be no unity this time.\nWhile some pro-choice parties say the government had no choice but to act due to delay and disagreement within the executive, others opposed to abortion say it amounts to a total override of devolution.\nThe government has made clear it did not want to step in but given legal duties it also must uphold, its patience with Stormont had run out.\nThis does not take the issues out of the parties' hands entirely though.\nProposals for abortion services will still need to go to the five-party executive, where any substantive discussion is likely to lead to even more division.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the barrier to human rights had been \"overcome\".\nHowever, DUP MP Carla Lockhart said abortion laws should be decided by Stormont. \n\"What we have in this statement from the secretary of state is a further example of a government acting with no respect to the local electorate and locally elected politicians. \n\"The DUP stand ready to find a locally agreed way forward. We urge all parties who sit with us in the Northern Ireland Executive to share this intent.\"\nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said he believed the delivery of services \"absolutely will happen\".\n\"Abortion is legal in Northern Ireland and therefore we need to have the services to make sure that they can be delivered.\n\"The Ulster Unionist Party has a position of conscience on abortion but myself as an MLA (member of the NI Assembly), I think that we need to have safe abortion services for women here in Northern Ireland, and it needs to be delivered as soon as possible.\"\nAlliance Party MP Stephen Farry said the intervention was \"upholding the law and human rights\". \nGreen Party NI leader Clare Bailey said she looked forward \"to seeing the creation of a fully funded, stigma-free and safe abortion service\".\nAbortion laws changed in Northern Ireland in March 2020, allowing terminations to take place in some circumstances.\nAccording to the latest figures from Northern Ireland's Department of Health, 1,556 terminations have taken place in Northern Ireland since March 2020.\nBut health trusts have been only carrying out limited services, meaning some women seeking an abortion beyond 10 weeks in their pregnancy have had to travel to Great Britain to access services.\nThe Department of Health has maintained that the matter is \"controversial\" and any decision on abortion services must be made by the whole executive.\nIn May, proposals from Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Health Minister Robin Swann on commissioning of abortion services were blocked from executive discussion by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\nThe party is opposed to abortion and has previously criticised Mr Lewis for taking powers to act, saying it would have \"serious consequences for devolution\".\nSinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP and Alliance have said they would support the commissioning of services being imposed by Westminster, if it remains stalled by the executive."

      "text": "Celeste, Arlo Parks and Mogwai are among the artists shortlisted for the Mercury Prize for album of the year.\nWolf Alice, who won in 2018, are also in the running - this time for their euphoric third album, Blue Weekend.\nBut they say they're wary of another victory. \"I would start to hate a band if they won it twice, without any rationale,\" joked bassist Theo Ellis.\nOther nomineees include Ghetts and Laura Mvula, while Berwyn is the first artist to be nominated for a mixtape.\nLess formal than a traditional album, mixtapes usually serve as an introduction to a new artist, or appear as a stop-gap between major releases by acts like Drake or Kanye West.\nBerwyn Dubois, who came third in the BBC Sound Of 2021, is recognised by the Mercury panel for his heartfelt and hook-filled debut Demotape/Vega, which he recorded in his bedroom three years ago and released last September.\nThere's also a nomination for the mysterious Sault - a collective of unknown musicians who released two albums last year reflecting the global protests against police brutality towards black people. \nThe second of those records, Untitled (Rise), picks up recognition from the 2021 Mercury judges - who include last year's winner Michael Kiwanuka, Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac and Tshepo Mokoena, editorial director of Vice. \nFour of the 12 records they selected are instrumental or predominantly instrumental, reflecting changing listening habits during the pandemic.\nThey include Nubya Garcia's richly musical debut, Source, and the one-track album Promises - which is a collaborative composition by electronic musician Floating Points and jazz saxophonist Pharoah Sanders. \nScottish post-rock pioneers Mogwai receive their first nomination for their 10th album As The Love Continues, which is also largely instrumental.\n\"It's very unexpected,\" said frontman Stuart Braithwaite. \"It's one of those things we never thought was going to happen.\"\nWhile Mogwai's albums are traditionally light on vocals, he said he could understand why instrumentals had become more popular over the last year.\n\"When you take away the element of people singing along with things, maybe people think of music in a more introspective way. \n\"But with the albums on the [Mercury] shortlist, I think it's more to do with the fact they're just really good records.\"\nWolf Alice and Laura Mvula join an elite club of artists who've been nominated for each of their first three albums, joining Coldplay, Anna Calvi and Michael Kiwanuka.\n\"We're blown away,\" said Wolf Alice's Theo Ellis. \"It's something we used to watch on TV when we were kids, so it's absolutely insane to be nominated three times.\n\"Hopefully it means we get to go out of the house and have a few free beers,\" he added.\nFirst-time nominee Celeste agreed.\n\"I can't wait to go and be amongst everyone else,\" she told the BBC. \"It's momentous to be nominated so I'm sure we'll all revel in that together.\"\nThe winner of the \u00a325,000 prize will be announced on 9 September in a ceremony at the Eventim Apollo, in London.\nHere are the nominees in full.\nEquipped with an old laptop and broken headphones, Berwyn wrote and recorded his debut mixtape in just two weeks in 2018.\nHe described the album as a \"last-ditch\" attempt to escape his surroundings. At the time, he was sleeping on a mattress on a bare floor, with an uncertain immigration status that left him unable to enrol in university, get a job or release music.\nUnvarnished but heartfelt, the songs vividly sketch a life lived on the margins: \"How come sleepin' in the car only filled me with drive?\" he asks on Glory.\nThe critics said: \"Starkly confessional and leaving nothing to question, Demotape/Vega is a striking outlook on the life that formed Berwyn's artistry.\" [97 Parade]\nListen to this: Trap Phone\nSeven-piece rock outfit Black Country, New Road have been called \"Britain's most divisive new band\" but their debut album united critics in praise.\nThe NME said For The First Time was \"bursting with ideas\", while Clash called it \"a significant milestone in modern guitar music\".\nAt first, it's a challenging listen. A collision of jazz, punk, noisecore, art-rock and the traditional Jewish music klezmer, its six songs warp and distort over nine-minute running times.\nBut perseverance reveals moments of tenderness, abrasive humour and wild invention, all part of the band's self-stated mission of \"embedding weirdness within songwriting\".\nThe critics said: \"That none of their experiments feel gimmicky speaks to a diverse and inquisitive musicianship.\" [Pitchfork]\nListen to this: Sunglasses\nBorn in LA but raised in Essex and Brighton, Celeste's career has been on an upward trajectory since she won the BBC Sound Of... poll at the start of 2020. \nAt that point, work on her debut album was already under way  - but she put it on pause during the initial stages of lockdown.\n\"Being in solitude helped me to get back in touch with my thoughts and feelings,\" she told the BBC \"I think in the process of doing that I found my true voice again and felt comfortable to let that be heard.\"\nThe result is a lush, soulful collection of songs that sent the artist straight to number one in February.\nThe critics said: \"A classy debut, from a sophisticated talent who takes things at her own sweet pace.\" [The Telegraph]\nListen to this: Strange\nThe first recording by US jazz legend Pharoah Sanders in more than a decade, Promises is a long-form collaboration between the 80-year-old saxophonist and British electronic musician Sam \"Floating Points\" Shepherd.\nThey're backed by the London Symphony Orchestra, who recorded their parts individually during lockdown, using more than 100 microphones.\nAlthough it is divided into nine \"movements\", it is essentially one continuous piece of music that unfolds over 46 minutes, like a slow motion video of a flower in bloom.\nSanders plays with watchful reflection throughout, as if holding a casual conversation with Shepherd's chiming harpsichords and airborne synth lines. \nIn a rare interview with the Los Angeles Times last year, he confirmed that had always been his approach: \"Just let the music come, and spend as much time as you can listening.\" \nThe critics said: \"It is a key work - a significant milestone - in the grand history of not only Sanders' career, but the whole free jazz style he helped pioneer.\" [Music OMH]\nListen to this: Promises (Movement 1)\nRooted in stories of family and community, the debut album by jazz musician Nubya Garcia celebrates the rich rhythms of the Afro-Caribbean diaspora.\n\"I was born in this country and grew up here, but my family isn't English,\" she told Paste Magazine. \"So I wanted to incorporate more of my identity in terms of the fact that my family is from the Caribbean. Music is a huge representation of a country and its culture. \n\"Reggae, dub, calypso, soca - all these styles that come from the Caribbean - and I just wanted to sprinkle some of that joy on the record.\"\nOver nine songs, she honours her ancestors (The Message Continues), stresses the importance of female solidarity (Stand With Each Other) and celebrates spiritual freedom (Boundless Beings).\nDeeply melodic and passionately heartfelt, it saw Garcia named a \"major voice\" by The New York Times and earned her a solo concert at this year's BBC Proms.\nThe critics said: \"The perfect encapsulation of British jazz in 2020.\" [The Times]\nListen to this: Source\nGhetts' third album, and his first major-label release, is a showcase for the rapper's versatility. It skips between familiar grime topics - police brutality, street violence, lyrical one-upmanship - and more unexpected musings on teenage heartache, his struggles with ADHD and fatherhood.\nThe key track is the seven-minute rags-to-riches story, Autobiography, which opens with Ghetts' mother reminiscing about his first ever stage performance, at the age of three, and ends with the star declaring himself the greatest of all time.\nBut Ghetts, who released his first mixtape 16 years ago, is also aware of his responsibility to the next generation: \"Industry's full up of victims of mental health,\" he raps with evident concern. \"Don't forget about yourself while you entertain the world.\"\nThere are guest appearances from Stormzy, Ed Sheeran, Shaybo, Dave and Skepta, but the real star is the 36-year-old's disarming candour.\nThe critics said: \"A dazzling piece of storytelling.\" [The Guardian]\nListen to this: Good Hearts\nMogwai wanted to record their 10th album in the US last summer but thanks to Covid, they ended up in a converted church in Worcestershire, with producer David Friddman dialing in by Zoom.\nBut while the band were earth-bound, their music soared. \"I think it's quite a warm record, and that might have come from writing the music while we were stuck inside during a plague,\" frontman Stuart Braithwaite told the NME. \"It has a lot of positivity to it, which some of our records in the past haven't so much.\"\nLargely instrumental, the songs have a cinematic sweep and scale - ascending from fragile grooves into thunderous, feedback-encircled climaxes. \nReleased in February, the album gave the Scottish band their first number one, an achievement Braithwaite described as \"totally surreal\" and \"completely unexpected\".\nThe critics said: \"Yet another high water mark in Mogwai's irresistible ride.\" [Mojo magazine]\nListen to this: Ritchie Sacramento\nAfter releasing two Mecury-nominated albums - 2013's Sing To The Moon and 2016's The Dreaming Room - Laura Mvula was unceremoniously dumped by Sony Music, who informed her of their decision by forwarding an email that was just seven lines long.\nShe subsequently said it was \"a hard thing to make sense of and to come back from\" - but, earlier this year, she bounced back in style, with her triumphant, joyous, liberated third album, Pink Noise.\nMarinated in the saw-tooth synths and chunky drum machines of the 1980s (Prince's Purple Rain gets a namecheck) its principle purpose is to get you on your feet.\n\"Ultimately, when it comes to dance music it's all about feeling,\" she told DIY Magazine. \"It doesn't matter if I have the most killer sentiment in the song, or the most poetic lyric; if the song doesn't groove, it doesn't carry.\"\nThe critics said: \"Pink Noise is a John Hughes soundtrack just waiting for its film to be written and it's a bold return from an artist with a point to prove.\" [The Skinny] \nListen to this: Got Me\nSoothing and tender, Arlo Parks' debut album is full of hope, even when she tackles subjects like depression, grief and alcoholism.\n\"Just know it won't hurt so much forever,\" she reassures a friend on the soulful R&B groove of Hurt. \"I'll be there to kiss the damage,\" she tells a victim of domestic abuse on For Violet.\nThe 20-year-old says she wants her songs to help people in the same way Radiohead and Sufjan Stevens helped her as a teenager.\n\"In times of chaos, I've always reached for music as a kind of salve or a healing agent,\" she told the BBC earlier this year. \"It makes you feel held and understood... no matter where you're from, or even what language you speak.\"\nThe critics said: \"A quietly subversive pop record that, for all its deceptive softness, challenges old perceptions of sexuality and mental health.\" [NME]\nListen to this: Black Dog\nInspired by the patterns created by fir trees on the side of a mountain, Hannah Peel's latest album is an expansive and life-affirming ode to the earth's natural cycles.\nFrom the ethereal voices of the opening song, Wind Shadow, to the other-worldy textures of the closing track, Reaction Diffusion, the Northern Irish musician manages to create a sonic universe all of her own.\nIt's also a record that pays tribute to electronic music pioneer Delia Derbyshire - who famously arranged the original Doctor Who theme. Peel was given permission to reinterpret the musician's 1972 album Electrosonic, re-sampling her work to generate new digital instruments, and pay tribute to one of her inspirations.\n\"I just wish I could have had a conversation with her over a cup of tea at some point to find out what drove her,\" Peel told the Yorkshire Post. \"It is that side of experimentation and willing to do something different, I think that's really gorgeous.\"\nThe critics said: \"Wait until the right time of night, put it on your headphones, and it... becomes entirely transporting.\" [The Arts Desk]\nListen to this: Emergence In Nature\nShrouded in mystery, British music collective Sault have stealth-released a series of powerful, funky albums over the last three years. Their latest, Nine, only adds to their mystique: it's primed to self-destruct after 99 days.\nThey've never done any press, and their identities are a secret. The best the internet can guess is that the project is a collaboration between British producer InFlo (Michael Kiwanuka, Little Simz), singer Cleo Sol and Kanye West prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Kid Sister.\nThe wilful anonymity works because it focuses your attention on the music - an intoxicating fusion of funk, soul, disco, house and R&B. \nTheir Mercury Prize nomination comes for their second album of 2020, which uses those dance-floor grooves as a Trojan Horse for hard-hitting lyrics about black lives. \"Why do my people always die?\" demands the vocalist on I Just Want to Dance. \"Little boy, when you get older...  I'll tell you the truth about the boys in blue,\" adds the seemingly serene closing track, Little Boy.\nThe critics said: \"More than writing simple protest songs, they are creating what is arguably some of the most life-affirming and confrontational music released in recent years.\" [Beats Per Minute]\nListen to this: I Just Want To Dance\nProving that 2017's Mercury Prize-winner Visions Of A Life was no fluke, Wolf Alice sharpened their songwriting skills and delivered one of the best British rock albums of the last 10 years.\nWith chameleonic musical powers, they swerve confidently from moshpit anthems (Play The Greatest Hits) and dreamy indie pop (Safe From Heartbreak) to stadium-ready torch songs (The Last Man On Earth).\nThe connective tissue is frontwoman Ellie Rowsell, whose affecting vocals and whip-smart lyrics are always worth paying attention to, whether she's \"feeling like Marilyn Monroe\" on a trip to LA, or calling out misogynist rock critics on Smile\nThe critics said: \"The sound of a band satisfying themselves rather than proving themselves, and completely filling the space they've carved out over the years.\" [The Forty-Five]\nListen to this: Last Man On Earth\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Liverpool stripped of Unesco World Heritage status",
      "tags": "Unesco World Heritage sites,Unesco,Liverpool",
      "text": "Liverpool has been stripped of its World Heritage status after a UN committee found developments threatened the value of the city's waterfront.\nThe decision was made following a secret ballot by the Unesco committee at a meeting in China.\nUnesco had said that the developments, including the planned new Everton FC stadium, had resulted in a \"serious deterioration\" of the historic site. \nThe decision was described as \"incomprehensible\" by the city's mayor. \n\"Our World Heritage site has never been in better condition having benefitted from hundreds of millions of pounds of investment across dozens of listed buildings and the public realm,\" Joanne Anderson said.\nShe said she would work with the government to examine whether the city could appeal against the decision, which comes \"a decade after Unesco last visited the city to see it with their own eyes\".\nLiverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said the decision was \"a retrograde step that does not reflect the reality of what is happening on the ground\".\n\"Places like Liverpool should not be faced with the binary choice between maintaining heritage status or regenerating left-behind communities and the wealth of jobs and opportunities that come with it,\" he said.\nLabour's Kim Johnson, MP for Liverpool Riverside, said she remained \"proud of my city and what we've done\".\n\"People come here because it's amazing city and, while I'm disappointed, as a city we are resilient and we will always fight back.\"\nThe government said it was \"extremely disappointed\" and believes Liverpool still deserves its heritage status \"given the significant role the historic docks and the wider city have played throughout history\".\nLiverpool becomes only the third site to lose its World Heritage status since the list began in 1978, the other two being Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary in 2007 and the Dresden Elbe Valley in Germany in 2009.\nAnnouncing the decision, the committee chairman said 20 votes had been cast - with 13 in favour of deleting the city, five against the proposal and two ballot papers being invalid.\nLiverpool's Liberal Democrat leader Richard Kemp said it was a \"day of shame\" for the city, adding that it would \"without a doubt, affect our tourism and inward investment\". \nThe city was awarded the much-coveted title in 2004 in recognition of its historical and architectural impact, joining places including the Taj Mahal, Egypt's Pyramids and Canterbury Cathedral.\nIt recognised its history as a major trading centre during the British Empire and its architectural landmarks.\nHowever, a report in June by the World Heritage Committee said developments on the city's waterfront had resulted in \"irreversible loss of attributes\". \nIt cited the Liverpool Waters project and Everton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley Moore Dock. \nChris Capes, director of development for Peel L&P's Liverpool Waters, said he was disappointed \"particularly given the considerable investment that the city has put into protecting and improving its heritage sites\".\nEverton have agreed to invest up to \u00a355m to \"preserve, restore and celebrate the heritage assets\" of the area as part of its stadium plan.\nThey project was approved following two public consultations, with the second survey attracting more than 40,000 people.\nThe club found 98% of people supported the proposed design of the stadium, while 96% backed the club's plans for historic features on the site. \nBy Claire Hamilton, BBC Radio Merseyside political reporter\nLiverpool has seen more peaks and troughs than most, and it's a city which has changed immeasurably since 2004 when the World Heritage Status was conferred.\nBack then, there was no Liverpool One shopping centre, no hint that Everton would consider building a multi-million pound waterfront stadium and its year as European Capital of Culture hadn't happened. The city has changed.\nToday, there's a sense of defiance in some quarters about Unesco's decision that the city doesn't need the title, especially if sits in the way of progress for an area which has lain neglected and semi derelict for decades.\nCritics argue the benefits of being a World Heritage status were never properly spelled out and there wasn't the political will in the city to address Unesco's concerns until recently, when it was too late.\nMany people argue that tourists visiting the Pier Head, St George's Plateau or Penny Lane are not coming because Liverpool is a designated World Heritage site - they probably don't even realise it is.\nThey're coming for the Beatles, the football, food and the history but that history will remain.\nYet today's announcement worries those who fear that the ability to protect heritage, architecture and history is now diminished, that there will be a free-for-all of unsuitable, careless development. \nThe argument for the last decade has been presented as a binary choice: heritage or progress? The feeling in Liverpool is, couldn't we have had both?\nDr David Jeffery, who is a lecturer of British politics at the University of Liverpool, said he believed the decision would not have a \"serious impact\" on the city's tourism industry. \n\"I do hope this serves as a warning to the council to stop approving ugly buildings though,\" he said.\nWayne Colquhoun, who has campaigned for 15 years to keep Liverpool's heritage status, said he was \"devastated\" by the news.\n\"It's the status symbol that has put us up there with the Great Wall of China and the pyramids and now it has gone,\" he said. \n\"You've got to be clever being a World Heritage city and be able to take traditional materials and build them in a modern manner.\"\nRichie Wright, 40, who has lived in Liverpool all his life, said the status had \"on many occasions, hampered and restricted development in a city that is ripe for development\".\n\"I hope that Liverpool and its wider city region now seizes this opportunity to make common sense decisions that make our city and the world proud,\" he said.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Public sector,NHS,Royal College of Nursing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nurses may consider industrial action over the offer of a 3% NHS pay rise in England and Wales, a union says. \nThe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) told the BBC it would be consulting members but staff were \"angry\" and deserved a bigger increase.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng acknowledged the hard work of NHS staff and said he felt the 3% rise was fair.\nMeanwhile, school leaders have said the pay freeze for most teachers in England is a \"slap in the face\". \nIn November the government announced a public sector pay freeze for 2021-22, with exceptions made for those on salaries under \u00a324,000 and NHS staff.\nThe 3% pay rise is for most NHS staff including nurses, paramedics, consultants, dentists and salaried GPs and is backdated to April 2021.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said the pay rise was a recognition of the \"extraordinary efforts\" of NHS workers.\nAccording to government calculations for the average nurse, this will mean an additional \u00a31,000 a year, while many porters and cleaners will receive around \u00a3540.\nIt comes after heavily criticised proposals made by the Department for Health and Social Care in March said only a rise of 1% was affordable.\nThe independent NHS pay review body then recommended a 3% rise, which was accepted by the government. \nPatricia Marquis, England director of the RCN, said the whole process had been \"shambolic\" and nurses had \"fallen way behind on pay\". \nShe told BBC Two's Newsnight: \"Our next steps will be to consult with our members about their view on the award. \n\"And once we have their view - which we suspect will be to say they are unhappy about the level - we will then be considering with them what the next steps might be, which could include consideration of industrial action most certainly.\" \nShe added that nurses were \"really angry and upset\" at the pay award, which the union says amounts to a pay cut once inflation is taken into account, and it made them feel they were not \"valued for what they do\". \nThe RCN had called for a 12.5% pay increase, which it said would help fill vacancies and retain staff. \nThe business secretary told BBC Breakfast NHS staff undertook \"incredible work\" but said the country was in a \"difficult position\" as far as public finances were concerned.\nMr Kwarteng said: \"I think 12.5%, given the situation we are in, is a huge amount to ask for in a single year - given that we have spent something like \u00a3350bn... supporting the economy, keeping jobs alive, paying people's wages effectively and also giving loans to businesses.\"\nOther unions have also criticised the pay offer. \nUnison said the increase, though an improvement on the initial offer, fell short of what NHS staff deserved.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors, also said the pay rise was disappointing, adding that junior doctors and some GPs could miss out on it altogether.\nThe GMB union described the increase as \"insulting\" and said it would recommend its members reject the offer. \nLabour's shadow health minister Justin Madders described the new pay rise as a \"U-turn\" and called on the government to \"make our NHS and key workers feel supported and valued after all they have done for us\".\nNHS Trusts and employers said all pay rises need to be fully funded by government, rather than being squeezed from existing hospital budgets.\nNHS pay rises are negotiated by independent pay-review bodies that look at evidence from a range of groups before making recommendations to the government.\nThe pay rise does not include doctors and dentists in training who have their own separate, multi-year contracts.\nIn theory, the pay-review bodies make recommendations for NHS staff across the UK - but it is up to the individual UK nations to decide whether to accept them.\nAll NHS staff in Wales will be offered a 3% rise by the Welsh government.\nIn Scotland, most NHS staff have already been offered a 4% pay rise  - backdated to December 2020. This follows a one-off Covid payment for health and social care staff of \u00a3500.\nMeanwhile, the government has also confirmed that there will be a pause to headline pay rises for the majority of public sector workforces in 2021-22. \nBut the School Teachers' Review Body has recommended a pay award of \u00a3250 for all teachers earning less than \u00a324,000 in England. \nThe pay freeze for other teachers was criticised by unions, who said it risked making recruitment challenges worse. \nNAHT, the school leaders union, said it was a \"slap in the face\", while the Association of School and College Leaders said it was \"an absolute insult\", after a year where teachers had worked \"flat out\" because of the pandemic. \nShadow education secretary Kate Green said: \"A real-terms pay cut for the vast majority of teachers is an insult after the heroic work they have done to keep children safe and learning throughout the pandemic."

It is also a recognition of how valued they are by Welsh communities.\"\nShe said it means that the lowest paid staff would also receive more the living wage recommendation of \u00a39.50 an hour.\nThe Welsh Conservatives said they were \"delighted\" at the pay award, while Plaid Cymru said staff might feel \"let down\", considering the 4% offer in Scotland.\nBut Helen Whyley, RCN Wales' director, said: \"The 3% award is a long way off the 12.5% claim of the Royal College of Nursing, which would bring nurses in line with other professions and redress the fact that their wages have reduced over the last 10 years.\n\"It also does not recognise the commitment of nursing staff throughout the pandemic.\"\nIt follows a row earlier in the year where the UK government suggested it would only support a 1% pay rise for NHS workers in England.\nWelsh Labour had criticised the proposed cap during the recent Senedd election campaign, but did not state what it would offer instead, with ministers saying they would wait for the pay bodies' recommendations. \nPlaid Cymru's deputy leader, Sian Gwenllian, said: \"Our health service is already under pressure, under-resourced and under-staffed, and the least we can do is ensure our workers do not remain under-paid.\"\nWelsh Conservative shadow health minister, Russell George, said the pay award was \"recognition of their extraordinary efforts during the most challenging period in the history of our treasured national health service\".\nThe Welsh NHS' funding comes mostly from the UK government, and Welsh officials said the Treasury had not said whether any additional cash would be provided for the pay deal.\nIt is in addition to an earlier one-off payment of \u00a3735 last March."

      "text": "Sub-postmasters wrongly convicted of offences in a Post Office IT scandal will get interim compensation of up to \u00a3100,000, the government has said.\nAs of this week, a total of 59 former sub-postmasters have had their convictions quashed - with more due in court over the coming months.\nMore people have been affected by the scandal than in any other miscarriage of justice in the UK.\nThe government has agreed to fund the initial payments.\nThose affected can still seek extra compensation at a later date, via mediated settlements or through the civil courts. Some of those claims could add up to millions of pounds.\nPostal Affairs Minister Paul Scully said: \"The suffering and distress these postmasters and their families have gone through cannot be overstated. While nothing will make up for the years of pain they faced after this appalling injustice, I hope this initial step provides a measure of comfort.\n\"The Post Office has started to turn a corner in terms of dealing with its past mistakes - and this government will support them in doing so wherever possible.\"\nThere were more than 700 prosecutions based on evidence from the Horizon software system. \nHundreds of people who ran Post Office branches were subsequently convicted of various offences, including theft and false accounting, when the system was used. \nFollowing the convictions some of these former postmasters went to prison, were shunned by their communities, and struggled to secure work. Some lost their homes and even failed to get insurance owing to their convictions. Some have since died.\nHowever, the IT was found to have bugs and defects that left a black hole in accounts.\nFollowing a series of court cases, many have received some civil compensation and some have had their convictions overturned. \nThe Post Office said the interim payments would be offered to those who were \"badly failed\" whilst final compensation arrangements were established.\nIts chief executive, Nick Read, said: \"Ensuring compensation is made as quickly as possible is a priority for Post Office.\n\"Whilst we cannot change the past, this is an important step towards meaningful compensation for victims and we will offer payments as soon as possible.\"\nThe Post Office is contacting postmasters and will aim to make an offer for an interim payment within 28 days of receiving an application from those whose overturned convictions relied on Horizon evidence.\nAnyone who has received a share of the civil payout can still receive the latest compensation, if their Horizon-related conviction is overturned.\nChi Onwurah, Labour's shadow business minister, said: \"This news is bittersweet - for those sub-postmasters who lost their jobs, homes, and reputations, for those who have still not had their convictions overturned and so will not be in scope, and for those who lost their lives, for whom this news comes too late.\"\nNeil Hudgell, of Hudgell Solicitors, which represents some of the postmasters, described the announcement of interim compensation as a \"cautiously positive step\"\n\"This cannot be a delaying gesture though. This is money to which these clients are entitled. With regards to how final settlements are agreed, we want them to come to the table and be meaningful in what they put forward,\" he said.  "

      "text": "New Covid daily contact testing sites for workers at supermarket depots and food manufacturers won't begin operating until next week. \nSupermarket depot workers and food manufacturers in England will be exempt from quarantine rules as the government tries to prevent food supply problems.\nThe government had initially promised to begin testing at 15 \"crucial\" supermarket depots on Friday.\nBut the BBC has learned that testing will be delayed until Monday 26 July.\nUp to 10,000 staff are expected to qualify for the scheme, but supermarket workers are not included.\nEarlier on Friday, the Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast: \"We've identified 15 depots covering around five supermarkets where they have the most acute problem with staff absences at the moment and we intend to roll that out today. They already have the infrastructure in place to do the testing at those sites.\"\nHowever, on Friday afternoon a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesman confirmed to the BBC that testing has not yet started.\n\"No sites are running yet, but we expect to be able to offer daily contact testing to some priority organisations by the end of the day on Monday 26 July and we will support them to mobilise as quickly as possible,\" he said. \nHe added that so far, Defra had contacted 10 supermarkets and that Test & Trace would continue to contact all the organisations identified for this scheme over the weekend and early next week.\nThe move comes after the high number of retail staff self-isolating affected the availability of some products.\nIceland welcomed the change, but said it wouldn't solve the issue of staff shortages in supermarkets themselves.\n\"The food supply chain only works if teams are in place to support at each stage - there's no point in fixing the manufacturing and logistics issues if there is no one to put products on the shelves, serve customers at the till and deliver to their homes,\" said Iceland boss Richard Walker.\nInitially, 15 supermarket depots will be involved, followed by 150 depots later on next week. Up to 500 sites will take part in total, but the new rules will not apply to supermarket store staff. \nIt will mean workers who are alerted by the app or contacted by NHS Test and Trace will be able to continue working if they test negative, whether or not they are vaccinated.\nKrissy Fremont is the HR manager for Birchall Foodservice, a wholesaler based in Burnley, Lancashire, that delivers to schools, hospices, care homes, restaurants, hotels and cafes.\nShe says there is still confusion as to whether her firm is on the exemptions list and when they can start on-site daily contact testing - instead of staff members having to self-isolate. \n\"We're struggling left, right and centre in all departments, but this last week has been the toughest with people having to self-isolate with pinging from the app or children having to self-isolate from school,\" she told the BBC.\n\"We've had 14 people off in the last week due to Covid and only one of them has been a positive case.\"\nShe says her customers cannot be left without food because many are in vulnerable situations, so by hook or by crook the food deliveries must go out. \n\"So we've had directors going out delivering, we've had to buy extra vans so people like myself can go out delivering.... the management team is all hands on deck,\" she said. \n\"We can't fail our customers, they've stood by us and we have to get our orders out.\"\nThe scheme will run until 16 August when the plan is for the rules to change so that double jabbed people and under-18s will no longer have to self isolate if they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. \nM&S said it was working with the government to identify the key sites it wanted to take part in the daily contact testing scheme. \nBut it said more needed to be done to \"mitigate the impact on wider store operations for all food retailers and we would like the bring forward of the 16 August date so that those who are fully vaccinated or who have a negative test are not forced to quarantine when they are contacted by track and trace\". \nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast shop staff had been excluded from the scheme because their inclusion would have been a \"really significant undertaking\". \n\"You're talking then thousands of different shops and many more people and we still want to maintain the test, trace and isolate system.\"\nHowever, he added that the government would keep the policy \"under review, but we think this is a sensible first step\".  \n\"We're never going to take risks with our food supply chain,\" he added.\nThe government's move comes as supermarkets said the supply of some products was being affected by the \"pingdemic\" keeping staff away from work.\nA record 618,903 people were told to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app between 8 and 15 July in England and Wales. \nWhile some retailers said they may have to close stores, they played down fears of food shortages, saying the problems were not widespread.\nHelen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said \"disruption is limited at the moment\", but it was vital that the government rolled out the scheme as fast as possible and was prepared to take further action if necessary.\nSeparately, the government outlined plans to allow other key industries in England to deploy daily Covid testing instead of self-isolation for a limited number of essential workers. In this case, the scheme will only apply to workers who are fully vaccinated.\nThis scheme covers sectors including transport, emergency services, border control, energy, digital infrastructure, waste, the water industry, essential defence outputs and local government. \nThe policy applies only to workers named on a list kept updated by officials - it is not a blanket exemption for all employees in a sector. \nHannah Essex, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that while the announcement would be a relief to some businesses, \"it will leave many more still facing critical staff shortages and lost revenue as the number of people being asked to isolate remains high\".\nCBI director general Tony Danker agreed, warning: \"The current approach to self-isolation is closing down the economy, rather than opening it up.\"\nBusinesses have already exhausted contingency plans to get in extra staff and are \"at risk of grinding to a halt in the next few weeks\", he added.\nPhil Langslow, trading director at Cheshire-based County Milk Products, which provides dairy products to the likes of Nestle and Kellogg's, said the government move was \"a step in the right direction\".\n\"People having to isolate meant that a number of our suppliers, the service providers that are doing the transport for us, have just said they cannot cope. Roughly half of the deliveries that we would expect to be done are not being done routinely and we're having to scramble to actually get product to its destination on time.\n\"If you think of the food chain as just that - as a chain, and like any chain, you're only as good as the weakest link - if you cannot get your goods to the market, then you've got a problem,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\nScotland has also launched a system of exemptions from self-isolation, covering workers in sectors such as health and social care.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said daily testing of food industry staff would \"minimise the disruption caused by rising cases in the coming weeks, while ensuring workers are not put at risk\".

And we need to go back to that stage,\" he said.\nMs Morgan said demand on Wales' GPs and emergency departments had continued to grow beyond levels seen before the pandemic, adding: \"Staff are under real pressure.\"\nThe government, she said, wanted to make sure everyone could access the \"high quality care they need in the right place, the first time\".\n\"Often people feel they have no option but to go to their GP, call 999 or go to their nearest emergency department for advice or treatment,\" Ms Morgan said.\n\"But under our new plans, people with urgent care needs could be treated elsewhere by the many different health professionals working in NHS Wales.\"\nHealth boards have had funding to set up new \"urgent primary care centres\", she said, where people can be seen without the need for a GP appointment or to go to A&E.\nShe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers ambulance services saw a 45% rise in calls on Monday compared with the previous week. \nShe urged people to think \"very carefully\" about whether their accident was \"genuinely\" an emergency to help reduce waiting times.\nLast month, Ms Morgan welcomed the rollout of a 111 service system for people in north Wales to get \"non-urgent medical advice\".\n\"What we're trying to do is make sure the public understands that there are alternatives to accident, emergency and GP services,\" she said.\nThe service has now been rolled out to all health board areas across Wales, except for the Cardiff and Vale area, which is expected to come later this financial year. \nAdditional money will also be made available for schemes to help people return home from hospital, reducing unnecessarily long stays and freeing up essential bed capacity.\nThe summer holidays and hot weather, along with the easing of lockdown restrictions and an increase in Covid cases, has heaped more pressure on the NHS.\nThe Welsh Conservatives called on the health minister to urgently come out with a plan, calling the numbers \"extremely concerning\".\n\"Without treatment, people simply cannot go about their daily lives,\" Russell George said.\n Plaid Cymru welcomed the announcements of extra funding and better signposting, but said problems were \"even deeper than before.\n\"I'll be looking for evidence of changes that make a difference in the long term, building more sustainable services at the heart of our communities,\" Rhun ap Iorwerth said.\nOlwen Williams, vice president for Wales at the Royal College of Physicians, described the proposals as \"a wonderful opportunity\".\n\"Care in the community is definitely the way forward,\" she said.\n\"And we need our primary care teams, our ambulance services, our community services, social services and our medical services all to work together to ensure that individuals get the right care in the right place at the right time.\"\nDr Williams added there were \"two big challenges\" involved.\nShe said the first was whether people would accept the change of \"care closer to home\".\nThe second, she explained, was to do with staffing, and how health boards would deliver the changes.\nWales Ambulance Service chief executive Jason Killens said a combination of factors in recent days had put the service under \"extreme pressure\".\n\"It's not just here in Wales that we're seeing this unprecedented level of demand on the emergency ambulance service, and indeed on the NHS as a whole,\" Mr Killens said. \n\"Our staff have been doing fantastic work for 18 months through the pandemic, and with this warmer weather, they are working in extremely difficult conditions and I pay tribute to them because they've all been fantastic.\""

      "text": "Students wanting to study medicine at the University of Exeter are being offered free accommodation and \u00a310,000 cash if they are prepared to delay their course for a year. \nA record number of students have applied to study medicine this autumn, a rise of more than 20% on last year. \nThe number of places for medicine in England is capped by the government.\nIf students delay until 2022, that could reduce the number of places available for those applying next year. \nThe University of Exeter has written to students who have accepted an offer to study medicine starting in 2021 asking if they will delay to 2022. \nIn return it would guarantee their place next year, provide free accommodation for their first year and a cash bursary of \u00a310,000 \"to spend on preparing yourself\" at the end of October 2021. \nThe accommodation in the university's Rowancroft accommodation building would normally cost \u00a36,574 for an en-suite room or \u00a37,611 for a studio flat. \nThe letter to students says the university understands this would mean \"big changes\" to their plans but their place next year would be secure, provided they get the grades specified in their offer. \nProfessor Mark Goodwin, Exeter's deputy vice chancellor, said it had seen a significant increase in students who had prioritised the university as their first choice for medicine.\n\"This is unprecedented for us, something has happened this year to make a higher proportion choose us. More students are holding us as their firm choice this year\"\nAs the numbers admitted to the course are regulated by the government, the university is asking applicants holding a firm offer to decide by 30 July if they will defer.\n\"We want to deliver a really high quality student experience, and deliver those safe and secure NHS placements so we can train the number of doctors the government asks us to train.\"\nGCSE and A-level results will be decided by teachers\nRecord numbers apply to study nursing\nMore black students sought by top science college\nPlaces to study to be a doctor are limited by the government, partly because of the large subsidy needed from public funding to meet the high cost of around \u00a3180,000 for a medical degree. \nEvery medical student also has to undertake clinical placements in the NHS in the last three years of the degree.\nSo universities are given an allocation of places which they cannot exceed.\nIt is always competitive to get a place in medical school, with around three applicants chasing each place on average. \nDr Katie Petty-Saphon from the Medical Schools Council says the increase in applications this year has made it harder for universities to judge the right number of offers. \n\"In the past the very best applicants might receive four offers which would mean they would reject - and thus free up - places at three medical schools.  \n\"This did not happen this year and so the 'conversion rate' of offers to firmly accepted places has changed, meaning that some medical schools have more acceptances than they were anticipating.\"\nShe added there are the same number of places in England this year as usual, around 7,500. \nHowever, universities are also accommodating students who had to defer after the chaos of last year's A-level grading left more than usual with the grades they needed.\n\"The government has funded 450 additional places for applicants who were required to defer last year - and so such candidates are not taking up places destined for 2021 applicants\" said Dr Petty-Saphon. \nIt is not clear if extra money would be available from the government for additional places next year,  which could mean students applying to Exeter competing for fewer places. \nWhile Exeter has written to students holding offers, other medical schools will be grappling with similar issues, albeit on a smaller scale.

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,NHS",
      "text": "More than 600,000 people using the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales were sent self-isolation alerts in the week between 8 and 15 July.\nData shows 618,903 alerts were sent - a 17% rise from the previous week.\nThere are complaints from businesses that the alerts are causing serious staff shortages and affecting services.\nHowever some fully-vaccinated key workers will be exempt from self-isolating if they are pinged by the app as a close contact of a positive case.\nBusiness secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC a \u201cvery narrow\u201d list of jobs would be released today.\nSelf-isolation for all fully-vaccinated people pinged by the app as close contacts is due to be scrapped by 16 August, although there are calls for this deadline to be brought forward.\nThe app alert is advisory only and not enforceable by law, unlike a phone call from the Test and Trace team.\n\"If you are pinged, you should self-isolate. I know it poses challenges, and we are seeing reports of shortages which we are monitoring, but the rules are clear and I think they should be followed,\" Mr Kwarteng told the Today Programme on BBC Radio 4.\nLatest government figures show there are a further 44,104 daily coronavirus cases in the UK, with 73 coronavirus-related deaths.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson warned cases could rise even more this week, as most legal restrictions have ended in England.\nHis spokesman said that the app was doing \"what it's designed to do\".\n\"We're aware of the impact on some industries and services and working closely with them particularly food and supermarkets\u2026.we have a robust and resilient food supply chain.\" \nBut supermarkets have warned they may have product shortages due to staff self-isolating.\nThe Co-op said it was \"running low on some products\", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut.\nHowever, Iceland urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary.\nMeanwhile, dozens of councils have suspended bin collections due to staff shortages from isolation and fuel provider BP has temporarily closed \"a handful of sites\" due to Covid staff absences.\nIn England 607,486 alerts were sent to app users in the period between 8 and 15 July, with a further 11,417 sent in Wales.\nThere were fewer app pings per case in England during this period, with 2.8 pings issued per every reported coronavirus case. \nAn average of 3.2 pings were sent per case reported in the last month.\nScotland's app has issued fewer than 60,000 notification \"pings\" since it launched in September 2020.\nAnother record then for the number of people pinged by the NHS Covid-19 app and sent into isolation.\nFor businesses struggling to deal with the impact on their employees this will be more evidence that a different approach is needed. The fact that the number of pings did not rise even more sharply in a week when case numbers were accelerating, may be an indication that some people have deleted the app, although we have to be cautious about extrapolating too much from one week's figures.\nIts defenders point out that many of the complaints about the app concern wider health policy rather than the tech itself - the fact that people  who may have been in contact with the virus are being told to isolate even if they are fully vaccinated is a policy applying to traditional Test and Trace too, and won't change until August 16th.\nOne man, who was heavily involved in the design of the app, told me people didn't realise that it worked on a number of levels - \"even if someone ignores the message to self-isolate, telling them they have been exposed to the virus is likely to make them behave more cautiously.\"\nHe also said that while the anonymous nature of the app meant only limited data could be extracted from it, there was useful and early information for epidemiologists about the spread of the virus and the R rate.\nThe government still insists the app is doing the job for which it was designed - but there will be mounting pressure from industry for a more rapid change to allow people who are pinged to be tested rather than to isolate.\nWhen the new health secretary Sajid Javid replaced Matt Hancock, there were reports that he wanted the app's sensitivity tweaked so that it sent out fewer alerts. But that appears to be off the agenda for the moment, with the Department of Health insisting there are no immediate plans for any changes.\nDownloads of the app continued to rise to 26,826,748 from 26,523,853 the previous week. \nThe BBC understands there is no way to know if the app has been deleted, but #DeleteTheApp has been trending on Twitter today.\nA recent poll by YouGov suggested that one in ten users have deleted the app, having previously installed it.\nThose aged between 18 and 24 were most likely to have deleted the app, after installing it, according to the data.\nPeople in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own).\nIf you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a \"ping\" alert if they later test positive for Covid-19 and share the information with the app. The app uses the Bluetooth signal to determine whether your phone had recently been within 2m of theirs for at least 15 minutes.\nIf you are \"pinged\" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for up to 10 days.\nIn this same week to 14 July, 259,265 people in England tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 33% from the previous week.\nNHS Test and Trace said it was the highest weekly number of people testing positive since January.\nThe service said it had identified 475,465 people as close contacts of somebody who had a positive coronavirus result, and had been able to contact 94% of them"

      "text": "The number of young people with eating disorders in England ending up in hospital has risen sharply during the pandemic, a BBC investigation has found.\nData released to the BBC by NHS Digital showed the number of under-20s admitted over the past year topped 3,200 - nearly 50% higher than in 2019-20.\nThe numbers are so high that hospitals are now warning they are running out of beds to care for these patients.\nMental health charities said the pandemic, and lockdowns in particular, had had a devastating impact on vulnerable young people, increasing anxiety and isolation.\nThis has lead to more people developing eating disorders, such as bulimia and anorexia, as well as a deterioration in many youngsters who had already been diagnosed with those conditions, they said..\nThe BBC investigation found as the numbers needing help increased the early support available in the community could not cope with demand, increasing the risk of young people reaching crisis point and ending up in hospital.\nHannah, who is 16, had been struggling with an eating disorder before the pandemic began.\nBut she said the last 16 months has been \"really tough\" after her community support was stopped.\n\"There were huge readjustments and my eating disorder thrived off that and not seeing friends - at that time my anxiety took over.\"\nAs the pandemic progressed she found her mental health went \"up and down\".\n\"I was sitting in front of the news and not knowing what the rules were going to be that week and getting your hopes up and then being disappointed like at Christmas - thinking you can get out but then you can't was really tough.\"\nShe ended up having to go to A&E because her health deteriorated, although she was not admitted into hospital.\nShe is now back to getting one-on-one help. \"With lockdown easing and cases rising, it's uncertain and that's not great, but having appointments again is helpful.\" \nBut Hannah is one of the lucky ones in many ways.\nSince the pandemic started 3,200 people under the age of 20 have ended up in hospital - many needing weeks sometimes months of treatment.\nThe numbers represent a big rise on the year before when under 2,200 were admitted.\nThe situation has got so bad that hospitals are now running out of specialist beds - one leading children's trust told the BBC it had had to resort to putting vulnerable children on general wards where there was not the specialist staff to support them.\nThe rise in hospital admissions comes as specialist community-based services for young people have struggled to keep up with demand.\nThere are now more than 3,000 young people starting treatment each month, up from just over 2,000 before the pandemic began.\nGetting early support, either one-on-one from specialist therapists or via group work, is vital to keep people out of hospital. \nBut services are increasingly struggling to see people quickly enough - nearly three in 10 patients wait longer than they should, which is one week for urgent referrals and four for routine.\nMeanwhile, the number of young people on the waiting list now tops 1,500, three times higher than was the case before the pandemic.\nSimilar data is not available for other parts of the UK, although services have also reported increased demand.\nSaffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents mental health services, said the figures obtained by the BBC were a \"great cause for concern\".\nShe said they chimed with surveys of their members which showed NHS trusts were struggling to meet demand and that was leading to a \"worrying rise in delays\" for treatment.\n\"Many children and young people are presenting later with more complex symptoms which are often harder, and take longer, to treat.\"\nTom Quinn, from eating disorders charity Beat, said lockdowns and the pandemic had had a \"massive impact\".\n\"For those who already had an eating disorder their illness has worsened, more people have developed an eating disorder for the first time and others who thought they had recovered from their eating disorder have relapsed. \n\"We have seen a huge increase in demand for our helpline, with many talking about increased anxiety, isolation and lack of support as factors.\"\nAnd Emma Thomas, chief executive of Young Minds, said the figures were \"deeply worrying\".\n\"The  pandemic has left many young people isolated, uncertain about the future and less in control.\"\nAnd she said the pressures were being seen across child and adolescent mental health services with vulnerable young people facing long waits for the support they need.\nNHS England mental health director Claire Murdoch acknowledged the last year had \"taken its toll\" on young people.\nShe said services were treating more children and young people than \"ever before\" and the NHS was bringing in new targets to improve performance across mental health services."

      "tags": "Policing,Teaching,Doctors,Nursing,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Every Thursday evening the UK is clapping for NHS staff, carers and other key workers. But many are on low pay. \nThe weekly applause ran for 10 weeks during the UK's first coronavirus lockdown last spring and is set to return from 7 January.\nKey workers are the individuals recognised by the government as being critical to the running of the country, ranging from NHS and care workers to delivery drivers and shop workers. \nAcross the UK, the median salary for all full-time employees last year was \u00a331,461. \nWe use the median income - the salary right in the middle of all employees - because, unlike the (mean) average, it doesn't get pushed up by the small number of extremely well-paid individuals at the top. It can therefore be seen as a better indicator of the \"typical\" income. \nThe Office for National Statistics' (ONS) annual earnings survey provides a detailed picture of key workers' pay, as well as higher and lower pay brackets.\nThe following chart represents where most workers - 60% - sit in the salary range. But 20% of people in each profession earn less than the bottom of this range. And 20% earn more than the top of the range.\nAnd in many cases, those starting out earn significantly less than the bottom of the range -  police officers can expect a salary of around \u00a325,400 a year to start with, the lowest NHS pay band for a nurse is under \u00a320,000 and junior doctors receive under \u00a330,000 for their first foundation year. \nThere are dozens of professions and roles that count as key workers. This selection has been chosen to cover a number of sectors but is not exhaustive. \nThe average full-time cashier, shop assistant, care worker, food processor, bus driver and postal worker all earn below the median income. \nNurses and primary teachers are paid just above the median income, while doctors and pharmacists earn substantially above it. \nHowever, working out average salaries is an inexact science with various factors affecting pay - like overtime, part-time work or extra money for working in an expensive area. \nLow income employees, for example, are more likely to work part-time or hour-by-hour (such as through zero-hour contracts). This means a large number will not earn anything close to their occupation's full-time median income.\nThe ONS estimates that the hourly pay for a care worker, cashier or shelf stacker is under \u00a39 - which is more or less in line with the minimum wage (\u00a38.72 for those aged 25 and over). But that falls short of what the Living Wage Foundation charity calculates is necessary to meet basic needs. It recommends \u00a39.50 - or \u00a310.85 in London. \nAnalysis by the BBC's Shared Data Unit last year found that hundreds of thousands of key workers earn below that. \nThe government plays a large role in the pay of individuals working in the public sector - that's anyone whose job is directly funded by taxes. \nPolice officers, nurses, civil servants and teachers all have representatives who work with government departments, unions and other groups to come up with annual recommendations for how much pay should change. \nThe government sets \"remits\" on these boards. \nBetween 2011 and 2018, most public sector pay was either frozen or capped at 1%, as part of the government's austerity measures aimed at reducing the deficit.\nThis meant that as prices increased with inflation, salaries did not keep up. \nThe government has less control over private sector pay. \nThis includes people who work in transport, supermarkets, postal and courier services.\nIt also includes most care home staff and any services (such as cleaning or catering) the NHS might outsource.\nThe government does not directly set their wages, but they can lower taxes, provide benefits and increase the minimum wage. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak announced in November's Spending Review that 1.3 million public sector workers would be getting their pay frozen again.\nBut 2.1 million workers earning less than \u00a324,000 a year were promised a pay rise of at least \u00a3250.\nAnd more than a million NHS workers will get an increase.\nThe minimum wage will go up by 19p to \u00a38.91 an hour in April 2021. The Conservatives have pledged to increase this to \u00a310.50 by 2024.\nSome private companies, including supermarkets and delivery services, have already increased pay for staff during the coronavirus crisis.

Nissan and Rolls-Royce have both warned that staff shortages could affect production.\nMeanwhile, a group representing some of the UK's biggest ports said staff shortages caused by people having to self-isolate after being contacted by the NHS app represented \"one of the most significant threats to ports' resilience in recent years\".\nThe UK Major Ports Group (UKMPG), which represents Felixstowe, the Port of Liverpool, Southampton and others, says that absence rates caused by staff self-isolating are at 10% at some ports.\n\"Whilst ports are maintaining all the controls on site that have - so far - kept ports open through the pandemic, we have no control over what happens in the wider world,\" said Tim Morris, chief executive of UKMPG.\nIceland's Mr Walker said that as well closing some stores, the chain has also had to reduce opening hours in some circumstances. \"The concern is that as this thing rises exponentially as we've just been hearing. It could get a lot worse a lot quicker,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\nMr Walker said 4% of Iceland's 30,000-strong workforce was now absent. \"In fact, we've just announced employing an additional 2,000 people on top of that to give us a deeper pool of labour, because so many people are now getting pinged.\"\nThe number of Covid cases in England and Wales surpassed 50,000 on both Friday and Saturday, the highest number since mid-January. On Monday, England lifted final Covid restrictions, including the legal requirement to wear a face covering to prevent the spread of the virus. \nWales is expected to scrap most rules on 7 August though this will not include face masks. Scotland has moved to the lowest level of restrictions of Covid restrictions but face coverings must be worn for a further three weeks. Northern Ireland will decide on Thursday to ease rules on seven days' time. \nPureGym's chief executive, Humphrey Cobbold, said his business had managed to keep all of its sites open despite rising numbers of employees forced to self-isolate, but it had been difficult.\n\"Up to 25%, in some areas, of our staff have been asked to self-isolate,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Through flexibility and sharing of labour across sites, we've been able to keep sites open so far but it's been a very close call in certain circumstances.\"\nKate Lester, founder and chief executive of Diamond Logistics, which runs a UK network of fulfilment and delivery centres, said the company has had to delay opening a new site at Motherwell in Scotland because between 20% and 25% of staff are off work.\n\"We're actually having to delay that launch for over a month which deprives our new network partner of his income and in addition to that it deprives his clients of vital logistics services,\" she said.\nToday is potentially a big day for many businesses. Capacity limits are gone; venues can fill up if they want to. That means many pubs and restaurants, for example, have the chance of turning a profit again. \nBosses have longed for this day since the pandemic began. But they face another growing problem. As infections rise, so too are the number of people told they must self-isolate after coming into contact with a positive case. This is causing a staffing problem for many, many firms. Venues and stores have had to close. Opening hours have been curtailed. \nThere is a clamour from companies, demanding the government immediately change the self-isolation rules to exempt people who have had both Covid-19 vaccines and test negative. The regime is due to be overhauled in a month's time.\nHowever, business leaders fear many more staff will be told to stay at home and therefore businesses will be forced to close at a time when they hoped to making money again.\nThe CBI has called for an immediate end to the 10-day self-isolation period for people who have been fully vaccinated. It also said daily lateral flow tests could help people who have not received both jabs get back to work.\nFrom 16 August, people who have been fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they are \"pinged\" by the NHS app when they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. They will instead be advised to take PCR test as soon as possible.\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were forced to U-turn on a decision not to self-isolate after coming into contact with Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who tested positive for Covid on Saturday.\nMr Johnson and Mr Sunak had said initially that they would not need to isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involves daily testing instead. But this sparked a backlash from opposition parties and businesses.\nGreene King's Mr Mackenzie said the government needed to bring the \"test and release\" scheme forward to allow more people to come into work and \"get us back to normal again\"."

      "text": "People buying flats in buildings lower than 18m (59ft) in England will no longer have to provide safety details on external walls to get a mortgage, the government has said.\nBarclays, HSBC and Lloyds welcomed the change, and said it should pave the way for updated industry guidance.\nIt follows concerns over large bills to remove cladding facing many flat owners since the Grenfell Tower fire.\nBut Labour called the height-based stipulation \"arbitrary\".\nAfter the 2017 fire in Grenfell Tower, west London, in which 72 people died, thousands of blocks of flats were found to be covered in similar dangerous cladding.\nWork to remove the material, as well as fix other safety issues, meant many residents were charged thousands of pounds, often leaving them in negative equity and unable to sell their property.\nMortgage lenders began asking for assurances on the safety of external wall systems as a condition of approving mortgage applications.\nMortgage applicants were asked to get safety assessors to sign off a form - known as EWS1 - to prove their property is safe. \nLenders have been asking for the forms for many different types of buildings, including those without cladding. \nTo begin with, only those who owned flats in tall buildings with dangerous flammable cladding were affected.\nAfter the government extended its advice to smaller properties in January 2020, mortgage lenders began demanding fire surveys from a much wider range of sellers.\nBut on Wednesday, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said this guidance would now be changed to exempt leaseholders in low-to-medium-rise blocks from this requirement.\nHe said the change followed new advice from fire safety experts commissioned by the government earlier this year. \nHome fires were at an all-time low, he said, while 91% occurred in houses, bungalows or converted flats. \nBy BBC business presenter Sarah Corker\nThis is an attempt to unlock parts of the property market that have been paralysed by the cladding crisis. \nIt's estimated that up to 3 million flats have been left unsellable because lenders are demanding an EWS1 form. \nIt's left people in low and mid-rise buildings, where the safety risks are deemed as low, unable to move with properties valued at zero. \nEven blocks with no cladding have been affected. \nThe problem has been compounded by a shortage of fire engineers to carry out the checks and flat-owners have faced long delays obtaining the paperwork. \nThere is an acceptance too that \"extreme risk aversion\" from lenders, insurers, and the wider property industry has resulted in flat-owners across the UK receiving massive bills for work that is not necessary. \nLenders have now committed to review their practices on this, but the response from leaseholders has so far been muted. \nThey are waiting for banks to actually change their policies - only then will this policy make a real difference to those caught up in the cladding scandal.\nMr Jenrick also said: \"In the small number of cases [in purpose-built tower blocks below 18m] where there are known to be concerns these should be addressed primarily through risk management and mitigation.\"\nHe added: \"Fire-risk assessors and lenders should not presume that there is significant risk to life unless there is evidence to support this.\n\"This would ensure that they respond only to the evidence and adopt a far more proportionate and balanced approach.\"\nMr Jenrick said he was pleased major lenders had agreed to change their rules, adding: \"I hope and expect other lenders to follow suit swiftly.\"\nThe change, which will apply only in England, would influence mortgage lenders' attitudes across the UK, he added.\nFor Labour, shadow housing secretary Lucy Powell said there was a \"cosy relationship between developers and the private inspectors they handsomely pay\".\nShe added: \"The government should think again about its arbitrary definition of high-risk buildings.\""

      "text": "Three people remain in hospital after a car crashed into a group of customers in a pub beer garden in south Wales.\nOne pedestrian suffered life-changing injuries after the crash outside The Windsor Hotel in Pontyclun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, on Thursday evening.\nSouth Wales Police said a 79-year-old man was believed to have suffered a \"medical episode\" before his silver Ford Puma hit the people and the pub.\nOfficers said the driver of the car was in a critical condition in hospital.\nSix people were taken to hospital after the incident, but three have since been discharged.\nFour other people were also taken to University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff as a precaution with minor injuries.\nPolice have launched an investigation into the cause of the \"very distressing incident\" on Llantrisant Road, about 15 miles north-west of Cardiff.\nThe pub will remain closed until Monday.\nPeter Rex, 66, from Brynsadler, was sat on a bench outside the pub, chatting to friends and enjoying the sunshine when he heard a bang and fell to the ground.\nHe was badly bruised and was treated at the scene by a paramedic.\n\"After I'd seen the car then he'd smashed all the bench and glasses everywhere, then bounced back after the impact,\" he said.\n\"You never expect a vehicle coming from nowhere and just bash right into you like that. \n\"It was a terrible shock. I was checked over by a paramedic and my blood pressure had gone right up with the shock.\"\nKaitlin Moore, a hairdresser at the nearby Charizma salon, said she saw the crash.\n\"I was outside the salon waiting for a lift home when I heard a lot of glass smashing and I could see that a car had gone into the benches outside The Windsor pub,\" she said.\n\"It was very chaotic, it happened so quick, I think everyone was in shock.\"\nShe added: \"I could see people lying on the floor. People upstairs in the pub were throwing blankets and pillows down to them.\n\"I normally stand near the Windsor waiting for a lift home from work, it just happened I was waiting by the hairdresser's last night. I feel like I've had a lucky escape.\"\nCharles Morris said seeing people lying on the ground covered in blankets as he drove past the pub on Thursday night was \"quite traumatic\".\n\"I could see complete chaos around the pub,\" the 60-year-old said.\n\"It was packed, every table was full.\n\"One table was smashed and I guess that's the one the car went into, and there were people screaming,\" he said.\nPub manager Tia Lewis told BBC Wales: \"A car came, crashed off the road and hit people sat in the beer garden.\n\"The car hit the wall of the pub too. It was very frightening, we can't believe it. I just hope the people hurt are OK. \n\"The pub was pretty busy and because of the nice weather there was obviously people sat outside.\"\nA spokesman from owners Star Pubs and Bars said: \"The thoughts of everyone at The Windsor are with the injured and all those caught up in this tragic accident. It was very upsetting for those who witnessed the crash.\n\"We would like to thank our customers, the local community and the emergency services for their support.\n\"The pub is closed until Monday out of respect for the injured and to allow our staff to recover from last night's shock.\"\nAt least five ambulances, several police cars and four fire service vehicles attended the incident which happened just before 20:30 BST on Thursday.\nThe road was shut in both directions overnight, but has since reopened.\nCh Insp James Ratti of South Wales Police said: \"Emergency services were confronted with a scene which involved a number of casualties.\n\"We worked alongside our colleagues in both the ambulance and fire services to deal with the casualties as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\"This was a very distressing incident and we are very grateful to the members of the public who came to the aid of the injured people in the moments immediately after the collision.\"\nIt's just after lunchtime in Pontyclun and it's very busy along the high street where people are milling around, going to the post office, the Co-op or one of the many hairdressers or caf\u00e9s. \nOne of the main topics of conversation I've overheard several times while walking along the high street is, of course, last night's crash outside the Windsor pub.\nLocal people are obviously shocked by the incident and some have been discussing what they might have seen or heard.\nThe pub sits just over the brow of the hill as you walk away from the hub of businesses along Llantrisant Road, just in front of Pontyclun rugby club and next to the train line.\nThroughout the morning people have been stopping outside the premises, as a couple of contractors swept the pavement of any remaining debris and placed safety bollards along the area where the car smashed through chunky, wooden posts.\nThe pub owners say it'll remain closed until Monday out of respect for those who are injured and to allow staff to recover.\nThe overall feeling here is one of shock, with many saying their thoughts are with those who were seriously injured, including the elderly driver.\nRhondda Cynon Taf leader Andrew Morgan reacted to the incident in his county: \"My thoughts are with everyone affected by this.\"\nPontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones added: \"The community are all devastated over this truly awful incident, my heart goes out to everyone involved.\n\"It was a nice evening, people enjoying themselves in the nice weather, sat outside having an evening meal and you just don't expect this to happen.\n\"We're a tight-knit community and everyone has rallied round together trying to help out as much as they can.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Critical staff working in the health, food and transport sectors can apply to be exempt from self-isolation, under a new Scottish government scheme. \nPeople who work in the emergency services, government and finance could also qualify for an exemption. \nBut they must be double vaccinated, have a negative PCR test and agree to take daily lateral flow tests. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the changes would \"ensure staff shortages do not put key services at risk\". \nThe exemptions would be limited and applied on a \"case by case basis and only where absolutely necessary\", she added. \nPreviously anyone who came into contact with someone who had tested positive must isolate for 10 days.\nThe new scheme will allow employers to apply to the Scottish government for permission to exempt those who work in critical roles and where staff shortages could jeopardise essential services.\nThe exemption will only be granted where workers have voluntarily agreed not to self-isolate. \nThe changes come after businesses across the UK were affected by large numbers of workers self-isolating, leading to shortages of some products in supermarkets.\nHealth and social care also remains under pressure from staff shortages.\nIn Lanarkshire urgent social care is being prioritised only for the most vulnerable by reducing home care packages \"where it is safe to do so\" as a result of the \"exceptional\" pressures on the NHS.\nThe Scottish government has said employers who meet the definition of Critical National Infrastructure can apply for the exemption. There are 13 national infrastructure sectors:\nMs Sturgeon said: \"It is essential that lifeline services and critical national infrastructure are maintained and we are implementing these changes now ahead of possible changes to self-isolation rules for close contacts that may apply more generally in future. \n\"We have seen significant staff shortages in a small number of organisations in recent days and we have worked with them to protect services.\n\"Clinical evidence tells us we can safely and effectively release some critical staff from self-isolation, with appropriate safeguards. However, this is a very limited change at this stage, to be applied on a case by case basis and only where absolutely necessary.\"\nThe move was widely criticised by unions including Unite, Unison and GMB Scotland. \nLouise Gilmour, of GMB Scotland, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme that the \"pretty shocking\" decision was \"driven by resource - not what is safe for our workers or their families\".  \n\"We believe it's the cuts, the underfunding and the under-staffing of these services that means they don't have the capacity we need in times of crisis - that's within our NHS, our social care and our supermarkets,\" she added. \nMeanwhile Unison's Willie Duffy warned that the new rules were not an \"appropriate or well evidenced\" response and could lead to further spread of the virus. \nHowever it was described as a \"step forward in... a fast-moving situation\" by the Scottish Retail Consortium. \n\"Whilst it is vexing that store staff are not explicitly in scope, it will hopefully help the grocery supply chain as its grapples with a conflux of pressures at the current time including elevated levels of self-isolation amongst staff in logistics, distribution, and production,\" a spokesman added.\nHe said the availability of products on shop shelves \"remains good\".\nThe move was also welcomed as a \"cautious step in the right direction\" by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross. \n\"However, many questions must be clarified by the SNP if these changes are to have the right effect,\" he added.  \"They must be clear on who exactly will qualify for an exemption and for how long an exemption will last for.\"\nEarlier Colin Smith, chief executive of the Scottish Wholesale Association, said his members were \"critical\" to keeping the shops supplied. \nHe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland there was on average a 13% shortfall of required drivers in Scotland but staff shortages were not as bad as in England. \n\"The problems is the supply chain is heavily interlinked with England, so higher cases down there means less staff to pick and deliver to our depots so we can get it out our end users,\" he added.\nHe said fast moving goods such as soft drinks, pet food and alcohol are goods where \"we can't replenish quick enough\". \nIn the transport sector, ScotRail said a \"very limited number of trains\" have been cancelled due to staff shortages, but it has not amended its timetables.\nOn Thursday a Loganair flight was cancelled due to staff isolation. The airline is understood to be experiencing shortages of cabin crew and pilots. "

I could see I was losing a lot of blood.\"\nMr Hibbert described lying on the floor and seeing his daughter Eve's injuries.\n\"It was almost like she'd been shot through the head. She was gasping for breath and I could see she was dying in front of my eyes.\"\nMr Hibbert told the inquiry of his \"frustration\" that his daughter was covered twice with T-shirts and posters while lying on the foyer floor by responders who believed she was dead. \nHe said people who did not have the right qualifications were \"playing God\".\nMr Hibbert said if he had lost consciousness, then he believes Eve would not have survived.\nThe football agent told the hearing how Eve spent 10 months in hospital and he believes she is the only person in the world to survive the type of brain injury she suffered. \nSince the attack Mr Hibbert has done a number of charity challenges and is currently in training to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in September in aid of the Spinal Injuries Association.  \nThe inquiry continues.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to rape and sexual assault charges in a Los Angeles court.\nHe appeared in court in a wheelchair after being extradited from New York, where he is serving a 23-year jail sentence for similar crimes.\nThe 69-year-old faces 11 counts of sexual assault in California relating to alleged incidents with five women. \nHe maintains his innocence and has said any sexual activity was consensual.\nThe incidents are said to have occurred in hotels in Beverly Hills and Los Angeles between 2004 and 2013.\nThe charges include forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual battery by restraint, and sexual penetration by use of force. \nIf convicted, Weinstein could face a maximum sentence of 140 years.  \nWearing brown prison overalls and a face mask, Weinstein only spoke only to say \"thank you\" to Judge Sergio Tapia after she wished him \"good luck\".\nHis lawyer said the charges were not credible.\n\"They are baseless, they are from long, long ago, they are uncorroborated,\" Mark Werksman said after the hearing.\nWeinstein is appealing against last year's conviction in New York.\nMore than 80 women have accused him of sexual misconduct, and some of the accusations date back several decades.\nAllegations reported in 2017 contributed to the rise of the #MeToo movement, which encouraged people to share experiences of sexual harassment and assault.\nHowever, very few of the allegations have led to criminal charges.\nThe pandemic and procedural delays meant Weinstein's extradition to California took well over a year.\nDuring the hearing, Mr Werksman requested the former movie mogul have a health examination.\n\"He's going blind in one eye,\" he told reporters.\nWeinstein has produced several hit movies including Shakespeare in Love, which won the Oscar for best picture in 1999.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Priti Patel defends deal to stop rising numbers crossing Channel",
      "tags": "France,Home Office,English Channel,Europe migrant crisis,Migration",
      "text": "Home Secretary Priti Patel has defended a new \u00a354.2m deal with France to stem the rising number of migrants crossing the English Channel.\nThe number of people crossing the Channel this year is now more than the total for all of 2020. \nShe denied it was \"sending good money after bad\" after a \u00a328.2m deal last November failed to limit crossings.\nCalais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont suggested it would not have an impact as the French coastline is too long to patrol.\nGiving evidence to the Home Affairs Committee, Ms Patel said it was an \"evolving situation\", with the numbers of those attempting the crossing having \"increased considerably\". \nOn Monday at least 430 migrants crossed the Channel - a record for one day. The previous daily high of 416 was set in September last year.  \nAnd on Wednesday, a group of migrants was seen arriving at Dover, bringing the total number this year to more than the 8,461 who made the crossing in 2020. \nThe group included at least five children, according to reports.\nThe deal agreed on Tuesday between London and Paris will see France double the number of police patrolling its beaches. It will also fund improved intelligence sharing and introduce better technology to target the gangs who organise the crossings.\nBut some have questioned whether it will have an impact.\nBy BBC home editor Mark Easton, in Kent\nThe terrace of the Stade hotel, on the seafront in Hythe, is festooned by England flags. But its usual summer guests have been told their holidays there are cancelled. The hotel's owner says it has been block booked for 68 days by the Home Office - at an irresistible price to him of \u00a35,000 a day.\nThe occupants are young men who tell us - from their balconies - that they are 16 or 17 and from Iran. One has been there 11 days and they aren't allowed to leave their rooms. \nBetween 15 and 20 unaccompanied migrant children are currently accommodated in a government office building, Frontier House in Folkestone, in sleeping bags on camp beds and reportedly without proper washing facilities or medical support.  One agency has warned that the children's welfare is deteriorating.\nThe BBC has obtained photographs of conditions in one holding centre that show young boys sleeping on the floor with cushions for pillows and military-style camp-beds, trying to get some rest in what looks like an office waiting room.\nKent County Council has for a second year said it is unable to care for any more unaccompanied child asylum seekers. It is currently looking after 358 of them. \nConservative MP Tim Loughton said \"giving the French more money to carry on doing what they're doing badly is not going to solve the problem.\" \nThe home secretary said there had been a \"complete change in modus operandi in terms of the crossings\", with a \"widespread dispersal\" of launches of small boats \"along the whole French coastline\" rather than people just coming from Calais. \nShe said France had intercepted more boats than they did this time last year, because the numbers are \"so high\" and are \"going up.\"\nAnd she stressed that France would \"argue they are doing their bit\" but said they have a \"different interpretation\" of how to save lives at sea. \nBorder Force director general Paul Lincoln said last year France had made more than 2,100 interceptions of boats last year, while this year the figure was now over 6,000. \nCalais MP Mr Dumont has suggested the new deal would not have an impact as the French coastline is too big.\nHe told the Today programme: \"The fact is, we've seen it before. Having more money, having more police officers, having more controls, will not prevent people to succeed in these crossing attempts.\n\"We have too many kilometres of shore to monitor.\" \nMr Dumont added that the French are not supposed to intervene at sea - yet former Border Force chief Tony Smith has called for joint patrols. \nMr Smith said: \"That seems to be a step too far for the French at the moment. The French position is they are not prepared to intervene on the high seas, only on land.\"\nMs Patel and French interior minister Gerald Darmanin have agreed to \"strengthen co-operation\" over the crossings.\nShe told the Home Affairs Committee she had discussed with the French their obligations are under international law to return migrants trying to cross the Channel to their territory. She added they were looking at everything that could be done to save lives at sea, saying of the French: \"They absolutely know what their responsibilities are.\" \nThe Home Office said UK support last year helped France double the number of officers deployed daily on the beaches of its northern coast.  \nThe new support announced by the UK would enable France \"to respond by posting more security forces further up the coast, installing and utilising the latest surveillance equipment throughout northern France\", the Home Office said.\nAnalysis by Simon Jones, BBC reporter, in Dover\nFrom the famous White Cliffs of Dover, we watched this morning as another group of migrants was brought to shore by the Border Force, having been picked up in the Channel. \nConditions at sea are once again incredibly calm and the sun is shining, so these are unlikely to be the only arrivals today. \nAlmost 1,000 people have reached the UK by boat in the past three days, putting pressure on the home secretary to act. \nPriti Patel is now pledging more money to the French authorities to try to prevent the crossings. But the deal struck last night is very similar to one agreed between Britain and France last November - which has failed to stem the numbers arriving, though the Home Office points out the number of crossings being prevented by the French authorities has doubled.\nThe government here accepts there is no quick and easy fix to problems with the asylum system, but there's no doubt the home secretary will want to see swift results in return for the increased investment in northern France.\nMs Patel has previously pledged to make Channel crossings \"unviable\", with new legislation that will make it a crime to knowingly arrive in the UK without permission.\nThe Nationality and Borders Bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, will mean migrants entering without permission could face up to four years in prison.\nThe government hopes the overhaul of asylum rules will deter migrants from making the crossing. \nBut the plans have been criticised by charities including Refugee Action, which has called them \"extreme and nasty\". \nAmnesty International's Steve Valdez-Symonds told the BBC the new legislation was an \"extremely reckless and dangerous response\" to the issue and would not tackle the problem of people smugglers.  \nLabour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Home Office announcement was \"yet more empty words from the Conservatives about agreeing a deal with France to address trafficking gangs\". \nNumber 10 said the government was \"doing two things in parallel\" to tackle migrant crossings.

The next day is day one of self-isolation.\nYou can leave self-isolation after five full days if you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart.\nYou can take the first on day five. If it's negative, you can take another test 24 hours later on day six. If this is also negative - and you don't have a temperature - you can immediately end isolation. \nThe rules apply whether or not you are vaccinated.  \nThe current self-isolation regulations run out on 24 March.\nThe prime minister has told MPs he does not expect to renew the rules and said they could end sooner - if Covid data allows.\nHe said that \"as Covid becomes endemic\" (in other words, constantly present) the government will \"replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others\". \nThis would be similar to advice for other infectious diseases such as flu. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid also said he was \"optimistic\" the government would shortly be able to \"remove all restrictions around Covid\".\nIt is not clear whether the rest of the UK would follow suit. \nIn Scotland and Wales you must self-isolate for at least seven days as soon as symptoms appear.\nPeople without symptoms who have a positive LFT result should also self-isolate immediately. They don't need to take a PCR test, although clinically vulnerable people in Wales are advised to do so.\nYou can end self-isolation after two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart - the first no earlier than day six. If you don't have a temperature, you can stop self-isolating after the second negative test, on day seven.\nIf the day six test is positive, you can take two further tests on subsequent days.\nThe guidance applies whatever your vaccination status.\nAnyone leaving self-isolation is \"strongly advised\" to limit close contact with people in crowded or poorly-ventilated spaces. \nThey should work from home and minimise contact with people at higher risk from Covid.\nThe rules about self-isolation after contact with someone with Covid are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or until 10 days since your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to under-18s (18 years and four months in Scotland; 18 years and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test.\nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. \nIn Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nSelf-isolation means staying at home and not going out.\nAdults shouldn't go to work and children shouldn't go to school. \nYou should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to deliver supplies.\nNo-one from outside your household should come inside, unless to deliver essential care.\nIf you have symptoms or test positive, you should: \nPeople on a low income who are told to isolate may be entitled to some financial help:"

And we need to go back to that stage,\" he said.\nMs Morgan said demand on Wales' GPs and emergency departments had continued to grow beyond levels seen before the pandemic, adding: \"Staff are under real pressure.\"\nThe government, she said, wanted to make sure everyone could access the \"high quality care they need in the right place, the first time\".\n\"Often people feel they have no option but to go to their GP, call 999 or go to their nearest emergency department for advice or treatment,\" Ms Morgan said.\n\"But under our new plans, people with urgent care needs could be treated elsewhere by the many different health professionals working in NHS Wales.\"\nHealth boards have had funding to set up new \"urgent primary care centres\", she said, where people can be seen without the need for a GP appointment or to go to A&E.\nShe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers ambulance services saw a 45% rise in calls on Monday compared with the previous week. \nShe urged people to think \"very carefully\" about whether their accident was \"genuinely\" an emergency to help reduce waiting times.\nLast month, Ms Morgan welcomed the rollout of a 111 service system for people in north Wales to get \"non-urgent medical advice\".\n\"What we're trying to do is make sure the public understands that there are alternatives to accident, emergency and GP services,\" she said.\nThe service has now been rolled out to all health board areas across Wales, except for the Cardiff and Vale area, which is expected to come later this financial year. \nAdditional money will also be made available for schemes to help people return home from hospital, reducing unnecessarily long stays and freeing up essential bed capacity.\nThe summer holidays and hot weather, along with the easing of lockdown restrictions and an increase in Covid cases, has heaped more pressure on the NHS.\nThe Welsh Conservatives called on the health minister to urgently come out with a plan, calling the numbers \"extremely concerning\".\n\"Without treatment, people simply cannot go about their daily lives,\" Russell George said.\n Plaid Cymru welcomed the announcements of extra funding and better signposting, but said problems were \"even deeper than before.\n\"I'll be looking for evidence of changes that make a difference in the long term, building more sustainable services at the heart of our communities,\" Rhun ap Iorwerth said.\nOlwen Williams, vice president for Wales at the Royal College of Physicians, described the proposals as \"a wonderful opportunity\".\n\"Care in the community is definitely the way forward,\" she said.\n\"And we need our primary care teams, our ambulance services, our community services, social services and our medical services all to work together to ensure that individuals get the right care in the right place at the right time.\"\nDr Williams added there were \"two big challenges\" involved.\nShe said the first was whether people would accept the change of \"care closer to home\".\nThe second, she explained, was to do with staffing, and how health boards would deliver the changes.\nWales Ambulance Service chief executive Jason Killens said a combination of factors in recent days had put the service under \"extreme pressure\".\n\"It's not just here in Wales that we're seeing this unprecedented level of demand on the emergency ambulance service, and indeed on the NHS as a whole,\" Mr Killens said. \n\"Our staff have been doing fantastic work for 18 months through the pandemic, and with this warmer weather, they are working in extremely difficult conditions and I pay tribute to them because they've all been fantastic.\""

The fact that the number of pings did not rise even more sharply in a week when case numbers were accelerating, may be an indication that some people have deleted the app, although we have to be cautious about extrapolating too much from one week's figures.\nIts defenders point out that many of the complaints about the app concern wider health policy rather than the tech itself - the fact that people  who may have been in contact with the virus are being told to isolate even if they are fully vaccinated is a policy applying to traditional Test and Trace too, and won't change until August 16th.\nOne man, who was heavily involved in the design of the app, told me people didn't realise that it worked on a number of levels - \"even if someone ignores the message to self-isolate, telling them they have been exposed to the virus is likely to make them behave more cautiously.\"\nHe also said that while the anonymous nature of the app meant only limited data could be extracted from it, there was useful and early information for epidemiologists about the spread of the virus and the R rate.\nThe government still insists the app is doing the job for which it was designed - but there will be mounting pressure from industry for a more rapid change to allow people who are pinged to be tested rather than to isolate.\nWhen the new health secretary Sajid Javid replaced Matt Hancock, there were reports that he wanted the app's sensitivity tweaked so that it sent out fewer alerts. But that appears to be off the agenda for the moment, with the Department of Health insisting there are no immediate plans for any changes.\nDownloads of the app continued to rise to 26,826,748 from 26,523,853 the previous week. \nThe BBC understands there is no way to know if the app has been deleted, but #DeleteTheApp has been trending on Twitter today.\nA recent poll by YouGov suggested that one in ten users have deleted the app, having previously installed it.\nThose aged between 18 and 24 were most likely to have deleted the app, after installing it, according to the data.\nPeople in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own).\nIf you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a \"ping\" alert if they later test positive for Covid-19 and share the information with the app. The app uses the Bluetooth signal to determine whether your phone had recently been within 2m of theirs for at least 15 minutes.\nIf you are \"pinged\" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for up to 10 days.\nIn this same week to 14 July, 259,265 people in England tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 33% from the previous week.\nNHS Test and Trace said it was the highest weekly number of people testing positive since January.\nThe service said it had identified 475,465 people as close contacts of somebody who had a positive coronavirus result, and had been able to contact 94% of them"

      "tags": "Gaming,Companies,Activision Blizzard",
      "text": "One of the world's largest game companies is being taken to court over an alleged \"frat boy\" culture that discriminates against women. \nActivision Blizzard is accused of unequal pay, promoting men over women, and widespread sexual harassment.  \nCalifornia's Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) is taking legal action against the company, following a two-year investigation. \nActivision called the action \"disgraceful and unprofessional\".\nAnd it called the DFEH \"unaccountable state bureaucrats\". \nThe company is one of the largest and most successful games companies, publishing major titles Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Overwatch and many others.\nThe DFEH made extensive allegations about an ingrained culture of discrimination and sexual harassment.\n\"Female employees almost universally confirmed that working for defendants was akin to working in a frat house,\" the DFEH legal filing claims. \n\"In the office, women are subjected to 'cube crawls', in which male employees drink copious amounts of alcohol as they 'crawl' their way through various cubicles in the office and often engage in inappropriate behaviour toward female employees.\" \nMale employees would also:\nAnd such workplace cultures were \"a breeding ground\" for harassment and discrimination.  \n\"Female employees are subjected to constant sexual harassment,\" the DFEH alleged.\n\"High-ranking executives and creators engaged in blatant sexual harassment without repercussions.\" \nAnd when formal complaints were made, Activision failed to take effective measures to solve problems.  \nInstead, complaints were dismissed - and not kept confidential.  \n\"As a result of these complaints, female employees were subjected to retaliation, including but not limited to being deprived of work on projects, unwillingly transferred to different units and selected for layoffs,\" the DFEH said. \nOne female employee had even killed herself, \"due to a sexual relationship with her male supervisor\", the DFEH claimed, \"a tragic example of the harassment that defendants allowed to fester\" - an allegation Activision strongly denies.\nShe had gone on a company trip with him, before which, another employee alleged, male co-workers had \"passed around\" intimate photos of her at a party.\nBut Activision said: \"We are sickened by the reprehensible conduct of the DFEH to drag into the complaint the tragic suicide of an employee whose passing has no bearing whatsoever on this case and with no regard for her grieving family.\n\"It is this type of irresponsible behaviour from unaccountable state bureaucrats that are driving many of the state's best businesses out of California.\"\nPay disparity and other career barriers were also common inside the company, the filing claims, which mean many women  leave. \nThe company's workforce \"is only about 20% women\", it says. \n\"Its top leadership is also exclusively male and white.\n\"Women across the company are assigned to lower paid and lower opportunity levels.\n\"Female employees receive lower starting pay and also earn less than male employees for substantially similar work.  \n\"Defendants promote women more slowly and terminate them more quickly than their male counterparts.\"\nAnd when one female employee taking on managerial responsibilities asked for a pay increase and promotion, her manager \"commented that they could not risk promoting her, as she might get pregnant and like being a mom too much\". \nThe DFEH also noted \"women of colour were particularly vulnerable targets\" of discriminatory practices. \nIn its fierce rebuttal, Activision said the DFEH filing \"includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard's past\". \n\"The picture the DFEH paints is not the Blizzard workplace of today,\" it said - adding it had made significant changes to internal procedures and introduced compulsory anti-harassment training.  \nThe DFEH was required by law to \"have good-faith discussions with us to better understand and to resolve any claims or concerns before going to litigation - but they failed to do so\". \n\"Instead, they rushed to file an inaccurate complaint.\" \nThe DFEH, in its filing, said it had attempted to resolve things before filing the legal action. \nIt \"required all parties to participate in a mandatory dispute resolution\" - but both sides had been \"unable to resolve\" the problems.

      "tags": "Mars,Nasa,Geology,Nasa Perseverance Mars rover,Space exploration,Mars rovers",
      "text": "The US space agency's Perseverance rover is getting ready to take its first sample of Mars rock.\nThe core, about the size of a finger, will be packaged in a sealed tube for eventual return to Earth.\nScientists say their best chance of determining whether Mars ever hosted life is to study its surface materials in sophisticated home laboratories.\nPerseverance landed on the Red Planet in February, in a 45km-wide (30 miles) crater called Jezero.\nSatellite images indicate this deep depression once held a lake, fed by a deltaic river.\nAs such, it is considered a great candidate for the preservation of ancient microbial organisms - if they ever existed.\nThe Nasa robot has driven about 1km (3,000ft) south from where it touched down in dramatic fashion five months ago.\nIt's now stopped at a location that's been dubbed the \"Paver Stones\", or \"Fractured Rough\".\nThis is a collection of pale-coloured rocks that the mission team believes represents the base, or floor, of Jezero.\nThe scientists want to determine whether these Paver Stones are sedimentary or volcanic in origin. Either is interesting, but the special quality of volcanic rocks is that they can be dated with very high precision and accuracy in a lab, says chief scientist Ken Farley.\n\"That would really pin down the timing of many of the things we are looking at on Mars,\" he told reporters.\nPerseverance will first abrade the surface of a chosen section of Paver Stone, to remove Mars' obscuring dust, and then examine the site with its powerful instruments.\nThese are held on the end of its robotic arm. They are capable of determining the chemical composition, the mineralogy and texture within a rock - to identify it definitively.\nFinally, in early August, the robot will secure a drilled core.\nThe rover will be caching something like 40 of these small sample tubes over the course of its mission. Later projects from Nasa and the European Space Agency (ESA) will arrive on Mars to take ownership and bring them home.\nProf Farley said he expected four unique samples to be cached in the area of the crater now being investigated. This includes an enticing outcrop of rock, called Artuby. This is some 600m away and looks to contain some very finely layered sediments, potentially deposited by the lake and river delta system that once occupied Jezero.\n\"This is exactly the kind of rock that we are most interested in investigating for looking for potential bio-signatures in this ancient rock record,\" the California Institute of Technology researcher said.\nNasa is delighted with the way Perseverance is performing. \nA particular success has been its mode of driving, which now achieves a high level of autonomy. \nWhereas past vehicles needed a lot of direction from controllers back on Earth, or could self-navigate only slowly, Perseverance can image the terrain ahead at speed and plot a route with great efficiency. The robot can do this for drives of 100m or more, dodging tricky obstacles, such as large boulders or fissures in the ground, along the way.\nThe rover is being helped by the reconnaissance conducted through the mini-helicopter it brought to Mars.\nCalled Ingenuity, this little chopper has been flying ahead of Perseverance to survey the terrain.\n\"We just completed flight nine (of Ingenuity),\" said Nasa project manager Jennifer Trosper.\n\"It broke all of our records. The duration was two minutes and 46 seconds, the velocity was 5m/s, and we quadrupled the distance that we had ever flown, and we flew about 625m.\""

      "tags": "NI Brexit,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "Northern Ireland's political parties are divided on calls by the government for the EU to begin negotiations to radically amend the Brexit protocol.\nOn Wednesday, Number 10 gave details of some proposals and said a new arrangement was urgently needed. \nUnionist parties, which oppose the protocol, have welcomed the statement and urged the EU to engage.\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP and Alliance urged the government to agree a veterinary agreement to reduce checks.\nThe UK and EU agreed the Northern Ireland Protocol in 2019, as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.\nIt prevents a hard border in Ireland by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods.\nThe UK says its implementation has been \"unbalanced\" and is \"unsustainable\" in its current form.\nBrexit Minister Lord Frost said the full deal should not be implemented and called on the EU to look at new proposals with \"fresh eyes\".\nHis comments were welcomed by unionist parties in Northern Ireland, who have called for the protocol to be renegotiated as it is damaging Great Britain to Northern Ireland (GB-NI) trade and posing a risk to the union in its current form. \nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there was now a \"tacit acceptance\" from the government that the protocol is not working.\n\"Sticking plasters and short-term fixes were never going to work. We need a proper renegotiation,\" he said.\nHe criticised the EU and said Brussels had \"failed to recognise the concerns of unionists\". \nThe government has issued a 28 page command paper to accompany today's ministerial statements.\nBut it boils down to one simple sentiment: \"Trust us.\"\nThey are telling the EU that it's single market can be protected without the panoply of checks and controls which currently apply to goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nThey are suggesting this can largely be achieved through a light-touch, trusted trader scheme and new legislation to discourage smuggling.\nBrexit veterans will recognise these as the sort of \"alternative arrangements\" suggested earlier in this process.\nThe EU was not persuaded then and with trust in short supply it will be a struggle to persuade them now.\nThe Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said he hoped Wednesday's statement would lead to \"movement in the direction of finding pragmatic, workable solutions\".\n\"I hope that the European Union will take their time in considering these proposals in good faith and will not reject them out of hand,\" he added.\nThe UUP leader will travel to Dublin on Thursday to meet the Taoiseach (Irish PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin to make that case to him directly. \nStormont's other main parties - Sinn F\u00e9in, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Alliance - have said they recognise concerns about the protocol but that must be fully implemented in the absence of another arrangement.\nSinn F\u00e9in chairman Declan Kearney said the British government had agreed and ratified all elements of the protocol with the European Commission. \n\"It should now stop the evasion, and get on with it's implementation,\" he said. \n\"It is not acceptable for the Tories to adopt an a la carte approach towards the protocol, to rewrite history, and now attempt a renegotiation.\"\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the government's statement on Wednesday as a \"shameless position based on political expedience rather than providing the stability that people, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland need\".\nHe said he believed a resolution was still possible but would require the government to \"step back from its bad faith interventions\". \nAlliance's deputy leader Stephen Farry also said the government was attempting to \"rewrite history\" and that their actions had undermined trust with the EU in finding sustainable solutions.\nHis party has supported suggestions from the EU for a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement as a way to reduce most checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nThat would require the UK to follow all EU agri-food rules.\nThe UK said it is unwilling to cede control to the EU on this issue and is instead pushing for an equivalence arrangement in which the EU would recognise UK food production standards as being equivalent to its own.\nSimon Hoare, chairman of Westminster's Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, described the UK's new proposals for the protocol as an \"interesting approach\".\n\"If there is to be any chance of change, mutual and binding trust will be the key currency. I am fearful that this is in short supply and needs to be worked on energetically and now. \n\"Common sense and pragmatism must not be a dirty word for either side,\" Mr Hoare added.\nEarlier, Ireland's Europe minister, Thomas Byrne, said \"there can be no renegotiation of the [NI] protocol\".\nBut he added that the arrangement had its complications, and said Irish government is \"willing to discuss any creative solutions within the confines of the protocol\".\nAhead of the publication of the UK paper, the chairman of Marks & Spencer Archie Norman warned of the impact of full protocol checks on fresh foods when grace periods end this autumn.\n\"This Christmas, I can tell you already, we're having to make decisions to delist product for Northern Ireland because it's simply not worth the risk of trying to get it through,\" he said.\nMr Norman called for a \"common sense\" solution to post-Brexit problems at his firm's stores on the island of Ireland.\nThe M&S said the level of checks and controls are \"very threatening\" to Marks and Spencer's Irish business.\nHe suggests the easiest solution would be to \"agree a time limited veterinary/food standards agreement\".\nSpeaking on Radio 4 on Wednesday morning, Mr Norman said the problems his company has faced exporting to the Republic of Ireland are likely to be replicated in Northern Ireland by the autumn.\n\"At the moment only about 80% of our product is getting into [the Republic of] Ireland - so 20% doesn't arrive at all,\" he said.\n\"It's not the rules of the Customs Union that is the problem, it's the Byzantine and pointless and honestly pettifogging enforcement which means that wagons can't get through.\"\nHe said trucks had been turned away on the basis of the wrong colour of typeface used on documents.\n\"We're employing 13 full-time vets who are not looking after animals or welfare, they're simply ticking boxes and filling out forms,\" he added.\n\"Sandwiches typically require about three vets' certificates to get through.\n\"Come October our experience in southern Ireland is probably, as it currently stands, set to be replicated in Northern Ireland.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThere's no need to panic buy, says the managing director of a supermarket, who warns there's a risk shops will shut due to the numbers of workers being forced to self-isolate for 10 days. The comments from Iceland boss Richard Walker came after a warning from the British Retail Consortium that pressure is mounting on shops to keep their shelves stocked as more and more staff are being pinged by the NHS Covid app. He says photographs of empty shelves were isolated incidents but he is calling for retail staff to be exempt from staying at home when contacted. The government says it is crucial people isolate when contacted to stop the spread of the virus. \nA 3% pay rise offered to nurses and other NHS workers by the government has left staff \"really angry and upset\" and feeling they are not \"valued for what they do,\" a union has told the BBC - and after a consultation it could lead to a strike. The Royal College of Nursing had called for a 12.5% pay increase, which it says would help fill vacancies and retain staff. It claims the 3% - or an additional \u00a31,000 a year for the average nurse - is effectively a pay cut once inflation is factored in. The pay rise, recommended by an independent NHS pay review body then accepted by the government, was a recognition of the \"extraordinary efforts\" of the health service's workers, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said.\nWomen quarantining in UK hotels will now have female guards, when possible. The change made by the Department of Health and Social Care comes after the BBC reported allegations of sexual harassment. Sixteen women contacted the BBC and some said complaints were ignored or disbelieved. One male guard had mimed having sex in a lift, and another had asked for a hug, they said. If it's not possible for women to have female guards they should be escorted by two male guards, the new guidance says.\nCovid vaccine supply isn't generally a problem in the US. It was one of the world's leaders in the uptake of vaccinations until the middle of April, but its rate has slowed down. The US is still ahead of some other major economies, such as Japan, but the rate is dropping off as it climbs elsewhere. We've had a look into why.\nYou've been told you can work from home indefinitely by your boss, so do you find different places to work from time-to-time, stay put or move more than 200 miles away? One family decided to do just that. Meet the Lancasters, who say the pandemic gave them a chance to reinvent their lives - they moved from Berkshire to a new life on the North Yorkshire coast.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAlmost 90% of the adult population have had a first dose of the vaccine and about two thirds both doses so who's next to be invited to book their Covid jab?\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Liverpool has been stripped of its World Heritage status after a UN committee found developments threatened the value of the city's waterfront.\nThe decision was made following a secret ballot by the Unesco committee at a meeting in China.\nUnesco had said that the developments, including the planned new Everton FC stadium, had resulted in a \"serious deterioration\" of the historic site. \nThe decision was described as \"incomprehensible\" by the city's mayor. \n\"Our World Heritage site has never been in better condition having benefitted from hundreds of millions of pounds of investment across dozens of listed buildings and the public realm,\" Joanne Anderson said.\nShe said she would work with the government to examine whether the city could appeal against the decision, which comes \"a decade after Unesco last visited the city to see it with their own eyes\".\nLiverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said the decision was \"a retrograde step that does not reflect the reality of what is happening on the ground\".\n\"Places like Liverpool should not be faced with the binary choice between maintaining heritage status or regenerating left-behind communities and the wealth of jobs and opportunities that come with it,\" he said.\nLabour's Kim Johnson, MP for Liverpool Riverside, said she remained \"proud of my city and what we've done\".\n\"People come here because it's amazing city and, while I'm disappointed, as a city we are resilient and we will always fight back.\"\nThe government said it was \"extremely disappointed\" and believes Liverpool still deserves its heritage status \"given the significant role the historic docks and the wider city have played throughout history\".\nLiverpool becomes only the third site to lose its World Heritage status since the list began in 1978, the other two being Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary in 2007 and the Dresden Elbe Valley in Germany in 2009.\nAnnouncing the decision, the committee chairman said 20 votes had been cast - with 13 in favour of deleting the city, five against the proposal and two ballot papers being invalid.\nLiverpool's Liberal Democrat leader Richard Kemp said it was a \"day of shame\" for the city, adding that it would \"without a doubt, affect our tourism and inward investment\". \nThe city was awarded the much-coveted title in 2004 in recognition of its historical and architectural impact, joining places including the Taj Mahal, Egypt's Pyramids and Canterbury Cathedral.\nIt recognised its history as a major trading centre during the British Empire and its architectural landmarks.\nHowever, a report in June by the World Heritage Committee said developments on the city's waterfront had resulted in \"irreversible loss of attributes\". \nIt cited the Liverpool Waters project and Everton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley Moore Dock. \nChris Capes, director of development for Peel L&P's Liverpool Waters, said he was disappointed \"particularly given the considerable investment that the city has put into protecting and improving its heritage sites\".\nEverton have agreed to invest up to \u00a355m to \"preserve, restore and celebrate the heritage assets\" of the area as part of its stadium plan.\nThey project was approved following two public consultations, with the second survey attracting more than 40,000 people.\nThe club found 98% of people supported the proposed design of the stadium, while 96% backed the club's plans for historic features on the site. \nBy Claire Hamilton, BBC Radio Merseyside political reporter\nLiverpool has seen more peaks and troughs than most, and it's a city which has changed immeasurably since 2004 when the World Heritage Status was conferred.\nBack then, there was no Liverpool One shopping centre, no hint that Everton would consider building a multi-million pound waterfront stadium and its year as European Capital of Culture hadn't happened. The city has changed.\nToday, there's a sense of defiance in some quarters about Unesco's decision that the city doesn't need the title, especially if sits in the way of progress for an area which has lain neglected and semi derelict for decades.\nCritics argue the benefits of being a World Heritage status were never properly spelled out and there wasn't the political will in the city to address Unesco's concerns until recently, when it was too late.\nMany people argue that tourists visiting the Pier Head, St George's Plateau or Penny Lane are not coming because Liverpool is a designated World Heritage site - they probably don't even realise it is.\nThey're coming for the Beatles, the football, food and the history but that history will remain.\nYet today's announcement worries those who fear that the ability to protect heritage, architecture and history is now diminished, that there will be a free-for-all of unsuitable, careless development. \nThe argument for the last decade has been presented as a binary choice: heritage or progress? The feeling in Liverpool is, couldn't we have had both?\nDr David Jeffery, who is a lecturer of British politics at the University of Liverpool, said he believed the decision would not have a \"serious impact\" on the city's tourism industry. \n\"I do hope this serves as a warning to the council to stop approving ugly buildings though,\" he said.\nWayne Colquhoun, who has campaigned for 15 years to keep Liverpool's heritage status, said he was \"devastated\" by the news.\n\"It's the status symbol that has put us up there with the Great Wall of China and the pyramids and now it has gone,\" he said. \n\"You've got to be clever being a World Heritage city and be able to take traditional materials and build them in a modern manner.\"\nRichie Wright, 40, who has lived in Liverpool all his life, said the status had \"on many occasions, hampered and restricted development in a city that is ripe for development\".\n\"I hope that Liverpool and its wider city region now seizes this opportunity to make common sense decisions that make our city and the world proud,\" he said.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "Nurses may consider industrial action over the offer of a 3% NHS pay rise in England and Wales, a union says. \nThe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) told the BBC it would be consulting members but staff were \"angry\" and deserved a bigger increase.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng acknowledged the hard work of NHS staff and said he felt the 3% rise was fair.\nMeanwhile, school leaders have said the pay freeze for most teachers in England is a \"slap in the face\". \nIn November the government announced a public sector pay freeze for 2021-22, with exceptions made for those on salaries under \u00a324,000 and NHS staff.\nThe 3% pay rise is for most NHS staff including nurses, paramedics, consultants, dentists and salaried GPs and is backdated to April 2021.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said the pay rise was a recognition of the \"extraordinary efforts\" of NHS workers.\nAccording to government calculations for the average nurse, this will mean an additional \u00a31,000 a year, while many porters and cleaners will receive around \u00a3540.\nIt comes after heavily criticised proposals made by the Department for Health and Social Care in March said only a rise of 1% was affordable.\nThe independent NHS pay review body then recommended a 3% rise, which was accepted by the government. \nPatricia Marquis, England director of the RCN, said the whole process had been \"shambolic\" and nurses had \"fallen way behind on pay\". \nShe told BBC Two's Newsnight: \"Our next steps will be to consult with our members about their view on the award. \n\"And once we have their view - which we suspect will be to say they are unhappy about the level - we will then be considering with them what the next steps might be, which could include consideration of industrial action most certainly.\" \nShe added that nurses were \"really angry and upset\" at the pay award, which the union says amounts to a pay cut once inflation is taken into account, and it made them feel they were not \"valued for what they do\". \nThe RCN had called for a 12.5% pay increase, which it said would help fill vacancies and retain staff. \nThe business secretary told BBC Breakfast NHS staff undertook \"incredible work\" but said the country was in a \"difficult position\" as far as public finances were concerned.\nMr Kwarteng said: \"I think 12.5%, given the situation we are in, is a huge amount to ask for in a single year - given that we have spent something like \u00a3350bn... supporting the economy, keeping jobs alive, paying people's wages effectively and also giving loans to businesses.\"\nOther unions have also criticised the pay offer. \nUnison said the increase, though an improvement on the initial offer, fell short of what NHS staff deserved.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors, also said the pay rise was disappointing, adding that junior doctors and some GPs could miss out on it altogether.\nThe GMB union described the increase as \"insulting\" and said it would recommend its members reject the offer. \nLabour's shadow health minister Justin Madders described the new pay rise as a \"U-turn\" and called on the government to \"make our NHS and key workers feel supported and valued after all they have done for us\".\nNHS Trusts and employers said all pay rises need to be fully funded by government, rather than being squeezed from existing hospital budgets.\nNHS pay rises are negotiated by independent pay-review bodies that look at evidence from a range of groups before making recommendations to the government.\nThe pay rise does not include doctors and dentists in training who have their own separate, multi-year contracts.\nIn theory, the pay-review bodies make recommendations for NHS staff across the UK - but it is up to the individual UK nations to decide whether to accept them.\nAll NHS staff in Wales will be offered a 3% rise by the Welsh government.\nIn Scotland, most NHS staff have already been offered a 4% pay rise  - backdated to December 2020. This follows a one-off Covid payment for health and social care staff of \u00a3500.\nMeanwhile, the government has also confirmed that there will be a pause to headline pay rises for the majority of public sector workforces in 2021-22. \nBut the School Teachers' Review Body has recommended a pay award of \u00a3250 for all teachers earning less than \u00a324,000 in England. \nThe pay freeze for other teachers was criticised by unions, who said it risked making recruitment challenges worse. \nNAHT, the school leaders union, said it was a \"slap in the face\", while the Association of School and College Leaders said it was \"an absolute insult\", after a year where teachers had worked \"flat out\" because of the pandemic. \nShadow education secretary Kate Green said: \"A real-terms pay cut for the vast majority of teachers is an insult after the heroic work they have done to keep children safe and learning throughout the pandemic."

      "text": "A health minister has defended the proposed 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England, saying \"nurses are well-paid for the job\".\nLord Bethell praised the \"heroics\" of health workers during the pandemic, but said they had secure jobs that many people would \"envy\".\nHe was responding to opposition calls for the government to rethink its \"miserly\" 1% pay offer.\nLabour peer Lord McNicol said it was a \"kick in the teeth\" for NHS workers.\nLib Dem peer Lord Willis said it amounted to a pay cut - and the government should instead give staff a \"substantial bonus\" before negotiating a \"fair\" pay deal. \nLord Bethell insisted it was not a pay cut, but added: \"There are millions of people out of work out of the back of this pandemic. \n\"There are lots of people who have had an extremely tough time and who face a period of unemployment. Nurses are well-paid for the job. They have a secure job and they have other benefits. \n\"There are many people in this country who look upon professional jobs within the NHS with some envy and we shouldn't forget the fact that some public sector jobs are, in fact, extremely well-paid.\"\nWhat are key workers paid? \nMinisters will make their final decision on NHS pay for 2021/22 in May, after an independent panel makes it final recommendation.\nLord Bethell rejected calls for the government to change the evidence it had given to the panel and recommend a higher pay settlement, saying \"affordability\" remained the \"key challenge\".\nHe also rejected claims the pay proposal would harm recruitment, saying \"there is a long queue of people\" who want to train for nursing and other NHS jobs, because \"they are rewarding in many different ways\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has also defended the 1% rise, saying it was as much as the government could afford \"at the present time\" and NHS staff had been exempted from a public sector pay freeze.\nNurses have described the offer as \"insulting\", with unions threatening strike action and warning that the \"pitiful\" rise may lead staff to quit their jobs - worsening staffing issues in the health service.\nEarlier, the head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens confirmed that he had budgeted for a 2.1% pay rise for this year, but that had changed in light of the pandemic.\nHe added: \"You would expect the head of the health service to want to see properly rewarded NHS staff, particularly given everything that the service has been through over the course of the last year.\n\"And so I think the right way to resolve this is the path the government has actually set out, which is to ask the independent pay review bodies to look at all of the evidence.\" \nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: \"The head of the NHS has confirmed what we already knew: the Conservatives have broken their promise to the NHS and are cutting nurses' pay.\"\nHe told an audience at the IPPR think tank that the 1% pay award was \"morally obnoxious\" and was \"only going to exacerbate the under-staffing issues we have in the NHS\".\nSome Conservative MPs are calling for a one-off bonus, of the kind offered to NHS staff in Scotland and Northern Ireland, as a \"thank you\" for their efforts during the pandemic. \nAsked about this idea, Sir Simon said: \"That's a discussion to be had in the round, whether that or whether underlying other action is the right approach, obviously we can see the attractions of that but that might not be the only answer.\"\nThe NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by the devolved administrations.\nThe Scottish government has announced that 2021-22 pay negotiations will be delayed until the summer - staff have been given an \"interim\" pay rise of 1%, which will form part of the new settlement.\nNHS workers in Northern Ireland were promised a one-off \u00a3500 \"special recognition\" payment in January; and the Welsh government has said it will not set a \"ceiling\" of 1% on NHS pay rises for 2021-22."

      "text": "Industry bodies have reacted with dismay at the government's plan for firms to apply for staff to be exempt from coronavirus self-isolation rules.\nThe government has said there will be no list of critical workers exempt from isolating rules and exemptions will be \"considered on a case-by-case basis\".\nKaren Dee, chief executive of the airport operators association, said the scheme was \"simply unworkable\".\nThe food supply industry called for clarity on how the scheme would work.\nThe new policy comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that fully-vaccinated people in critical roles in England would be able to continue working even if told to self-isolate after being in close contact with someone who has Covid. The new rule is limited to those without Covid symptoms.\nIndividual businesses will have to contact their relevant government department to apply for any exemption.\nThose deemed eligible, which includes NHS and care staff, will be able to take daily tests instead.\nDowning Street said that the first exemptions around self-isolation have been given in some critical sectors.\nThe number of exceptions outside of the NHS is expected to be relatively small, and not reach the high tens of thousands.\nThere are ongoing discussions with companies in critical industries.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said: \"A number of those exemptions are in process of being granted or have been granted.\"\n'Pingdemic'\nFirms have warned of increasing staff shortages caused by people being forced to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app. Iceland and Greene King said on Monday they had had to shut shops and pubs as a result.\nBusiness lobby group the CBI has warned that the problem could hamper the economic recovery.\nRod McKenzie, of the Road Haulage Association, said the plan felt like it had been \"thought up on the hoof without proper organisation or thought\".\n\"Truckers were classed as essential workers at the start of the pandemic; now they may be or may not be,\" he said.\n\"It's too confusing. The criteria isn't clear and it risks being both unfair and devastating to an already creaking supply chain.\"\nMs Dee, of the airport operators association, said the government \"must reconsider and exempt categories of workers\", such as airport security staff  and air traffic controllers from the requirement to self-isolate.\n\"As 24-hour operations, we need clear rules that are workable and easy to implement or there is a risk of unnecessary temporary closures,\" she said.\n\"Applying for each individual for an exemption from self-quarantine if they are 'pinged' is simply unworkable.\"\nShane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, said: \"What is the application process for businesses to use this? Who will qualify? Do you have to prove you are severely affected? How long will it take? \n\"If it's not simple and quick, it will not help and most businesses will have to ignore it.  \nHe said the number of people absent in the food sector due to isolation requests was \"growing exponentially across the food supply chain\".\nAndrew Selley is the chief executive of food wholesaler Bidfood, which has about 5,000 employees across the UK and 24 depots.\nHe said the number of staff who were self-isolating changed on a day-to-day basis, but added the company had \"well over 100 people\" off at the moment.\nThe firm, which has large contracts with schools, hospitals and prisons, recently had half a shift off at one depot due to staff being told to isolate.\nMr Selley said it was a \"little ridiculous\" to expect individual companies to seek exemptions for staff who had been told to self-isolate.\nHe added entire sectors, such as food supply, should be exempted and the government's scheme should work in the \"same way it did for key workers\" at the beginning of the pandemic.\nThe government has said it is \"crucial\" for people to quarantine after being \"pinged\" by the NHS Covid-19 app.\nIts message comes after business minister Paul Scully said it was a decision for individuals and employers whether they should isolate after a \"ping\" from the app.\nThe Times reported that another minister in the business department, Lord Grimstone of Boscobel, stressed in a letter to one large employer that the app was only an \"advisory tool\" and that people were not under any \"legal duty\".\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said \"business-critical areas\" would be able to apply to be exempt from isolating.\n\"It's not a blanket exemption and my understanding is we're not going to be producing a list covering individual sectors,\" he said.\n\"It's important that anyone who feels they're in a critical industry or wants to raise potential issues because of isolation are able to contact departments and get advice and where necessary get exemptions.\"\nAsked specifically about supermarket workers, the spokesman said: \"We're not seeking to draw lines specifically around who or who is not exempt. \n\"What's important is to make sure critical services are able to function and get that balance right between requiring people to isolate... but also making sure critical services can function.\""

      "text": "The NHS Covid-19 app will be altered to send out fewer isolation alerts, the BBC has learned.\nThe team behind the contact tracing app for England and Wales has been told to adjust the measurements which trigger the alerts, a source has confirmed.\nThe time frame for the change is not yet known.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps had suggested that the app might need to change for the planned lifting of restrictions in England on 19 July. \nThe app has so far been downloaded nearly 26m times in England and Wales.\nBut businesses and individuals have raised concerns that too many people were being advised to self-isolate for up to 10 days, following close contact with a device that later reported a positive Covid test result. \nA requirement to self-isolate if people have had both vaccine doses will only stop on 16 August, raising fears that millions would be asked to self-isolate this summer as they mixed more after 19 July, and cases rise.\nThe UK is experiencing a marked increase in Covid infections, according to the Office for National Statistics, with the latest data suggesting one in every 160 people has the virus.\nThat is up from one in every 250 in the previous week and an estimated 400,000 people are thought to have been positive in the week to 3 July.\n\"Things are moving fast,\" said the source at the app team.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the app was doing \"exactly what it was designed to do\". \nThe app user's phone detects others that are around it, using bluetooth.\nPeople who later test positive for Covid can anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for all those flagged as close contacts in the days before the test. \nCurrently this is devices at a distance of 2m or less, for a minimum of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period. This formula has been tweaked several times since the app launched in September 2020, and additional variables have also been factored in as more has been learned about the infectious nature of the virus.\nIt is these parameters which are to be adjusted, and the source said the changes could be made very quickly.\nHowever, Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer has expressed concerns about making the changes as case numbers increase. \n\"This feels like taking the batteries out of the smoke detector and that is never a good idea,\" he said.\nIn the week of the 30 June some 356,000 alerts were triggered following the input of 61,000 positive Covid tests - an average of about six isolation requests per case.\nThe isolation alerts are not legally enforceable - unlike the requirement to isolate if you are contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace.\n\"The app is, and has always been, advisory,\" said the Department of Health in a statement. \n\"In the context of rising cases it is vital people are aware of their personal risk so they can make informed decisions on their behaviour to protect those around them.\" \nDowning Street said the app had been an \"important tool\" and people should continue using it and isolate when asked to do so.\nThe NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations and separate test-and-trace programmes.\nThe Welsh government has said people in Wales should continue to use the app even if social distancing rules in Wales differ from those in England.

      "text": "Britons spent more money on charity, dating and their pets as Covid restrictions continued to ease, according to data from Nationwide.\nSpending on holidays, eating and drinking, leisure, gardening, and clothing also surged from April to June, the building society said.\nContactless and mobile payments also continued to pick up pace, Nationwide added.\nHowever, spending fell in general retailers across the board.\nThe building society looked at hundreds of millions of transactions by its customers from April to June, and compared them with the previous quarter.\nBy far the biggest surge in spending was on holidays, including a massive increase in spending on UK campsites and caravan parks, as quarantine restrictions remained for many foreign destinations.\nSpending on eating and drinking also surged to more than \u00a31bn as restrictions on restaurants were lifted.\nHowever, general retailers and department stores continued to be hit by the pandemic, with a massive 91% drop in spending by Nationwide customers.\nHowever, there was a 16% increase in spending on charity - dwarfing the spending in department stores.\nThis included charity shops and charitable donations, said Nationwide's head of payments Mark Nalder. The building society expects that trend to continue.\nCharity shops saw a huge spike in spending when they were allowed to reopen on 12 April, with the British Heart Foundation alone taking \u00a31m in a single day on that Monday, said Charity Retail Association's chief executive Robin Osterley.\n\"There was a lot of pent up demand that continued on,\" he said.\nSales at charity shops have continued to boom, ranging between 5% and 10% higher than two years ago.\nDuring lockdown people had a chance to reflect on what they really needed, and so were donating after clear-outs, but they also had a think about how they wanted to spend their money, Mr Osterley added.\n\"It's all part of people thinking: 'There has to be a better way. We can't go back to how we were [before the pandemic]',\" he said.\nPeople who were in a financial position to make a choice were attracted by the sustainability aspect of buying from charity shops. They also liked the fact that their money was going to a good cause, he said.\nThere were also people who were struggling financially, and had to buy from charity shops to make ends meet.\nThere was also a surge in people looking for romance, as spending on online dating grew. \nBetween April and June people spent \u00a33.8m, a rise of 5% from the previous quarter.\nBritons also showed how much they loved their pets, splurging \u00a3124.5m on gifts and keeping them fed and healthy.\nMillions of households bought new pets during the pandemic, prompting lawyers to say that couples should consider a legal agreement over who should get custody of the pet, in the event of a break-up.\nBut the biggest growth in essential spending was on public transport and taxis as restrictions eased in the second quarter, followed by motoring and fuel and car charging.\nThe ways that people paid for goods and services also continued to evolve.\nContactless payments, including via mobile phone, were already booming during the pandemic, and that growth continued in the second quarter.\nMobile payments were up 76%, while contactless card payments grew 46%. Payments were still dominated by debit cards despite slower growth, however.\nMr Nalder said that although the growth in contactless payments meant more convenience for many, he warned that a decline in cash use seen during the pandemic could become entrenched to the  disadvantage of people who rely on it."

      "text": "A decision on whether to reopen theatres and concert halls has been delayed by the Northern Ireland Executive until next week.\nVenues were expected to reopen on 26 July but minsters want more time to consider the health implications.\nMinisters however have agreed to relax some restrictions considered low risk.\nFrom Monday, 15 people from unlimited households can meet outdoors and close contact services can open without the need for pre-booked appointments. \nMinisters will meet again on Monday to decide if theatres can reopen.\nIf given the go ahead, those measures would come into effect immediately.\nIn a statement on Thursday afternoon, the Northern Ireland Executive said \"modest relaxations\" had been agreed after careful consideration. \nIt followed an update from health and scientific advisers on how the virus is progressing, including the increasing numbers of cases and hospital admissions, the statement added. \nIt comes as another 1,430 positive cases were reported by the Department of Health on Thursday. This includes samples taken in recent days, not necessarily in the last 24 hours. \nNo further deaths were recorded. \nThe frustration here is not totally surprising.\nA pause has been put on things which some people hoped would be given the green light and the most disappointed people will be those who run our theatres and concert halls.\nToday's decision doesn't mean reopening of those venues won't happen, but it's not going to happen as quickly as the people who own them want.\nHowever, when you consider some of the figures that ministers were considering today, that is not a surprise.\nThis all happens before the executive meets on 12 August to consider the mandatory wearing of facemasks and the end of social distancing.\nIt doesn't look like 'freedom day' - or anything like it - will be announced in Northern Ireland anytime soon.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the decision to make modest changes to restrictions was made \"in the context of a rapid increase in the number of cases\".\nShe said there had also been a doubling of the number of people in hospital in the last eight days, the majority of whom were unvaccinated.\nMs O'Neill reiterated a call for young people to take up the opportunity to get vaccinated at pop-up centres across Northern Ireland.\n\"A cautious approach is what is required here and a steady approach,\" she said.\nMs O'Neill said health officials had advised there would be more data available next week, which would help them understand the correlation between Covid-19 cases and admissions to hospital.\nShe said this information would help inform decisions around restrictions that may be further eased.\nDr Alan Stout, chairman of Northern Ireland's GP committee, described the Northern Ireland Executive's decision as \"sensible and measured\".\nHe said the executive had not bowed to pressure to ease restrictions but has instead based its decision on data and the risks faced.\n\"The temptation is that we move too soon, we need that little bit more time,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.\nHowever, Dr Stout added that Northern Ireland was \"not losing the race\" between infections and vaccines.\n\"We are doing well and we are protecting people. We would shudder to think what position we would be in right now if we had not vaccinated as many people,\" he said.\nHowever, Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said it was \"regrettable\" more progress could not have been made in the wider reopening of the economy.\nHe added that the executive also needed to take action about the number of people being required to self-isolate.\n\"We have received numerous calls from members this week indicating that they could well have to close because of staff having to self-isolate,\" he said.\n\"At the very least, we need the executive to bring Northern Ireland into line with the English date of 16 August, which allows 'pinged' double-vaccinated workers to take a PCR test, rather than self-isolation for 10 days.\"\nMeanwhile, Ireland's deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the number of Covid-19 cases related to overseas travel had increased \"very sharply\".\nHe said 676 cases were reported in the last fortnight in people returning from Spain, Great Britain and Portugal.\nIn a series of posts on Twitter, Dr Glynn said it was \"strongly advised\" that people should only travel on the basis of their vaccination status or immunity after recovering from Covid-19.\nBy Louise Cullen, BBC News NI health reporter\nWe know younger people are currently affected more by Covid-19 because a large part of that cohort simply have not had a vaccination yet.\nThe uptake is slow in that age group.\nOf all the positive tests in the previous seven days, more than 90% were in those aged under 60.\nAnecdotally, we are hearing from some people that they are getting vaccinated but some are still catching the virus.\nA lot of people have said to us that they really would not like to see what they would have had to go through if they had not been vaccinated.\nIt is a complicated, hard-hitting and unpleasant virus.\nOur hospital figures are remaining reasonably low but today we have 162 people in hospital.\nThere is a lag, however. In another two to three weeks, we are going to see those rising case numbers reflected in hospital admissions.\nThe Northern Ireland Executive will also decide on Monday if the current limit on indoor gatherings can be increased from six to ten people, from no more than three households.\nA decision on the reopening of MoT test centres is also due to be taken at that meeting.\nOther decisions, including removing the restrictions on sound levels from indoor venues, the holding of conferences and exhibitions and reducing social distancing to one metre will be considered next Thursday.\nMany Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland have been lifted in recent months, after a lockdown that lasted about four months.\nHowever, theatres and live music venues have been closed in Northern Ireland for the best part of 16 months, with all other parts of the UK already allowing them to reopen.\nThe arts and music sector had been urging the executive to stick to the latest indicative date and allow the industry to resume trading, with mitigations.\nThey had been looking at allowing a range of relaxations including:\nThe executive previously said that it intended to remove the so-called \"bubble\" caring provision if it approved the relaxations for increasing numbers of people allowed to meet at home.\nAlthough mandatory use of face coverings in England ended on 19 July, that does not apply in Northern Ireland.\nMinisters have discussed the issue in recent days but they are moving more cautiously with lifting that rule.\nThey did put in place an indicative date of 26 July, which would see face coverings no longer compulsory in places of worship or for students in school classrooms in the new term - but that has yet to be signed off by ministers.\nMinisters are due to review the wearing face coverings in places of worship at next Thursday's executive meeting. \nLooking at ending the mandatory use of face coverings more widely is unlikely to be discussed by ministers until a meeting on 12 August. \nMasks have been legally required in Northern Ireland on public transport, in shops and in a range of other settings since last summer, with a limited number of exemptions.\nThat is not entirely clear.\nDecisions on easing or imposing restrictions must be agreed by the five parties in the executive. \nThey have to consider advice from health officials about the spread of the variant, as well as social and economic effects of restrictions on the public.\nThe first and deputy first ministers have indicated that they will meet again on 12 August to look at lifting requirements for face coverings in other settings, the requirement for self-isolation and travel."

      "tags": "Brain injury",
      "text": "Sport has been allowed to \"mark its own homework\" on reducing the risks of brain injury, an MPs' inquiry says.\nIts report calls for a standard definition of concussion that all sports must use, and a paid medical officer at every major sporting event.\nIt comes as the first study to scan elite rugby players' brains suggests one in four could be at risk of small abnormalities.\nBut the long-term effects on brain health are not clear, researchers say.\nAnd they stress that there are many health benefits to taking part in sport, which must also be taken into account.\nThe inquiry, carried out by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee of MPs, heard evidence from former athletes, scientists, doctors, players' unions and the governing bodies for various sports.\nIt found \"unaccountable\" governing bodies had failed to address the issue of brain injury in their sports, and said the government had \"failed to take action on player welfare\".\nAs a result, its report said, the safety of athletes could be easily lost when funding for individual sports depended on how good their protocols looked on paper, but not in practice.\n\"We've been shocked by evidence from athletes who suffered head trauma, putting their future health on the line in the interests of achieving sporting success for the UK,\" committee chairman Julian Knight said.\n\"The Health and Safety Executive is responsible by law. However, risk management appears to have been delegated to the national governing bodies, such as the FA (Football Association). \n\"That is a dereliction of duty which must change,\" said Mr Knight.\nHe added that at grassroots level, the committee had found \"negligible effort to track brain injuries\" and the long-term impacts of them.\nThere is mounting evidence that heading a football repeatedly over many years may cause brain damage.\nAnd previous research has found that former professional footballers are three-and-a-half times more likely to die of dementia than people of the same age in the general population.\nBut there is still no definitive proof that one causes the other.\nThe issue hit the headlines after former England player Jeff Astle died aged 59 of dementia nearly 20 years ago, and a coroner ruled that he had the brain of a boxer which had been damaged by years of heading heavy leather footballs.\nDuring the inquiry, his daughter Dawn Astle told MPs that she felt let down by the lack of research that had taken place since.\n\"I want to make sure that the game is safe, safe for players now, players in the future, and children coming into the game. Sport just has not done enough and they should hang their heads in shame, in my opinion,\" she said.\nIn rugby, the potential for players to have mild brain injuries from heavy contact is much greater - particularly in rucks and tackles.\nIn a study of 44 elite rugby players from seven clubs, funded by the Drake Foundation, brain scans showed rugby players were more likely to have suffered changes to their brains than other athletes in non-contact sports, and non-athletes.\nIn fact, 10 of the players had signs of damage on scans, including small tears in blood vessels - and these were seen in players with and without a recent head injury.\nIn half of the players, scans showed unexpected changes in the brain's shape (or white matter volume).\nThere was no evidence that any of these players had poorer cognitive function or memory than other people in the study.\nProf David Sharp, senior study author from Imperial College London, said: \"What is not clear at this stage is the long-term clinical impact of these changes. \n\"Further research is needed to understand the long-term implications of repeated head injuries experienced during a rugby career and to provide more accurate ways to assess risk for an individual.\"\nDr Richard Sylvester, consultant neurologist at the National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery and Homerton University Hospital, said: \"You can find an abnormality if you look hard enough - but what is the relevance of it?\" \nThe Rugby Football Union (RFU) has announced a series of measures to reduce head impacts by players in training and matches.\nIt says it will agree a new framework for contact training, and introduce off-field assessments of head impacts in the women's game - this already exists in men's rugby."

      "text": "Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to self-isolate after one of his children tested positive for Covid, a spokesman has said.\nA statement from his office said one of his children tested positive at lunchtime, but Sir Keir was doing daily tests and tested negative this morning.\nSir Keir was in the House of Commons for PMQs earlier. \nThe PM and chancellor are also self-isolating after contact with the health secretary who tested positive.\nA further 73 people have died within 28 days of a positive test in the UK and another 44,104 cases have been recorded, according to the latest government figures.\nIn a tweet, Sir Keir said it was his responsibility to isolate with his family. This is the fourth time the Labour leader has had to self-isolate since the pandemic began.\nIn the House of Commons, Sir Keir described a \"summer of chaos\" amid soaring numbers of people self-isolating at home.\nThe Labour leader dubbed Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who is himself self-isolating at his country house in Buckinghamshire - the \"Chequers one\" as he mocked Mr Johnson's isolation in the same week that most remaining curbs were lifted in England.\nSpeaking in the Commons, Sir Keir said: \"Everything may be calm from the prime minister's country retreat but back here the truth is we're heading for a summer of chaos.\"\nAppearing virtually at PMQs, Mr Johnson urged people to stick with self-isolation rules ahead of changes next month because it is \"a vital tool in our defence\".\nHe added: \"I apologise to everybody in business up and down the land in all kinds of services, public sector or otherwise, who are experiencing inconvenience.\"\nMore than half a million alerts telling people to self-isolate were sent by the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the first week of July, with supermarkets saying they may have to cut opening hours or shut shops due to a lack of staff.\nBusinesses have warned of increasing staff shortages caused by people being forced to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app. Iceland and Greene King said on Monday they had had to shut shops and pubs as a result.\nBusiness lobby group the CBI has warned that the problem could hamper the economic recovery.\nThe government has said it is \"crucial\" for people to quarantine after being \"pinged\" by the NHS Covid-19 app.\nFollowing news on Saturday that Sajid Javid had tested positive and been in contact with Mr Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, No 10 said a workplace pilot scheme would allow them to keep working from Downing Street.\nBut the announcement met with an angry response, with opposition parties saying it suggested there was \"one rule for them and another for the rest of us\".\nThe prime minister and chancellor later announced they would complete a period of isolation.\nSpeaking in a video on Twitter after the U-turn, Mr Johnson said: \"We did look briefly at the idea of us taking part in the pilot scheme, which allows people to test daily, but I think it's far more important that everybody sticks to the same rules and that's why I'm going to be self-isolating until Monday 26 July.\""

      "tags": "Floods,Asia,China,Severe weather",
      "text": "As floodwater crashed through a busy subway station in China on Tuesday, desperate passengers tried to flee while others were swept helplessly off platforms.\nIn one train carriage, water seeped in and rose from ankle, to waist, to neck-height. Panicked commuters stretched upwards to breathe, while others lifted shorter people into the shrinking air pocket above.\nIn terrifying videos shared on social media, some passengers can be seen standing on chairs and clinging to the ceiling as the floodwater creeps upwards. One tried to smash a window, before realising that there was even more water outside the carriage.\nSome filmed the unfolding tragedy, while others called loved ones or posted pleas for help. \"I can't speak any more,\" one woman wrote on the social media site Weibo. \"If no rescue comes in 20 minutes, hundreds of us will lose our lives.\"\n\"We were all standing on the seats, and the water was already on our knees,\" a woman who gave her name as Ms Li told Elephant News. \n\"Some shorter passengers had water up to their necks,\" she said, adding that as time went on the air supply began to diminish.\nAfter about an hour, the train carriage was plunged into darkness and the oxygen level waned further. \"I was really scared, but the most terrifying thing was not the water, but the diminishing air supply,\" one person told Reuters news agency.\nAfter several hours of fear and uncertainty, rescuers were able to gain access through the roof of the carriage and pulled people out. \"We knocked on the glass a bit [on the ceiling]. Then suddenly there was air,\" an unnamed woman told state broadcaster CCTV.\nHundreds of people were eventually saved from the flooded subway tunnel in Zhengzhou, a city of 12 million people that sits on the banks of the Yellow River in central Henan province. \nBut at least 12 are known to have died and five were injured in the subway disaster, which came after the region saw more rainfall in three days than it usually would in a year. \nThis is a rainy time of year in China and floods happen annually. However, Chinese scientists say global warming has made the situation more dangerous and warn that extreme weather could become more frequent in the future.\nIn Henan, at least 33 people have died and more than 200,000 have been evacuated. Major roads have been turned into rivers, with cars and debris being swept along by fast moving currents.\nAt Shakoulu metro station the shutters are down, a small group of police stand watching at one entrance. \n\"Is this a crime scene?\" I asked one of them. \"I can't talk to you,\" he replied. \nThis is the place where graphic pictures, shared on social media, showed passengers lying lifeless on the platform below. You can't get down there now. Zhengzhou's metro network is completely closed. \nAbove ground, though, you can see the evidence and the aftermath: there's mud and silt on the edge of the road, on the other side from where I'm writing workers are fixing a part of the surface that was ripped up by the force of the water. \nBut to my right is the clearest evidence of what happened here; a four lane underpass vanishes after a few metres under an impromptu lake. \nThe water stretches out, covering the road, as far as I can see. It comes up almost over the railings on the walkway at the side.\nHarrowing accounts of the subway tragedy, and of the dramatic flooding around the province, are continuing to emerge, with witnesses describing scenes of fear and chaos.\n\"At the start there wasn't much water, then it was like it all started coming at once,\" one woman who was on the flooded subway train told the news outlet Pear Video.\n\"Within about 30 minutes it was up to my shoulders,\" she said. \"It was hard to breathe. A lot of people fainted.\"  \nThe woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said she was trapped for more than four hours and cried when she was finally rescued.\n\"There was so much water on the platform, and there was water streaming out of the cracks in the subway doors,\" another passenger told Jiupai News.\n\"I'm quite tall, but after about five minutes, the water was already at my chest,\" he said. \"Tall people helped short people and children up onto the seats. I was holding someone's child.\" \nIn one post on Weibo, a woman described the panic in the carriage. \"Many people started to suffer breathing difficulties,\" she wrote. \"I heard a nearby passenger on her phone, giving her bank account details to her family, and thought I should do the same.\"\n\"Water was leaking from the cracks in the door, more and more of it, all of us who could, stood on the subway seats,\" another post read.\nDramatic images have also been shared of rescues above ground. Emergency workers have used long ropes to pull people to safety as they were dragged along by gushing currents.\n\"I was lucky that I stayed at home, but we [still] felt like we were going to be washed away,\" Wang Qian told BBC OS from Zhengzhou.\n\"I've contacted all of my family and luckily they're all safe. \"There's a lot of damage around us. I can see the floods everywhere, lots of cars and water everywhere,\" she said.\nRescue efforts are continuing around the province, while further downpours have been forecast for the rest of the week. \n\"We're all waiting to see if everything will be OK soon,\" Ms Wang said. \"We're very scared.\"\nAdditional reporting by Kerry Allen and Gareth Evans"

      "tags": "Police Service of Northern Ireland",
      "text": "There were \"significant failures\" in the police investigation into the murder of a Catholic teenager by loyalist paramilitaries, a Police Ombudsman's report has concluded. \nDamien Walsh was shot in 1993.\nThere was no evidence police had advance knowledge of the attack or could have stopped it, the report said.\nBut there were \"collusive police behaviours\" in the investigation and decision to suspend surveillance of the gang responsible.\nThe teenager was fatally wounded after being shot by the UDA (Ulster Defence Association) in Belfast.\nHe was at work at a coal supply business within the Dairy Farm shopping complex close to Twinbrook in the west of the city. \nAt the time, the complex was under security force surveillance - fertiliser for Provisional IRA bombs was being stored in a premises two doors away from the coal business. \nOmbudsman Marie Anderson said the teenager was \"the innocent victim of a terror campaign mounted by loyalist paramilitaries against the nationalist community\".\n\"The UDA alone were responsible for Damien's murder,\" she added.\n\"However, I have identified investigative failings and gaps as well as collusive behaviours by police, which I believe failed both Damien and his family.\" \nMs Anderson noted that in the days before the shooting, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) suspended a surveillance operation against the UDA's 'C company'.\nShe said the decision \"cannot be directly linked to Damien's murder\", but it \"indirectly contributed\" to them being able to operate without constraint.\n\"In my view this amounted to a deliberate decision that constituted collusive behaviour on the part of police.\"\nDuring the period when the gang was not under watch, it also murdered Peter Gallagher at the Westlink Enterprise Centre in west Belfast.\nMs Anderson's report said police had suspended their surveillance in order to focus resources on the operation against the IRA at the Dairy Farm.\nHer report also found major failures in the murder investigation.\nThe senior investigating officer was not told of the surveillance operation of the Dairy Farm complex, nor was he made aware of Army witnesses to the attack.\nMs Anderson found this was a deliberate decision to impede the investigation.\n\"Intelligence indicating the UDA had received information from a police officer which informed their attack on the Dairy Farm was also withheld from the senior investigating officer, as was intelligence suggesting that the group had received information from 'British intelligence'.\"\nThe report stated the targeted nature of the attack, near a business unit being used by the IRA, \"suggested that gunmen had prior knowledge of the PIRA activities at the Dairy Farm\".\nThe ombudsman further found that of seven suspects, just three were arrested and only one questioned in relation to the murder.\nNone of the three suspects' homes was searched for evidence and no one has ever been charged in relation to the murder.\nPolice also failed to pursue evidence relating to the murder weapon.\nThe Browning pistol was found a year later but the person caught with it was not subjected to forensic tests to determine whether he could be linked to the teenager's killing.\nNeither was the man he claimed had given him the weapon.\nThe gun was subsequently destroyed - something which Ms Anderson said ought not to have occurred in an unsolved murder case - although its disposal was in line with police policy at the time.\nAll police officers connected to the case are now retired.\nThe Walsh family welcomed the ombudsman's findings and said they are determined to continue to fight for those involved to face justice.\n\"His life was stolen from him,\" said Damien's mother Marian.\n\"I am glad that all the suspicions I had around collusion have been verified at an official level.\n\"I really want to go on with this and I want to see the people who did this brought to court.\"\nSpeaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Ms Walsh said she was \"really exhausted, physically and mentally\". \nMs Walsh described government plans announced last week, which would see an end to Troubles-related prosecutions, as \"totally wrong and totally immoral\". \n\"This should just be the beginning of the process and I'm hoping it will be, but given Boris Johnson's trying to bring in legislation to stop any further investigations or prosecutions, inquests and so on, it looks like it might be the end of the process.\n\"It's denying us our basic human rights, we have the right to justice, we have the right to truth and that is taking all of that away.\"\nPolice Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said the service would carefully consider the Police Ombudsman's report with a view to identifying appropriate next steps.\n\"Damien Walsh was an innocent young man killed by a despicable act of terrorism,\" he said.\n\"The pain of such a grievous loss does not fade and I am acutely aware that today will be very upsetting for the family. My thoughts are with them.\""

      "tags": "Huddersfield,Tommy Robinson",
      "text": "English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson has been ordered to pay \u00a3100,000 in libel damages to a Syrian schoolboy.\nThe anti-Islam activist, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, published two Facebook videos in response to a viral clip of Jamal Hijazi being attacked.\nHe failed to convince the High Court his claims, such as Mr Hijazi attacking \"young English girls\", were true.\nMr Justice Nicklin found in Mr Hijazi's favour after a trial earlier this year.\nThe judge also ordered Mr Yaxley-Lennon to pay legal costs understood by the BBC to amount to about \u00a3500,000.\nMr Hijazi was filmed being attacked in the playground at Almondbury School in Huddersfield in October 2018.\nShortly after the video of the assault went viral, Mr Yaxley-Lennon claimed in two Facebook videos that the teenager was \"not innocent and he violently attacks young English girls in his school\".\nIn clips viewed by nearly one million people, the 38-year-old also claimed Mr Hijazi \"beat a girl black and blue\" and threatened to stab another boy at his school, allegations denied by Mr Hijazi.\n\"As was entirely predictable, the claimant then became the target of abuse which ultimately led to him and his family having to leave their home, and the claimant to have to abandon his education.\n\"The defendant is responsible for this harm, some of the scars of which, particularly the impact on the claimant's education, are likely to last for many years, if not a lifetime.\"\nThe judge said Mr Yaxley-Lennon's defence that the \"very serious\" allegations were substantially true had not been proved, and he had used language \"calculated to inflame the situation\". \n\"The defendant's contribution to this media frenzy was a deliberate effort to portray the claimant as being, far from an innocent victim, but in fact a violent aggressor,\" he added. \nAt a further hearing, the judge granted an injunction against Mr Yaxley-Lennon preventing him from repeating the allegations.\nThe final damages and costs figures will be agreed and submitted to the High Court at forthcoming hearings to establish Mr Yaxley-Lennon's means and assets.\nStephen Yaxley-Lennon's repeated jailings down the years - including nine months for interfering with a trial of a sexual grooming gang - have failed to silence him. But a turning of the legal screw on his finances may have a more profound effect. \nHe made a small fortune from his provocative social media channels attacking Islam and Muslims - enough to fund a lifestyle that would be the envy of many, complete with a large country house.\nThe cash began to dry up as he was thrown off Facebook and Youtube and some of his wealthy benefactors in North American backed away. Today, his social media reach is a shadow of what it once was. It's never been clear how much he made and where it has all gone - and that's why this judgement is so important. Not only does it vindicate Jamal Hijazi - but it opens the door to a court examination of his finances and how he affords to keep his activities going. \nJamal Hijazi's lawyers welcomed the judgement and praised Mr Hijazi's \"courage\" in pursuing the claim. \nFrancesca Flood, from Burlingtons Legal, said: \"Jamal and his family now wish to put this matter behind them in order that they can get on with their lives.\n\"They do, however, wish to extend their gratitude to the Great British public for their support and generosity, without which this legal action would not have been possible.\" \nDuring a trial in April, Catrin Evans QC, for Mr Hijazi, said that Mr Yaxley-Lennon's comments led to the teenager \"facing death threats and extremist agitation\" and that he should receive damages of between \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3190,000.\nShe described Mr Yaxley-Lennon as \"a well-known extreme-right advocate\" with an \"anti-Muslim agenda\" who used social media to spread his views.\nHis videos \"turned Jamal into the aggressor and the bully into a righteous white knight\", she said.\nMore stories from Yorkshire\nMr Yaxley-Lennon, who represented himself during the trial, maintained he was an independent journalist, telling the court: \"The media simply had zero interest in the other side of this story, the uncomfortable truth.\""

      "text": "Supermarkets have warned the rising number of retail workers being forced to self-isolate is beginning to affect the availability of some products.\nThe Co-op said it was \"running low on some products\", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut.\nSainsbury's said it \"might not always\" have the exact products people wanted, but downplayed fears of shortages saying the problem was not widespread.\nIceland also urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary.\nThe Co-op said items such as soft drinks, personal care products such as deodorant and beer were worst affected.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was \"concerned about instances of shortages\". \n\"I don't want people to get the impression that every shelf in every supermarket is bare - that is not the case but we are certainly concerned about instances of shortages, we are looking at the supply chains of critical industries and we are reviewing that situation,\" he added.\nA record 618,903 people in England and Wales were \"pinged\" by the NHS Covid app in the week to 14 July.\nSupermarkets and other sectors, including hospitality and transport, have said growing numbers of staff have been affected which means they have to self-isolate for 10 days. Some companies have reduced opening hours to cope with the staff shortages or shut parts of the business. \nFirms want people who have been doubly vaccinated or have daily tests to be able to return to work.\nMr Kwarteng said that the government would publish guidance later on which sectors would be exempt, although he declined to comment on whether it would include the food industry. \nMany of Thursday's newspapers carried pictures of empty shelves in some supermarket branches - with some describing panic buying of certain items - but industry sources told the BBC that so far, food shortages were not a systemic problem. \nIceland's managing director, Richard Walker, said photographs of empty shelves in supermarkets were \"isolated incidents\".\nIt is understood that Tesco is experiencing low availability across a small number of products due to the rise in the number of workers self-isolating as well as the industry-wide shortage of HGV drivers.\nMeanwhile, the Co-op said it was being hit \"by some patchy disruption to our deliveries and store operations\".\n\"We are working closely with our suppliers to get re-stocked quickly,\" it added.\nIt is understood that items such as soft drinks, personal care products such as deodorant and beer are worst affected.\nLidl said the rise in numbers of employees having to self-isolate was starting to hit operations, but it was working to minimise disruption.\nAbout 1,000 Iceland employees - almost 4% of its staff - are currently absent for Covid-related reasons, with the north of England most affected. \nOf these, 27% have tested positive for Covid, while 64% have been \"pinged\" by the NHS Covid app and told to isolate.\nIceland is recruiting 2,000 temporary staff to help with the shortages while the Co-op will take on 3,000 extra workers.\nWaitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership, said: \"We're working through the same challenges that all supermarkets are facing right now.\n\"As always, our focus is on maintaining the best possible range of products and high levels of service for our customers.\"\nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the increasing number of workers being told to isolate was \"putting increasing pressure on retailers' ability to maintain opening hours and keep shelves stocked\".\nA fall in the number of available HGV drivers, exacerbated by the rising numbers being forced to isolate, was also \"resulting in minor disruption to some supply chains\", the BRC's Andrew Opie said.\nThe Road Haulage Association estimates there is a shortage of 100,000 HGV drivers in the UK due to workers returning to Europe following Brexit as well as delays in testing hauliers for Covid. \nMeanwhile, the British Meat Processors Association said some members were seeing between 5% and 10% of their workforce \"pinged\" by the app. \nUnder current self-isolation rules in England, anyone who is traced as a close contact of a confirmed positive case must isolate for 10 days, whether or not they have received both doses of a vaccine.\nIf someone is told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace they are legally obliged to do so. \nBut if someone is \"pinged\" by the NHS Covid app the requirement to self-isolate is only advisory. \nAndrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood UK, which supplies produce to hospitals, care home and prisons as well as restaurants, said it was asking workers who have been \"pinged\" to come back to work after they have taken a negative PCR test. \n\"We have a process of doing lateral flow tests daily away from their workplace and if that is negative then they can proceed with their work,\" Mr Selley said.\nBut Mr Kwarteng told the BBC: \"The rules are clear and I think they should be followed.\"\nEarlier this week, the government announced a \"small number\" of fully vaccinated critical workers, including health and care staff, would be allowed to continue to do their job even if they were a close contact of someone who had tested positive for Covid. \nThe prime minister has said he does not want to extend the exemption too widely in order to limit the spread of the virus. \nThe government has argued it is necessary to keep isolation rules largely unchanged until 16 August. \nFrom that date, people who are fully vaccinated and under-18s will be able to avoid self-isolating by taking daily Covid tests. \nDozens of councils across England have also been forced to suspend bin collections due to staff self-isolating. \nOn Wednesday, BP said lorry driver shortages and isolating staff had caused fuel supply issues at some of its petrol stations. \nThe oil firm said shortages of unleaded petrol and diesel had seen a \"handful\" of its UK sites close temporarily.\nHave you experienced shops struggling to keep their shelves stocked?

      "text": "More than half a million isolation alerts were sent to people using the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales during the first week of July.\nSome 530,126 alerts telling people to self-isolate were sent in the week to 7 July, a 46% rise on the previous week.\nOne union has warned factories are on the verge of shutting because of staff shortages, with Nissan and Rolls Royce the latest firms to raise concerns.\nThe UK has recorded another 48,553 daily coronavirus cases.\nCases have increased 32.6% over the last week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had previously warned there could be 50,000 cases a day by 19 July - when most legal restrictions are due to end in England. \nLatest government figures also show a further 63 Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nAlerts are sent through the NHS Covid app to tell individuals they have been in close contact with a positive coronavirus case. Anyone alerted is advised to self-isolate for 10 days.\nSocial distancing rules are being lifted in England on Monday, leading to concerns about a bigger rise in the number of alerts.\nThe latest figures show that 520,194 alerts were sent in England in the week to 7 July, with another 9,932 sent in Wales.\nUnite said hundreds of employees were off work at some sites, with the app causing \"havoc\" on production lines.\nAssistant general secretary Steve Turner said it was no exaggeration to say factories were on the verge of shutting and that at some sites hundreds of staff are off work.\n\"It is clear that something has to be done in time for July 19, or else people will simply start deleting the app en masse to avoid isolation notices,\" he said.\nSteve Robinson, chief executive of homecare company Prama, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that around a quarter of his staff were currently off work after being \"pinged\".\nHe said he was currently offering three times the normal salary to cover emergency shifts.\nTim Moran, who runs cold supply chain company Lineage Logistics' UK division, said he had more staff absent than at any point during the pandemic and it meant the firm couldn't meet the demand to deliver food to customers.\nProf Lucy Easthope, who advises the government on disaster planning, said the issue of staff shortages because of the app hadn't come as a surprise.\nShe told the PM programme: \"We feared we would see in some workforces 80% absenteeism. There will come a point where we simply can't operate like that, particularly around things like food production.\"\nShe said she knew of some companies advising people not to have the app, which she said was in its \"death throes\". \n\"The app is not the way to do this now. It has always been that we should have had local contact tracing through public health and that now needs to be properly resourced.\"\nDespite the rise in the number of people getting \"pinged\" - data from the most recent week showed the most downloads of the app (342,483) since the seven days to 6 June (393,842).\nIt has already been announced that from 16 August, people who have been fully vaccinated in England will no longer have to self-isolate after close contact with someone who tests positive.\nThe BBC has been told the team behind the app has been asked to adjust the measurements that trigger the alerts so that fewer are sent out - although the time frame for the change is not yet known.\nHowever, the Department of Health and Social Care said that while the sensitivity of the app was kept under constant review there were no plans to change its sensitivity at this time.\nOther reasons people have to self-isolate include if they test positive, live with someone who tests positive, or are told to do so by contact tracers.\nPeople in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own).\nIf you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a \"ping\" alert if they later test positive for Covid and share the information with the app. The app uses Bluetooth readings to infer if you had recently been within 2m of them for at least 15 minutes.\nIf you are \"pinged\" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days.\nMeanwhile, the UK's two largest supermarkets - Tesco and Sainsbury's - have said they will continue to ask shoppers to wear masks when the legal requirement to do so in England is dropped on Monday.\nThe government has said it \"expects and recommends\" shoppers in England to wear face masks from Monday.\nBut the legal requirement to cover your face in enclosed spaces will end. Different rules apply in the devolved nations.\nAnd the government has been criticised over its decision to add Bulgaria and Croatia to its green travel list from Monday - but not give Foreign Office approval for travel to the countries. \nThe decision to allow people to travel there without isolating on return was announced on Wednesday, but the government's travel advice pages for both countries currently states that it  \"advises against all but essential travel\".\nGovernment travel advice affects operators' and passengers' insurance. \nAirlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said not aligning Foreign Office travel advice with government travel policies was causing \"huge confusion for passengers and carriers\"."

But Covid made her rethink last year.\n\"I originally joined when I was in Year 8, and I've competed in many competitions and love being a part of the club,\" she said. \n\"This year I had considered joining because I want to support the club and want to be part of the competitions. \n\"But Covid came, and I wasn't going to get the same experiences as usual. \n\"For me, being part of the competitions and meeting weekly, that's what YFC is, I enjoy the socialising.\n\"I would consider rejoining this year coming.\n\"I want to be a part of the YFC until I'm too old to do so because I really enjoy everything about it. \n\"Even if I do live in Cardiff, I still want to join and support the club.\"\nLike many organisations, the YFCs turned to the virtual world to hold many of their events and competitions. \nThat was not practical for every event - and not to everyone's taste, especially those who would prefer to meet face-to-face.\nBut it has offered opportunities to people like 24-year-old Sioned Fflur Evans, a member of Llanwenog YFC, Ceredigion, but has been living in Birmingham and Bristol for the past two years.\n\"This year, when the competition was online or on Zoom, it made it much easier for me to compete as I could log on from Birmingham,\" she said.\nThe challenge for the clubs in Wales is encouraging those who have left to rejoin - for social reasons, but also for the sake of the organisation's finances. \nLast year BBC Radio Cymru found the organisation was facing potential losses of \u00a3140,000.\nBut Ms Davies believes most members will rejoin after a year's break.\n\"We are positive about the future of the YFC because counties are meeting and clubs are meeting face-to-face,\" she said.\n\"With that we're seeing more members coming back. \n\"Looking forward, if the restrictions are relaxed again in August we'll see more members returning in September when the new YFC year starts.\""

      "text": "Phone numbers used by two Dubai princesses have reportedly been found as part of an investigation into the phone hacking spyware known as Pegasus.\nPrincess Latifa is the daughter of the ruler of Dubai, and Princess Haya Bint al-Hussain is his former wife.\nIn mid-February, BBC Panorama broadcast a secret video from Princess Latifa in which she said she was being held as a hostage and feared for her life.\nPrincess Haya meanwhile fled Dubai in 2019 saying she feared for her life.\nThe UAE has denied both women's allegations.\nTheir numbers are apparently on a list of some 50,000 phone numbers of people believed to be of interest to clients of Israeli-based firm NSO Group. \nThe list was leaked to major news outlets.\nThe discovery of the princesses' phone numbers on the list - and those of some acquaintances - has raised questions about whether they could have been the possible target of a government client of the group.\nHuman rights organisation Amnesty International has issued a statement alleging that the find implicates NSO Group \"in the catalogue of human rights violations\" inflicted on the two women.\nIt calls for regulation to rein in \"an unchecked surveillance industry\".\nNSO has denied any wrongdoing. \nIt says the software is intended for use against criminals and terrorists, and is made available only to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies with good human rights records.\nThe original investigation which led to the reports - by Paris-based NGO Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International - was \"full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories\", the Israel-based group said.\nThe reports are part of a series of news articles suggesting thousands of prominent people have been targeted.\nA senior Israeli official confirmed to the BBC that the Israeli government had set up a team to examine allegations about the Pegasus software.\nPrincess Latifa told the BBC this year that she was kidnapped and imprisoned after trying to escape Dubai.\nShe said that after escaping the UAE and boarding a boat across the Indian Ocean in 2018, she was seized from a yacht and taken back to Dubai, where she says she was imprisoned in a villa converted into a jail.\nThe story prompted an international outcry. After the UN demanded proof of life, Dubai's royal family said she was \"being cared for at home\".\nPrincess Latifa has not been seen or heard from in months. Photos allegedly showing Princess Latifa in public and even travelling have appeared on an acquaintance's Instagram profile in recent months.\nPrincess Haya meanwhile has accused her ex-husband of abduction, torture and a campaign of intimidation. A UK court published the allegations in a series of judgements last year. \nAccording to the documents, her marriage fell apart after she became suspicious about what happened to Princess Latifa, as well as another of her ex-husband's children, Sheikha Shamsa.\nShe fled to the UK in April 2019 with her two children. The court heard last year that veiled threats from Sheikh Mohammed had left her terrified for her own safety, as well as fears that her children could be abducted and forcibly returned to Dubai."

      "text": "Wales recorded its hottest day of the year so far on the final day of the four-day extreme heat warning that has been in force across the southern UK.\nThe mercury peaked at 31.2C (88.1F) at Gogerddan, near Aberystwyth on Thursday - beating the 30.9C (88F) in Usk on Tuesday and Cardiff on Monday.\nThe Met Office said Thursday's hottest place in the UK was 31.4C (88.5F) at Armagh town in Northern Ireland.\nRain and thunderstorms will replace the heatwave in most of Wales this weekend.\nForecasters predicted \"heavy, thundery showers\" as likely from early on Saturday morning through to late on Sunday night, which could be \"torrential\".\nIt is a change from the heatwave that Wales has been experiencing over the last week which caused the Met Office to issue its first UK extreme heat warning.\nWales' burns unit reported children in hospital with severe sunburn and the ambulance service was pushed to the limit, while a bar and restaurant shut due to the 'unbearable' heat.\nIt comes as the RAC has warned that Friday could be be the busiest day on UK roads with 2.3 million leisure trips - with Wales alongside the West Country and Scotland predicted to be the most popular destinations.\nTraffic data expert Inrix has warned delays on the roads could be up to a third longer than normal July traffic as people holiday in the UK due to foreign holiday travel restrictions during the pandemic.\nThe UK's hottest temperature of the year is still the 32.2C (90C) recorded at London's Heathrow Airport on Tuesday.\nBut the 31.2C reached at Gogerddan in Ceredigion is Wales' warmest of 2021 so far.\nAll areas of Wales had high temperatures with 30.6C (87F) recorded at Hawarden in Flintshire, 30.3C (86.5F) at Bala in Gwynedd and 30.2C (86.3F) at both Usk in Monmouthshire and Cardiff.\nAlthough temperatures soared across the country on Thursday, they were not the highest ever recorded in Wales or even in July.\nThe highest July temperature in Wales was 34.6\u00b0C (94.2) in 2006 - but the highest ever recorded in Wales was 35.2C (95.3F) Hawarden Bridge in Flintshire on 2 August 1990.\nWhat's the weather going to like in Wales on the weekend?\nThe Met Office said \"heavy, thundery showers\" are likely, which could be \"torrential\" with the potential for up to 100mm of rain falling in places.\nLightning and hail are also expected and there is a small chance of flooding and power cuts, forecasters warned.\nAt Aberavon beach in Port Talbot, Owen Parfitt manages Franco's chip shop.\n\"It's been bonkers, we have had queues down the path for the takeaway, we have had queues for the tables in the restaurant,\" he said.\n\"It's been really nice to be back to normal a little bit.\"\nOne local said the beach was \"lovely\" and the people \"fantastic,\" adding she was \"definitely\" in a good mood. \n\"This puts everyone in a better mood, doesn't it?\" she said. \nOver the past five years, there have been 25 days with temperatures of more than 30C (86F) in Wales - compared with four in the previous decade.\nThe problem with climate change is it makes the magnitude, the frequency and the duration of extreme events more intense,\" said Swansea University climate scientist Prof Mary Gagen.\n\"We know the hottest day of the year now is nearly a degree - about 0.8C higher - than it was a few decades ago. \n\"We know that in the future we can expect heatwaves like this, not just to occur maybe every five years or so, but actually every other year, and that is when the starts to become a very different thing.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Northern Ireland Assembly,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A decision on whether to reopen theatres and concert halls has been delayed by the Northern Ireland Executive until next week.\nVenues were expected to reopen on 26 July but minsters want more time to consider the health implications.\nMinisters however have agreed to relax some restrictions considered low risk.\nFrom Monday, 15 people from unlimited households can meet outdoors and close contact services can open without the need for pre-booked appointments. \nMinisters will meet again on Monday to decide if theatres can reopen.\nIf given the go ahead, those measures would come into effect immediately.\nIn a statement on Thursday afternoon, the Northern Ireland Executive said \"modest relaxations\" had been agreed after careful consideration. \nIt followed an update from health and scientific advisers on how the virus is progressing, including the increasing numbers of cases and hospital admissions, the statement added. \nIt comes as another 1,430 positive cases were reported by the Department of Health on Thursday. This includes samples taken in recent days, not necessarily in the last 24 hours. \nNo further deaths were recorded. \nThe frustration here is not totally surprising.\nA pause has been put on things which some people hoped would be given the green light and the most disappointed people will be those who run our theatres and concert halls.\nToday's decision doesn't mean reopening of those venues won't happen, but it's not going to happen as quickly as the people who own them want.\nHowever, when you consider some of the figures that ministers were considering today, that is not a surprise.\nThis all happens before the executive meets on 12 August to consider the mandatory wearing of facemasks and the end of social distancing.\nIt doesn't look like 'freedom day' - or anything like it - will be announced in Northern Ireland anytime soon.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the decision to make modest changes to restrictions was made \"in the context of a rapid increase in the number of cases\".\nShe said there had also been a doubling of the number of people in hospital in the last eight days, the majority of whom were unvaccinated.\nMs O'Neill reiterated a call for young people to take up the opportunity to get vaccinated at pop-up centres across Northern Ireland.\n\"A cautious approach is what is required here and a steady approach,\" she said.\nMs O'Neill said health officials had advised there would be more data available next week, which would help them understand the correlation between Covid-19 cases and admissions to hospital.\nShe said this information would help inform decisions around restrictions that may be further eased.\nDr Alan Stout, chairman of Northern Ireland's GP committee, described the Northern Ireland Executive's decision as \"sensible and measured\".\nHe said the executive had not bowed to pressure to ease restrictions but has instead based its decision on data and the risks faced.\n\"The temptation is that we move too soon, we need that little bit more time,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.\nHowever, Dr Stout added that Northern Ireland was \"not losing the race\" between infections and vaccines.\n\"We are doing well and we are protecting people. We would shudder to think what position we would be in right now if we had not vaccinated as many people,\" he said.\nHowever, Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said it was \"regrettable\" more progress could not have been made in the wider reopening of the economy.\nHe added that the executive also needed to take action about the number of people being required to self-isolate.\n\"We have received numerous calls from members this week indicating that they could well have to close because of staff having to self-isolate,\" he said.\n\"At the very least, we need the executive to bring Northern Ireland into line with the English date of 16 August, which allows 'pinged' double-vaccinated workers to take a PCR test, rather than self-isolation for 10 days.\"\nMeanwhile, Ireland's deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the number of Covid-19 cases related to overseas travel had increased \"very sharply\".\nHe said 676 cases were reported in the last fortnight in people returning from Spain, Great Britain and Portugal.\nIn a series of posts on Twitter, Dr Glynn said it was \"strongly advised\" that people should only travel on the basis of their vaccination status or immunity after recovering from Covid-19.\nBy Louise Cullen, BBC News NI health reporter\nWe know younger people are currently affected more by Covid-19 because a large part of that cohort simply have not had a vaccination yet.\nThe uptake is slow in that age group.\nOf all the positive tests in the previous seven days, more than 90% were in those aged under 60.\nAnecdotally, we are hearing from some people that they are getting vaccinated but some are still catching the virus.\nA lot of people have said to us that they really would not like to see what they would have had to go through if they had not been vaccinated.\nIt is a complicated, hard-hitting and unpleasant virus.\nOur hospital figures are remaining reasonably low but today we have 162 people in hospital.\nThere is a lag, however. In another two to three weeks, we are going to see those rising case numbers reflected in hospital admissions.\nThe Northern Ireland Executive will also decide on Monday if the current limit on indoor gatherings can be increased from six to ten people, from no more than three households.\nA decision on the reopening of MoT test centres is also due to be taken at that meeting.\nOther decisions, including removing the restrictions on sound levels from indoor venues, the holding of conferences and exhibitions and reducing social distancing to one metre will be considered next Thursday.\nMany Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland have been lifted in recent months, after a lockdown that lasted about four months.\nHowever, theatres and live music venues have been closed in Northern Ireland for the best part of 16 months, with all other parts of the UK already allowing them to reopen.\nThe arts and music sector had been urging the executive to stick to the latest indicative date and allow the industry to resume trading, with mitigations.\nThey had been looking at allowing a range of relaxations including:\nThe executive previously said that it intended to remove the so-called \"bubble\" caring provision if it approved the relaxations for increasing numbers of people allowed to meet at home.\nAlthough mandatory use of face coverings in England ended on 19 July, that does not apply in Northern Ireland.\nMinisters have discussed the issue in recent days but they are moving more cautiously with lifting that rule.\nThey did put in place an indicative date of 26 July, which would see face coverings no longer compulsory in places of worship or for students in school classrooms in the new term - but that has yet to be signed off by ministers.\nMinisters are due to review the wearing face coverings in places of worship at next Thursday's executive meeting. \nLooking at ending the mandatory use of face coverings more widely is unlikely to be discussed by ministers until a meeting on 12 August. \nMasks have been legally required in Northern Ireland on public transport, in shops and in a range of other settings since last summer, with a limited number of exemptions.\nThat is not entirely clear.\nDecisions on easing or imposing restrictions must be agreed by the five parties in the executive. \nThey have to consider advice from health officials about the spread of the variant, as well as social and economic effects of restrictions on the public.\nThe first and deputy first ministers have indicated that they will meet again on 12 August to look at lifting requirements for face coverings in other settings, the requirement for self-isolation and travel."

      "title": "Brexit: What's the Northern Ireland Protocol?",
      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "A Brexit deal, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, is at the centre of a dispute between the UK and the European Union (EU).\nSince it came into force at the start of 2021 the protocol has disrupted trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK has suggested it could suspend parts of the arrangement by triggering part of the protocol known as Article 16.\nThe protocol allows lorries to deliver goods without having paperwork and goods checked when they cross the border from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland.\nThis arrangement was easy to maintain before Brexit. When both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were part of the EU, they automatically followed the same EU trade rules, which meant no checks were required.\nHowever, a new arrangement was needed after Northern Ireland (along with the rest of the UK) left the EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods, such as milk and eggs, arrive from non-EU countries. Similar rules exist in other areas, such as medicine licensing. \nTo try to get round the problem the UK and the EU negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is now part of international law.\nRather than checks taking place along the Irish border, it was agreed any inspections and document checks would take place between Northern Ireland and  Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) instead.\nThis was allowed after it was agreed that Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU rules on product standards (part of the EU's single market rules). \nChecks on GB goods take place at Northern Ireland ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, this has led to criticism that a new trade border has effectively been created in the Irish Sea. \nUnionists are strongly opposed to the checks because they don't want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK.\nAlso, not all checks under the protocol have been fully implemented yet. For example, supermarkets had reduced paperwork required under a temporary \"grace period\". However, the UK decided to extend these periods - something the EU said was a breach of international law. \nDespite signing up to the agreement in 2019, the UK government now says the protocol represented a huge compromise by the UK and has accused the EU of applying it too rigidly.\nThe UK is calling for changes, which include:\nArticle 16 is a set of three paragraphs in the protocol that allows either side to suspend any part of the agreement that causes \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss - now the UK's lead Brexit negotiator - said she would trigger Article 16 if the UK failed to secure changes.\n\"I want a negotiated solution but if we have to use legitimate provisions, including Article 16, I am willing to do that,\" she wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.\nIf the UK went down this route, it could prompt the EU to respond with measures that would impose tariffs (or import taxes) on aspects of trade between the two sides.\nThe EU has warned that any such move would \"lead to instability and unpredictability\".\nThe EU has set out proposals, but says a renegotiation of the text of the Protocol is out of the question:\nIn return, the EU wants extra safeguards to prevent products from Great Britain crossing into the Republic of Ireland.\nThe border is a sensitive issue because of the history of Northern Ireland and the agreements made to bring peace, which included the removal of visible signs of the border.\nThe fear is that if any infrastructure were to be installed, such as cameras or border posts, it could become a target and lead to political instability.\nDuring negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority."

      "text": "The father of a 10-year-old girl set to get a new lab-built ear has said the science will transform her life.\nRadiyah, from Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, has a condition known as microtia and was born without a properly formed left ear.\nNow she is set to get a new ear after scientists at Swansea University began using 3D printing to build human cartilage.\nHer father, Rana, said it would \"help boost her confidence\".\n\"Girls like to tie their hair up and pierce their ears and to have two matching ears will be a positive thing,\" he said.\nThe \u00a32.5m study at Swansea University will use human cells and plant-based materials to rebuild ears and noses in a lab, which they say will eliminate scarring.\nIt is hoped it will be used for future treatment of people born without body parts or who have facial scarring as a result of burns, trauma or cancer. \nRadiyah had been hoping to begin the process of getting a new ear fairly soon, but it had been delayed by the Covid pandemic.\nHer father said she started to \"lose a bit of confidence so we decided to go down the medical route\".\nHe added: \"If it wasn't for this type of technology, she would have to have a skin graft instead which would mean she'd have a big scar on her skull and also under her breast area where they would have gone to get the cartilage.\n\"So she would have been left with a lot of scarring but by developing the ear in a lab then she will be scar-free.\"\nPeople without fully developed ears or noses have told researchers they would prefer their own tissue is used for reconstruction instead of existing plastic prostheses.\nThe three-year work, in partnership with the Scar Free Foundation, is attempting to overcome this challenge by 3D printing cartilage in a laboratory.\nThis can then be used to help form a new ear or nose.\nCartilage is the main type of connective tissue in the body which provides a framework for bone structure to develop. \nA patient's stem cells will be grown on to the cartilage structure in preparation for facial reconstruction. \nThis process will also avoid the need to take cartilage from elsewhere in the body and so reduce any further scarring.\n\"Successful translation of this research programme will transform the future of surgery, removing the need to transfer tissue from one part of the body to another and avoid the associated pain and scarring,\" said Iain Whitaker, chairman of plastic surgery at the university's medical school.\nSimon Weston, who suffered severe burns to his face and body during the Falklands War, is the lead ambassador for the Scar Free Foundation.\nHe underwent a series of skin grafts but, at the time, there was not the research or capability to be able to rebuild his ears and nose.\n\"Since the age of 20 I have had to live with my scars,\" he said.\n\"In the early days this abrupt change in the course of my life caused severe psychological challenges.\n\"I am passionate about the issue of scarring and want people with these kind of visual differences to be accepted in society.\"\nHe said: \"Having a facial difference can be difficult. \n\"Often we are stared at - staring is invading someone's privacy. People with scarring are real people who just want to be treated as equals.\"\nFoundation chief executive Brendan Eley said he was \"delighted\" to work with Health and Care Research Wales to launch the \"ground-breaking\" programme at Swansea University.\n\"Giving surgeons the ability in the future to reconstruct people's faces using their own cells without the need for further scarring is revolutionary,\" he said.   \n\"This life-changing research is part of our commitment to achieve scar-free healing within a generation for the millions of people living with scarring in the UK and across the world.\""

      "text": "Isolation for fully vaccinated people in close contact with a positive Covid case is expected to end during August.\nThe Welsh government reiterated its plans after it emerged 11,417 people were told to quarantine by the NHS Covid app between 8 and 15 July.\nIt is also discussing whether further measures are needed in the NHS and other critical services.\nBut it has not joined England in backing a list of key workers that will be exempt from isolation.\nThe Welsh government said it intends to ease the restriction on isolation during the next three week review period, which begins on 7 August - but a precise date has not been set.\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said the number of people being asked to self-isolate, whether by the app or by a contact tracer, has been increasing as cases rise.\nIt is a legal requirement to isolate if told to by a contact tracer, but the same legal duty does not apply to the app.\nHowever, the Welsh government said app users should follow the instruction \"to help minimise the virus' spread\".\nWhile 11,417 were asked to isolate in Wales the week ending 14 July, 607,486 alerts were sent in England.\nThere had been 9,940 people who received an alert in Wales the week before. In the week ending 2 June, it was 457.\nMs Morgan said that case rates and contacts are not at the levels seen elsewhere in the UK.\nBut she said: \"The increase in notifications to contacts advising them to self-isolate illustrates that the NHS Covid 19 App is working effectively and doing what it is designed to do.\"\n\"In August, as part of the next 21 day review cycle, we aim to remove the requirement for people who have been fully vaccinated to self-isolate if they are a close contact of someone who has tested positive.\"\nThe review cycle begins on 7 August, when the Welsh government plans to end most of Wales' coronavirus rules.\n\"We will also consider other potential exemptions, such as for those under the age of 18,\" she wrote.\nShe added that in the next few weeks there is potential for critical services, such as the NHS and social care, to face \"additional pressures\" because of contacts self-isolating.\nThe minister said they working closely with the NHS and social care \"to agree effective mitigation\".\n\"Our regional incident management teams who are responsible for Covid prevention and response planning have also been asked to consider whether isolation poses any risks to critical services and infrastructure and advise on any possible response that may be considered necessary.\"\nPeople asked to self-isolate by contact tracers are required to isolate for ten days.\nThe Welsh Conservatives' Russell George called for a review of the app: \"We can't afford to lose public confidence and this isolation period needs to be urgently reviewed.\""

      "title": "NHS workers in England offered 3% pay rise",
      "tags": "NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nurses and other NHS workers in England have been offered a 3% pay rise by government \"in recognition of unique impact of the pandemic\" on staff.\nIt comes after heavily criticised proposals made by the Department for Health and Social Care in March said only a rise of 1% was affordable.\nAll NHS staff in Wales will be offered a 3% rise by the Welsh government.\nBut some health unions opposed the new figure saying it does not reflect the sacrifices made by staff.\nThey point out the NHS workforce has been under unprecedented pressure.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors, said the pay rise was disappointing and that junior doctors and some GPs could miss out on it altogether.\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, of the BMA, said many doctors had not taken annual leave in the past year and now \"face a gruelling year ahead with millions of patients on waiting lists, and the country in the midst of another Covid-19 wave\".\nLabour's shadow health minister Justin Madders described the new pay rise as a \"U-turn\" and called on the government to \"make our NHS and key workers feel supported and valued after all they have done for us\".\nThe rise in pay for healthcare workers follows a public sector pay freeze for 2021-22, announced by the government in November, with exceptions made for those on salaries under \u00a324,000 and NHS staff.\nThe 3% pay rise is for most NHS staff including nurses, paramedics, consultants, dentists and salaried GPs and is backdated to April 2021. \nAccording to government calculations for the average nurse, this will mean an additional \u00a31,000 a year, while many porters and cleaners will receive around \u00a3540.\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"NHS staff are rightly receiving a pay rise this year despite the wider public sector pay pause, in recognition of their extraordinary efforts. \n\"We will back the NHS as we focus our efforts on getting through this pandemic and tackling the backlog of other health problems that has built up.\"\nNHS pay rises are negotiated by independent pay-review bodies that look at evidence from a range of groups before making recommendations to the government.\nThe pay rise does not include doctors and dentists in training who have their own separate, multi-year contracts. \nIt was a day of frustration for health unions and their members.  \nThere was a widespread expectation that the details would be revealed in a health minister's statement to the Commons at lunchtime.  \nBut MPs were told the government was still considering pay review body recommendations. \nThen the announcement came at 18:00 BST, suggesting a frantic afternoon finalising the deal with the prime minister, chancellor, and health secretary all self-isolating.  \nUnion reaction has been varied with one group acknowledging ministers had made a significant step up from the original 1% offer. \nOthers though said the 3% on the table was insufficient recognition of the huge effort of NHS staff during the pandemic.\nThe details will be put to union members in the next few weeks and it will be hard to predict the response at a time when pressure on the health service is intensifying because of another Covid surge.\nMembers of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) gathered in Westminster ahead of the announcement with placards and banners demanding a 12.5% pay increase.\nOne of those demonstrating, Kafeelat Adekunle, 55, a community matron with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London, described the pay rise as \"mad\".\n\"I'm not happy,\" she told the PA news agency. \"They're not listening, that's the whole problem. This is just to try and stop us from doing industrial action, just to keep us quiet, keep us shushed.\"\nAmy Fancourt, an A&E nurse and RCN member, told the BBC: \"Morale is extremely low, there's a lot of people leaving the NHS and there's a lot of people leaving the health sector more widely.\n\"And I think that is a direct consequence of years of being undervalued, on top of the extra pressure we faced during the pandemic.\"\nUnison general secretary Christina McAnea said the increase, though an improvement on the initial offer, fell short of what NHS staff deserved. \n\"The government has failed to show staff just how valued they are to us all,\" she said, warning some staff may now leave the health service.\nUnite national officer for health, Colenzo Jarrett-Thorpe, described the 3% offer as \"small step forward on the insulting 1% the government offered in March\".\n\"However, this recommendation in no way recognises the 19% drop in real earnings that many NHS workers have endured in the last decade, nor the immense sacrifices that health staff have and are continuing to make as Covid infection rates rapidly rise again.\"\nRCN chief executive Pat Cullen said the announcement was \"light on detail\" and that nursing staff would \"remain dignified in responding to what will be a bitter blow to many\".\n\"But the profession will not take this lying down,\" she warned.\nMike Henley, a member of the consultants committee, British Medical Association, told the BBC: \"We're disappointed. We wanted more than 5% to make up for our one-third pay loss since 2008, so 3% is a long way below that.\"\nIn making the final decisions on pay the government will have factored in the impact of the pandemic on both the economy and the NHS.\nCurrently almost half the NHS's budget goes on staffing costs - a total of \u00a356.1bn.\nIn theory, the pay-review bodies make recommendations for NHS staff across the UK - but it is up to the individual UK nations to decide whether to accept them.\nIn Wales, Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the 3% rise \"recognises the dedication and commitment of hardworking NHS staff\".\nIn Scotland, most NHS staff have already been offered a 4% pay rise (backdated to December 2020). This follows a one-off Covid payment for health and social care staff of \u00a3500."

      "tags": "Companies,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,UK economy,Marks & Spencer",
      "text": "Marks & Spencer has warned it is already cutting Christmas products in Northern Ireland due to concerns over forthcoming post-Brexit customs checks.\nChairman Archie Norman told Radio Four's Today Programme the changes could mean higher prices and less choice for Northern Ireland customers.\nMr Norman said current \"pointless\" checks with the Republic of Ireland were \"threatening\" to its business.\nHe called for a \"common sense approach to enforcement.\"\nThe UK is expected later to warn the EU it is prepared to unilaterally override the Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland if a simplified agreement cannot be reached.\nRight now, supermarkets who send products there from Great Britain face only light-touch checks, under a so-called \"grace period\" which delayed some of the new processes. That runs out at the end of September. \nThe Northern Ireland Protocol helps prevent the need for checks on the island of Ireland's internal border.\nBut in the first warning from a major retailer on the scale of the potential problems, former Conservative party MP Mr Norman said once light-touch export checks end, there will be \"gaps on the shelves\".\n\"This Christmas, I can tell you already, we're having to make decisions to delist product for Northern Ireland because it's simply not worth the risk of trying to get it through,\" he said.\n\"We've already made that decision. We're waiting to see how serious it's going to be but if it's anything like southern Ireland (the Republic of Ireland), and at the moment it's set to be, then it's going to be very, very serious for customers.\"\nMarks and Spencer is a major employer in Ireland, with more than 4,000 staff.\nIn a letter to Brexit minister Lord Frost, Mr Norman said the current EU customs arrangements were \"totally unsuited and were never designed for a modern fresh food supply chain between closely intertwined trading partners\".\n\"There is no other outcome for consumers in Northern Ireland in the end other than higher prices, given the inflationary pressures being put on to retailers by the regulatory regime,\" Mr Norman wrote.\n\"Being able to keep the show on the road, let alone growing, is going to be very challenging,\" he added.\nMr Norman told the BBC that \"pettifogging enforcement\" of the rules required M&S to employ 14 full-time vets, \"simply ticking boxes and filling out forms\", in order to certify its products.\n\"Sandwiches typically require three veterinary certificates to get through,\" he said.\nBecause of the way the system worked, M&S had had to give up exporting half its sandwich range to Ireland, he said.\nIf forms were filled in incorrectly, that meant delays, with everything on paper and nothing digital, Mr Norman said.\n\"If one page is blue instead of black typeface, the entire wagon is turned away,\" he added.\nMr Norman said that if the same regime was replicated in Northern Ireland at the end of September, it would be \"incendiary\" for the public there.\nMr Norman said M&S was one of the largest UK-based retailers operating in Ireland as a whole and played \"a disproportionate role\" in Northern Ireland. \n\"Our market share in Northern Ireland is almost double our share on the UK mainland. In part, this reflects our history as the only major UK retailer that committed to trade and invest continuously through the Troubles,\" he said.\n\"Our commitment and involvement with the people and communities of Northern Ireland remains strong. We are also a major employer and investor with over 4,000 people employed directly by M&S and many more in our supply chain.\"\nHe added that last year, M&S invested more than \u00a310m in the business in Northern Ireland.\nHowever, the issues raised by the current customs arrangements, in which Northern Ireland remains part of the EU Single Market while the rest of the UK has left, were \"very threatening to our business\", he said.\nIreland's European affairs minister Thomas Byrne said it was willing to discuss \"any creative solutions\".\n\"But we have to recognise as well that Britain decided itself to leave the single market of the European Union, to apply trade rules, to apply red tape to its goods that are leaving Britain, to goods that are coming into Britain,\" he added.\nThe EU has said a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement for Northern Ireland, in which the UK continues to follow EU agri-food rules, could be a solution, but it has been rejected by the UK.\nIn his letter, Mr Norman said he understood why the UK government was \"not favourably disposed\" to this solution, although he added that it was \"by far the best way of delivering a smooth trade flow\".\nRegardless of this, he added, many problems could be solved by a willingness to overlook \"trivial\" errors in paperwork and efforts to set up a \"trusted trader\" scheme.\n\"Any scheme should start on the basis that we are prepared to follow EU standards for products going to Northern Ireland,\" he said.\n\"The debate is not about meeting standards, this is about what we are required to do to show we are compliant.\"\nNumber 10 said Mr Norman's letter was a \"stark warning\" of \"the fundamental problems with the Protocol\".\n\"That is why we need to urgently tackle these issues, to ensure there is minimal disruption to people's lives in Northern Ireland, as the Protocol itself intended,\" it added.\nIt plans to set out details later on its approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe sort of products M&S is considering taking off the list for Northern Ireland this Christmas are ones containing a lot of different ingredients. For example, special occasion food like pies or pates, which people might order for a celebration. \nToday, the company's chairman wants to send a message that the way post-Brexit rules on trade with EU countries have been implemented is making it extremely difficult to get products over to the Republic of Ireland, forcing the retailer to cut back the range it sells there. \nAnd he fears Northern Ireland is heading the same way.\nIt won't be a co-incidence that Archie Norman's intervention comes just before we expect to hear more on the government's proposals. He presents an argument for introducing less disruptive trade processes after the grace periods expire.  \nWhether the EU will accept that is a whole other question."

      "tags": "GMB,Nursing,NHS Wales,NHS,Royal College of Nursing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Unions representing nurses in Wales say strike action is being considered in response to a 3% pay rise offer. \nThe GMB union said it was balloting with a clear recommendation to reject the offer and take industrial action.\nRCN Wales, which has argued for a 12.5% increase, said it was \"bitterly disappointed\" with the pay award from the Welsh government, which matches England's offer to NHS staff.\nEluned Morgan said she would be \"very disappointed\" if strikes took place.\n\"I think that now is not the right time for industrial action I'm afraid,\" she said.\n\"We are under immense pressure. We know that there are a lot of people waiting for to be seen on waiting lists, and we need to consider them as well when we're making these decisions.\"\nIt follows a similar announcement in England of a 3% pay rise for nurses and other NHS workers, while Scotland offered 4% in March.\nNurse Jackie Davies said colleagues were discussing striking for the first time in her career.\n\"For the first time in my 36 years, I've had nurses talking about striking and saying things like when are we going to walk out, not if,\" she said.\n\"I joined the RCN in particular because the RCN had a no-strike policy - and we're a profession, and we're never going to walk out on our patients.\n\"There was that trust and respect that we would be regarded fairly, and treated fairly. But I can look at my salary, and my salary has hardly moved in the last nine years, because we've had no pay raises for seven years.\"\nMs Davies, who works in Swansea and is the RCN's trade union committee member for Wales, said the union will consult with members and ask what action they would like to take.\n\"And I'll be putting a tick next to that box to say yes [to strike], and I, honest to God, since I started this in 1985 I never thought that I would be putting a tick next to a box like that,\" she said.\nMatthew Tovey, who qualified as a nurse during the pandemic, said every healthcare worker had dealt with the strain of the pandemic.\n\"We've all had to deal with Covid within our own wards, I think every healthcare worker has had to deal with Covid whether the cleaner, porter, support workers to staff nurses,\" he said.\n\"It was already under-resourced, understaffed and underfunded but Covid just accelerated the staff shortages, the staff morale, burnout, they've just exacerbated it.\n\"We're working at a 20% pay deficit from 2010... I'm hoping the government is just going to restore our pay... that's the least they can do, nurses are leaving in droves, we just want to be paid fairly.\"\nMr Tovey, from Merthyr Tydfil, said the public and politicians had clapped for NHS workers every week at the beginning of the pandemic, but had not fairly rewarded them.\n\"It's pathetic, pitiful and poor, after all we've been through - we saved Boris's life yet we've had nothing. Claps don't pay the bills,\" he said.\n\"There's real concerns and people are leaving the profession, the pressure is just too much. We're qualified people with responsibility, we're working the jobs of two or three people, we need to be paid fairly.\n\"We would only go to industrial action because we are adamant we need to make the change for patient safety.\n\"We need qualified and experienced people when people are admitted to A&E. When they go to wards, there are a lot of junior people at the moment but we need people to teach them, we need those experienced nurses.\"\nThe RCN's Ms Whyley said 12.5% was \"absolutely what we deserve\".\n\"We've got a really angry workforce who do not think this this award is sufficient,\" she said.\n\"I'm going to see what they want to do and when we've had that opportunity, we'll come back with our plan.\n\"We've done our homework, we've looked at the economic data, we've looked at the data from other professions and benchmarking and we can see that over the last 10 years, our members have significantly fallen behind other groups and their pay.\"\nPaul Gage, GMB health lead for Wales said: \"Let's face it, this is a slap in the face for Welsh NHS and social care staff.\n\"Everybody says that our NHS staff deserve better after what they did for us over the last 18 months. \n\"Well, it's time to do something about it.\n\"We'll be balloting our members with a clear recommendation for rejection and for industrial action.\"\nAnd TUC general secretary Shavanah Taj said: \"It simply doesn't recognise their dedication, commitment and contribution.\"\nThe increase will be backdated to April 2021, and follows a recommendation by NHS pay bodies.\nThe Welsh Conservatives welcomed the announcement, but Plaid Cymru said there is a risk workers will feel \"let down\" - especially as workers in Scotland are receiving 4%.\nAsked why Wales couldn't meet the Scottish government's offer of 4%, Ms Morgan said ministers were \"restricted by the amount of funding that we get from the UK Conservative government\" but she said it was \"important\" for the pay recommendations to be respected."

      "tags": "Tokyo",
      "text": "The show director of the Olympics opening ceremony has been dismissed, one day before the event is due to be held.\nFootage of Kentaro Kobayashi from the 1990s recently emerged in which he appears to make jokes about the Holocaust.\nJapan's Olympic chief Seiko Hashimoto said the video ridiculed \"painful facts of history\".\nThe dismissal is the latest in a string of scandals to hit the Games.\nSince the start of the year, three other organisers have been forced to step down from Tokyo 2020 - and the games have already been postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThis latest scandal has seen former comedian Mr Kobayashi strongly criticised for a sketch he performed 23 years ago, in which he and another comedian pretend to be children's entertainers.\nIn the sketch Mr Kobayashi turns to his colleague, referring to some paper dolls, saying they are \"the ones from that time you said 'let's play the Holocaust'\", according to AFP news agency.\nJapanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga described the comments as \"outrageous and unacceptable\".\nMeanwhile Rabbi Abraham Cooper, of the US-based Holocaust research body Simon Wiesenthal Center, said: \"Any person, no matter how creative, does not have the right to mock the victims of the Nazi genocide.\" \nMr Kobayashi himself has issued a statement responding to his dismissal.\n\"Entertainment should not make people feel uncomfortable. I understand that my stupid choice of words at that time was wrong, and I regret it,\" it said.\nOlympics chief Seiko Hashimoto said she was not aware of the sketch before Mr Kobayashi's appointment, and apologised for \"causing concern to those involved in the Olympics, to the citizens of Tokyo and the Japanese public\".\nDespite the last-minute change of leadership, Japan's prime minister said the event should proceed as planned - kicking off two weeks of competitive events.\nBut since Mr Kobayashi's removal, organisers are reassessing plans for ceremony. \nTo minimise the risk of a Covid outbreak, the event will already be a comparatively subdued affair, with only 950 people in attendance. Spectators have also been barred from most Olympic events.\nThe head of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Committee admitted this week that he had not ruled out cancellation, even at this late stage.\nMounting scandals have done little to stop unease about the Games. A recent poll found some 55% of people in Japan were opposed to holding the Games, amid fears it could become a coronavirus super-spreader event, Reuters news agency reported. \nOrganisers are also dealing with rising Covid case numbers across Japan - a country where only a third of the population have been vaccinated.\nDozens of people involved in the Games - including officials and athletes - have tested positive, and a state of emergency has been declared for the duration of the sporting event.\nHowever, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus congratulated organisers on Wednesday for having so far \"done your best\", telling them a \"zero risk\" Games was not possible.\n\"The mark of success in the coming fortnight is not zero cases,\" he added. \"The mark of success is making sure that any cases are identified, isolated, traced and cared for as quickly as possible.\"\nThe first events of Tokyo 2020 have already begun, with the hosts Japan winning their softball match on Wednesday."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThe number of people who received self-isolation alerts from the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales last week soared to more than 600,000. Some petrol station supplies have been hit, police forces are warning of staffing shortages and some bins are going uncollected in some areas. Advisory notifications - or \"pings\" - tell close contacts of positive cases to stay home for up to 10 days. \nAs the \"pingdemic\" continues, supermarkets are moving quickly to ease concerns over empty shelves. The Co-op said it was \"running low on some products\", while Iceland said shops might have to be shut. Sainsbury's said it \"might not always\" have the exact products people wanted, but downplayed fears of shortages saying the problem was not widespread. Iceland also urged shoppers not to panic buy, saying it was not necessary.\nThe proportion of people aged 20 to 29 testing positive for Covid in England has hit record levels, officials say. Public Health England's figures show, in the last week, 1,155 people in their 20s tested positive for every 100,000 in the population. Experts say this is the highest rate of cases in any age group since mass-testing began and urge everyone in this group to get both jabs.\nChina has rejected the next stage of a World Health Organization (WHO) plan to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. The WHO wants to audit laboratories in the area the virus was first identified. It follows the conclusion of a first phase that suggested it was \"very unlikely\" the virus emerged from a lab - though the theory has endured.\nThe number of young people with eating disorders in England ending up in hospital has risen during the pandemic, a BBC investigation finds. Data obtained from NHS Digital showed the number of under-20s admitted over the past year topped 3,200 - nearly 50% higher than in 2019-20. The numbers are so high that hospitals are now warning they are running out of beds to care for these patients.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Data on these species is being shared to prevent stocks becoming depleted.\nBut the EU and UK also agreed to allow each other's boats to catch species not covered by quotas in quantities based on historic averages, until June 2026.\nStatistics on these \"non-quota\" fish - which used to be collected and shared by the EU under the Common Fisheries Policy - are not being shared in full, despite an agreement to do so.\nThe two sides are hoping to hammer out an agreement to resume full data sharing at a new committee.\nLabour said the government was having to \"start from scratch\" in gathering the data, while the fishing industry has expressed concern that EU boats were catching large amounts of non-quota species, particularly in the English Channel.\nLabour's shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said a UK-EU data-sharing arrangement should have been in place when the post-Brexit trade agreement came into force in January.\nHe told MPs: \"The fishing industry knows that the government has failed to negotiate real-terms quota data with the European Union.\"\nMr Pollard added that the government had \"lost control of our waters\" and was \"badly letting down\" the British fishing industry.\nStocks not covered by quotas, including red mullet, squid and most commercial shellfish, are particularly important to smaller UK vessels fishing close to the shoreline.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice told MPs: \"The government has required all foreign vessels, including EU vessels, to have a licence to fish in our waters.\n\"That sets certain conditions. We have access to vessel-monitoring data so that we can track the precise location of all of those vessels.\" \nHe added: \"We are also working on methodologies now, so they have to declare their catch when they leave our waters and enter our waters, and that will give us the data that [Mr Pollard] suggests we need.\" \nMr Eustice also said the government had secured total fishing \"opportunities\" for UK fleets of 628,000 tonnes for 2021 - up around 55,000 tonnes on last year."

They already have the infrastructure in place to do the testing at those sites.\"\nHowever, on Friday afternoon a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesman confirmed to the BBC that testing has not yet started.\n\"No sites are running yet, but we expect to be able to offer daily contact testing to some priority organisations by the end of the day on Monday 26 July and we will support them to mobilise as quickly as possible,\" he said. \nHe added that so far, Defra had contacted 10 supermarkets and that Test & Trace would continue to contact all the organisations identified for this scheme over the weekend and early next week.\nThe move comes after the high number of retail staff self-isolating affected the availability of some products.\nIceland welcomed the change, but said it wouldn't solve the issue of staff shortages in supermarkets themselves.\n\"The food supply chain only works if teams are in place to support at each stage - there's no point in fixing the manufacturing and logistics issues if there is no one to put products on the shelves, serve customers at the till and deliver to their homes,\" said Iceland boss Richard Walker.\nInitially, 15 supermarket depots will be involved, followed by 150 depots later on next week. Up to 500 sites will take part in total, but the new rules will not apply to supermarket store staff. \nIt will mean workers who are alerted by the app or contacted by NHS Test and Trace will be able to continue working if they test negative, whether or not they are vaccinated.\nKrissy Fremont is the HR manager for Birchall Foodservice, a wholesaler based in Burnley, Lancashire, that delivers to schools, hospices, care homes, restaurants, hotels and cafes.\nShe says there is still confusion as to whether her firm is on the exemptions list and when they can start on-site daily contact testing - instead of staff members having to self-isolate. \n\"We're struggling left, right and centre in all departments, but this last week has been the toughest with people having to self-isolate with pinging from the app or children having to self-isolate from school,\" she told the BBC.\n\"We've had 14 people off in the last week due to Covid and only one of them has been a positive case.\"\nShe says her customers cannot be left without food because many are in vulnerable situations, so by hook or by crook the food deliveries must go out. \n\"So we've had directors going out delivering, we've had to buy extra vans so people like myself can go out delivering.... the management team is all hands on deck,\" she said. \n\"We can't fail our customers, they've stood by us and we have to get our orders out.\"\nThe scheme will run until 16 August when the plan is for the rules to change so that double jabbed people and under-18s will no longer have to self isolate if they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. \nM&S said it was working with the government to identify the key sites it wanted to take part in the daily contact testing scheme. \nBut it said more needed to be done to \"mitigate the impact on wider store operations for all food retailers and we would like the bring forward of the 16 August date so that those who are fully vaccinated or who have a negative test are not forced to quarantine when they are contacted by track and trace\". \nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast shop staff had been excluded from the scheme because their inclusion would have been a \"really significant undertaking\". \n\"You're talking then thousands of different shops and many more people and we still want to maintain the test, trace and isolate system.\"\nHowever, he added that the government would keep the policy \"under review, but we think this is a sensible first step\".  \n\"We're never going to take risks with our food supply chain,\" he added.\nThe government's move comes as supermarkets said the supply of some products was being affected by the \"pingdemic\" keeping staff away from work.\nA record 618,903 people were told to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app between 8 and 15 July in England and Wales. \nWhile some retailers said they may have to close stores, they played down fears of food shortages, saying the problems were not widespread.\nHelen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said \"disruption is limited at the moment\", but it was vital that the government rolled out the scheme as fast as possible and was prepared to take further action if necessary.\nSeparately, the government outlined plans to allow other key industries in England to deploy daily Covid testing instead of self-isolation for a limited number of essential workers. In this case, the scheme will only apply to workers who are fully vaccinated.\nThis scheme covers sectors including transport, emergency services, border control, energy, digital infrastructure, waste, the water industry, essential defence outputs and local government. \nThe policy applies only to workers named on a list kept updated by officials - it is not a blanket exemption for all employees in a sector. \nHannah Essex, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that while the announcement would be a relief to some businesses, \"it will leave many more still facing critical staff shortages and lost revenue as the number of people being asked to isolate remains high\".\nCBI director general Tony Danker agreed, warning: \"The current approach to self-isolation is closing down the economy, rather than opening it up.\"\nBusinesses have already exhausted contingency plans to get in extra staff and are \"at risk of grinding to a halt in the next few weeks\", he added.\nPhil Langslow, trading director at Cheshire-based County Milk Products, which provides dairy products to the likes of Nestle and Kellogg's, said the government move was \"a step in the right direction\".\n\"People having to isolate meant that a number of our suppliers, the service providers that are doing the transport for us, have just said they cannot cope. Roughly half of the deliveries that we would expect to be done are not being done routinely and we're having to scramble to actually get product to its destination on time.\n\"If you think of the food chain as just that - as a chain, and like any chain, you're only as good as the weakest link - if you cannot get your goods to the market, then you've got a problem,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\nScotland has also launched a system of exemptions from self-isolation, covering workers in sectors such as health and social care.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said daily testing of food industry staff would \"minimise the disruption caused by rising cases in the coming weeks, while ensuring workers are not put at risk\".

      "text": "The UK has unveiled a new set of demands to redraw the post-Brexit trading arrangements it agreed with the EU for Northern Ireland.\nThe government said border checks on goods from Great Britain it signed up to in the 2019 Brexit divorce deal had proved unsustainable. \nBrexit Minister Lord Frost said they risked harming business, and were damaging the \"fabric\" of the UK.\nThe EU said it would not agree to renegotiate the terms of the 2019 deal. \nThe checks are included in the Northern Ireland Protocol, a section of the Brexit deal designed to avoid border checks on the island of Ireland.\nLord Frost called on the EU to look on the UK's proposals with \"fresh eyes,\" adding: \"We cannot go on as we are.\"\nHowever, he announced the UK would not be triggering Article 16 of the protocol - which would allow it to suspend parts of the Brexit deal - before talks with Brussels. \nHe added that the government believed using it was justifiable, but said: \"Nevertheless, we have concluded that it is not the right moment to do so.\"\nLord Frost told the House of Lords there was a \"growing sense in Northern Ireland we have not found the right balance, seen in an ongoing febrile political climate, protests and regrettable instances of occasional disorder\".\nHe also called on the EU to agree a \"standstill period\" to prevent a ban on sending chilled meat products such as sausages from Great Britain coming into force in September, when the full terms of the deal kick in.\nHe later told reporters it was \"perfectly normal to change treaties in the light of experience, and it happens all the time\".\nIn a 28-page document, the UK government suggested changes to:\nThe protocol was agreed to prevent the return of a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, as both the UK and EU want to prevent any return to the Troubles, which lasted 30 years and cost more than 3,500 lives.\nUnder its terms, Northern Ireland effectively remains part of the EU's single market for goods, meaning it complies with standards set by Brussels.\nThe biggest practical difficulty, in trade terms, concerns the movement of food from Britain to Northern Ireland, which could then be transported into the EU via the Irish land border.\nThe prime minister's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the protocol had been a \"fudge\".\nBoth sides had wanted to \"sign up to something that was not what either side really wanted and which punted difficult questions into the future to figure out later\", he added.\nEuropean Commission Vice-President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the EU was willing to \"seek creative solutions within the framework of the protocol\" to ease border issues. \nBut he added the 27-member union would not agree to a \"renegotiation\" of the Brexit deal.\n\"Respecting international legal obligations is of paramount importance,\" he added. \nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: \"We welcome the acceptance from the government that the protocol is not working, that it is causing real harm to our economy in Northern Ireland and it is simply not sustainable.\"\nHe called the UK government's statement - and its publication of a command paper describing its demands - an \"important first step\".\nHowever, Sinn Fein Brexit spokesperson Declan Kearney called on the UK government to \"stop the evasion\" and \"get on\" with implementing the deal it agreed.\n\"It is not acceptable for the Tories to adopt an a la carte approach towards the protocol, to rewrite history, and now attempt a renegotiation,\" he added. \nIndustry group Manufacturing NI said the UK's proposals would create \"confusion and uncertainty for business\" and were likely to \"create conflict with the EU\".\nIt called on the EU to \"go further to ensure the UK's market works for business and consumers in Northern Ireland\".\n\"Both parties owe it to the people in Northern Ireland to skip the drama and get on with dialogue and decision making,\" the body added. \nFor Labour, Brexit spokeswoman Baroness Chapman urged the government to \"fix the problems the prime minister created\".\n\"Communities are tired of these games and the political stalemate,\" she added."

      "tags": "Croydon,London transport",
      "text": "A tram crash which killed seven people in Croydon was an accident, an inquest jury has found.\nMore than 50 people were injured when the tram tipped over and spun off the tracks near Sandilands tram stop in south London, early on 9 November 2016.\nThe tram was travelling more than three times faster than a speed limit.\nSpeaking after the verdict, the mother of one of the victims said the families were \"bitterly disappointed\" and that justice had not been done.\nThe inquest heard that the tram went into a very tight corner, just before the tram stop, at 73km/h (45mph). The speed limit was 20km/h (12mph).\nThe crash resulted in the deaths of Dane Chinnery, 19, Philip Logan, 52, Philip Seary, 57, Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, and Robert Huxley, 63, all from New Addington, and Mark Smith, 35, and Donald Collett, 62, from Croydon.\nFamily members sat in the public gallery at Croydon Town Hall to hear the verdict, which came after more than nine days of deliberations.\nThe foreman of the jury said: \"The tram driver became disorientated, which caused loss of awareness in his surroundings, probably due to a lack of sleep, as a result of which the driver failed to brake in time and drove his tram towards a tight curve at excessive speed.\n\"The tram left the rails and overturned on to its right side, as a result of which the deceased [were] ejected from the tram and killed.\" \nIt can now be reported that south London senior coroner Sarah Ormond-Walshe refused to call a number of people who the victims' families wanted to give evidence about alleged safety failings.\nThose potential witnesses included senior managers of operator Tram Operations Ltd (TOL) - a subsidiary of FirstGroup - and Transport for London (TfL), plus other experts.\nThe families said they felt \"justice had been suffocated\".\nMany think that the Croydon tram crash is the forgotten tragedy - it happened on the day Donald Trump was elected president of the US. \nToday, the families of those who died were visibly upset and angry at the jury's verdict. \nOutside court in tears they addressed the media. Many do not understand why witnesses from TfL and the tram operators or drivers on that line were not called as witnesses. One told me the whole process was a shambles.\nWhile Mr Trump has moved into and out of office, the families are still waiting for answers and justice. \nJean Smith, 64, mother of Mark Smith, said she was disappointed the inquest did not hear from TfL or the driver of the tram that crashed.\n\"I am bitterly disappointed as justice has not been done today. It has been a total farce as we have only heard half of the evidence and no-one who could potentially have been responsible for the crash has been called as a witness.\n\"It's morally wrong that we haven't been able to hear from anybody from TfL, TOL or the driver during the proceedings, whatever legal precedent says. \n\"It feels like they have been able to hide from giving evidence and it simply isn't fair or just. Justice has been suffocated because of the coroner's ruling.\"\nTfL said it was the coroner's decision for it not to give evidence to the inquest jury and that its trams general manager attended throughout.\nCommissioner Andy Byford said: \"We will never forget the seven people who lost their lives in the Sandilands tragedy.\n\"We know these inquests have been deeply distressing for their families and friends and all those involved and I want to reiterate my continued support to everyone affected.\"\nHe added that TfL had made changes \"to ensure nothing like this can ever happen again\".\nThe families of the victims intend to call on the Attorney General Michael Ellis to apply to the High Court to grant a new inquest.\nDanielle Wynne, the granddaughter of Philip Logan, said: \"I'm so upset and angry. It's not an accident. Someone is to blame.\n\"We want lessons to be learned so that no other family has to go through this.\"\nRemembering the victims"

Across the country people refer to many other locations with nicknames, from buildings to parks and roundabouts to road junctions,\" he said.\nChief coastguard Pete Mizen added: \"A great deal of hard work has gone into the creation of the FINTAN database, which delivers so much local knowledge, and there is no doubt that having this extra information at our fingertips cuts down our response times and saves lives.\"\nIn 2020, the MCA was called to more than 33,000 incidents around the coast of Britain.

      "text": "The maker of powerful spy software allegedly used to hack the phones of innocent people says blaming the company is like \"criticising a car manufacturer when a drunk driver crashes\".\nNSO Group is facing international criticism, after reporters obtained a list of alleged potential targets for spyware, including activists, politicians and journalists.\nInvestigations have begun as the list, of 50,000 phone numbers, contained a small number of hacked phones.\nPegasus infects iPhones and Android devices, allowing operators to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones and cameras.\nThe Israeli company says its software is intended for use against criminals and terrorists and made available to only military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies from countries with good human-rights records.\nBut a consortium of news organisations, led by French media outlet Forbidden Stories, has published dozens of stories based around the list, including allegations French President Emmanuel Macron's number was on it and may have been targeted. \nNSO Group said it had been told the list had been hacked from its Cyprus servers\nBut a company spokesman told BBC News: \"Firstly, we don't have servers in Cyprus. \n\"And secondly, we don't have any data of our customers in our possession. \n\"And more than that, the customers are not related to each other, as each customer is separate. \n\"So there should not be a list like this at all anywhere.\"\nAnd the number of potential targets did not reflect the way Pegasus worked. \n\"It's an insane number,\" the spokesman said. \n\"Our customers have an average of 100 targets a year. \n\"Since the beginning of the company, we didn't have 50,000 targets total.\"\nMany times in recent years, the company has been accused of allowing repressive governments to hack innocent people, including those close to murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\nBut it denies this and all other allegations.\nIt does not routinely investigate who is targeted but has systems in place to vet security services it sells to, it says.\nEarlier this month, NSO Group launched its Transparency Report, saying: \"We must hold ourselves to a higher standard and act with stewardship and transparency... to ensure public safety and concern for human rights and privacy.\"\nBut on Wednesday, the spokesman said: \"If I am the manufacturer of a car and now you take the car and you are driving drunken and you hit somebody, you do not go to the car manufacturer, you go to the driver. \n\"We are sending the system to governments, we get all the correct accreditation and do it all legally. \n\"You know, if a customer decides to misuse the system, he will not be a customer anymore. \n\"But all the allegations and all the finger-pointing should be at the customer.\"\nOf the people whose numbers are on the list, 67 agreed to give Forbidden Stories their phones for forensic analysis. \nAnd this research, by Amnesty International Security Labs, reportedly found evidence of potential targeting by Pegasus on 37 of those.\nBut NSO Group said it had no knowledge of how some phones on the list contained remnants of spyware. \nIt could be \"a coincidence\", the spokesman said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,London Heathrow Airport,Hotels,Sexual harassment,G4S",
      "text": "Women quarantining in UK hotels will now have female guards, when possible, after allegations of sexual harassment.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care made the change after a BBC report in which women said one male guard had mimed having sex in a lift, and another had asked for a hug.\nIf female guards are unavailable, women should be escorted by two male guards.\nSixteen women have reported harassment to the BBC and some say complaints have been ignored or disbelieved.\nSarah, a 23-year-old medical student from Manchester who says she was taken by a guard on a terrifying walk along deserted hotel corridors when she was quarantining in the Radisson Red Heathrow in April, welcomes the move to provide female guards for lone female travellers.\nBut she is critical of the suggestion to provide two male guards when female guards are not available - \"with each guard chaperoning the other to ensure appropriate behaviour,\" as the DHSC puts it.\nIn her case, the guard she was expecting to take her on an exercise break via the nearest lift grabbed her by the arm, asked if she had a boyfriend, and then showed her to a group of other guards, who spoke together in a foreign language and laughed at her, she says.\n\"Personally I would find two male guards more intimidating than just one lone guard,\" she says. \"A group of male guards were talking about me when they clearly saw one male guard was being inappropriate with me. I don't think it ensures the safety of women, rather it increases possible risk.\"\nAll of the women we have spoken to say they saw very few female guards in quarantine hotels. G4S told the BBC: \"The proportion of women to men in security officer roles at quarantine hotels is typical of the UK security industry and we are working to attract more women to the role.\"\nIn other changes, the DHSC says all guards will now be given additional training on how to behave with vulnerable guests \"with more focused attention on the needs of lone female guests\". It did not respond to a question about what the training consisted of or how long it lasted.\nWhat are the rules for travelling to green, amber and red-list countries?\nThe DHSC also says there is now a dedicated complaints team for quarantine hotels, with a clear process in place for reporting problems.\nAt the time of our first story on sexual harassment allegations in quarantine hotels, published on 26 June, the hotels said complaints about guards were a matter for the DHSC, which pays security companies to enforce quarantine rules in the hotels. The DHSC, however, said it expected hotels to investigate guests' complaints.\nNow hotels report concerns to the DHSC Managed Quarantine Service Complaints Team, which then investigates with the co-operation of the security companies.\n\"We are doing our upmost to ensure every person in managed quarantine gets the support they need and we're urgently working to investigate complaints of this nature,\" a DHSC spokesperson said.\nIn June, we spoke to four women who say they were sexually harassed in quarantine hotels after flying back from countries on the UK's Covid red list.\nWe have since been in contact with 12 more, including one who says she was harassed by one of the many paramedics hired by the government to work in the hotels. The cases include:\nAll of these 12 women say they are dissatisfied with the way their complaints were handled, including two who have received a response from the new DHSC complaints team. A number, including Sarah, said they had received no written response at all.\nBrittany Dodds, 26, received 13 Facebook messages from a guard on the second day of her quarantine in the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel at Heathrow in May. She had ignored his friend request and sent no replies.\nA South African lawyer, Brittany says she didn't confront him or complain, because she didn't want to \"possibly provoke him or cause a situation whereby he would find a reason to actually do something\".\nOn her fourth full day in quarantine, the guard sent a message, \"This evening I'll come.\" She says she barricaded herself in with her bags as he knocked repeatedly on her door.\nThe next day, when Brittany asked a different guard to escort her back to her room, the first guard seemed offended, she says, and knocked on her door, complaining loudly.\n\"At this point I was shaking and had no words because I knew that he was now following me,\" Brittany says. She didn't leave her room again until the 10 nights of her quarantine were over.\nIt was only once she had left that Brittany felt safe enough to complain and had a video call with Darren Carter, head of safety, security and sustainability for Edwardian Hotels, who asked her why she hadn't reported the guard to the hotel management or to the police, she says.\n\"Carter insinuated that it was because I hadn't taken any steps to protect myself that the security guard continued to do what he did, as he didn't know it was wrong.\n\"I told them that this was victim-blaming.\"\nRadisson Hotels said it could not comment on individual guests, but added it was co-operating with a DHSC investigation. \"The safety and security of our guests and staff is of the utmost importance for Radisson Hotel Group so we are taking these allegations very seriously,\" the company said.\nBrittany says she never got a reply from G4S, even though she emailed the head of security for a group of Heathrow hotels.\nA spokesperson for G4S said: \"We treat all complaints extremely seriously, report these promptly, support the Department of Health and Social Care to conduct rigorous investigations in all cases and take appropriate action if the conduct of any security officer falls below the required standard.\"\nFinally, on 19 July, Brittany received an email from the DHSC complaints team, saying that the guard had been dismissed, but adding that his messages contained \"nothing that relates to a sexual nature\". The official then repeated that Brittany could have reported the guard to the hotel or blocked the conversation \"if you was finding it stressful\".\nBrittany says that reading the email made her \"feel sick\" and that she, the victim, was once again being blamed.\nCaroline, from Nottingham, says she also had a guard who kept knocking on her door when she started quarantining on 6 June at the Crowne Plaza NEC, on her return from a trip to South Africa.\n\"He was saying, 'If there's anything you want, anything, you need to come to me. Just ask, I can help you get this stuff',\" she says.\nOn the second day, Caroline mentioned that she had not received her breakfast, so he came back with a fruit salad. He was very friendly and chatty, she says, when he escorted her to and from exercise outside.\n\"And then I was in my room trying to do my Covid tests and he kept knocking on the door again. To start with it was all right and I was like 'Yes I'm just trying to do my Covid test', and then again a knock and he'd left a note outside the door.\"\nThe note asked her to WhatsApp him. It had kisses on it, and ended: \"I think you're fit - love a lady in glasses.\"\nCaroline complained, and the head of security at the hotel - from the company, Mitie - told her that this was completely out of order. Caroline didn't see the guard again and assumed that he had been removed from the hotel. \nBut when the BBC asked Mitie to comment, the company said it had found that the handwriting and telephone number on the note didn't match those of the guard Caroline had described - or any of the other guards on shift that day. \nAsked how the company thought the note had appeared, the company said it expected high standards from security officers, all of whom were fully trained \"including on the behaviours required of them\" in quarantine hotels. We asked whether the company accepted that a guard may have more than one phone, but Mitie didn't respond.\nGuards are stationed in quarantine hotels to ensure that guests do not leave their rooms - and there are no non-quarantining guests - so other people in the hotel would have had little opportunity to leave the note.\n\"Do they think I am making it up? That I wrote the note myself?\" Caroline says. \"It's ridiculous.\"\nA spokesman for the Crowne Plaza NEC said the company was unable to comment because security companies were contracted by the DHSC.\nCaroline has heard nothing from the DHSC managed quarantine service complaints team.\nA 20-year-old teaching assistant, Alice says she was walking past the Pentahotel in Reading on 3 June when G4S guards milling around outside it started wolf-whistling and cat-calling.\nShe wrote to the hotel to complain, but received no reply for three weeks. Then on 26 June - the day we published our first story - she wrote again, and immediately received two replies. One was from the hotel manager, who said he was escalating the complaint and sending CCTV footage to the DHSC's complaints team.\nThe reply from the DHSC said the complaint was being rejected because CCTV footage showed that Alice had entered hotel premises and that guards had had to escort her out. She wrote back saying that this was incorrect - she had not passed through the metal barriers used to seal the hotel off from the street while it was operating as a quarantine hotel. The DHSC replied again saying the CCTV footage had been reviewed, and the department was sticking to its original opinion.\n\"I'm so angry - they have called me a liar, they ignored me for ages. I think it's disgusting,\" she says.\nEventually the DHSC sent Alice the CCTV video, and it showed someone else entirely. She pointed this out to them and has not heard back since.\nPenta Hotels said it was not responsible for the behaviour of guards, and the DHSC said it could not comment on individual cases.\nHarriet Wistrich of the Centre for Women's Justice said hotel quarantine was an \"incredibly oppressive situation\" for many women, particularly those travelling alone.\n\"They are effectively imprisoned and there aren't enough female guards to stop these incidents happening. Just putting on an extra male guard isn't good enough - and it's also quite oppressive.\"\nShe said the government couldn't \"privatise out\" its responsibility for the safety of these women and repeated a call she made last month for clear guidance to be given to everyone in hotel quarantine about who to contact for help if they feel unsafe.\nWest Midlands Victims' Commissioner Nicky Brennan backed the idea of giving female guards responsibility for lone women, but added: \"I'm gobsmacked that the government thinks that if a female guard is unavailable then two male guards are a good alternative. This couldn't be further from the truth and the move is both short-sighted and naive. I fear it will only exacerbate the problem.\"\nThe DHSC spokesperson said, \"Sexual harassment and abuse are abhorrent - and all allegations of this are taken extremely seriously... We will not hesitate to take immediate action to suspend staff where appropriate and report to the police if necessary.\"\nG4S said it had a \"zero-tolerance approach\" to staff who failed to treat people with respect. A spokesperson said: \"To provide additional assurance we have enhanced training, supervision and operational and safeguarding procedures. We have also established an oversight body comprising of women in senior executive roles.\"\nOne woman who is currently quarantining at a Heathrow hotel said she felt safe and the staff were friendly.\nBut she said that she had been given no information on how to make a complaint and was escorted for exercise either by a single female guard, or by a single male guard, never by two.\nAnother woman said she was asking specifically for a female guard when requesting an exercise break, and so far it seemed to be working.\nSource: Victim Support\nFollow  Sue Mitchell and Sarah McDermott on Twitter"

      "text": "Businessman Lex Greensill had a sometimes \"extraordinarily privileged\" relationship with government, a Cabinet Office report has found. \nThe report says the Australian financier's government role gave him \"a marketing platform\" for his business.\nCivil servants \"should have considered\" the conflicts of interest, it adds.\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the report had been set up as \"a classic Boris Johnson cover-up and whitewash to protect the government\".\nThe report was also attacked by the widow of Jeremy Heywood, a former top civil servant who is criticised in the report.\nLady Suzanne Heywood describe the report as a \"travesty\" that \"scapegoated\" her late husband. \nThe inquiry also criticises ex-Prime Minister David Cameron for his lobbying efforts on behalf of Greensill's company, which collapsed in March. \nReport author Nigel Boardman said Mr Cameron had \"on occasion understated the nature of his relationship with Greensill Capital\" when seeking to influence the Treasury's decisions.\nHowever, he concluded that Mr Cameron \"did not breach the current lobbying rules and his actions were not unlawful\".\nThe government ordered an inquiry when it emerged the former prime minister had lobbied ministers via text messages on behalf of the finance firm.\nAt the time, Mr Cameron - who had taken a role with Greensill in 2018 - was accused of trying to exploit private contacts with former government colleagues, for his own benefit.\nGreensill Capital specialised in supply chain financing - a technique aimed at making it easier for businesses to receive payments.\nDuring Mr Cameron's time in Downing Street, Mr Greensill worked informally for the government before being made an unpaid adviser on supply chain finance.\nMr Boardman says \"this area of public appointments is opaque and ill-defined\" but adds that this appointment appears to have been \"properly made\".\nMr Greensill was later appointed to the Economic and Development Secretariat - something Mr Boardman says raises \"significantly more questions\" than the previous role.\nHe says it came as Mr Greensill was trying to set up his supply chain financing company in the UK and adds that the banker was able to use his position in government to \"leverage his position\" with major companies. \nThe job, Mr Boardman says, enabled Mr Greensill to \"promote a product which did not, in fact, provide material benefits to government, although it could have been of benefit to his incipient business and was of immediate benefit to his former employer, Citibank\".\nHe specifically criticises former top civil servant Lord Heywood saying it \"should have been apparent... that Mr Greensill was building a supply chain business in the UK and should have considered the issue of conflicts of interest,\" the report says.\n\"It is unclear why Mr Greensill was permitted to remain an adviser to government on supply chain finance under these circumstances,\" he adds.\nMr Boardman also said Lord Heywood was \"primarily responsible\" for Mr Greensill securing a role in government.\nLord Heywood died in November 2018 and Mr Boardman says readers of the report should \"bear in mind\" that it could not include his personal explanation of the appointment.\nLady Heywood accused Mr Boardman of running \"a deeply flawed process from beginning to end, gagging representation for my late husband to facilitate his scapegoating, and glossing over the ministerial approval the then coalition government gave for Mr Greensill's appointment\".\nShe described the review as \"nothing less than a travesty\", adding: \"His absence is being exploited to distort the facts of a decade ago and divert attention from the current government's embarrassment at the collapse of Greensill Capital long after Jeremy's death.\"\nConsidering the communications between Greensill and the government, Mr Boardman says: \"It has been argued that the government's processes for managing lobbying are insufficiently transparent, that external organisations are able to exploit certain loopholes to land their messages more effectively, and that a privileged few have a disproportionate level of access to decision makers in government.\n\"I think some of these observations are justified, particularly in the context of the fact-finding work which I have done in relation to Greensill Capital's engagement with government.\"\nThe report also singles out for criticism the former top civil servant Bill Crothers, who in 2015 worked for both the government and as an adviser to Greensill.\nLater that year, he left his civil service job and in 2016 went on to become a director of Greensill.\nThe report says some of his behaviour towards government departments while working for Greensill \"was at the margins of acceptable conduct\" and notes that he had to apologise to civil servants in the Ministry of Justice for being \"too forceful\" in his lobbying efforts.\nLabour's Angela Rayner said the terms of Mr Boardman's inquiry had been limited \"to avoid a wider investigation of lobbying, privileged access and the revolving door between Whitehall and business\". \n\"The rules that are supposed to regulate lobbying are completely unfit for purpose and require radical and immediate overhaul,\" she added.\nResponding to the report, Mr Cameron said he was \"pleased that the report provides further confirmation that I broke no rules\". \n\"I have said all along that there are lessons to be learnt, and I agree on the need for more formal lines of communication.\" "

      "text": "Students wanting to study medicine at the University of Exeter are being offered free accommodation and \u00a310,000 cash if they are prepared to delay their course for a year. \nA record number of students have applied to study medicine this autumn, a rise of more than 20% on last year. \nThe number of places for medicine in England is capped by the government.\nIf students delay until 2022, that could reduce the number of places available for those applying next year. \nThe University of Exeter has written to students who have accepted an offer to study medicine starting in 2021 asking if they will delay to 2022. \nIn return it would guarantee their place next year, provide free accommodation for their first year and a cash bursary of \u00a310,000 \"to spend on preparing yourself\" at the end of October 2021. \nThe accommodation in the university's Rowancroft accommodation building would normally cost \u00a36,574 for an en-suite room or \u00a37,611 for a studio flat. \nThe letter to students says the university understands this would mean \"big changes\" to their plans but their place next year would be secure, provided they get the grades specified in their offer. \nProfessor Mark Goodwin, Exeter's deputy vice chancellor, said it had seen a significant increase in students who had prioritised the university as their first choice for medicine.\n\"This is unprecedented for us, something has happened this year to make a higher proportion choose us. More students are holding us as their firm choice this year\"\nAs the numbers admitted to the course are regulated by the government, the university is asking applicants holding a firm offer to decide by 30 July if they will defer.\n\"We want to deliver a really high quality student experience, and deliver those safe and secure NHS placements so we can train the number of doctors the government asks us to train.\"\nGCSE and A-level results will be decided by teachers\nRecord numbers apply to study nursing\nMore black students sought by top science college\nPlaces to study to be a doctor are limited by the government, partly because of the large subsidy needed from public funding to meet the high cost of around \u00a3180,000 for a medical degree. \nEvery medical student also has to undertake clinical placements in the NHS in the last three years of the degree.\nSo universities are given an allocation of places which they cannot exceed.\nIt is always competitive to get a place in medical school, with around three applicants chasing each place on average. \nDr Katie Petty-Saphon from the Medical Schools Council says the increase in applications this year has made it harder for universities to judge the right number of offers. \n\"In the past the very best applicants might receive four offers which would mean they would reject - and thus free up - places at three medical schools.  \n\"This did not happen this year and so the 'conversion rate' of offers to firmly accepted places has changed, meaning that some medical schools have more acceptances than they were anticipating.\"\nShe added there are the same number of places in England this year as usual, around 7,500. \nHowever, universities are also accommodating students who had to defer after the chaos of last year's A-level grading left more than usual with the grades they needed.\n\"The government has funded 450 additional places for applicants who were required to defer last year - and so such candidates are not taking up places destined for 2021 applicants\" said Dr Petty-Saphon. \nIt is not clear if extra money would be available from the government for additional places next year,  which could mean students applying to Exeter competing for fewer places. \nWhile Exeter has written to students holding offers, other medical schools will be grappling with similar issues, albeit on a smaller scale.

      "text": "The US says it has reached a deal with Germany to prevent Russia from using its Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline as political leverage over Europe. \nThe near-complete 1,230km (764 miles) pipeline under the Baltic Sea will double Russian gas exports to Germany. \nUS official Victoria Nuland said it was \"a bad pipeline\", but said the deal envisaged sanctions against Moscow if it tried to blackmail Ukraine.\nUkraine says the Nord Stream 2 pipeline threatens its security.\nThe country has been fighting Russian-backed separatists in the east since 2014. Russia also annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv fears a full-scale Russian invasion once Nord Stream 2 is fully operational. \nUkraine also stands to lose about $3bn (\u00a32.2bn) a year in gas transit fees.\nPoland is also opposing the pipeline, which runs from Vyborg in Russia under the Baltic Sea to Lubmin in Germany. Poland says the $10bn project threatens the security of central and eastern Europe.\nRussia denies this and describes the project as commercially beneficial for all involved.\nUnder the terms of the US-German deal, Ukraine will get $50 million in green energy technology credits and a guarantee of repayment for gas transit fees it will lose by being bypassed by the pipeline through 2024, according to the Associated Press.\nIn May, US President Joe Biden's administration waived sanctions on a company building the pipeline, despite a strong opposition from Republican lawmakers.\nMr Biden's White House opposes the pipeline, but analysts say he is reluctant to risk a transatlantic rift with Germany at a time when he has been trying to reach out to European allies.\nLike its already operational twin Nord Stream, the new pipeline will have the capacity of 55bn cubic metres of gas per year to Europe."

      "text": "A pub and a restaurant have both closed due to scorching temperatures in Wales.\nThe Pipeworks Bar said the heat was \"unbearable\" for staff behind the bar at Pontyclun in Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nThe Stone Crab restaurant in the Welsh seaside resort of Saundersfoot in Pembrokeshire has also shut and said it \"cannot let our staff continue to suffer in this hot weather\". \nMonday was Wales' hottest day of 2021 as 30.9C temperatures were recorded in Cardiff amid an extreme weather alert.\nThe Met Office issued one of its new-style extreme heat weather warnings for the first time for parts of the UK, including larges parts of Wales.\nThe amber warning will be in place until Thursday, when temperatures are expected to peak and could reach 33C (91.4F) in some western areas.\nIn a Facebook statement, the Pipeworks Bar said: \"As well as being too hot outside, it's unbearable behind our bar. \n\"Everything that is keeping the drinks cold is making us even hotter,\" it said, referring to its three fridges.\n\"Plus, masks are just horrid to wear at the moment. So, it's only fair on the staff that we give them a couple of days off... We didn't ever think we would close due to sun.\"\nOwner Simon Cole said he was also thinking of the customer enjoyment when making the decision.\n\"I went there and had a pint on my day off and the pint was warm within five minutes and it wasn't very nice,\" he told BBC Wales.\nHe said as well as the fridges, he had an ice machine which pumped out hot air and there was no air conditioning. Even the outdoor area which has a pergola was \"like a greenhouse\".\nThe temperature inside the bar when he opened up had registered 40C and a bottle of spirits he picked up was hot to the touch.\n\"It's mainly just for our staff to have a break and not have to endure the heat. I think they felt relief,\" he said.\n\"We have great staff. I messaged them at the weekend and they said it was awful.\n\"It's not worth the money to have upset staff. It's [only closing] for a few days.\"\nThe Stone Crab said on Facebook it was \"with a heavy heart and with deep thought\" that they have closed until Friday due to the Met Office's extreme temperature weather warnings.\n\"We cannot in good knowledge let our staff continue to suffer in this hot weather,\" their statement said.\n\"We have already been under significant pressure whilst working due to this heat wave, and the new warnings that have come out this evening make it unsafe for our staff to work, let alone the hours that we are all working due to staff shortages in the area.\"\nUnder UK law, there is no legal right to leave work when workplaces hit a certain temperature.\nHowever under the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992, employers have a legal obligation to provide a \"reasonable\" temperature in the workplace, although that does not mean they have to provide air conditioning, for example.\nBy 14:00 BST on Tuesday, Cardiff had recorded the highest temperature in Wales at 30.2C, with Usk in Monmouthshire and Llysdinam in Powys both registering 29.3C, the Met Office said.\nThe highest temperature of the year in Wales was set on Monday in Cardiff at 30.9C, and could still be beaten on Tuesday as temperatures are still rising.\nHealth services have issued advice to the public on how to stay cool and safe in the heat.\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service declared a business continuity incident - where service is at risk of being disrupted - because of pressure on its services and asked people to think carefully before calling an ambulance.\nIt said the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, coupled with the warm weather and an influx of holidaymakers and day-trippers to Wales, meant it was facing a busy summer period.\nCardiff and Vale University Health Board said its emergency unit remained very busy and asked people not to attend unless it was life-threatening but to ring for an appointment instead.\nHywel Dafydd, consultant plastic surgeon at Morriston Hospital's Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery, warned people to be very careful in the hot weather, especially in regard to protecting children.\n\"The UV index is very high at the moment, and so the risk of getting severe damage from the sun in the form of sunburn is very, very high and it will happen very quickly,\" he told BBC Wales.\n\"My advice primarily is to stay out of the sun, particularly in the height of the sun between the hours of 11am and 3pm, and if you do have to be in the sun then protect yourself by wearing high factor sun screen such as factor 50 and cover up by wearing long-sleeved light cotton or linen-type shirts, wear a wide-brimmed hat to protect your face, and sunglasses.\"\nHe said children who got a severe blistering sunburn before the age of 10 doubled their risk of getting melanoma skin cancer, which was more prevalent among people aged 16-30.\nExcess heat was also affecting transport.\nNetwork Rail said three watchmen were on the lines to monitor temperatures since early morning and had identified three places where speed restrictions were needed, including Llanbister in Powys, where trains were running at 20mph."

      "text": "Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18.\nIf they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days.\nYou must self-isolate for 10 days if you:\nYou must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with has Covid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result.\nEach UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: \nWhen people test positive for coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include:\nIf you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms.\nScotland\nFrom 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. \nInstead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test.\nEngland\nFrom 16 August, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advised to take one PCR test as soon as possible. \nAs long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action.\nWales\nSimilar changes will happen in Wales from 7 August. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not.\nNorthern Ireland\nMinisters in Northern Ireland are expected to discuss changes on 12 August. \nAny adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts.\nAnyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. \nThe NHS Covid app is available to download in England and Wales. \nIf you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a \"ping\" alert if they later test positive for Covid. \nYou need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. \nNorthern Ireland and Scotland have separate apps. \nIf you are \"pinged\" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days.\nGovernment ministers have said it is \"crucial\"  that people self-isolate when sent an alert.\nHowever, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led to many users deleting the app.\nCurrently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time.\nHowever, the app will soon only alert close contacts from the previous two days before the positive test.\nThe sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate.\nIn the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before.\nIn England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated. Sectors include energy and emergency services.\nSupermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status.\nA similar system is being launched in Scotland.\nA \u00a3500 grant is available in England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, many applications have been turned down.\nIn Scotland people can apply for the Self-Isolation Support Grant, worth \u00a3500, and there is a similar scheme in Wales. In Northern Ireland a discretionary payment is available.\nYou may also be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay, which is worth \u00a396.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme."

Past disasters such as the sinking of a ship on the Yangtze River in 2015 saw some social media posts removed in order to maintain stability and prevent anti-government sentiment.\nWith the floods in Zhengzhou, many people shared tales of horror and pleaded for help online. In response, thousands of people on social media directed their Weibo posts to emergency rescue teams so that they knew where to go. \nWhen news emerged that some trains were being stranded after rail lines had become submerged, people put together lists of each train number and the resources its passengers needed.\nSome put together text-only versions of critical contact lists, after discovering that people in some areas could not download images because heavy rains had affected internet speeds.\nPeople also helped to organise streams of information so that it was up-to-date and clear.\nAccording to local media reports, residents living near the Tielu Railway Station also delivered food and bottled water to passengers stuck in a train after a related hashtag was viewed more than 800 million times. \nWhile some focused on giving emergency rescue advice, others shared information on mental health support and personal hygiene tips. \nA hashtag related to menstruation amid the floods had more than 200 million views, as doctors and social workers reminded women to change their sanitary pads frequently to avoid the risk of infection. Others posted addresses to locations where women could collect free sanitary products.\nBut there have also been cases where posts about the floods have been censored. These are mainly from individuals requesting help, rather than people criticising the government. \nFree Weibo, a site that determines whether posts have been censored, said these posts included reports of people trapped at a school, elderly people in need of oxygen and thousands of people trapped on a campus. \nOne post asked whether authorities should be held accountable.

Data on these species is being shared to prevent stocks becoming depleted.\nBut the EU and UK also agreed to allow each other's boats to catch species not covered by quotas in quantities based on historic averages, until June 2026.\nStatistics on these \"non-quota\" fish - which used to be collected and shared by the EU under the Common Fisheries Policy - are not being shared in full, despite an agreement to do so.\nThe two sides are hoping to hammer out an agreement to resume full data sharing at a new committee.\nLabour said the government was having to \"start from scratch\" in gathering the data, while the fishing industry has expressed concern that EU boats were catching large amounts of non-quota species, particularly in the English Channel.\nLabour's shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said a UK-EU data-sharing arrangement should have been in place when the post-Brexit trade agreement came into force in January.\nHe told MPs: \"The fishing industry knows that the government has failed to negotiate real-terms quota data with the European Union.\"\nMr Pollard added that the government had \"lost control of our waters\" and was \"badly letting down\" the British fishing industry.\nStocks not covered by quotas, including red mullet, squid and most commercial shellfish, are particularly important to smaller UK vessels fishing close to the shoreline.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice told MPs: \"The government has required all foreign vessels, including EU vessels, to have a licence to fish in our waters.\n\"That sets certain conditions. We have access to vessel-monitoring data so that we can track the precise location of all of those vessels.\" \nHe added: \"We are also working on methodologies now, so they have to declare their catch when they leave our waters and enter our waters, and that will give us the data that [Mr Pollard] suggests we need.\" \nMr Eustice also said the government had secured total fishing \"opportunities\" for UK fleets of 628,000 tonnes for 2021 - up around 55,000 tonnes on last year."

      "text": "North America experienced its warmest June on record, according to the EU's Earth observation programme.\nThat will come as no surprise given the unprecedentedly high temperatures recently recorded during the heatwave that hit Canada and parts of the US.\nBut UK residents may be startled to learn that despite the rain and cloud they experienced, it was the second warmest June on record for Europe.\nIt was also the fourth warmest June ever recorded worldwide.\nCopernicus, the EU's Earth observation programme, produces its figures for world temperatures from computer-generated analyses using billions of measurements from satellites, aircraft and weather stations around the world.  \nClimate experts say the findings point to a frightening escalation in temperature extremes.  \n\"We are getting used to record high temperatures being recorded somewhere around the world every year now,\" says Prof Peter Stott of the UK Met Office.  \nHe says what meteorologists like him find shocking is not that the world is experiencing more heatwaves but that temperature records are increasingly being broken by such large margins.\nIn Canada and the north-western US, several cities recorded temperatures a full 5 degrees Celsius above previous records. \nA Siberian heatwave last year saw temperatures more than 5C above the previous record between January and June.\nA study by the Met Office on the extreme heat in the Russian region found that reaching such temperatures was almost impossible without human-caused climate change.\nIt anticipates similar results from studies of the Canadian heatwave.  \nIts initial calculations suggest the odds of the sort of temperatures experienced in Canada occurring without climate change are very low indeed, says Professor Stott.\n\"It is telling us that changes in average climate are leading to rapid escalation not just of extreme temperatures, but of extraordinarily extreme temperatures,\" he adds. \nThat is exactly what the science says we should expect, Prof Friederike Otto of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University told the BBC.\n\"Every decade the world has increased the rate of greenhouse gas emissions and that has increased the rate of warming. So, of course, heat records are being broken more frequently,\" she maintains.\nProf Otto believes the risks from the increasing number of heatwaves the world now experiences is not taken seriously enough.\nStorms and flood provide dramatic before-and-after images and cause widespread damage to property.\nHeatwaves, by contrast, do not leave a trail of destruction in their wake. Prof Otto describes them as \"silent killers\".\n\"People rarely drop dead on the street, but die quietly in their poorly insulated and un-air-conditioned homes.\"\nIndeed, how many victims these events claim is often only apparent months after the event when statisticians can calculate excess mortality.  \nProf Otto says even if we do manage to achieve the dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that many countries around the world are now committed to, we will still see more frequent and more intense heatwaves than we have today.\nShe advises that, alongside cutting carbon emissions, we should be investing in adaption and resilience to ensure our communities can withstand the higher temperatures we can expect in the future.

      "text": "Lorry driver shortages are causing temporary fuel supply issues at some of BP's petrol stations.\nThe oil firm said shortages of unleaded petrol and diesel had seen a \"handful\" of its UK sites close temporarily. \nHowever, the oil company said the \"vast majority\" of shortages were being \"resolved within a day\".\nBP said its supply chain had also been exacerbated by the closure of a distribution terminal due to staff being told to isolate last week.\n\"We are working hard with our haulier supplier to deliver fuel into sites and minimise any disruption to our customers. We apologise for any inconvenience caused,\" BP said.\n\"Our supply chain has been impacted by the industry-wide driver shortages across the UK, and was exacerbated by the temporary closure of our Hemel Hempstead fuel distribution terminal last week because of necessary Covid-19 isolations amongst staff. The terminal is now operating as normal once again.\"\nLorry drivers are currently in short supply, with the Road Haulage Association estimating a shortfall of about 60,000.\nIt said some 30,000 HGV driving tests did not take place last year because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nPreviously, a temporary extension of lorry drivers' working hours was met with backlash from the industry who said the government is applying a \"sticking plaster\" to driver shortage problems.\nBP's announcement came as retail industry body the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned supermarkets were experiencing \"minor disruption\" due to a shortage of drivers.\nSome supermarkets are understood to be suffering shortages of particular brands. But while customers may not be able to find the exact product they are after, the same product made by different brands is available.\nThe BRC called on the government to \"rapidly increase\" the number of HGV driving tests taking place.\nThe Department for Transport said it is looking to increase testing capacity.\nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC, said supermarkets were working closely with suppliers to \"ensure consumers still have access\" to the same selection of goods.\n\"Government must rapidly increase the number of HGV driving tests taking place, fill gaps by providing visas for EU HGV drivers, and also look for a longer-term solution to this issue,\" he added.\nSome stores have also reported an increase in workers having to self isolate due to being \"pinged\" by the NHS Covid app, but levels are not said to be near previous peaks in the pandemic.\nOther sectors are also experiencing staff shortages due to workers needing to isolate.\nRoyal Mail said in a \"limited number of areas\" services were being disrupted due to Covid-related absences.\nThe shortages in workers comes as the government announced firms can apply for staff to be exempt from coronavirus self-isolation rules.\nThe government has said there will be no list of critical workers exempt from isolating rules and exemptions will be \"considered on a case-by-case basis\".\nHowever, the numbers of those who will be granted exemption outside of the NHS are expected to be relatively small, and not reach the high tens of thousands.\nRod McKenzie, of the Road Haulage Association, said the government's plan was \"confusing\" and felt like \"it's been rushed\".\nHe said: \"Where do you draw the line on lorry drivers, essential workers, the people in the supply chains? Because most of the people I know in the supply chain would say 'hang on a sec, I'm an essential worker'.\"\nIn a letter to the logistics sector, government ministers said they would consult about \"the delegation of off-road manoeuvres\" as part of the HGV test, which they said would boost testing capacity.\nIt added the Department for Transport would also look to into issuing provisional licences to drive rigid and articulated lorries. \nDowning Street previously said that the first exemptions around self-isolation have been given in some critical sectors."

      "text": "The hottest day of the year has been recorded in Scotland, peaking in Dumfries and Galloway.\nTemperatures have soared across the country, including a 29.3C hot spot at Threave, near Castle Douglas.\nElsewhere, haar (or sea fog) was spotted earlier in eastern and central areas, caused by warm air passing over the cold North Sea.\nAmber warnings have been issued for extreme heat in Northern Ireland, Wales and the south east of England.\nThe Met Office warning comes with an appeal to watch out for heat exhaustion and sunburn.\nThe hot weather is expected to last until the weekend.\nThe second highest temperature was 28.4C recorded at Dunstaffnage, near Connel Bridge in Argyll and Bute, while 28C was recorded at Auchincruive in Ayrshire.\nTemperatures hit 26C in Glasgow but were cooler in the east, rising to only 19.5C at Gogarbank near Edinburgh.\nBBC Weather said the heat was triggering a few thunderstorms in Dumfries and Galloway with grey, murky skies in some eastern coastal areas and the Northern Isles. \nForecaster Kirsteen MacDonald said: \"High pressure across the UK did not really move all week.\n\"We also have had a cumulative effect, where each day of strong sunshine warms the air further, on top of the warming by descent. \n\"This is what has caused the hot weather in parts of the UK over the last few days. Temperatures will peak again tomorrow around 28C, possibly 29C. \n\"This weekend, high pressure will remain in charge across Scotland. Plenty of warm sunshine in the forecast, but temperatures will be down by quite a few degrees. Eastern coasts will continue to be plagued by haar.\"\nThe Met Office launched its new extreme heat warning system at the start of June to highlight potential widespread disruption and adverse health effects. Amber is the second-highest level in the system.\nHeatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change.\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began, and temperatures are predicted to keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to greenhouse emissions."

      "text": "The UK has unveiled a new set of demands to redraw the post-Brexit trading arrangements it agreed with the EU for Northern Ireland.\nThe government said border checks on goods from Great Britain it signed up to in the 2019 Brexit divorce deal had proved unsustainable. \nBrexit Minister Lord Frost said they risked harming business, and were damaging the \"fabric\" of the UK.\nThe EU said it would not agree to renegotiate the terms of the 2019 deal. \nThe checks are included in the Northern Ireland Protocol, a section of the Brexit deal designed to avoid border checks on the island of Ireland.\nLord Frost called on the EU to look on the UK's proposals with \"fresh eyes,\" adding: \"We cannot go on as we are.\"\nHowever, he announced the UK would not be triggering Article 16 of the protocol - which would allow it to suspend parts of the Brexit deal - before talks with Brussels. \nHe added that the government believed using it was justifiable, but said: \"Nevertheless, we have concluded that it is not the right moment to do so.\"\nLord Frost told the House of Lords there was a \"growing sense in Northern Ireland we have not found the right balance, seen in an ongoing febrile political climate, protests and regrettable instances of occasional disorder\".\nHe also called on the EU to agree a \"standstill period\" to prevent a ban on sending chilled meat products such as sausages from Great Britain coming into force in September, when the full terms of the deal kick in.\nHe later told reporters it was \"perfectly normal to change treaties in the light of experience, and it happens all the time\".\nIn a 28-page document, the UK government suggested changes to:\nThe protocol was agreed to prevent the return of a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, as both the UK and EU want to prevent any return to the Troubles, which lasted 30 years and cost more than 3,500 lives.\nUnder its terms, Northern Ireland effectively remains part of the EU's single market for goods, meaning it complies with standards set by Brussels.\nThe biggest practical difficulty, in trade terms, concerns the movement of food from Britain to Northern Ireland, which could then be transported into the EU via the Irish land border.\nThe prime minister's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the protocol had been a \"fudge\".\nBoth sides had wanted to \"sign up to something that was not what either side really wanted and which punted difficult questions into the future to figure out later\", he added.\nEuropean Commission Vice-President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the EU was willing to \"seek creative solutions within the framework of the protocol\" to ease border issues. \nBut he added the 27-member union would not agree to a \"renegotiation\" of the Brexit deal.\n\"Respecting international legal obligations is of paramount importance,\" he added. \nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: \"We welcome the acceptance from the government that the protocol is not working, that it is causing real harm to our economy in Northern Ireland and it is simply not sustainable.\"\nHe called the UK government's statement - and its publication of a command paper describing its demands - an \"important first step\".\nHowever, Sinn Fein Brexit spokesperson Declan Kearney called on the UK government to \"stop the evasion\" and \"get on\" with implementing the deal it agreed.\n\"It is not acceptable for the Tories to adopt an a la carte approach towards the protocol, to rewrite history, and now attempt a renegotiation,\" he added. \nIndustry group Manufacturing NI said the UK's proposals would create \"confusion and uncertainty for business\" and were likely to \"create conflict with the EU\".\nIt called on the EU to \"go further to ensure the UK's market works for business and consumers in Northern Ireland\".\n\"Both parties owe it to the people in Northern Ireland to skip the drama and get on with dialogue and decision making,\" the body added. \nFor Labour, Brexit spokeswoman Baroness Chapman urged the government to \"fix the problems the prime minister created\".\n\"Communities are tired of these games and the political stalemate,\" she added."

      "tags": "Tokyo,Japan,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Tokyo Olympic Games are under way, with thousands of athletes set to compete.\nOrganisers say the event can be held safely, despite calls for it to be cancelled because of Covid.\nThe 2020 Summer Olympic Games take place between 23 July and 8 August. \nThe Paralympic Games are due to run between 24 August and 5 September. \nThe Games were postponed last year because of Covid. \nThe Olympics will feature 33 sports at 339 events across 42 venues. The Paralympics will feature 22 sports at 539 events across 21 venues.\nMost events are in the Greater Tokyo area, although some football games and the marathon will take place in the northern city of Sapporo.\nJapan has had relatively low case numbers, but a new wave of infections began in April.\nAs of 21 July, there were 848,222 confirmed cases and 15,062 deaths (compared with 5.5 million cases and 128,800 deaths in the UK).\nJapan only began vaccinating in February and only 22% of its population of about 126 million is fully vaccinated.\nIn Tokyo and Osaka, the two cities hit hardest by the recent surge, authorities hope over-65s will be fully vaccinated by the end of July. \nEntry to Japan by foreigners from 159 countries - including the UK - is currently banned. \nInternational athletes and support staff are being tested every day.\nAthletes don't have to be vaccinated, though International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials expect around 80% will be.\nMore than 90 people associated with the Games have tested positive so far, including British athlete Amber Hill who has withdrawn from the women's skeet competition.\nAll spectators were banned after a state of emergency was declared in Tokyo on 8 July. It will stay in place until 22 August.\nA decision about whether Japanese spectators will be able to attend the Paralympics has not yet been made.\nTokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said she was \"sorry to those who purchased tickets\".\nThe contract between the IOC and the host city Tokyo suggests only the IOC can cancel the event.\nThe IOC is thought to make around 70% of its money from broadcast rights, and 18% from sponsorship.\nIOC president Thomas Bach said the thought of rescheduling the competition \"caused sleepless nights\". He insisted the Games must go ahead \"to give hope\" for the future.\nThe head of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also backed the competition, arguing it could show what can be done with the correct Covid safeguards.\nBut the head of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee Toshiro Muto has not ruled out cancelling the Olympic Games even at this late stage.  He said he would keep an eye on infection numbers and hold \"discussions\" if necessary.\nIf the Tokyo organisers were to cancel the contract, the risks and losses would probably fall on the Japanese side. \nThe budget for Tokyo 2020 was set at $12.6bn (\u00a38.9bn), although it's been reported the actual cost may be double that. \nSeveral towns set to host athletes reportedly pulled out earlier in the year because of fears about Covid and extra pressure on the healthcare system.\nIn May, a Japanese doctors' union said it was \"impossible\" to hold the Games given the pandemic. \nA poll in May in the leading Asahi Shimbun newspaper suggested more than 80% of the population want them cancelled or postponed.\nA number of bodies have expressed concern. \nThe World Players Association, representing 85,000 athletes in over 60 countries, said the IOC must do more to ensure athletes' safety - with stricter physical distancing and more rigorous testing. \nJapanese athletes have largely kept a low profile, but the country's biggest sports star, tennis champion Naomi Osaka, previously said there should be a debate about whether the Games should go ahead.
