      "text": "A series of police failings before the murders of two vulnerable women, who were found dead in a freezer, can be revealed for the first time. \nViolent sex offender Zahid Younis, 36, from east London, was jailed last year for the murders of Henriett Szucs and Mihrican Mustafa.\nBBC Newsnight has found how officers \"lost\" one of the victims and missed chances to identify the killer. \nThe Metropolitan Police said it had treated the case \"very seriously\". \nThe bodies of Henriett and Mihrican were discovered in a freezer in the east London flat of Younis in April 2019. A sadistic sex offender with a history of violence, he was jailed for life last year.\nBut a BBC investigation has examined whether the two murders were preventable, uncovering a series of missed chances to protect the women or locate them after they vanished. The family of Mihrican, the second of the women to die, told the programme she could have been saved.\nThe 32-year-old, a Hungarian national and mother-of-three, came to Britain in 2014, but was abandoned by the man she arrived with. She said the man was a pimp and she had her passport stolen. She found herself homeless on the streets of east London and was treated as a trafficking victim. \nHenriett was highly vulnerable and known to the Met Police, which received reports of her being assaulted. She told police a local man, David Dallison, had raped her. He was charged, denied the offence, and was remanded in custody before trial. \nWhat followed was a major missed opportunity to protect Henriett and then later detect her murder. Newsnight has obtained transcripts of the proceedings, which were so disastrous - due to late paperwork and abandoned hearings - that a judge described the Crown Prosecution Service's handling of the case as \"deplorable\" and \"disgraceful\". \nIn January 2016, prosecutors told Snaresbrook Crown Court that Henriett had been \"lost\" by police. The defendant was released and the rape charge left to lie on file.\nHowever, unlike the police, Dallison found Henriett and within four days she was in his flat. She was later discovered seriously injured outside the block of flats, saying she had been pushed out of his fifth-floor window.\nWhile in hospital, Henriett met Younis, a convicted sex offender with a long record of imprisoning, torturing and sexually abusing women and girls. The Met Police judged him as a \"medium risk\" and officers monitoring him visited his flat and collected intelligence on his relationships.\nYounis and Henriett stayed in touch after she moved to a safe house for trafficking victims outside London, but she left and headed for Younis's flat in spring 2016, without telling staff the address. Evidence from the later murder trial showed how she was then coercively controlled and eventually falsely imprisoned by Younis in the flat. She spent weeks severely injured prior to her death.\nIn June 2016, a fateful hearing took place in the rape prosecution involving Henriett. It was at this hearing - attended by police and prosecutors - that she went off the radar of key authorities.\nProsecutors again came to court to say she had been \"lost\". The court was told police could not find her and that officers had earlier suggested to her that it might be in her \"best interests\" to leave the country. The judge said that Henriett might have followed the advice, despite not having a passport.\nThe defendant David Dallison was cleared of all charges and walked free. There was no evidence Henriett had left Britain. No-one reported her missing.\nDays after the rape case was dropped, a Met detective received a text, apparently from Henriett, saying she was too unwell to attend court. The number was not traced. But Newsnight has established the message came from a phone attributable to Younis. Scotland Yard says it has no record of whether officers informed the CPS or the judge about the text.\nWeeks later, when Younis was stopped in the local area by officers, he was with a thin woman whose face was covered by a scarf. The woman's name triggered no alert. This was the last sighting of Henriett.\nKnown as Jan by her family, the 37-year-old, vanished from her native east London in 2018 - long after Henriett had been killed in autumn 2016. \nNewsnight has seen the internal Scotland Yard report into the year-long missing person inquiry for Jan, who was first reported missing in May 2018. In it:\nOfficers refused to class Jan as a high-risk missing person and, just weeks before she was found dead, wrote it was not a \"working hypothesis\" that she'd been harmed by someone else. \nHowever, Newsnight has established that police knew she was at grave risk of male violence and a local drug support group had anticipated the danger she was in.\nBefore going missing, she had been referred to the care of a local multi-agency panel, which included the Met Police, for high risk victims of domestic violence.\nFour months before she disappeared, a letter from a local drug support agency said Jan had \"a history of domestic violence\" from various partners and was \"very vulnerable\" to it happening again. The Met's internal report exonerated the force, saying Younis was being \"appropriately managed\" by officers.\nSeparate reviews into both deaths are currently underway, but Jan's family was not even informed a review had been launched, first finding out through the Newsnight investigation.\nHer family has since received an official apology. They believe Jan would still be alive if Henriett's case had been dealt with properly.\nThere was a series of earlier chances to deal with the threat Younis posed.\nHe had raped, tortured and imprisoned various girls and young women. He was never held fully accountable even when prosecuted, with offences dropped and victims disbelieved by judges and juries.\nOne victim he was convicted of abusing gave evidence in the murder trial.\nSpeaking publicly for the first time, she told Newsnight that if Younis had been dealt with by police earlier the two murder victims \"would still be alive today.\" \"They didn't take the victims seriously,\" she said.\nShe is from a non-Muslim background, and was groomed by Younis from the age of 12. She approached police after the bodies were discovered and was a key witness in the murder trial.\nBut she says the Met has still not investigated a central issue, namely that Younis \"married\" her in a mosque against her will when she was underage.\nShe says officers failed to investigate it because she was unable to provide full details to a detective who rang after she had given a statement to the homicide inquiry. She adds: \"I feel like if they allowed me to get married under age, how many more children has this happened to? Is it still happening now?\"\nThe victim became pregnant by Younis as a child, bringing up her child alone. Her daughter, who also spoke to Newsnight, says even as a child she understood the threat he posed. \"When people found out [about the murders] they were shocked and surprised,\" she says, \"I knew what he was like.\"\nScotland Yard says the passage of time meant it was not in the public interest to pursue the forced marriage complaint any further. The Met Police says its officers took Jan's disappearance very seriously and conducted a full investigation with hundreds of actions taken by officers. The force said Jan had lived a transient lifestyle and had been identified as medium risk.\nRegarding Henriett, the force says it is not policy to report people as missing if they fail to turn up to trial - and that officers had conducted extensive enquiries to locate her. The CPS says there is no causal link between the court case involving Henriett being discontinued and her murder.\nBut Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales, said the evidence had revealed a \"systemic failure\". She said domestic violence needed to be elevated to the same priority as other crimes, with changes needed in how serial perpetrators are managed."

      "text": "Emergency departments across the UK are seeing record numbers of young children - but most have a mild fever that could be treated at home, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health says.\nWinter viruses are flourishing as more people mix, and a doctor's chief says many A&Es are being \"overwhelmed\".\nExperts say any infections are unlikely to be serious and GPs, pharmacies or NHS 111 should be the first option.\nBut A&E remains an option if parents are still concerned or in an emergency.\nAlways seek medical advice if your baby or child:\nThe warning from doctors comes after the RCPCH collated data and the views of paediatricians in emergency departments across the UK. \nIt found children coming to A&E are mostly under the age of five - but they do not have coronavirus.\nIn most cases, their fevers, coughs and runny noses are caused by other respiratory infections such as RSV, bronchiolitis, the common cold and paraflu.\nAfter disappearing last winter during lockdown when no-one was mixing in large numbers, these viruses have reappeared in the summer - but at winter levels, putting huge pressure on emergency departments in hospitals.\nFor most youngsters, treatment with children's paracetamol or ibuprofen will make them feel better after a few days. \nDr Damian Roland, a paediatrician who works in Leicester, said he had recently seen nearly 300 patients in one day in his emergency department.\n\"You just see hour after hour more and more patients arrive, and we simply don't have enough staff to keep up with that demand,\" he said. \n\"We feel like we're at our capacity and winter hasn't even begun yet.\"\nDoctors understand that parents may be concerned, especially if their child is young and this is the first time they have been unwell. \nBut they are also warning of long delays of more than four hours in emergency departments, which can be difficult for both parents and children.\nDr Camilla Kingdon, president of the RCPCH, said many emergency departments were \"overwhelmed\".\nShe said fevers were very common in young children and usually aren't serious.\n\"Most of these children are fine and have returned home once their parents were reassured,\" Dr Kingdon said.\n\"We need to make sure that services are available for children who are seriously unwell.\" \nData from four children's emergency departments - Leicester Royal Infirmary, Royal Hospital for Children Glasgow, Birmingham's Children's Hospital and Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust in Liverpool - show there were an extra 2,500 children attending in May.\nAttendances in children under 15 have increased from nearly 16,000 in May 2018 to 21,046 in May 2019 and 23,661 in May 2021.\nLast month, fewer than 1% of attendances were classified as needing immediate attention.\nMore than 72% - or 17,000 of the children attending - were not seriously unwell.\nGPs said delivering care to young children was an essential part of their job, although they were also under huge pressure at the moment.\n\"We understand that it's a really difficult time to be a parent of a young child, particularly if the child has been born during the pandemic, as many of the usual support services parents rely on have not been available,\" Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs said."

      "title": "Britney Spears wants her conservatorship to end: What happens next?",
      "tags": "Britney Spears",
      "text": "Britney Spears has apologised to fans for \"pretending like I've been OK\", while suffering under what she calls an \"abusive\" conservatorship.\nThe star told a US court on Wednesday that she wants the conservatorship - which controls her personal life and finances - to end after 13 years.\nShe revealed the arrangement requires her to use birth control and prevents her from marrying her boyfriend.\nOn Instagram, she said she had not spoken out before due to \"pride\".\n\"I'm bringing this to people's attention because I don't want people to think my life is perfect because it's definitely not at all, and if you have read anything about me in the news this week... you obviously really know now it's not,\" she said.\nSpears apologised to fans for hiding the truth from them, adding: \"I did it because of my pride and I was embarrassed to share what happened to me... but honestly who doesn't want to capture there [sic] Instagram in a fun light!\"\nThe 39-year-old has been under the conservatorship since 2008, when concerns over her mental health prompted her father, Jamie Spears, to petition the court for legal authority over his daughter's life.\nIn court on Wednesday, Britney read a prepared statement asking for the arrangement to end.\n\"I've been in denial. I've been in shock. I am traumatised,\" she said in the emotional, 23-minute speech. \"I just want my life back.\"\nIn response, Britney's father said he always had her best interests at heart.\nSo what are the chances of the conservatorship coming to an end? We asked two lawyers with experience of family law and conservatorships in the US - Alexander Ripps of Bohm Wildish & Matsen, and Christopher Melcher of Walzer Melcher - for their analysis.\nHow effective was Britney in arguing her case?\nChristopher Melcher: From a legal strategy standpoint, I don't know that her statement helped her that much. It helped us, as the public, to know what she wants, and ended the speculation over whether she was under this conservatorship voluntarily. She made that crystal clear. \nIf I were preparing her, I would have coached her to present herself in a calm way, acknowledging that she did have problems 13 years ago that justified protection; showing awareness of what those problems were; and articulating the steps she's taken to make sure that she doesn't find herself in that situation again. That would provide assurance to the court that she doesn't need that help. \nIf it was a calm presentation, the court would struggle to find a reason why this conservatorship is needed. But we did see a more explosive, emotional, raw statement from Britney. I understand why she would feel that way, but I don't know that she did herself any favours.\nAlexander Ripps: Based on my reading of the transcript I think it was effective. If you cut through it all, she said in unequivocal terms that she wants the conservatorship terminated.  \nWhile acknowledging she still has issues to work through, she has now directly placed her opposition to the conservatorship in front of the court. The bar for conservatorship is meant to be very high; and if Britney can show that her mental condition has improved since the conservatorship was put in place, the court should re-evaluate the need for the conservatorship.\nWhat is the next step, from a legal standpoint?\nChristopher Melcher: So, Wednesday's hearing was just to hear from Britney. She made it clear that she wants to end the conservatorship but she hasn't asked to do so formally. The next step is to file a petition to terminate the order - and then the court would have a hearing. \nAlexander Ripps: In the petition, Britney would have to state facts showing that the conservatorship is no longer required or that the grounds for establishing the conservatorship no longer exist. Once the petition is filed, a hearing date would be set. At some point prior to the hearing, the court investigator should interview Britney and then submit a report to the court. Of course, interested parties would be allowed to file their objections. \nChristopher Melcher: Britney commented on that. She said that she was opposed to being evaluated. So the court can order the evaluation - but it can't physically force her to go there and answer questions. If Britney doesn't get evaluated, the court can consider her refusal to do so as a grounds for denying her petition to terminate [the conservatorship]. So we'll see how that plays out. \nShe said in court that she had researched previous conservatorship cases, and there have been instances where an evaluation has not been required. Is that true, in your experience?\nChristopher Melcher: The court is not required to have one. To me, placing an adult under conservatorship is an extreme measure. This is taking away a person's liberty to make decisions that ordinarily an adult would make for themselves. We shouldn't do that for someone unless they're gravely disabled - developmentally disabled, unable to care for themselves, or resist undue influence. \nI think a judge should be able to tell that pretty quickly, just by interviewing someone. If they're able to have a 30-minute conversation with the court, we can tell a lot from that. And I do wonder what is an evaluation really going to reveal.\nBritney's lawyer requested that any further hearings will be held in private, so could this be the last we hear about the arguments in public?\nChristopher Melcher: That was a surprise from the testimony on Wednesday - that it wasn't in a closed session. I was hoping, for Britney's sake, that the court would close the courtroom to the public, because the nature of this conservatorship is highly personal. It involves medical issues, mental health issues, conflict with her father. I don't think it's healthy for Britney to have all that information blasted out in public and to be critiqued and repeated.\nI suspect most people who find themselves under a conservatorship would protest that it's unfair. Has that been your experience?\nChristopher Melcher: That's exactly right. The conservatorship, by its nature, is one adult controlling another adult. And anyone who's aware enough of their situation would protest about that, probably. \nThe question is whether it's necessary. For Britney, I don't know what the evidence is going to be when she does make a motion to terminate. Can she bring in acquaintances that have seen her daily activities, who can attest that there's been no erratic behaviour? Or has she been isolated so much that she doesn't have any of those favourable witnesses? \nAnd will the conservators testify as to observations they've had of her behaviour that would justify the court in continuing the conservatorship? Are there recordings of Britney, maybe in a private setting, that would show, one way or the other, how she's behaving? These are all things that are going to be coming out\nIs there any way her conservators could prevent her from filing a petition to end the conservatorship?\nAlexander Ripps: No. The right of a conservatee to file a petition to terminate the conservatorship is based on the statutory provision of California Probate Code Sec. 1861(a).\nWhat sort of arguments could they mount to keep the arrangement in place?\nAlexander Ripps: Keep in mind that there are two elements to the conservatorship: Conservatorship of the person and conservatorship of the estate [ie Britney's finances]. Conservatorship of the estate can be warranted for someone who is substantially unable to manage their financial resources, or someone who is substantially unable to resist fraud or undue influence. This is where I think there has potentially been a disconnect with the public. I don't think the public has been privy to all the information as it relates to what was going on Britney's life that may have made her susceptible to undue influence.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,Coronavirus vaccines,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government's expansion of the UK's green travel list does not go far enough, industry leaders have warned.\nArrivals from 16 places, including Spain's Balearic islands, will not have to quarantine from 04:00 on Wednesday.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps also said the government plans to drop quarantine for fully vaccinated people returning from amber list countries \"later in the summer\".\nBut EasyJet has said the timetable \"simply isn't ambitious enough\".\nAmong the places being added to the UK's green list is Malta, which has since tightened travel rules for British holidaymakers.\nFrom 30 June, only arrivals from the UK who have been fully vaccinated - with a vaccine certificate recognised by the Maltese Health Authorities - will be allowed into Malta without having to quarantine. \nSome in the travel industry have reacted more positively to the UK government's latest travel announcement, including Thomas Cook, with the company describing the announcements as \"a good first step\" that opened up more holiday options for customers. \nEasyJet Holidays chief executive Garry Wilson said there had been a \"huge surge\" in people booking holidays to countries that had been placed on the green list. \nHowever, he questioned why more destinations, such as the Canary Islands and the Greek islands, were not added to the list.\nAnd he criticised what he described as the \"delay\" to opening up travel to double-vaccinated people, saying the UK was \"falling behind Europe\".  \nThe transport secretary said several issues still needed to be resolved before the system could be introduced, including whether children should be given the vaccine and how people from outside the UK could prove their vaccination status. \nMr Shapps told BBC Breakfast there was also a \"fairness issue\" because younger people had not yet had the opportunity to have their second jab. \nHe also defended the green watch list as a \"maximal transparency approach\" but even for countries on the regular green list he said there was no guarantee their status would not change at short notice. \nThe destinations added to the green list from 04:00 BST on 30 June are:\nSix destinations will also be added to the government's red list on 30 June. They are the Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda.\nAll the additions to the green list, with the exception of Malta, have also been added to the green watch list, signalling they are at risk of moving back to amber. Israel and Jerusalem have also been put on the watch list, the government said. \nAre you planning to go to a green list country soon? Email: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nThe Department for Transport said the plan to allow fully vaccinated people to arrive from amber list countries without having to quarantine will take place in phases, starting with UK residents. \nIt also said it plans to remove the guidance that people should not travel to amber countries, and will take clinical advice on whether regular testing could provide a safe alternative to quarantine for children accompanied by vaccinated adults.\nHowever, a spokesman said further details - such as when these changes might happen - will not be set out until next month.\nThis is the longest the green list has been since the traffic light system was introduced this year. \nThe addition of Spanish and Caribbean holiday islands is helpful for the travel industry, but it still leaves most of Europe on amber. \nThe majority of destinations have also been placed on the green watch list - a sign that they are at a higher risk of tipping to amber. Will this dissuade potential travellers from booking? \nAfter more than a week of build up, there's some disappointment that there's no guarantee of when quarantine will be dropped for fully vaccinated arrivals from amber list countries. \nWhile some in the industry are celebrating a small step in the right direction, others have already said that this is not enough to save the summer. \nReacting to the news, Sean Doyle, chief executive of British Airways, said the announcement was not enough to help the sector recover from the pandemic.\n\"We cannot afford another missed summer. There are jobs at stake, Britons separated from family members and we cannot afford to allow the success of our vaccine programme to be wasted,\" he said.\nAnd industry body Abta said the announcement \"will not on its own deliver the meaningful restart of international travel that the industry desperately needs\".\nAirline Jet2 cautiously welcomed the announcements as \"a step in the right direction\". \nHowever, chief executive Steve Heapy said the traffic light system still did not set out the criteria for placing countries in different lists. \nLabour also called for the government to publish the criteria by which it was assessing each country and said the amber list was a concern. \n\"It's essentially a nod and a wink to go if you want to go. But it doesn't give confidence to consumers to book ahead,\" shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \nMr Shapps said the Joint Biosecurity Centre, which advises the government on which countries to open up to travel, publishes the data behind its decisions including case rates, vaccination levels, the amount of sequencing of variants and the quality of data from a country. \nHowever, the prospect of European holidays does, however, face another hurdle, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested earlier this week all EU countries should make British travellers quarantine on arrival to slow the spread of the Delta variant.\nCurrently, people travelling from the UK to Greece, Spain and Portugal are not required to quarantine when they get there.\nBut those going to Italy have to self-isolate for five days then take a test, while fully-vaccinated UK visitors to France can enter without quarantining.\nCases numbers are continuing to rise in the UK, with a further 16,703 reported on Thursday. Another 21 deaths were also reported. \nMore than 60% of UK adults have now been fully vaccinated, while 82% have had at least one dose."

      "tags": "US economy,Infrastructure,US Congress,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The US Senate has struck an agreement for a $1.2tn (\u00a3860bn) infrastructure bill in what could herald a legislative victory for President Joe Biden.\n\"We have a deal,\" said the president after meeting the cross-party group of senators at the White House.\nThe eight-year plan includes funding for roads, bridges, the power grid, public transport and internet.\nBut the deal is far from done as Mr Biden said it depended on the passage of another, bigger spending bill.\nAt the White House on Thursday, Mr Biden praised the group of five Republican and five Democratic senators whom he met earlier, and promised the package would generate \"millions\" of jobs.\nThe investments are long overdue, said Mr Biden, who has persisted with the cross-party negotiations despite the impatience and scepticism of some in his Democratic party.\n\"We're in a race with China and the rest of the world for the 21st Century,\" he continued, adding: \"This agreement signals to the world that we can function, deliver and do significant things.\"\nLess than half the money in the eight-year proposal is new spending. It includes $109bn for roads and bridges, $66bn for railways, $49bn for public transport and $25bn for airports, according to a White House statement.\nA further $73bn would be pumped into power grid and $65bn for expanding Americans' access to broadband internet.\nThe package is meant to be paid for with unused coronavirus aid money and returned state jobless benefits.\nDemocrats also argue the bill's proposed $40bn investment in the Internal Revenue Service for beefed-up enforcement would generate a net gain of $100bn in extra tax revenue.\nThe plan will reportedly neither raise taxes on middle-income Americans, nor reverse the cuts to business taxes that were passed during the Trump presidency.\nRepublicans had strongly opposed Mr Biden's calls to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, while the president had rejected a plan to hike taxes on petrol. \nThe president wants to enact another, roughly $6tn spending package that would roll in his party's priorities on climate change, education, paid leave and childcare benefits. It is being drafted by Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist.\nThat measure is expected to include tax increases on the wealthy and corporations. It would be passed by a budget reconciliation process that would not require any Republican votes in the Senate.\nThe most powerful Democrat in the US House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, made clear they would not pass one bill without the other.\n\"There ain't going to be a bipartisan bill without a reconciliation bill,\" Mrs Pelosi said.\nMr Biden echoed that sentiment in later remarks from the East Room of the White House: \"If this is the only thing that comes to me, I'm not signing it. It's in tandem.\"\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, whose support will be crucial to passage of the infrastructure bill, told Fox News: \"I think we have gone from optimism to pessimism as a result of the president's second press conference.\"\nThere was also scepticism from Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate who could effectively doom the larger bill because the upper chamber is evenly split between the two parties.\nHe told reporters on Thursday: \"That sounds extremely, extremely high for us to take on that much debt.\" \nMr Biden already signed a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus back in March. By the end of July, Congress also faces a deadline to again raise the nation's borrowing limit, which is already at $28tn in debt.\nIn his inaugural address, Joe Biden pledged to work with Republicans to reach bipartisan consensus.\nFor the first five months of his presidency, however, Mr Biden and the Democrats have mostly had to go it alone - on an expansive Covid relief package and on confirming nominees to the administration and the judiciary.\nNow, after extended negotiations, it appears that the White House has found a way to work with a handful of Senate Republicans to pass an infrastructure spending package.\nIt's not the \"epiphany\" candidate Biden promised would occur among conservatives during his presidency, but for a White House that has laboured for a deal, it's a start.\nThere are still many ways this agreement could go sideways, however. Mr Biden's strategy of passing this bipartisan legislation alongside a more ambitious Democrat-only package of spending on social programmes will be a tricky dance.\nIf the former fails, centrist Democrats may vote against the liberal agenda. If Democrats can't stick together on the latter, then progressive senators - growing wary of this administration - could scuttle the former.\nMr Biden, a veteran of the US Senate, likes to boast that he knows how the chamber operates. The next few months will more than test his skills."

      "tags": "Fossils,Human evolution,Evolution",
      "text": "Chinese researchers have unveiled an ancient skull that could belong to a completely new species of human.\nThe team has claimed it is our closest evolutionary relative among known species of ancient human, such as Neanderthals and Homo erectus.\nNicknamed \"Dragon Man\", the specimen represents a human group that lived in East Asia at least 146,000 years ago.\nIt was found at Harbin, north-east China, in 1933, but only came to the attention of scientists more recently.\nAn analysis of the skull has been published in the journal The Innovation.\nOne of the UK's leading experts in human evolution, Prof Chris Stringer from London's Natural History Museum, was a member of the research team. \n\"In terms of fossils in the last million years, this is one of the most important yet discovered,\" he told BBC News.\n\"What you have here is a separate branch of humanity that is not on its way to becoming Homo sapiens (our species), but represents a long-separate lineage which evolved in the region for several hundred thousand years and eventually went extinct.\"\nThe researchers say the discovery has the potential to rewrite the story of human evolution. Their analysis suggests that it is more closely related to Homo sapiens than it is to Neanderthals.\nThey have assigned the specimen to a new species: Homo longi, from the Chinese word \"long\", meaning dragon.\n\"We found our long-lost sister lineage,\" said Xijun Ni, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Hebei GEO University in Shijiazhuang. \nHe told BBC News: \"I said 'oh my gosh!'. I could not believe that it was so well preserved. You can see all the details. It is a really amazing find!\"\nThe skull is huge compared with the average skulls belonging to other human species. Its brain was comparable in size to those from our species. \nDragon Man had large, almost square eye sockets, thick brow ridges, a wide mouth, and oversized teeth. Prof Qiang Ji, from Hebei GEO University, says it is one of the most complete early human skull fossils ever discovered.\n\"It has a mosaic combination of primitive and more modern features, setting itself apart from all the other species of human,\" the researcher explained.\nThe scientists believe that Dragon Man was powerfully built and rugged. But little is known about how he lived, because his skull was removed from the site in which it was found. \nThis means that there is currently no archaeological context, such as stone tools, or other elements of culture.\nThe skull was reportedly discovered in 1933 by a construction worker helping to build a bridge on the Songhua river running through Harbin, in Heilongjiang province, which translated means Black Dragon River, hence the new human's name..\nThe city was under Japanese occupation at the time. Suspecting its cultural value, the Chinese worker smuggled it home, to keep it out of the hands of occupiers. He hid it at the bottom of his family's well, where it remained for around 80 years. The man told his family about the skull before he died, which is how it eventually got into the hands of scientists.\nDragon Man joins a number of early human remains uncovered in China that have proven difficult to categorise. These include remains from Dali, Jinniushan, Hualongdong, and the Xiahe jawbone from the Tibetan Plateau.\nThere has been a fierce debate about whether these remains represent primitive examples of Homo sapiens, Neanderthals, a human group called the Denisovans, or something else entirely.\nThe Denisovans were first identified from DNA retrieved from a 50,000-30,000-year-old finger bone discovered in Denisova Cave, Russia. Because the remains associated with this sister lineage to the Neanderthals were so fragmentary, the group has been described as a \"genome in search of a fossil record\".\nProf Marta Mirazon Lahr, from the University of Cambridge, believes that Dragon Man was, in fact, a Denisovan.\n\"The Denisovans are this fascinating mystery population from the past. There is a suggestion (from DNA evidence) that the jawbone found in the Tibetan Plateau might be a Denisovan,\" she said. \"And now because the jawbone from Tibet and Dragon Man look like each other - now we might actually have the first face of the Denisovan.\"\nAnd a group that recently published details of remains from Israel belonging to a possible precursor species to the Neanderthals, believes Dragon Man might be descended from humans that first emerged in the Levant region.\nBut the Chinese researchers maintain that the hard-to-classify fossils from East Asia represent the gradual evolution of a new species. Prof Ni has a gracious response to those that disagree with this assessment.\n\"The results will spark a lot of debate and I am quite sure that a lot of people will disagree with us,\" he said. \n\"But that is science and it is because we disagree that science progresses.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter."

      "text": "Mumford & Sons' lead guitarist has quit the band following backlash to a tweet supporting a right-wing author.\nWinston Marshall took time away from the band in March after saying journalist Andy Ngo was \"brave\" for his book which says far-left activists have \"radical plans to destroy democracy\".\nWinston says he regrets the distress to his bandmates caused by his tweet.\n\"I could remain and continue to self-censor, but it will erode my sense of integrity,\" he wrote in a blog post.\nHe blamed a \"viral mob\" for his decision to leave the band permanently.\n\"I failed to foresee that my commenting on a book critical of the far-left could be interpreted as approval of the equally abhorrent far-right.\"\n\"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" he said, adding that 13 members of his family were murdered in concentration camps during the Holocaust, in the Second World War.\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, Winston, 33, had used his social media accounts to comment on the books he was reading.\nMuch of the backlash from his tweet about Andy Ngo's book was aimed at the band's frontman, Marcus Mumford.\n\"It's our singer's name on the tin. That name was being dragged through some pretty ugly accusations, as a result of my tweet,\" Winston wrote.\n\"The distress brought to [the whole band] and their families that weekend I regret very much. I remain sincerely sorry for that. \n\"Unintentionally, I had pulled them into a divisive and totemic issue.\"\nWinston said his Mumford & Sons bandmates had asked him to stay with them after his tweet.\nBut when he decided to step back from the band \"another viral mob came after me, this time for the sin of apologising\".\nHe said articles calling him right-wing are \"libellous\" and that his political views are somewhere between \"centrist\" and \"liberal\".\n\"Being labelled erroneously just goes to show how binary political discourse has become,\" he wrote.\n\"I had criticised the 'left', so I must be the 'right', or so their logic goes.\"\nWinston had been in the hugely successful four-part band for 14 years, since it formed in London in 2007.\nIn that time they've released four albums - two of which have topped charts in both the UK and the US.\nThe book Winston tweeted his support for was called Unmasked: Inside Antifa's Radical Plan to Destroy Democracy. \nIt was an Amazon bestseller and appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list for non-fiction.\nAntifa is an abbreviation of anti-fascist, and is a word that became widespread while Donald Trump was in power in America, especially in coverage of clashes with white supremacists.\nIt is not an official organisation. \nThe loose affiliation of mostly far-left activists includes anarchists, but also communists and a few social democrats. What sets them apart is their willingness to use violence - in self-defence, they say.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "tags": "Public health,Coronavirus vaccines,Welsh government,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales has become the first UK nation to fully vaccinate more than half of its entire population, latest figures show.\nIn total 1,591,322 of people (50.5%) have now received both Covid-19 jabs, Public Health Wales (PHW) said.\nWales is now fifth in the world for the proportion of people fully vaccinated, and leads the world for the percentage of people given a first dose (71.3%).\nIt comes as the Welsh government delayed easing restrictions as case rates continue to rise.\nThe national case rate - 37.6 per 100,000 people - is at its highest level since March after a further 336 cases were reported on Friday by PHW.\nWith Covid case numbers across Wales now doubling every seven to ten days, First Minster Mark Drakeford confirmed lockdown restrictions would remain as they are for a further three weeks.\nMr Drakeford said: \"There is some positive research evidence emerging that despite the speed at which the delta variant is spreading, vaccination is helping to prevent serious illness.\n\"This is why are working so hard to speed up the vaccination programme while we have temporarily paused any further changes to the restrictions and why we are encouraging everyone to have two doses of the vaccine.  \n\"Take-up rates have been fantastic and, overall, people have been really enthusiastic about the vaccine.\n\"But there are some small signs of hesitancy among the 30 to 39 age group. \n\"Health boards are working hard to make clinics and appointments as flexible as possible, we are encouraging employers to give staff the time off to be vaccinated and we are also continuing to work with particular communities and groups to maximise their protection.\"\nThe latest data shows that Wales remains ahead of the other UK nations in the total proportion of the population given a first and second jab.\nScotland had given first doses to 67.6% of its population and 48.2% had received a second.\nNorthern Ireland had given first doses to 60.7%, while 43.9% had been given both doses.\nEngland had given 65% their first does and 47.7% their second.\nThe latest data published for the rest of the world is due to be released later on Friday.\nFor countries with populations of more than one million, Wales has been ahead of every nation in the world for first jabs since mid-May.\nFor second doses of the vaccine, Thursday's data shows Wales is in fifth place among nations with more than one million people, behind Israel (59.6%), Bahrain (54.7%), Mongolia (52.3%) and Chile (51%).\nWe have to bear in mind the vaccine figures published in Wales, unlike in England, are not \"real-time\".\nIt takes up to five days after a person receives a dose for the data to be published. \nGPs are asked to input data into the NHS Wales-built system as soon as possible but it then has to be verified and quality-assured by PHW - to ensure people are not double-counted, for instance - before it is actually published.\nSo there is a built-in lag between what health bosses are seeing happening daily and when we see the figures.\nOne health official said they were under-reporting rather than leaving \"any chance of over-reporting\".\nMinisters, however, have access to \"real-time\" data as soon as it is in the system so have an idea what is going on, on the ground."

      "text": "There are still significant weakness in the performance of NHS Test and Trace in England, a watchdog is warning.\nThe National Audit Office (NAO) review highlighted poor turnaround times for testing during the winter, as well as an over-reliance on consultants.\nIt showed there remained \"pressing challenges\" to solve in the coming months, the NAO said.\nBut it also pointed to signs of progress too, including the creation of local council contact tracing teams.\nThis is the second time the NAO has looked into the performance of the service.\nIts first report - published earlier this year - was heavily critical and warned there was no evidence it had made a clear impact at the time.\nThis one looked at performance from November to April.\nIt said that in December, with infection levels rising, the proportion of test results given within 24 hours dropped to 17%.\nThe report acknowledged turnaround times improved after that - albeit as demand on the service dropped, with infection levels falling.\nThe speed of contact tracing also improved when tests were carried out at official sites. \nBut once tests done at home and in care homes were taken into account, the process still appeared to be taking too long, the report said.\nThe continued reliance on consultants was also criticised. More than 2,200 were employed in April, higher than the total in December despite promises to reduce their use.\nAlthough overall there was still an underspend on the budget - just \u00a313.5bn of its \u00a322bn was used, most of that on testing.\nMeanwhile, the creation of the UK Health Security Agency, which will take on responsibility for NHS Test and Trace, the Joint Biosecurity Centre and some functions of Public Health England in October, could disrupt the focus on containing the virus, the report warned.\nThe NAO warned effectiveness of the service was still being undermined by low levels of public compliance, both in terms of coming forward for testing and adhering to isolating.\nIt also pointed out that just 14% of the 691 million rapid tests sent out to the public had been registered as used.\nMeg Hillier, chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, said the findings were \"deeply disappointing\" and the service continued to be \"plagued by the same issues\".\nBut a Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said NHS Test and Trace was playing an \"essential role\" in the pandemic by breaking chains of transmission and spotting outbreaks early.\n\"It continues to be one of the centrepieces of our roadmap to return life to normal,\" she added."

      "tags": "Minnesota,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "The US has been convulsed by nationwide protests over the death of an African-American man in police custody.\nGeorge Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nFootage of the arrest on 25 May shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the floor.\nMr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder.\nTranscripts of police bodycam footage show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained by the officers. \nThe key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes. Based on accounts from witnesses, video footage and official statements, here's what we know so far. \nIt began with a report of a fake $20 (\u00a316.20) bill.\nA report was made on the evening of 25 May, when Mr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes from Cup Foods, a grocery store.\nBelieving the $20 bill he used to be counterfeit, a store employee reported it to police. \nMr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas. He had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but, like millions of other Americans, was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic. \nMr Floyd was a regular at Cup Foods. He was a friendly face, a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble, the store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC. \nBut Mr Abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident. In reporting the suspicious bill, his teenage employee was just following protocol.\nIn a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but \"he [Floyd] doesn't want to do that\", according to a transcript released by authorities.\nThe employee said the man appeared \"drunk\" and \"not in control of himself\", the transcript says.  \nShortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner.\nAfter approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands. In an account of the incident, prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun.\nMr Lane, prosecutors said, \"put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car\". Then Mr Floyd \"actively resisted being handcuffed\".\nOnce handcuffed, though, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for \"passing counterfeit currency\". \nCourt transcripts from police body cameras show Mr Floyd appears co-operative at the beginning of the arrest, repeatedly apologising to the officers after they approach his parked car.\nMr Lane asks Mr Floyd to show his hands at least 10 times before ordering him to get out of the vehicle.\nIt was when officers tried to put Mr Floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued. \nAt about 20:14, Mr Floyd \"stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic\", according to the report. \nMr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in a further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car.\nDuring this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd away from the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said. \nHe lay there, face down, still in handcuffs.\nThat's when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd's last.\nMr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck.\nFor more than nine minutes, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, the prosecutors say. The duration was initially given as eight minutes and 46 seconds but Minnesota prosecutors have since revised the time.  \nThe transcripts of bodycam footage from officers Lane and J Alexander Kueng show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained. He was also pleading for his mother and begging \"please, please, please\".\nAt one point, Mr Floyd gasps: \"You're going to kill me, man.\"\nOfficer Chauvin replies: \"Then stop talking, stop yelling. It takes heck of a lot of oxygen to talk.\"\nMr Floyd says: \"Can't believe this, man. Mom, love you. Love you. Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead.\"\nA female bystander told the police: \"His nose is bleeding, come on now.\"\nAbout six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse.\nOfficer Kueng did just that, checking Mr Floyd's right wrist, but \"couldn't find one\". Yet the other officers did not move. \nAt 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd's neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance. \nHe was pronounced dead about an hour later.\nOn the night before his death, Mr Floyd had spoken to one of his closest friends, Christopher Harris. He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency.\nForgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd.\n\"The way he died was senseless,\" Harris said. \"He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn't designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can't get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.\""

      "text": "Wales has given 84% of people eligible for Covid boosters a vaccination, according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales.\nThe programme has slowed down since before Christmas, delivering 3,752 booster doses a day in the last week.\nAt its height, 50,524 doses were given out on 21 December.\nTwo-thirds of vaccines given out in the past weeks were boosters, while more than 13,000 second doses, mainly to 12 to 15-year-olds.\nPeople can receive a booster three months after receiving their second vaccine, so it means that 84% of those eligible for a booster vaccine have now been reached in Wales.\nThat figure on 27 January was also 84% in Scotland, 81% in England and 75% in Northern Ireland.\nTo reach the remaining eligible people, at the current rate, it would take just over three months.\nThe situation is complicated by those who catch Covid having to wait before they can receive a booster, with higher proportions of the 18 to 40 age group infected since Christmas.\nThe total is 1,875,473 boosters given out by 27 January.\nThese include more than 42% of 18 to 29-year-olds and more than half of those in their 30s.\nWe can see that by last Sunday, 68% of adults had received their booster jab.\nMonmouthshire (78.6%) had reached the most and Cardiff (61.7%) the fewest.\nWith the over-50s, Monmouthshire has reached more than 88% and Powys, Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend and Caerphilly more than 87%. Cardiff and Neath Port Talbot (about 82%) have reached the fewest.\nAround 77% of people in their early 50s had also been given the booster and 81% of those in their late 50s.\nFor care home residents, the range is from just over 82% in Pembrokeshire to 96.6% of those on Anglesey having a booster.\nWales is slightly behind Scotland with the proportions of their populations given a first jab - 79.1%.\nBy 27 January, 2.5m people in Wales had been given their first dose. \nA total of 2,361,042 people have received a second jab, or 74.5% of the total population. \nMore than 64% of 16 and 17-year-olds have now received a second dose.\nWales (74.9%) and Scotland (75.3%) are close together on the proportions of second vaccinations.\nBy 27 January, England was on 71.6% and Northern Ireland trailing a little on 69.1%.\nFor the proportion of its population with booster doses, Wales is ranked fifth in the world, compared with other nations with a population above 1 million.\nWhen we look at figures within Wales, we can see Powys reached nearly 81% of its total population with two doses and 67.9% with boosters. \nSwansea Bay has reached the fewest proportion for vaccines, for all three doses (54.2%).\nNearly 62% of the youngest age group offered vaccines have taken a first dose in Wales by Wednesday.\nBut there is a big variation between counties. This ranged up to last Sunday from 74.1% in Monmouthshire and 70% in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) to less than half of 12 to 15-year-olds in Neath Port Talbot taking up the offer.\nRCT and Merthyr Tydfil have so far reached nearly half of this age group with second doses too."

      "text": "A tornado has swept through several villages in the Czech Republic, killing five people and leaving more than 150 others injured.\nThursday night's storm blew the roofs off buildings in the south-eastern Breclav and Hodonin districts, uprooting trees and overturning cars.\nWinds of at least 219km/h (136 mph) were recorded and the worst-hit areas were said to look like a war zone.\n\"It's living hell,\" said South Moravia regional governor Jan Grolich.\nHail stones the size of tennis balls were reported, and local officials said a string of villages had suffered considerable damage along a 25km (15-mile) stretch of road heading from Breclav to Hodonin, to the north-east. \nIn the village of Valtice, on the other side of Breclav, Mayor Pavel Trojan said almost every building had been damaged by a bombardment of hail.\nThe government said around 1,000 homes had been affected and local authorities were working to provide accommodation for people whose roofs had been destroyed.\nMichaela Bothov\u00e1, a spokeswoman for the South Moravian rescue service, told Czech TV that dozens of people had been taken to hospital by medical services. Initial reports spoke of three deaths but Czech police said later the number had risen to five.\nThe images of devastation in villages in the Hodonin area are simply jaw-dropping. \nIn one video, the camera pans across an apocalyptic landscape; cars are dumped like toys on piles of twisted steel. Planks of wood have been sprinkled on the ground like matchsticks. \n\"My lovely little car is in there, somewhere,\" says one man, filming on his phone in a car park in front of what had been some sort of factory. \n\"If it's mine. You can't really tell to be honest\" - the singsong Moravian cadence in his voice giving away the location of this disaster. \nThe indistinct voices around him are punctuated by the repetitive beep-beep-beep of an alarm. Black smoke billows from something burning a short distance away. \nThis is South Moravia, land of undulating hills and vineyards. But not as we know it.\nRescue teams from across the country, as well as from neighbouring Austria and Slovakia, have been deployed and tens of thousands of people have been left without power.\nPrime Minister Andrej Babis, who is in Brussels for an EU summit, described what had happened as an apocalypse.\nAt least a third of the houses in the village of Hrusky, with a population of 1,600 people, were destroyed by the tornado. Only 15% of buildings had been untouched, said deputy mayor Marek Babisz.\n\"The church is without the tower, the elementary school has no roof and insulation any more, only walls remained from what were houses,\" he told Czech public radio.\nThe tornado and hailstones struck the border town of Hodonin, damaging an old people's home and destroying the local zoo. Vineyards in the area were also damaged.\nThe situation looked like a battlefield, said Antonin Tesarik, the director of Hodonin's hospital, where many of the injured were treated.\n\"It was an apocalypse. There was blood everywhere and helpless people in tears. They saved their lives and lost the roofs over their heads,\" CTK news agency quoted him as saying.\nThe tornado also caused severe traffic disruptions and power outages, blocking entire motorways and leaving more than 100,000 homes without electricity overnight.\nIn a tweet, Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamacek described the situation as very serious, saying that all available rescue units were being sent to the scene.\nThe minister, who has arrived in the disaster-hit region, said a state of emergency had been declared.\nBBC Weather forecaster Ben Rich explains\nTornadoes aren't as rare as you might imagine in Europe - it's thought a few hundred touch down across the continent every year. Exact estimates vary, though, and some almost certainly go unreported as they hit in sparsely populated rural areas.\nTornadoes have been reported in every continent on Earth except Antarctica - and even there they are theoretically possible.\nBut the US sees the most tornadoes of all, with more than 1,000 per year on average. The country also records more of the most violent twisters than anywhere else in the world.\nIts mountainous landscape and proximity to the warm, moist Gulf of Mexico give the perfect conditions for violent supercell thunderstorms to form. And these are the storms that give birth to tornadoes."

      "text": "Only 28 cases of Covid-19 were recorded after nine large-scale events studied to assess the impact on transmission of the virus, a government report says.\nA total of just over 58,000 people went to the indoor and outdoor events but there were \"no major outbreaks\". \nAt the time, virus levels were low and testing before and after events was also low, making conclusions difficult.\nPilot events included the FA Cup final, the Brit awards and two Circus nightclub dance nights in Liverpool.\nThe Events Research Programme was commissioned by the prime minister in February to test how mass gatherings could be held safely, and what measures would help reduce the risk of the virus spreading.\nScientists involved in the research said large indoor events could post \"a higher potential risk of transmission\" because of people being close to each other and poor ventilation.\nBut they said \"pinch points\", where people were crowded together for a time, existed at both indoor and outdoor events. \nThey added that face coverings, restrictions on food and drink, testing, ventilation and social distancing could all be used to reduce the risk of transmission.\nThe report said no decisions had been taken on fully reopening mass events.\nThe government is due to set out its plans for this before 19 July - the current date for the final easing of lockdown restrictions in England.\nThe nine pilot events studied were:\n*There was a total of eight cases across these three football events.\nAll attendees were required to provide a negative lateral flow (rapid) test before they could enter the events.\nThey were also asked to take a voluntary PCR test (which is sent to a lab) before and after the event.\n\"Low uptake of PCR testing before and after events meant evidence of direct transmission at events was challenging to determine,\" the report says.\nSome 26-31% of attendees returned a PCR test after an event, but researchers said they also tested their close contacts and those of people who tested positive to find out more about potential spread.\nData on cases in the local populations who made up the audience at the events, such as Liverpool, were also studied. \nBut the report says the figure of 28 positive cases at events - 11 identified as potentially infectious and 17 as potentially infected at or around the time of an event - should be \"interpreted with extreme caution\".\nThis is because of \"relatively low levels of community prevalence of Covid-19 at the time of running the first phase of pilots\" - and the spread of the now-dominant Delta variant could increase those figures, the report noted.\nProf Iain Buchan, public health expert from the University of Liverpool, who was involved in the study, said: \"The single most important thing people can do is get vaccinated to make events happen\".\nHe said he had witnessed \"an outbreak of joy rather than an outbreak of virus\" at the events.\nThe next phase of the events research programme will include tennis's Wimbledon Championships, golf's Open Championship, the Goodwood Festival of Speed and the Latitude Festival.\nTeams from the University of Liverpool, Loughborough University, University College London, the University of Edinburgh and Movement Strategies, a company that specialises in people movement and crowd dynamics, carried out the main research."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "title": "Covid in schools: What will next term look like?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The end of the school term usually brings a big sigh of relief for pupils and teachers and this year, that sigh will be even louder. \nThis session has been the first, and hopefully only, school year carried out entirely under Covid restrictions. Repeated home isolations for some pupils, face-coverings in class and the cancellation of exams brought constant disruption.\nSchools reopen in August. But will next term be more normal?\nParents have described the feeling of dread when their child's school tells them they have been identified as a close contact and need to self-isolate. \nBut the lack of physical distancing between pupils, the fact they are interacting five days a week and that secondary pupils can be with different groups in each class, means the chances of being asked to isolate even if there is just one positive case in a school, can be high for both young people and their teachers.\nIn the autumn term, the number of pupils isolating at one time reached a peak of almost 30,000. We also heard of some pupils having to isolate multiple times. It was for this reason that the formal exam diet was cancelled for a second year in a row.\nAs we have approached the summer break the numbers isolating were creeping up again to more than 24,000 on 22 June, with the number of Covid cases at just over 800.\nIt's this disparity between the number of cases and the numbers isolating which caused some to question whether the 10-day isolation period could be relaxed or replaced with testing.\nThe Scottish government says it is reviewing its approach to self-isolation, although there is no time frame for when this might be completed. It is expected to have a bearing on the decision around exams, coming in August, so we could expect it before then. \nLarry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teaching union, believes what happens in schools should reflect what is happening in wider society.\nHe said: \"Come August, schools will be reopening on the same basis as they have closed, so any changes which are introduced will be after the start of term. \n\"There is debate around teenagers being vaccinated and the issue around self-isolation will depend on the level of teenager transmission. \n\"At the moment that is very high and without vaccination, I can't see that potential in-school transmission being reduced, so I think self-isolation will remain an option, or possibly a requirement, unless there is a vaccination programme put in place.'\nLeon Cameron is going into 6th year. Vice chairman of Glasgow Youth Council, the 16-year-old thinks vaccines will be key.\nHe said: \"I think the obvious answer is for self-isolation in schools to continue. If we didn't do it, it would probably lead to more cases which would be a problem. \n\"If the vaccine programme was rolled out to teenagers by August, then we would be safer and it would minimise the risk of having to self-isolate.\" \nAll secondary pupils in Scotland have been wearing face-coverings in school corridors and classrooms since they returned to in-school learning in the spring. At the start of the school year last August, pupils didn't need to wear them at all, the rules then gradually changed, widening out to include more pupils in more settings. \nWe know that the Scottish government is looking at the role of masks in general society after 9 August, when many restrictions will be lifted.\nHowever, they are still expected to be worn in some instances including shops and public transport and, potentially, in schools.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this week: \"Although no final decision has been taken, it may be that, in some settings, which might include schools, we ask people to continue to wear face coverings for a period longer.\"\nTina Woolnough from the parents organisation, Connect, sees polarised views among parents about the wearing of masks in class, and wants clarity.\n\"If you go into a cafe now, you walk in wearing your mask and you sit down and take it off,\" she said. \n\"We need some consistency in wider society about what happens so that young people know what to do and so that parents know what to support when they go back into school.\"\nThere have now been two years without formal school exams, cancelled because of the pandemic. The algorithm used to moderate grades last year was widely criticised and ended up with a government U-turn and reversion to teacher estimates. \nThis year, the plan was meant to be continuous assessment, but schools having to go to online learning for almost four months during that time meant the system was adapted and ended up resembling what some branded \"exams in all but name\" without the study leave.\nThe Scottish government is replacing the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) exams body, but that could take years. We will be told what is happening with next year's exams before schools return this August.\nEducation secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said the decision on whether to hold a more normal exam diet could be linked to the review on self-isolation, telling parliament: \"Any changes here could have a significant bearing on the extent of disruption for individual learners in the next school year, and in turn our decision on whether to hold an exam diet or use an alternative model of certification.'\"\nLeon has never sat a formal exam and he would to see a mix of both scenarios.\nHe said: \"The system needs stability.  I feel like if there were continuous assessments, say from August onwards to gather evidence, then that would be helpful and bit less disorganised and less chaotic. I'd also then be up for sitting a more normal exam at the end of the year.\"\nLarry Flanagan said the continuous assessment model would need to change.\nHe said: \"The alternative certification model which was applied this year has created a huge workload pressure for teachers who have been working flat out to deliver these qualifications. \n\"If we are not looking at an exam diet, I think we need a contingency arrangement which is more manageable than this year's has been.\"\nAt first, it doesn't look like it. Schools are preparing to go back in August with the same mitigations they have in place at the moment. The feeling among school leaders seems to be that it's much harder to go back to restrictions both practically and psychologically, once they have been lifted.\nIf we really are heading towards what Nicola Sturgeon calls \"much greater normality\" in August, before schools go back, then there might be pressure to take steps like removing masks in classrooms and cutting periods of isolation for pupils, fairly quickly. \nWhat happens with longer term issues, such as exams, will depend on forecasting further into the future and although pupils, parents and teachers will be keen for certainty, they have become used to things changing, even after plans are made.\nThe Scottish government said it was closely monitoring developing evidence on vaccination and transmission risk, and would continue to review whether self-isolation requirements remained necessary and appropriate. \nThis would include whether and to what extent the requirement for children and young people to self-isolate as contacts of positive cases could safely be significantly reduced in future.\nOn face coverings, a spokeswoman said that the Covid-19 education recovery group would develop updated guidance to support schools to reopen safely after the summer holidays. \nShe said: \"We expect that advice will make clear which baseline mitigations should be retained in schools as we move beyond level zero, and which should be removed at the earliest safe opportunity following the return. \n\"Where mitigations can safely and practically be removed immediately after the summer holidays, schools will be asked to do so as quickly as is operationally feasible.\"\nThe spokeswoman also confirmed that the education secretary would outline plans for 2022 national qualifications by the start of the new school year in August."

      "tags": "Minneapolis,US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "The death of George Floyd, a 48-year-old black man, while he was being restrained by a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, during an arrest in Minneapolis in May 2020, shocked the world and sparked global protests about racism and police brutality.\nChauvin's three-week trial - on charges of murder and manslaughter - has now resulted in his conviction. \nHere are five key moments from the trial which heard from 45 witnesses and saw hours of video footage filmed by bystanders.\nSome of the most powerful testimony came in the first days of the trial when witnesses spoke of what they saw that day.\nDarnella, who was 17 at the time of Mr Floyd's death, filmed the video that went viral around the world. She told the jury there were nights when she stayed up \"apologising to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life\".\n\"When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad. I look at my brothers, I look at my cousins, my uncles. Because they are all black,\" she said.\nEmotional testimony also came from Charles McMillian, 61, who had been among the first on the scene and had tried to persuade Mr Floyd to get in the police car.\nHe broke down in tears watching graphic footage of the arrest in court, saying he had felt \"helpless\" as events unfolded and explained that he had confronted Chauvin after Mr Floyd was taken away in an ambulance because \"what I watched was wrong\".\nThe defence has argued that the presence of bystanders influenced Chauvin's actions that day. The court heard from one Minneapolis police officer, Peter Chang, that the crowd had been \"very aggressive to the officers\", while Nicole McKenzie, who trains the city's police on providing medical care, said the presence of bystanders at an arrest could make it harder for officers to see signs of distress in those they detained.\nAnother powerful moment came when Mr Floyd's girlfriend of three years, Courteney Ross, took the stand.\nShe described their first meeting, in the lobby of a Salvation Army homeless shelter, where Mr Floyd worked as a security guard, and how he had been devastated by his mother's death in 2018.\nMs Ross also told the court they both suffered from chronic pain, which led to an off-and-on struggle with opioid addiction.\n\"We got addicted and tried really hard to break that addiction many times,\" she testified.\nOne of the defence's arguments has been that Mr Floyd died largely because of complications from the opioids and methamphetamine he had in his system at the time of his arrest. \nAnother key issue at the heart of this trial has been whether Derek Chauvin violated policies on restraint when he kneeled on George Floyd's neck for nine and a half minutes.\nThe head of Minneapolis police, Chief Medaria Arradondo, was one of the prosecution's most high-profile witnesses and had fired Chauvin a day after the arrest.\nHe told the court that the police officer should have stopped applying \"that level of force\" the moment Mr Floyd stopped resisting. \"It's not part of our training and it's certainly not part of our ethics or values\" to continue with such force, he said.\nDefence witness Barry Brodd, a use-of-force expert, said Chauvin had been \"justified\" and acted \"with objective reasonableness\" because of the \"imminent threat\" Mr Floyd posed in resisting arrest.\nHowever, he did concede under cross-examination that the dangers of positional asphyxia - not being able to breathe in a certain position - were well-known among law enforcers.\nThe cause of Mr Floyd's death was arguably central to this trial, with the prosecution maintaining he died from asphyxia while the defence pointed to Mr Floyd's drug use and general poor health. \nDr Martin Tobin, an expert in pulmonary medicine, used video footage to explain what was happening to Mr Floyd's breathing during the nine and a half minutes he lay under Chauvin's knee.\nEven \"a healthy person, subjected to what Mr Floyd was subjected to, would have died,\" he said.\nA key witness for the defence, forensic pathologist David Fowler, said Mr Floyd's death should have been classified as \"undetermined\" rather than as a homicide, because there were \"so many conflicting different potential mechanisms\". \nComplicating factors included Mr Floyd's drug use and possible exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning from the police car's exhaust, said Dr Fowler, who was chief medical examiner for the state of Maryland until his retirement in 2019.\nHowever, under cross-examination he agreed that Mr Floyd should have been given immediate medical attention when he went into cardiac arrest, as there still was a chance to save his life.\nJust before the defence rested its case, the man on trial - Derek Chauvin - confirmed to the judge that he would not testify.\n\"I will invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege today,\" he said, referring to the constitutional right to remain silent in fear of self-incrimination.\nAsked by the judge whether this was his decision alone, and whether anyone else had unfairly influenced his decision, Chauvin responded: \"No promises or threats, your honour.\"\nChauvin pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree unintentional murder - for which he could be jailed for up to 40 years - third-degree murder, and manslaughter. \nThe jury took under a day to return a unanimous verdict convicting him of all charges."

It also did bulk deals where a seller could spend \u00a3620 for 50 reviews or \u00a38,000 for 1,000 reviews.\nWhich? said the CMA's investigation was \"a positive step\".\n\"The CMA must now move swiftly towards establishing whether these companies have broken the law, said Which? director of policy and advocacy Rocio Concha.\n\"This should prompt Amazon and Google to finally take the necessary steps to protect users from the growing tide of fake reviews on their platforms and, if they fail to do so, the regulator must be prepared to take strong enforcement action.\" "

      "text": "Spain's Balearic Islands, Madeira, Malta and Barbados are among the places being added to the UK's green travel list, the transport secretary has said.\nPeople entering the UK from 16 places will not have to quarantine from 04:00 on 30 June, Grant Shapps confirmed.\nHe also said the government intended to drop quarantine for fully vaccinated people returning from amber list countries \"later in the summer\".\nSix destinations have also been added to the government's red list. \nThe travel industry welcomed the additions to the green list, but urged the government to go further.\nThe destinations added to the green list from 04:00 BST on 30 June are:\nThe places added to the red lists for the same time are:\nDominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda.\nAre you planning to travel to a green list country soon? Email: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nMr Shapps cautioned that all the additions to the green list, with the exception of Malta, had also been added to the green watch list, signalling that they are at risk of moving back to amber. Israel and Jerusalem have also been put on the watch list.\nThe Department for Transport said the plan to allow fully-vaccinated people to arrive from amber list countries without having to quarantine was expected to take place in phases, starting with UK residents. \nThe department also said it intended to remove the guidance that people should not travel to amber countries, and it would take clinical advice on whether regular testing could provide a safe alternative to quarantine for children accompanied by vaccinated adults.\nA spokesman said further detail will be set out next month, including the rules for children and those unable to be vaccinated and the dates the changes will come into effect. \nMr Shapps added: \"We're moving forward with efforts to safely reopen international travel this summer, and thanks to the success of our vaccination programme, we're now able to consider removing the quarantine period for fully-vaccinated UK arrivals from amber countries - showing a real sign of progress.\n\"It's right that we continue with this cautious approach, to protect public health and the vaccine rollout as our top priority, while ensuring that our route out of the international travel restrictions is sustainable.\" \nBut Eluned Morgan, Wales' minister for health and social services, said: \"Our message is clear - this is the year to holiday at home. We're calling on people to only travel overseas for essential reasons.\"\nOn Thursday, the UK reported 16,703 cases and 21 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. \nThe prospect of European holidays also faces another hurdle after German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested all EU countries should make British travellers quarantine on arrival to slow the spread of the Delta variant.\nMrs Merkel told Germany's parliament: \"In our country, if you come from Great Britain, you have to go into quarantine - and that's not the case in every European country, and that's what I would like to see.\"\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also spoke of his concern at the spread of the variant.\n\"We should all be vigilant because the Delta variant is coming,\" he said on Thursday. \n\"We see that it affects people who have not yet been vaccinated or who have only had one dose, which means we have to be even faster in this vaccination campaign.\"\nCurrently, people travelling from the UK to Greece, Spain and Portugal are not required to quarantine. \nThose going to Italy have to self-isolate for five days then take a test, while fully-vaccinated UK visitors to France can enter without quarantining.\nMost holiday hotspots are currently on the amber list, including France, Italy and mainland Spain, meaning travellers returning to the UK have to self-isolate for 10 days, as well as pay for tests.\nThe expanded green list is the longest it has been since the government set up the traffic light system for travel. \nBut BBC transport correspondent Caroline Davies pointed out that most of Europe and other key transport destinations are still not on the green list. \nThere is also no set date for when fully vaccinated travellers will no longer have to quarantine, with the government still having to resolve questions about how the policy will work.\nOur correspondent added that it was potentially a small step in the right direction for the industry, \"but maybe a bit of a shaky one\". \nThe travel industry welcomed the expansion of the green list but warned it was not enough to help the sector recover from the pandemic. \nSean Doyle, chief executive officer of British Airways said: \"We cannot afford another missed summer. There are jobs at stake, Britons separated from family members and we cannot afford to allow the success of our vaccine programme to be wasted.\"\nHe added that plans to allow vaccinated people to travel more freely this summer were \"critical\" and urged the government to work with the aviation industry to set this up.\nMatthew Fell, the Confederation of British Industry's chief UK policy director, said the additions to the green list \"won't be enough to salvage the summer season for the international travel sector\".\nHe said: \"The UK's successful vaccine rollout means we should be in the vanguard of safely restarting international travel. Other countries are already pressing ahead with enabling travel for the fully vaccinated.\"\nShai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said the expanded travel green list \"fails to go far enough\", adding that the US should have been added to it.\nHe said quarantine should be removed for fully vaccinated passengers arriving from amber and green countries \"no later\" than 19 July.\nBut Rory Boland, travel editor of consumer magazine Which?, said travellers still needed to be \"extremely cautious\" about booking trips abroad with the rules on international travel changing regularly.\n\"Most providers will not pay refunds if a country is moved from green to amber, and 'free' amendments are often anything but, with many companies requiring significant notice of any changes and bookings for new dates usually costing hundreds of pounds,\" he said. \nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a \"real opportunity\" to open travel this summer for those who have had two jabs.\nAsked about the prospect of a change to travel rules, Mr Johnson said: \"The most important thing is that we think double jabs do offer a good way forward, we think they offer the hope of travel this summer.\n\"More than 60% of our population have now had two jabs, I think 83% have had one jab, we're really getting through it now. The crucial thing is, come forward and get your second jab,\" he said.\nThe UK government reviews which countries are on which list every three weeks.\nThere will also be a \"checkpoint\" review of the rules for each category on Monday 28 June. \nOn Wednesday, workers in the industry, including cabin crew, pilots, travel agents and airport staff, held a series of protests against the rules.\nIndustry body Abta, representing travel agents and tour operators, estimated 195,000 travel jobs have been lost during the pandemic or are at risk."

      "text": "The prices of flights and hotels for new green list travel destinations have swung sharply in both directions since the guidance was changed on Thursday. \nThe government added 16 destinations to the list. Travellers returning from these do not have to isolate on return. \nDestinations include Malta and Spain's Balearic Islands, and some holidays have doubled in price, the Independent's travel editor Simon Calder said.\nAirlines have added extra capacity.\nInitially when these new flights have become available, prices have fallen as extra supply takes up the demand.\nBut this has proved to be short-lived in many cases: \"Availability is changing by the minute,\" said Mr Calder, who has been checking prices regularly since the announcement.\n\"Immediately after it was made there was still quite a lot of keenly priced flights and holidays, but we're back down to 'last seat' showing.\"\n\"Madeira and Malta, for example, were looking pretty reasonable, but then things really took off. Unless you're sitting in front of a screen there's no way of gauging which trend line you're on,\" he added.\nEasyJet said: \"When new flights are put on sale the starting fares may be lower compared to existing flights with many seats already booked.\n\"Like all airlines, our pricing is dynamic which means that our fares start low and increase the closer it is to the date of departure and as more seats on the aircraft are booked.\"\nThe destinations added to the green list from 04:00 BST on 30 June are:\nEurope: The Balearic Islands (which include Ibiza, Menorca, Majorca and Formentera), Malta and Madeira\nCaribbean: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat and Turks and Caicos Islands\nOther British Overseas Territories: Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory and Pitcairn\nSix destinations will also be added to the government's red list on 30 June. They are the Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda.\nOperators contacted by the BBC were concentrating mainly on satisfying demand for the Balearic Islands, Majorca, Menorca and Ibiza, and Malta. \nBA said it was reviewing its schedule and had added some additional flights and upgraded some routes to larger aircraft, for example to Malta and the Balearic Islands.\nEasyJet said it was also adding seats and holiday packages and new routes, also focussing on Malta and the Balearics.\nNew routes to Malta from Bristol and Luton will launch next month and offer some seats at \u00a327.99.\nRyanair said it was selling 200,000 extra seats on flights from the UK to Malta, Ibiza and Palma for July, August and September.\nRyanair's Dara Brady called the latest announcement a \"small step in the right direction\" but called on the government to add Cyprus, the Canary Islands and Greek islands to the green list.\nJet2holidays said there had been a \"huge surge\" in bookings.\nIt reported the highest volume of bookings to the Balearic Islands in almost a year, with bookings for July alone up more than 3,000%.\nBookings for Malta and Madeira also jumped by almost 1,500%.\nSeveral factors influence the price of airline tickets. These include how many seats are available, how many people are looking for tickets, the popularity of the route, and the time of the day the journey takes place. \nDue to computer algorithms, airlines can alter the price of tickets by the minute. For example, an algorithm can pick up when lots of customers are looking to purchase a particular ticket and then trigger an automatic response. \nHowever, it's not all computers that set the price, humans play a role too. Revenue managers will sometimes manage automatic systems from time-to-time.\nPeter Morris, chief economist at Ascend consultancy and a veteran with 25 years in aviation, says approaches do differ between airlines and they typically sell tranches of tickets with prices increasing as long as sales are going well.\nRead more about how prices rise for flights.\nJet2.com and Jet2holidays have put more than 70 additional flights on sale to Malta and Madeira with immediate effect and a new route to Malta from London Stansted is being added.\nSteve Heapy, chief executive of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays, said the response from customers had been \"truly incredible\".\n\"Bookings to Majorca, Menorca, Ibiza, Malta and Madeira have gone through the roof, which shows just how much UK holidaymakers want to get away.\"\nThe Independent's Mr Calder said: \"It's now a matter of 'can you time it right' so you go in just when the new flight goes on. \n\"If you do you can still get a bargain. Otherwise you are competing with people prepared to spend many of hundreds of pounds to get away to what are, after all, still a very small number of destinations compared with normal years.\"\nThe new rules on travel will, of course, change as situations develop.\nAnd the countries on the UK's Green List have their own set of rules.\nFor example, Malta will only allow people in to the country without quarantine if they present an approved valid vaccine certificate. \nAn email from its High Commission in London said on Friday afternoon: \"This means that only people who have a vaccination certificate recognized by the Superintendent for Public Health can enter Malta from the United Kingdom without the need of quarantine.\"\nIt said anyone who did not meet the entry requirements should make a formal request to the Public Health Superintendence to authorise entry to Malta at covid19.vetting@gov.mt. Further conditions may then apply. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps has said the UK government plans to drop quarantine for fully vaccinated people returning from amber list countries \"later in the summer\".\nHowever, EasyJet has said the timetable \"simply isn't ambitious enough\".\nThe transport secretary said issues such as whether children should be given the vaccine and how people from outside the UK could prove their vaccination status needed to be resolved before the system could be introduced.\nHe added there was also a \"fairness issue\" with young people yet to receive their second jabs."

      "text": "The US white ex-police officer convicted of murdering African-American man George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 has been sentenced to 22 years and six months in jail.\nThe judge said Derek Chauvin's sentence was based \"on your abuse of a position of trust and authority, and also the particular cruelty shown\" to Mr Floyd.\nMr Floyd, 48, died after Chauvin knelt on his neck for nine minutes. \nHis murder caused global protests against racism and police brutality.\nChauvin, 45, was convicted of second-degree murder and other charges last month. During his trial, his lawyer described the killing as \"an error made in good faith\". \nChauvin was also told to register as a predatory offender and was barred from owning firearms for life. \nHe and three other former officers are separately charged with violating George Floyd's civil rights. \nThe Floyd family and their supporters welcomed the sentence. \n\"This historic sentence brings the Floyd family and our nation one step closer to healing by delivering closure and accountability,\" lawyer Ben Crump tweeted.\nMr Floyd's sister Bridgett Floyd said the sentence \"shows that matters of police brutality are finally being taken seriously\" but there was still \"a long way to go\". \nPresident Joe Biden said the sentence \"seemed to be appropriate\" but admitted that he did not know all the details.\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Mr Floyd's brother Terrence Floyd demanded the maximum available, a sentence of 40 years. \n\"Why? What were you thinking? What was going through your head when you had your knee on my brother's neck?\" he said.\nMr Floyd's daughter Gianna, aged seven, appeared in a video recording, saying she missed him and she loved him. \n\"I ask about him all the time,\" she said. \"My daddy always used to help me brush my teeth.\" \nThe judge said the case had been painful for the community and the country, but above all, for Mr Floyd's family. \n\"What the sentence is not based on is emotion, or sympathy, but at the same time, I want to acknowledge the deep and tremendous pain that all the families are feeling, especially the Floyd family,\" said Judge Peter Cahill. \nChauvin told the court he offered his condolences to the Floyd family, saying there would be \"some other information in the future\" and he hoped \"things will give you some peace of mind\". \nHowever, he did not apologise. \nIn court, Chauvin's mother said he was a \"good man\". \n\"I have always believed in your innocence and I will never waver from that,\" said Carolyn Pawlenty. \nChauvin's sentence was \"one of the longest a former police officer has ever received\" for deadly force, said Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. \nHe bought a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store in May 2020. A shop assistant believed he had used a counterfeit note and called police after Mr Floyd refused to give the cigarettes back.\nWhen officers arrived, they ordered Mr Floyd out of his parked car and handcuffed him. A struggle ensued when officers tried to put a screaming Mr Floyd in their squad car. They wrestled him to the ground and pinned him under their weight.\nChauvin pressed his knee into the back of Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes.\nAs he was being restrained, Mr Floyd said more than 20 times that he could not breathe, pleading for his mother and begging \"please, please, please\".\nWhen the ambulance arrived, Mr Floyd was motionless. He was pronounced dead about an hour later.\nHis death was filmed by Darnella Frazier, now 18, who was out walking with her cousin when she saw his arrest. \nShe said she had begun recording the incident on her phone because \"I saw a man terrified, begging for his life\".\nEarlier this month, Ms Frazier was awarded a special Pulitzer Prize, the most prestigious award in American journalism.

      "text": "More than one million people in Sydney's central and eastern suburbs, including Bondi Beach, will be locked down after a jump in Covid cases.\nThe Australian city is battling to contain an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant.\nOfficials reported 17 new cases on Friday, taking the cluster to 65 cases.\nIt is the first lockdown in Australia's largest city since December. The country has consistently maintained very low rates of Covid transmission.\nThe stay-at-home order will affect the city centre and inner-city suburbs, as well as beachside suburbs in the east. \n\"We don't want to see this situation linger for weeks. We would like to see this situation end sooner rather than later,\" New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.\nBut she added that medical experts believed only a targeted lockdown was necessary for now, sparing the wider city from shutting down.\nFrom Saturday, residents as well as people who work in the affected areas will have to stay at home except for essential reasons. The lockdown will be enforced until 2 July. \nResidents in the virus hotspots had already been banned from travelling out of the city. Other Australian states and territories have also blocked arrivals from Sydney.\nSydney's current outbreak marks its most significant rise in Covid transmission since December. For most of the year, locals had enjoyed almost no restrictions on daily life.\nThe cluster of infections emerged just a week ago in Bondi, the famous beach suburb, but has since spread into the city centre and to its western fringes.\nIt has been linked to a driver who transported international arrivals from the airport.\nMs Berejiklian stressed that the stay-at-home order would also apply to workers, noting that office workers commuting to and from the central business district had brought the virus into outer suburbs.\nAbout half a million people work in Sydney's central financial district, generating about a third of the city's economy.\nAustralia has enacted strict border closure and quarantine measures since March 2020 to keep the virus out of the country.\nHowever, very infectious strains of the virus - such as the Delta and Alpha variants - have increasingly breached the defences of the quarantine system, which is largely run out of hotels in state capitals.\nSince November, more than eight lockdowns have occurred in various state capitals across Australia including Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide due to leaks from quarantine hotels.\nMelbourne only last week emerged from a two-week lockdown to counter a Delta outbreak. Prime Minister Scott Morrison committed to plans on Friday for purpose-built quarantine centres, which critics said should have been built earlier.\nSydney's outbreak has also fuelled criticism over the federal government's slow vaccination rollout. Vaccine hesitancy has also been a problem.\nLocal media reported the driver at the centre of Sydney's outbreak had been reluctant to take the AstraZeneca vaccine due to its rare blood-clotting risk. \nSo far, just over 3% of the adult population has been fully vaccinated and about 25% of Australians have received a first dose. Government critics, including political opposition, have argued that cities would not need to endure lockdowns again if a majority of the population was vaccinated.\nSydney has seen outbreaks before but authorities have steered away from citywide lockdowns. Instead it has relied on its swift contact-tracing system and setting restrictions on targeted areas. \nIn December, officials locked down the city's northern beaches district to contain a cluster of about 150 cases."

Until a change to the law in 1953, German citizenship could only be passed on paternally.\nA legal decree was passed in 2019 to help close these loopholes. Now that it has passed the lower house of Germany's Bundestag, with a large majority, prospective applicants will have a firmer legal footing for their appeal.\nThe law does also cover those who were directly deprived of their citizenship but, given the passage of time, descendants will be the main beneficiaries.\nThe new law also bars the naturalisation of people convicted of racist, anti-Semitic or xenophobic acts. \n\"This is not just about putting things right, it is about apologising in profound shame,\" said Interior Minister Horst Seehofer in March, when the government passed the draft law.\n\"It is a huge fortune for our country if people want to become German, despite the fact that we took everything from their ancestors.\"\nThe move comes as neighbouring Poland comes under the spotlight for a draft law which critics say would make it harder for Jews to recover property seized by Nazi occupiers during World War Two.\nThe bill, passed by Poland's lower parliamentary house on Thursday, has been condemned by the US and Israel."

      "tags": "Fertility,Population growth,Ageing population,Pregnancy",
      "text": "Last year more deaths than births were registered in the UK for the first time since 1976. \nIn total, just over 683,000 births were registered compared with nearly 690,000 deaths. \nThis was only the second time deaths have outnumbered births since the late 1890s. \nThe coronavirus epidemic led to a sharp rise in deaths last year but birth rates have also been falling for the last decade. \nThe number of deaths in the UK has been rising in recent years, but part of that increase is due to the UK population increasing and getting older. \nLast year's 13% rise in that figure is attributed by statisticians to the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt was the largest jump in a single year seen since World War Two, bringing death rates, the chances of any single person dying, back to levels seen in 2008. \nFigures published this morning by the Office for National Statistics suggest the first lockdown had not led to a baby boom.\nBirth rates in December and January, nine months after lockdown started, were sharply down on the same months one year before. \nBut the pandemic has affected register offices, leading to problems with birth registrations, so the ONS \"urges caution\" when reading meaning into these figures. \nIt is perhaps unsurprising - and it should be a one off - but the provisional finding that the UK natural population shrank is stark all the same. \nThe spike in deaths above the number of births puts pandemic mortality into some sort of context. \nBut it also shines a light on the significant falls in the fertility rate in the past few years. \nIn 2012, the total fertility rate was 1.92 - close to the level where a population replaces itself. \nIn just eight years that has fallen below 1.6, much closer now to societies considered to be \"ageing\" such as Germany and Japan. \nThere are many questions to ask about whether this is linked to a significant squeeze on younger families.\nThese figures need not necessarily be a problem. However, if confirmed in the final figures, they do point to significant changes for British society and its economy too.\nPart of the reason that deaths have outstripped births is that births have been falling steadily in every nation of the UK since at least 2015. \nThe Office for National Statistics says this is because we are having children later in life and fewer of them. \nThis trend has been happening for decades but it wasn't apparent in the noughties as another trend was masking it. \nBack then, younger migrants tended to have more children than UK-born mothers and so they propped up British birth rates.\nBut this is no longer the case and birth rates have been falling since 2011, feeding through into a lower total number of births by the middle of the decade. \nThe last time deaths outnumbered births was in 1976. \nIn that year, there were just under 681,000 deaths and about 5,000 fewer births. \nThe main driver was falling birth rates: the late 1960s and 1970s saw sharp falls in the number of live births in the UK. \nThere has been some relationship between the state of the economy and the number of births and the low levels in the 70s coincided with a faltering economy. \nBut the biggest reason for the sharp change was the widespread availability of contraception and the legalisation of abortion in the UK in the late 60s. \nIt is likely that more Britons died than were born during some years of the World Wars, with the smallest gap between the two in 1940, the year of the Blitz. \nBut deaths of military personnel who died abroad are not included in the UK death registration figures charted above.

It is everybody's duty to follow the rules, but equally I've not been somebody who has criticised and condemned people when they've made mistakes.\"\nLabour's Emily Thornberry, the shadow international trade secretary, told the same programme that Mr Hancock's actions showed \"an arrogance that they believe they're above the law\", adding that \"he should have gone a long time ago\".\n\"What we're talking about is somebody breaking the rules for which they were personally responsible - where they were on television night after night telling us that we weren't allowed to have intimate contact with people from outside our households,\" she said.\nAnd a Labour spokesperson said the matter was \"definitely not closed, despite the government's attempts to cover it up\".\nThe government believes no laws were broken because Mr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo were both in the department for legitimate work purposes, sources say.\nThe Liberal Democrats called on Mr Hancock to resign and accused him of \"hypocrisy\" over social distancing.\nBoris Johnson doesn't do ministerial resignations.\nHe resists calls from the opposition, the media - and even his own colleagues.\nHis then aide Dominic Cummings wasn't sacked last spring for his 260-mile trip to Durham during lockdown.\nUnlike with Mr Cummings, there has been no cacophonous clamour from Mr Hancock's Conservative colleagues for him to go straight away.\nBut there are concerns that he won't have credibility in the Commons or in the country to argue that the existing restrictions should be respected.\nAnd in retaining Mr Hancock in office, Boris Johnson has enabled political opponents to revive an attack which they believe has resonance with voters: that there is one rule for ministers - and another for everyone else.\nThe Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said it was \"heartbreaking\" that Mr Hancock had been \"ignoring the rules while we were unable to hug friends and family at our loved ones' funerals\".\nThe group wrote to the prime minister, saying that if the health secretary was \"unable to find the decency to do the right thing and resign his position, it is paramount that you relieve him from it\".\nIn a statement, Mr Hancock, 42, said: \"I accept that I breached the social distancing guidance in these circumstances. I have let people down and am very sorry.\n\"I remain focused on working to get the country out of this pandemic, and would be grateful for privacy for my family on this personal matter.\"\nThe Metropolitan Police said it was not investigating Mr Hancock over alleged breaches of Covid regulations as it did not look into Covid-related issues retrospectively \"as a matter of course\".\nThe force added it was aware of the images alleged to have been obtained within official government premises but \"at this time this remains a matter for the relevant government department\".\nMs Coladangelo, a friend of the health secretary since they worked on a student radio station at Oxford University, was made a non-executive director of the Department of Health last September.\nThe role comes with a \u00a315,000 salary and involves 15 to 20 days of work per year.\nLabour deputy leader Angela Rayner has written to the cabinet secretary - the UK's most senior civil servant - asking him to investigate whether Mr Hancock broke ministerial rules by failing to \"declare that he was engaged in a relationship with someone whom he personally appointed at taxpayers' expense\".\nA government spokesman said Ms Coladangelo's appointment had been \"made in the usual way\" and had \"followed correct procedure\".\nThe Times has reported that Mr Hancock failed to declare their friendship when appointing Ms Coladangelo - who is also communications director for fashion retailer Oliver Bonas - as an adviser in March last year.\nShe held the role for six months, before she was appointed to the Department of Health's non-executive board. \nIn May last year, epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson resigned from the government's scientific advisory group (Sage) after it emerged he had broken lockdown rules when a woman he was reportedly in a relationship with visited his home.\nAt the time Mr Hancock called these actions \"extraordinary\", adding that social distancing rules were \"there for everyone\" and \"deadly serious\".\nOn Friday, Labour's First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said Mr Hancock had been \"quick to condemn\", adding: \"We can't make laws for other people and not be willing to abide by them yourself.\"\nBut Mr Hancock's colleagues rallied around him, with International Trade Secretary Liz Truss telling the BBC: \"[Mr Hancock] does have my support.\"\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said there was \"a complete difference between what people do in their job... and what they do in their personal lives\".\nHowever, Conservative backbench MP Andrew Bridgen said that if the health secretary felt that the revelations over Ms Coladangelo had \"affected his performance of his role\" he should consider his position.\nMr Hancock has been married for 15 years to Martha, who is an osteopath.\nMs Coladangelo, 43, is married to Oliver Bonas founder Oliver Tress."

      "text": "At least one person has died and dozens are missing after the collapse of a 12-storey residential building north of Miami, Florida, officials say. \nThe number of people who have been located now stands at 102, while 99 are still unaccounted for, according to Miami-Dade Mayor Danielle Levine-Cava.\nIt is unclear how many people were in the building at the time. \nThe cause of the collapse - affecting about half of the 130 units in the complex - remains unclear. \nThe block in the town of Surfside was built in 1980. \nA number of Latin American migrants have been reported missing by their consulates. \nRelatives of the first lady of Paraguay are also among the missing, Paraguayan officials said. Rescuers were unable to contact the sister and brother-in-law of first lady Silvana L\u00f3pez Moreira, along with their three children and a domestic worker. \nRescuers pulled 35 people from the wreckage, officials said. Ten were assessed and treated, of whom two were sent to hospital. \nSearch and rescue teams are working from a parking garage underneath the wreckage as they explore the rubble for survivors.  \nA small fire broke out during the search but was extinguished within 20 minutes, said Miami-Dade fire chief Raide Jadallah.\nHe said they had been using sonar and search cameras as well as specially trained dogs, but it was a \"slow and methodical\" process because of the risk of shifting rubble. \n\"The back of the building, probably a third or more, is totally pancaked,\" Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett told a news conference. \nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis, who visited the site on Thursday afternoon, said the fire and rescue service was still in \"search and rescue mode\".\n\"The TV doesn't do it justice. It is really, really traumatic to see the collapse of a massive structure like that,\" he said. \nThe BBC's Will Grant, at the scene, said relatives of the missing have been huddled around a community centre a few blocks from the collapsed building, waiting for information and fearing the worst.\nPresident Joe Biden said he was waiting for Mr DeSantis to declare an emergency and officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) were already at the scene.\n\"I say to the people of Florida, whatever help you want, what the federal government can provide, we're waiting, just ask us. We'll be there,\" Mr Biden said. \nPolice gave the building's location as 8777 Collins Avenue, the address of the 12-storey Champlain Towers. The city of Surfside runs along Collins Avenue, north of Miami Beach city limits.\nRescuers could be seen using a crane to reach residents in nearby apartments in order to help them evacuate.\nOne man who was out with his brothers walking their dog described hearing the building come down.\n\"Basically we heard a really big rumble and we thought it was a motorcycle, you know, and we turned around and saw a cloud of dust just coming our way,\" he told CBS Miami.\n\"We were like - 'what is going on?' We went rushing toward it with shirts over our faces and the security guard came out and we were, like, 'what happened?' and she said the building collapsed.\"\nA man who witnessed the aftermath of the collapse told CNN, \"It looked like something from 9/11,\" referring to the attacks that brought down the Twin Towers in New York in 2001.\nSanto Mejil, 50, was woken when his wife called from a unit on the ninth floor of one of the three buildings that make up Champlain Towers. She is an overnight caretaker for an elderly disabled woman.\n\"She said she heard a big explosion,\" Mr Mejil told the Miami Herald. \"It felt like an earthquake.\" His wife was among those rescued.\nA man who lives in a neighbouring building described what happened for CBS: \"The building shook and then I looked out the window and you couldn't see, I thought it was like a storm or something coming in. \n\"When the dust cleared, the back two-thirds of the building was gone, it was down to the ground.\"\nAre you in the area?

      "text": "Emergency departments across the UK are seeing record numbers of young children - but most have a mild fever that could be treated at home, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health says.\nWinter viruses are flourishing as more people mix, and a doctor's chief says many A&Es are being \"overwhelmed\".\nExperts say any infections are unlikely to be serious and GPs, pharmacies or NHS 111 should be the first option.\nBut A&E remains an option if parents are still concerned or in an emergency.\nAlways seek medical advice if your baby or child:\nThe warning from doctors comes after the RCPCH collated data and the views of paediatricians in emergency departments across the UK. \nIt found children coming to A&E are mostly under the age of five - but they do not have coronavirus.\nIn most cases, their fevers, coughs and runny noses are caused by other respiratory infections such as RSV, bronchiolitis, the common cold and paraflu.\nAfter disappearing last winter during lockdown when no-one was mixing in large numbers, these viruses have reappeared in the summer - but at winter levels, putting huge pressure on emergency departments in hospitals.\nFor most youngsters, treatment with children's paracetamol or ibuprofen will make them feel better after a few days. \nDr Damian Roland, a paediatrician who works in Leicester, said he had recently seen nearly 300 patients in one day in his emergency department.\n\"You just see hour after hour more and more patients arrive, and we simply don't have enough staff to keep up with that demand,\" he said. \n\"We feel like we're at our capacity and winter hasn't even begun yet.\"\nDoctors understand that parents may be concerned, especially if their child is young and this is the first time they have been unwell. \nBut they are also warning of long delays of more than four hours in emergency departments, which can be difficult for both parents and children.\nDr Camilla Kingdon, president of the RCPCH, said many emergency departments were \"overwhelmed\".\nShe said fevers were very common in young children and usually aren't serious.\n\"Most of these children are fine and have returned home once their parents were reassured,\" Dr Kingdon said.\n\"We need to make sure that services are available for children who are seriously unwell.\" \nData from four children's emergency departments - Leicester Royal Infirmary, Royal Hospital for Children Glasgow, Birmingham's Children's Hospital and Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust in Liverpool - show there were an extra 2,500 children attending in May.\nAttendances in children under 15 have increased from nearly 16,000 in May 2018 to 21,046 in May 2019 and 23,661 in May 2021.\nLast month, fewer than 1% of attendances were classified as needing immediate attention.\nMore than 72% - or 17,000 of the children attending - were not seriously unwell.\nGPs said delivering care to young children was an essential part of their job, although they were also under huge pressure at the moment.\n\"We understand that it's a really difficult time to be a parent of a young child, particularly if the child has been born during the pandemic, as many of the usual support services parents rely on have not been available,\" Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs said."

      "title": "Matt Hancock: High profile former health secretary",
      "tags": "Matthew Hancock",
      "text": "Before resigning his role, Matt Hancock had achieved an unusually high profile for a health secretary, with the coronavirus pandemic making him a household name. \nBut it was his personal life, after pictures emerged of the married father-of-three embracing close colleague Gina Coladangelo, which led him to quit his job.\nMr Hancock has admitted breaking social distancing rules and accepted he \"let people down\".\nOn Saturday he resigned, saying \"we owe it to people who have sacrificed so much in this pandemic to be honest when we have let them down\".\nPropelled into the limelight as Covid-19 gripped the country in spring 2020, Mr Hancock regularly spoke for the government in the media and at the daily Downing Street press conferences.\nHe famously set a target to conduct 100,000 Covid tests a day by the end of April, a target which he said he met - with his method for calculating the target later coming in for criticism.\nBut his performance at the onset of the pandemic has recently come under renewed scrutiny, following a series of explosive allegations by Boris Johnson's ex-adviser Dominic Cummings.\nMr Hancock has repeatedly denied Mr Cummings' claims of lying to the prime minister about care home testing and procurement of personal protective equipment during the first Covid wave. \nA bitter war of words between Mr Hancock and the PM's ex-aide has since ensued - with Mr Cummings publishing WhatsApp messages, apparently from Mr Johnson in March last year, in which the PM called the health secretary \"totally [expletive] hopeless\".\nMr Hancock also has faced criticism for his decision to hire his friend, the ex-TalkTalk boss and Tory peer Dido Harding, to run England's much-criticised test and trace system.\nAnd his later decision to give her a role as interim head of the UK's new health protection agency sparked controversy, with Labour saying the appointment lacked transparency.\nBut Mr Hancock has been steadfast in his defence of her, rejecting criticism of early delays to the NHS Test and Trace app and even describing it as the \"cherry on Dido's cake\".\nLike other ministers, he has repeatedly stressed the importance of people keeping their distance and following government guidance.\nYet he had already apologised once before for breaching the advice - saying sorry for a \"human mistake\" in June last year after he was caught on camera slapping a colleague on the back in the House of Commons. \nIn addition, Mr Hancock has also faced questions over how his department awarded Covid contracts at the height of the first wave of the pandemic. \nHe has denied involvement in the awarding of a controversial \u00a330m contract to a firm run by the former landlord near his old constituency home.\nIn late May, the PM's standards adviser said he was guilty of a \"minor technical breach\" of the ministerial code after initially failing to declare his stake in an NHS supplier run by his sister and brother-in-law.\nThe prime minister decided this breach did not \"impugn\" the health secretary's \"good character\".\nBut that has not stopped Labour and other opposition parties from heaping pressure on Mr Hancock over his record in office - calling for him to be sacked before his resignation. \nMatt Hancock was born in Cheshire in 1978, and privately educated at the King's School in Chester, before later studying computing at a further education college.\nLike many in Westminster, he went on to study politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford university - before then briefly working for a Conservative backbencher and at the Bank of England. \nIt was during his time at Oxford that Ms Coladangelo says she first met Mr Hancock, after they worked together at a student radio station.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4 for a documentary broadcast in April last year, she said: \"I read the news and Matt read the sport.\n\"I've always joked with him that he did the sport because he wasn't good enough to do the news.\"\nShe told a story from Mr Hancock's time as a student journalist, saying he once overslept and missed his train to Twickenham Stadium, where he was supposed to be reporting from a rugby match.\nInstead, she added, he \"told a white lie\" and pretended he'd gone to the game, when in fact he was filing his match report from a pub in Reading.\nMr Hancock entered the political world as an adviser to then-shadow chancellor George Osborne, before rising up the ranks to become his chief of staff.\nElected Conservative MP for West Suffolk at the 2010 election, he held various ministerial posts under David Cameron and Theresa May. \nHis big break came in early 2018, when, aged 39, he became the youngest member of Mrs May's cabinet after she appointed him culture, media and sport secretary. \nIt was a role that Mr Hancock, an avid cricketer who once trained to become a jockey for a charity horse race, embraced enthusiastically. \nHe also professed a passion for technology - garnering much attention, and a certain amount of mockery, when he launched his own Matt Hancock smartphone app.\nHe was made health secretary in July 2018, after long-serving incumbent Jeremy Hunt was appointed foreign secretary to replace Boris Johnson, who had quit the cabinet in protest at Mrs May's Brexit strategy. \nAfter Mrs May stepped down as PM in 2019, Mr Hancock was among more than a dozen Tory MPs who initially entered the contest to replace her as leader, before quitting the race after coming sixth in the first ballot of the party's MPs.\nHe did not originally back a rival candidate, before deciding to back Mr Johnson's successful run for the leadership three days later. He was among a handful of ministers to keep their roles when Mr Johnson entered No 10."

      "text": "It's fair to say Wales supporters will be hugely outnumbered for Saturday's Euro 2020 knockout clash with Denmark in Amsterdam - but those who are going have pledged to make themselves heard.\nDanish fans are getting extra tickets for the game as Welsh fans can't travel with the Netherlands currently barring non-essential visitors from the UK.\nBut for two Welsh brothers, the last 16 encounter is \"like a home game\" as they live round the corner from the ground.\nThey can't wait for the \"moving\" game.\n\"We haven't been home since the start of the pandemic because of Covid travel restrictions,\" said Sam Credgington, 26.\n\"It has been quite challenging as we've missed our family and friends and although fans from Wales aren't allowed here for the game - in a weird way, it does feel like Wales is coming to see us.\n\"It'll be quite moving. Watching Wales is one of the greatest feelings. \n\"It'll be a chance to get our Wales shirts on, have a sing-song and just enjoy being Welsh with other Welsh people who live over here. It'll be a special moment for us.\"\nSam, a technology researcher who has lived in the Netherlands for six years, shares a house with younger brother Zach just a few blocks from Amsterdam's huge Johan Cruyff Arena.\nDanish fans can enter the Netherlands if they stay in the country for less than 12 hours as part of an exemption to the entry rules for EU and Schengen area residents. The exception does not apply to Wales fans, following Brexit.\nMuch has been made of Welsh fans that can't get to Saturday evening's football game - so the Credgington brothers feel like they're two of the \"fortunate\" ones.\nAnd the brothers, originally from Undy in Monmouthshire, have said they're ready to \"shout for an entire nation\" and help represent Welsh football's Red Wall in Amsterdam.\n\"We'll be singing our hearts out all game as there won't be many of us and there could be 4,000 Danish fans in the ground,\" masters student Zach, 24, told BBC Radio Wales.\nWales defender Connor Roberts has already said \"99% of the world\" will be supporting Denmark after their \"emotionally charged\" knock-out stages qualification was inspired by midfielder Christian Eriksen and his recovery from a cardiac arrest on the pitch.\n\"Yeah, there is a few things against us on Saturday but I don't think that will affect the Wales players,\" said Sam, who was due to watch Wales in Italy last weekend before Covid restrictions stopped him.\n\"I'm reassured by the fantastic performance and win against Turkey, when Turkey had loads of fans in the ground in Baku - that was like an away game for Wales. \n\"No matter what the atmosphere is like on Saturday, I don't think it'll rattle our players who seem to rise to big occasions.\"\nThe brothers have managed to buy a Welsh flag in Amsterdam after Zach got the night off working in a bar to go to Saturday's game.\n\"As soon as it was confirmed Wales were playing here, it was excitement then chaos for us as we thought 'we've got to go',\" said Zach.\n\"Firstly we had to try and find some tickets from somewhere, then I had to get the night off work as I was due to to work.\"\n\"It's bittersweet as we're so happy that the only knock-out game in Amsterdam involves Wales. But we do wish we were in the ground with thousands of our Welsh fans and our family who usually come to Wales games with us.\n\"But as we live just around the corner from the ground and can hear the crowd cheer on match days, there's no way we could have missed this one. No way.\"\nLike the Credgington brothers, Dai Rees also lives in the Netherlands and went to watch Wales at Euro 2016 when the team reached the semi-final.\nThe music teacher - and host of Coleman Had A Dream football podcast - is travelling with eight mates, three of whom are Welsh, from their homes in The Hague.\n\"Due to the format of Euro 2020, Wales could've played in many cities across Europe for their last 16 game - and I can't believe they're coming to Amsterdam,\" Dai, from Cardiff told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"It rode on last Sunday's game with Italy. If we stayed second in the group, we were coming to the Netherlands - so when Chris Gunter went close with that header in Rome, my heart was saying score but selfishly deep down I was thinking, please don't win the group as I want to see the boys play.\n\"The fact there's so many things against us pleases me as I think we thrive when our backs are against the wall. But to try and make ourselves heard, I might smuggle a loudspeaker in for the Welsh fans!\""

      "text": "The number of people listed as missing after the collapse of a 12-storey building in the US city of Miami has risen to 159, officials say. \nFour people are known to have died.\nThe mayor of Miami-Dade says they \"still have hope\" of finding survivors. Search teams working around the clock have reported hearing people banging beneath the debris.\nWhat caused the 40-year-old building to collapse early on Thursday morning remains unclear. \nAt least 102 people have now been accounted for, but it is uncertain how many were in the building when it came down. Dozens of people have been evacuated from what is left of the structure. \nPresident Joe Biden has approved an emergency declaration for Florida, meaning the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) will help state agencies with the relief effort.\nOvernight hundreds of rescuers used sonar cameras and specially trained dogs as they scoured the rubble for survivors. Teams were tunnelling from an underground car park below the building in an effort to reach victims.\nThe mayor of Surfside, where the disaster happened, Charles Burkett, said at an early-morning news conference that some 15 families had walked out of the building.\nMost residents would have been asleep when the collapse happened at about 01:00 (05:00 GMT).\n\"It's heartbreaking because it doesn't seem to me... that we will find people alive,\" Mr Burkett said.\nHowever, on Friday Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said they would do \"everything possible\" to locate survivors. \n\"We will continue search and rescue because we still have hope that we will find people alive,\" she said. \nOvernight, search teams detected sounds of banging and other noises, but no voices coming from the tonnes of debris. Officials say the efforts are dangerous as further rubble could collapse on them.\nConstant rain and storms are further complicating an already difficult task for the search-and-rescue teams.\nAuthorities have begun taking DNA samples from relatives of those missing in case only remains of their family members are found in the rubble.\nRelatives of the missing have been huddled around a community centre a few blocks away, waiting for information and fearing the worst. They have been putting out appeals on social media for information that could help them find their loved ones.\nNicolas Fernandez said his calls to missing loved ones had gone unanswered. \n\"I think they're gone,\" he told CBS. \"I don't want to be pessimistic, but we've been calling them non-stop with no reply.\" \nJenny Urgelles woke up to the news that her parents' building had collapsed. She called them, but both their phones went straight to voicemail.\n\"I am holding on to hope. I'm very desperate to know what's happening,\" she told a local TV channel.\nA large section of the oceanfront Champlain Towers in Surfside crumbled to the ground in the early hours of Thursday.\nThe BBC's Will Grant at the scene says the collapse has left children's bedrooms visible - \"It's a very disturbing sight.\"\nEyewitnesses described hearing what sounded like thunder before seeing a huge cloud of dust in the aftermath of the collapse. One compared the scene to the 11 September 2001 attacks on the Twin Towers in New York.\nResident Barry Cohen was in bed when the building started to collapse. \"It sounded like thunder, and my wife and I, we went out on the balcony; it looked like a bomb had exploded,\" he told the BBC.\n\"When we opened the door, there was no building there, it was just a pile of rubble,\" he said. \nIt remains unknown. A full investigation will begin after the rescue mission. \nAs the building has stood since 1980, it was due its standard 40-year review. The building was undergoing its \"recertification\" process and required repairs, officials said.\nA study from researchers at Florida International University published last year found that the building had been sinking at a rate of two millimetres per year in the 1990s, which may have affected the building structurally.\nBut the author has cautioned that the study was just a snapshot in time. The building was constructed on reclaimed wetland, which experts say is always of concern as the land underneath can compact over time, leading to shifts.\nOn the sinking, the author of the study, Prof Shimon Wdowinski, told the Miami Herald newspaper: \"We've seen much higher than that, but it stood out because most of the area was stable and showed no subsidence.\"  \nProf Wdowinski said the research is not meant to suggest certainty about the latest incident. \nAre you in the area?

Today\u2019s approval by the FAA of our full commercial launch licence, in conjunction with the success of our 22 May test flight, give us confidence as we proceed toward our first fully crewed test flight this summer.\" \nVirgin Galactic has previously set out a schedule for this year, as it continues to mould the kind of service it plans to offer its commercial customers. \nThis would see four of the company's employees climb aboard Unity (along with the two pilots) for the next flight, to get a sense of the experience that future ticketed passengers will enjoy. \nThe flight after that is likely to see Sir Richard himself go to the edge of space, as a statement of readiness for commercial service. \nAnd it's then on the subsequent outing that the company is expected to start earning revenue from carrying people - although this is a mission that has been block booked by the Italian Air Force, which is going to put several payload specialists aboard Unity to supervise a number of microgravity experiments.\nIt had been speculated that Sir Richard might try to make his flight to 4 July, earning him his astronaut credentials before Jeff Bezos. The Amazon.com founder has a rocket system of his own in which he plans to ride to the edge of space on 20 July. \nA spokesperson for Virgin Galactic told the BBC on Friday that the 4 July speculation was just that - speculation. The timings of flights this summer have not been determined. \nIt's been a tough road for Sir Richard to realise his spaceflight ambitions. \nHe first announced the concept of passenger access to space in a rocket plane in 2004, with a target for services to begin in 2007. But developing the chosen technology has proved far harder than the businessman envisaged. \nHe is now, though, on the cusp of delivering. Friday's licence approval is a green light. "

      "text": "A Glasgow MP who moved herself to a safe house after a death threat wants women in public life to have more protection.\nCarol Monaghan feared for her and her family's lives when online abuse turned into the detailed threat.\nEarlier this month Jonathan Bell, 35, admitted his behaviour caused her \"fear or alarm\".\nThe SNP MP for Glasgow North West says social media companies must take action to end misogynistic abuse.\nTwitter said it takes action against accounts which violate rules on abuse and harassment. \nLike most women in politics, Ms Monaghan has always received attacks via her social media accounts.\nBut after a series of offensive tweets emerged from a particular individual, the attacks turned sinister.\nMessages she was sent included references to murdered MP Jo Cox.\nThen her constituency office in Partick was targeted, with windows being smashed.\nWhile the MP was in London, the office front was splattered with ketchup.\n\"When my staff came in it was quite a disturbing thing to see,\" she told BBC Scotland's The Seven programme. \n\"It was obviously meant to look like blood across the windows. That was the start of the physical activities.\"\nThings got worse when a death threat was made against her. \n\"It was phoned in and it contained enough details about my personal life, enough detail to cause the police to take it seriously,\" she explained.\n\"I got a call from my office manager. The police had contacted him to say there was what they considered to be a credible threat. \n\"They weren't necessarily sure I should come back to Glasgow. But I was keen that I did come back to Glasgow - my family were here.\"\nMs Monaghan was terrified for her family.\nShe said: \"Because of the personal nature of the threat and the personal details, I knew he knew where I lived, I knew he knew who my kids were. I just had to be there.\n\"That evening when we came back from the police station to the house, the police wouldn't let us into the house until the whole area had been searched. \n\"They spent the night outside the house and very early the next morning we left and went to a safe place.\"\nBell harassed the SNP MP between January and April 2019.\nAt Glasgow Sheriff Court he pled guilty to causing fear or alarm. He will be sentenced next month.\nThick skin\nMs Monaghan puts a lot of what happened down to social media. She has endured a stream of abuse and has tried unsuccessfully to engage the platforms to deal with it.\n\"Social media gives people a platform, it gives them a way of directly contacting a person - at any time of the day or night,\" she said\n\"It gives them the opportunity to say things anonymously. It gives them a whole lot of protection that the target of their abuse does not have.\"\nMs Monaghan believes any woman in a public role is party to this abuse, and says she has been told told to \"grow a thick skin\" and get used to it.\nBut, she says: \"Really, why should we take that level of abuse? We wouldn't accept it in a workplace, but we are just supposed to take it and somehow we are to blame if we don't.\"\nShe is calling for safeguards to be put in place. Her main issue is with people being untraceable.\n\"This idea that an abuser on Twitter can stay anonymous cannot be right,\" she said. \n\"I understand some people want to interact on Twitter anonymously for the best of reasons but there is also a huge hiding place for people who want to put more sinister stuff out there. We need a way of identifying users and take action against them for tweets that are offensive.\"\nThe MP has considered giving up politics because of the abuse, saying it wears her down. But although she says she is not planning to go yet, she admits she would probably not want any of her three daughters to go into politics.\nShe will keep pushing for change.\n\"Longer term, we need to consider how we deal with people in public-facing roles and how we put protections in place for them to ensure they can go about their jobs in a normal manner.\n\"I live here in Glasgow and I represent the area where I live and I love to walk about in this area. I don't want that to change. And I don't want it to change as a result of this.\"\nIn response, Twitter said: \"Abuse and harassment have no place on our service. We have clear rules in place that apply to everyone, everywhere, that address threats of violence,abuse and harassment and hateful conduct, and we take action when we identify accounts that violate these rules.\""

      "tags": "Belarus",
      "text": "A Belarusian dissident who was taken off a Ryanair jet forced to land in Minsk has been transferred to house arrest, authorities have confirmed.\nRoman Protasevich was taken into custody on suspicion of inciting unrest after his dramatic capture on 23 May.\nHis girlfriend, Russian citizen Sofia Sapega, was arrested with him and has also been moved to house arrest, Belarus's investigative committee said.\nThe EU responded to the plane incident with sanctions on Belarus.\nSince their capture during a flight from Greece to Lithuania, both EU states, Mr Protasevich and Ms Sapega have been paraded on Belarusian TV and shown confessing to criminal activity in recordings which appeared to have been made under duress. \nWestern countries accuse Belarus of hijacking the Ryanair plane under the pretext of a false bomb threat.\nMr Protasevich's father Dmitry said the charges against both detainees had not been withdrawn, BBC Russian reports.\nThe journalist, 26, faces charges that include organising mass unrest and for which he could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison, while Ms Sapega, 23, is also accused of causing unrest.\n\"The European Union, along with our like-minded partners, continues to demand their immediate, unconditional release,\" EU spokesperson Nabila Massrali said on Friday. \"They must also be able to travel to the original destination of the journey they took on board of the flight between Athens and Vilnius.\"  \nBelarus has been ruled by the same hardline president, Alexander Lukashenko, since 1994. He defied months of protests last year as opposition politicians and activists were arrested and held in prison. \nNews of the transfer was revealed to BBC Russian Service by relatives of both detainees and later confirmed by the investigative committee. The committee said the pair were \"consistently confessing\" their guilt, and it had granted their request to be released into house arrest.\nBBC Russian says they are now living in separate flats. Both had been held on remand since their arrest. \nMs Sapega's parents told the BBC they had met her in a restaurant in Minsk on Thursday, and she was now living in a rented flat in the city. \"We're in shock,\" said her stepfather Sergei Dudich.\nHouse arrest is usually seen as an alternative to jail when the detainee is not considered to be a flight risk. \n\"Of course we're pleased that she is not in a remand prison, the conditions are quite different,\" he said, describing her mood as positive. \nMr Protasevich's father, who lives with his wife in Poland, said he had not been contacted by the Belarusian authorities and did not plan to return. \"They tell us nothing about how Roma [Roman] is or about his status, it's just outrageous,\" he said.    \n\"If the form of detention has changed it's an improvement in their living conditions,\" he added. \"Otherwise we don't know what's coming next.\"  \nAnalysis by Olga Ivshina, BBC Russian\nLeaving a notoriously harsh KGB prison for house arrest will bring at least physical relief to Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega. \nBut that does not mean they have any significant freedom. We have no idea what price they may have paid for their improved detention conditions. \nA day before the move they were both spotted being filmed by a TV crew in a Minsk park. Opposition activists condemned it as a propaganda shoot, and we don't know when it will be broadcast. \nRoman Protasevich has already appeared three times on camera: on one occasion, with cuts from handcuffs visible on his wrists, he burst into tears. \nThe Sapega family lawyer said the change had come about only because of a Putin-Lukashenko summit earlier this month and the efforts of the Russian Embassy. \nBut the opposition believes Minsk buckled under pressure from the EU: that faced with the threat of painful economic sanctions, Belarus decided to ease their conditions, at least in appearance.\nThe latest EU sanctions targeted 78 individuals, including some linked to the \"forced and unlawful landing\" of the Ryanair plane. Further measures focused on key exports including tobacco, petroleum and potash fertiliser.\nDmitry Protasevich said he had found it difficult to comment on the actions of the authorities. \"Maybe he's been drawn into some political game,\" he suggested.  \nExiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya welcomed the change but said they were still hostages: \"[It] does not mean freedom, they are still facing charges. Their every step is being watched by wardens.\"\nShe noted that more than 500 \"recognised political prisoners\" were still in prison and thousands more faced \"made-up and politically motivated charges\".\nHer own husband Sergei went on trial in Belarus on Thursday accused of disorder and inciting hatred against officials."

      "tags": "NI Health,Organ donation,Robin Swann",
      "text": "Long-awaited laws on opt-out organ donation in Northern Ireland have been given approval to proceed after talks at Stormont.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan announced the decision on social media on Thursday.\nIt followed talks between Mr Givan, Health Minister Robin Swann, who proposed the legislation, and campaigners.\nMr Givan said the legislation can now proceed by way of urgent procedure to the Northern Ireland Assembly. \nIt will be up to Speaker Alex Maskey to decide on Friday when the bill can be introduced in the assembly, before the summer recess begins next week.\nMr Swann said he was pleased that the organ donation bill had been signed off by Mr Givan and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill.\nEarlier, he had accused the DUP of blocking the bill on a \"point of principle\" and described the delay as very frustrating.\nHis proposed bill would mean people automatically become donors, unless they specifically say otherwise.\nIt needed approval from the executive before it can go to the assembly.\nNorthern Ireland is the only part of the UK without a soft opt-out system, after the law in England changed last year.\nMr Givan is expected to meet campaigners at Stormont on Friday to discuss the bill's approval.\nThey have hailed the decision and said there was no time to waste in order to get the legislation through the Northern Ireland Assembly before its mandate ends.\nM\u00e1irt\u00edn MacGabhann, whose four-year-old son D\u00e1ith\u00ed has been waiting on a new heart for three years, said it was an emotional night.\n\"It's so important because time is running out on this mandate and we had until the end of this week to get this approval.\n\"So this is a massive victory but, in some ways, it's a small victory too because time is still running out. \n\"But this news tonight gives it a lot better chance of going through, so we are proud of the work we've done and the work others in the British Heart Foundation have done along with us.\"\nFollowing the announcement, the head of the British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland, Fearghal McKinney, said his organisation \"very much welcomes the decision\". \n\"Our elected representatives will now have the opportunity to consider, scrutinise and debate the issue. But we must not get complacent, this is just the start of the process,\" he said. \nJust when it looked like this legislation would become a casualty of Stormont stalling, along came another late-night surprise.\nThere had been hesitancy from some in the DUP to progress the bill, but Robin Swann and other parties had argued that the place to debate the rights and wrongs of the proposals was in the assembly - not around the executive table.\nThe DUP had also been warned that if a decision was not taken tonight, the bill would have been past the point of no return.\nThe breakthrough is significant - Stormont has been talking about amending its organ donation laws for the better part of a decade.\nHowever this is far from the end of the road for campaigners.\nThey will be anxious to make sure the bill completes its lengthy legislative journey without any further delay.\nMr Swann had said he had tried a number of times in recent weeks to bring the bill to the executive, but it had not made it onto the agenda. \nAhead of the announcement, it is understood some DUP ministers had expressed concerns about the wording of the bill.\nOthers in the DUP previously said they supported an opt-in system, rather than presumed consent for organ donation.\nCurrently donation will only proceed in Northern Ireland if a person has given their express consent, usually by signing on to the NHS Organ Donor Register or by speaking to their family.\nIn the absence of this, the family is asked to make a decision on behalf of the patient.\nThe Department of Health drew up legislation and held a public consultation aimed at changing the law.\nAll the main executive parties apart from the DUP have said they support the minister's bill.\nA similar piece of legislation to introduce an opt-out system was tabled in 2016, but rejected by the Stormont health committee.\nAt that time, some of Northern Ireland's most senior clinicians warned that Northern Ireland was not ready for such a system and described that bill as unhelpful.\nMr Swann's bill is not the only piece of legislation that has faced delay due to disagreement in the executive.\nEarlier this week, Justice Minister Naomi Long said her proposals to tackle upskirting and strengthen protections for victims of sexual abuse were being blocked.\nShe said the DUP had opposed her bill as it was too wide-ranging.\nHowever Thursday's executive meeting saw ministers agree to allow it to be introduced before the assembly's summer break, after Ms Long agreed to make some changes to the bill.\nShe criticised the DUP for what she said was its \"reckless disregard for some of the most vulnerable victims and witnesses in the justice system\".\n\"The DUP's conduct in respect of this bill has been both unacceptable and unsustainable in a five party coalition; however, I could not in good conscience, allow 75% of the bill content which included vital legislation to protect victims of serious sexual offences, child sexual exploitation and human trafficking, to be lost. \n\"It is far too important.\""

      "tags": "Domestic abuse,France,Violence against women",
      "text": "Val\u00e9rie Bacot, whose lifetime of abuse at the hands of her husband shocked France, has been found guilty of his murder but told she can leave the court a free woman.\nShe was given four years' jail, with three suspended, but released because of the year she had already served.\nBacot earlier collapsed in court when prosecutors called for her to be convicted but given clemency and freed.\nShe admitted killing her husband in March 2016 with his own gun.\nBacot, 40, described how she was abused from the age of 12 by Daniel Polette, first as her stepfather and then as her husband. For years Polette had forced her to prostitute herself with other men, but she finally snapped when he began talking about abusing their daughter.\nMore than 700,000 people signed a petition calling for her release. \nAs she left court a crowd of well-wishers applauded, to cries of \"Bravo!\". She told reporters her battle was not over.\n\"I'm not relieved... [I'm] completely shattered physically and mentally,\" she said, adding that she just wished to return to her four children.\nBacot had spent a year on remand and ahead of the jury's decision her lawyers said she should not just be freed but cleared of the charges against her.\n\"For me it's an immense victory that that woman is going back to her children tonight and I'm very moved,\" said lawyer Nathalie Tomasini. Justice had been done, she said, although she wanted the defence of \"battered-woman syndrome\" to be accepted in France as legitimate self-defence, as it was in Canada. \nEarlier, prosecutor \u00c9ric Jallet told the court in the eastern city of Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne why it was important Bacot should be convicted but still allowed to walk free.\n\"A criminal court stands for civilised values - foremost among which is the protection of life. If people take justice into their own hands, then everybody is at war with everybody else,\" he argued.\nNevertheless, imprisoning her would not provide anyone with greater protection and the risk of her committing any crime was minimal, he added. He had proposed a five-year sentence, not the four years that Bacot was given.\nVal\u00e9rie Bacot's lawyers had earlier told the court she had been driven to kill her husband because of \"the extreme violence that she suffered for 25 years and the fear that her daughter would be next\".\nHer case bears similarity to that of another French woman, Jacqueline Sauvage, who was jailed for shooting dead her abusive husband after 47 years of abuse. In 2016 Sauvage received a presidential pardon after serving two years of her 10-year sentence. The same legal team went on to work on Bacot's court case.\nPolette, who was 25 years older than Bacot, spent two and a half years in jail for assaulting her in the 1990s, but later returned to the family home and made her pregnant when she was 17. \nIn a recent book she wrote about her life story, she said she had been \"afraid all the time\" and \"had to put an end to it\".  She told the court that her husband had repeatedly threatened her with his pistol.\nShe also said that he had forced her to prostitute herself for 14 years. Details emerged in court of how she was ordered to have sex with clients in the back of the family's Peugeot minivan.\nSumming up in court, her lawyer Janine Bonaggiunta explained why French laws were not adequate for this kind of case: \"When it has been established that the case involves battered-woman syndrome, she does not spend a day in prison. I would like us too to move ahead with this.\"\nYou may be interested in:"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Vaccination is offering Scotland the \"route out\" of the pandemic, according to Nicola Sturgeon. The first minister told MSPs this week that the link between new cases and the serious health harms caused by the virus hasn't gone away - but it is weakening significantly.\nScotland recorded 2999 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday - a record high. What do recent figures show us about this link? And does this mean we no longer have to worry about case numbers?\nCases are rising fast - and there are no signs yet that the rate of new infections is slowing.\nScotland had been enjoying a sustained decline in the number of new Covid-19 cases, but that all changed on 5 May.\nSince then, the number of new Covid cases per day has mainly been rising, and at an increasing pace in recent days.\nOn 5 May, the number of cases detected over the previous seven days was 1,046. By 23 June, this figure had gone up to 11,067 - a 10-fold increase.\nScotland also has the highest case rate among all of the UK nations, reaching almost 203 cases per 100,000 people on Wednesday.\nThe sharp rise is being driven by the more infectious Delta variant, first identified in India, which accounts for more than 90% of new cases in the UK, according to the UK government.\nHowever, the Scottish government says fewer people are being treated in hospital for Covid illness now and fewer people are dying, despite this increase.\nIn short, yes.\nBut according to the government's analysis, only about 5% of people who are infected end up in hospital, rather than the 10% we were seeing before vaccination started to offer us protection.\nPeople are also staying hospital for shorter periods after being admitted.\nThe easiest way to see this is in a graph which shows the link between new cases and the number of people in hospital being treated for Covid.\nDuring the outbreaks in the autumn and over the winter, the daily figure on hospital occupancy has closely tracked the daily cases figure, but it's different this time.\nThe number of people in hospital is trending upwards, but the gap between the two lines is obvious.\nTo draw a comparison with the end of 2020, when the average number of new cases being recorded a day was similar to now, there were 1,174 Covid patients in hospital. On 23 June, there were 170.\nPublic Health Scotland publishes data on daily hospital admissions of people with a positive test for Covid, and again there appears to be a different pattern this time.\nOn 28 August, as the second wave took hold in Scotland, an average of seven people were being admitted a day. It was a similar figure on 5 May 2021, as the Delta variant began to drive a new wave of cases.\nThis next chart compares hospital admissions from those dates.\nFor the first three weeks there is not much difference at all between the two lines, but then the rate of new admissions in the autumn begins to rise at a much faster rate.\nThere is generally a lag of several weeks between new cases and Covid-related deaths, which means it is harder to draw firm conclusions on whether the link between the two figures is weakening.\nCertainly, the number of new death certificates mentioning Covid-19 in Scotland has been reasonably stable over the last few weeks.\nHowever, the rate of new deaths in the autumn did not begin to rise fast until the latter half of October - six to eight weeks after case numbers began going up.\nIn the seven days up to 6 September just two death certificates mentioned Covid-19, the lowest figure in any week since the pandemic began in Scotland.\nAfter that, weekly deaths began to rise, with 76 recorded in the seven days up to 18 October.\nLast week, there were 13 death certificates mentioning Covid-19, according to the National Records of Scotland - three weeks after this spring's low of four deaths in the middle of May.\nWhat happens to this rate in the next few weeks will give a clearer indication on how much the link with deaths has weakened.\nLinda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland she was expecting the number of deaths to go up.\n\"We will see more deaths if cases continue to increase and we're going to see those deaths in two groups - the unprotected by full vaccination and, in a small number of cases, people who have had both doses, because the vaccines are not 100% protective,\" she said. \n\"So I think it will go up, but I'm hoping that it won't go anywhere near where we were before.\"\nIn the first minister's statement to Holyrood on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon announced a \"revised strategic framework\" for tackling Covid, which took into account the protection being offered by vaccination against Covid sickness.\nShe said that previously the Scottish government was intent on suppressing the virus to the \"lowest possible level\", but this has been replaced with an aim of suppressing the virus \"to a level consistent with alleviating its harms\".\nThis essentially means that higher numbers of cases will be tolerated than in past waves of the pandemic.\nThe Scottish government's new strategy reflects the latest guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) on public health and social measures to tackle Covid.\nIn this document, the WHO says the focus can shift from case numbers to hospital admissions and intensive care rates in countries where the most vulnerable are fully vaccinated - a position Scotland will be in by next week, according to the first minister.\nBut there is a balance to be struck here.\nIf case rates are allowed to get completely out of control, then pressure will inevitably increase on the NHS and more will die, Prof Bauld said.\n\"If we really see these numbers continue to increase, it's still going to translate into some hospital admissions and people becoming very unwell.\n\"So we've just got to hold the course for a few more weeks and try and send the behavioural message that this is not a free-for-all - we all need to do our bit.\"\nA high case rate also increases the risk of new variants of concern emerging - ones that are more infectious, more deadly or which are resistant to current vaccines.\nThe WHO's document says that some form of Covid restrictions - for example isolating after a positive test - will need to be used \"for the foreseeable future\".\n\"Things are improving but it's not going away,\" Prof Bauld said.\n\"Into the winter months we're still going to have to have some mitigations... there may be [restrictions] that are put in place again, rather than everything just continuing open indefinitely.\"\nAnd Prof Bauld also cautioned against governments coming up with an acceptable death rate for Covid-19.\n\"I think there's pressure on politicians to come up with a number of tolerable deaths from this disease in the future and quite rightly they're resisting that,\" she said.\n\"There are also these constant comparisons with flu which is unfortunate, because its much more deadly than influenza - and more transmissible.\"\nThe vaccination programme has been operating for more than six months and has been made possible thanks to the hundreds of people who give the jabs. If you are one of those vaccinators, we'd like to hear from you.

      "tags": "Saskatchewan,Indigenous Canadians,Canada",
      "text": "An indigenous nation in Canada says it has found 751 unmarked graves at the site of a former residential school in Saskatchewan. \nThe Cowessess First Nation said the discovery was \"the most significantly substantial to date in Canada\". \nIt comes weeks after the remains of 215 children were found at a similar residential school in British Columbia. \n\"This is not a mass grave site. These are unmarked graves,\" said Cowessess Chief Cadmus Delorme. \nThe Marieval Indian Residential School was operated by the Roman Catholic Church from 1899 to the 1980s, when the First Nation took over operations, in the area where Cowessess is now located in southeastern Saskatchewan. It is not yet clear if all of the remains are linked to the school.\nIt was one of more than 130 compulsory boarding schools funded by the Canadian government and run by religious authorities during the 19th and 20th Centuries with the aim of assimilating indigenous youth. \nAn estimated 6,000 children died while attending these schools, according to former Truth and Reconciliation Commission chair Murray Sinclair.  Students were often housed in poorly built, poorly heated, and unsanitary facilities.\nPhysical and sexual abuse at the hands of school authorities led others to run away. \nLast month, the Cowessess began to use ground-penetrating radar to locate unmarked graves at the cemetery of the Marieval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan. Thursday's announcement marked the first phase of the search efforts. \nChief Delorme said there may have been markers for the graves at one point but that the Roman Catholic church, which oversaw the cemetery, may have removed them. Cowessess First Nation is \"optimistic\" that the church will work with them in investigating further, he said. \nIt has not yet been determined if all the unmarked graves belong to children, Chief Delorme said. Technical teams will now work to provide a verified number and identify the remains, he said. \nIn a statement, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was \"terribly saddened\" by the discovery in Saskatchewan. He said it was \"a shameful reminder of the systemic racism, discrimination, and injustice that Indigenous peoples have faced\".  \nBetween 1863 and 1998, more than 150,000 indigenous children were taken from their families and placed in these schools throughout Canada. \nThe children were often not allowed to speak their language or to practice their culture, and many were mistreated and abused. \n\"They made us believe we didn't have souls,\" said former residential school student Florence Sparvier at a press conference on Thursday. \"They were putting us down as people, so we learned to not like who we were.\"  \nA commission launched in 2008 to document the impacts of this system found that large numbers of indigenous children never returned to their home communities. The commission's landmark report said the practice amounted to cultural genocide. \nIn 2008, the Canadian government formally apologised for the system.\nThe Roman Catholic church - which was responsible for the operations of up to 70% of residential schools - has not yet issued a formal apology. \nThe May discovery of 215 children's remains at the site of a former residential school in Kamloops has thrown a spotlight Canada's past policies of forced assimilation.\nIndigenous leaders expect similar findings as the search for grave sites continues, aided by new funding from federal and provincial governments. \nCities in the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick have cancelled upcoming celebrations for Canada Day on 1 July in protest, and statues of figures involved with residential schools, including Canada's first Prime Minister John A Macdonald, have been vandalised or removed throughout the country.

      "text": "The Stormont Executive is to divert funding of more than \u00a330m in a bid to tackle Northern Ireland's growing waiting lists.\nThe move is part of a reallocation exercise known as a monitoring round.\nIt will also see extra funding of \u00a310.7m diverted to the Department of Health to cope with pharmaceutical pressures linked to Brexit.\nFinance Minister Conor Murphy presented details of his proposed June monitoring round at Thursday's executive meeting.\nOther reallocations include \u00a319m to the Executive Office to pay first-year costs of the Troubles compensation scheme, in which money will go to eligible victims and survivors of the conflict. \nMr Murphy said long-term funding for the scheme would continue to be discussed with the Treasury.\nThe Department of Education is also in line for almost \u00a336m to provide additional support for children with special educational needs (SEN).\nOther allocations include:\nMr Murphy said the detail of what areas in elective care the funding will be allocated to \"is a matter for the health department\".\nHe said a long-term strategy for investment will require \"very substantial intervention over a long number of years\".\nHe added that the Troubles compensation scheme is due to open in July after a slight delay.\n\"We haven't yet resolved the issue of who's responsible for the scheme, who pays for the scheme, that dialogue is ongoing and I hope to resolve that in the not-so-distant future,\" he said.\nHe said the money would go directly to those applying for the scheme \"so victims won't have to wait further\".\n\"It was never our desire to get into a financial wrangle over this but the British government changed the scheme substantially and handed the cost over to the executive and we've been having dialogue ever since.\"\nIn recent weeks, it has emerged that some people are waiting seven years for medical procedures in Northern Ireland.\nThe latest waiting list figures, from January to March 2021, indicated that:\nThe departmental target is that at least half of all patients should wait no longer than nine weeks for a first appointment and no-one should wait longer than 52 weeks.\nIt prompted Health Minister Robin Swann to suggest the size of Northern Ireland's waiting lists was \"undermining\" the principle of a free health service.\nHe had previously said it could take up to 10 years to tackle the issue and that many people were waiting \"too long for treatment\".\nNorthern Ireland has the worst waiting times of any UK region, with problems exacerbated by the restructuring of the health service to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMr Swann said the additional waiting list funding will go towards areas including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and psychological therapies.\n\"This will be in addition to our ongoing investment in elective care for the highest priority cases in terms of clinical need,\" Mr Swann said.\n\"While additional one-off allocations will always be welcome, a long-term solution to waiting lists requires sustained and guaranteed funding over a number of years.\"\nOther health allocations also include \u00a34.5m for Muckamore Abbey Hospital support costs, including funding for the alternative location of patients who might previously have been treated at Muckamore, \u00a31m for cyber security and \u00a311.5m capital funding.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said \"\u00a331.5m is welcome but it is a far cry from what is needed.\n\"The truth is that this is not simply a waiting list issue; it represents a serious collapse in health services for far too many people who have been told that they have to wait for years for elective care that will improve their quality of life.\"\n\"What we need is a longer-term strategic resource plan to deal with this crisis.\n\"The Department of Health and Royal College of Surgeons have identified \u00a31bn is needed over the next five years to address waiting times alone.\n\"That critical resource needs to be accompanied by a strong political agreement to transform our health service so that patients can access treatment at the point of need.\"\nEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen welcomed the funding for children with special educational needs \"after an extremely challenging year for the education sector\".\nShe said the money will be used \"to deal with the pressures caused by Covid-19\".\nMs McIlveen said the funding will \"support pressures relating to special schools and specialist support in mainstream schools, SEN support services and SEN transport\" and includes a further \u00a38m to support implementation of the new special educational needs framework."

      "title": "Colin Pitchfork: Government to ask for review of child killer's release",
      "tags": "Enderby,Narborough,DNA",
      "text": "The government will ask the Parole Board to look again at its decision to release a double child killer who was the first murderer to be convicted using DNA evidence.\nColin Pitchfork was jailed for life in 1988 for raping and murdering 15-year-olds Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth.\nEarlier this month the Parole Board said it was satisfied Pitchfork was safe for release.\nBut the justice secretary is to apply to the board to reconsider.\nRobert Buckland will write to the Parole Board on Monday, arguing that the decision to release the 61-year-old is irrational. \nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"Our heartfelt sympathies remain with the families of Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth.\n\"After a careful review, the Lord Chancellor will ask the Parole Board to reconsider its decision.\" \nUnder rules passed by Parliament to ensure judicial independence from politicians, ministers cannot block Pitchfork's release, or directly order the Parole Board to retake the decision. \nInstead, they have 21 days to make submissions to the board as to why a panel's decision is arguably wrong. \nPitchfork, who was in his 20s at the time of the attacks, left his baby son sleeping in the back of his car and raped and strangled Lynda Mann in November 1983.\nThree years later, less than a mile from where Lynda died, he raped and murdered Dawn Ashworth.\nA police investigation initially led to the wrong man, a 17-year-old who falsely confessed to one of the killings.\nAfter an unprecedented mass screening of 5,000 men using pioneering \"DNA profiling\" technology, Pitchfork was eventually caught and given a life sentence in January 1988.\nPitchfork has spent 33 years in prison and was previously denied parole in 2018.\nBut on 7 June, the Parole Board said it was satisfied Pitchfork was suitable for release, subject to conditions.\nThe panel considered more than 1,100 pages of information, victim statements and heard evidence from Pitchfork, as well as his probation officers, police and a psychologist.\nWhen Pitchfork was jailed in 1988, the then home secretary still had the power to order that he never be released.\nThe Lord Chief Justice of the time advised that the killer may never be safe to be let out - but the minister decided on a 30-year minimum term. \nSince then, governments have successfully removed themselves from decisions about managing offenders to comply with wider legal concerns that the criminal justice system should be independent of the prevailing winds of politics. \nSo today, ministers cannot directly order the Parole Board to retake a decision - Justice Secretary Robert Buckland can only hope that the judge who is asked to look at Pitchfork's papers agrees that the decision was so irrational on the evidence that it needs to be taken again. \nThe way the law works and the statistics show that very few Parole Board decisions - whether to keep someone inside or to let them out - are changed following this reconsideration process. \nThere have been at least 240 applications from prisoners for their parole refusals to be reconsidered in the last three years - and only 15 were returned for a new hearing. \nThe secretary of state has made about 32 submissions to keep someone inside. Only eight went to a full reconsideration - and only one of those led to the inmate remaining behind bars for longer. \nAlberto Costa, Conservative MP for South Leicestershire, has campaigned for Pitchfork to remain behind bars and thanked the Lord Chancellor for his intervention.\nHe said: \"The national outrage following the Parole Board's decision a few weeks ago is proof that many people remain haunted by Pitchfork's abhorrent and heinous crimes.\n\"The Parole Board now has a final opportunity to get it right.\"\nMr Buckland will formally ask the board to re-examine the decision, under the provisions of the so-called reconsideration mechanism, introduced in July 2019.\nThis allows people to challenge the board's decision if they believe them to be \"procedurally unfair\" or \"irrational\".\nHowever, the provisions make clear that \"being unhappy with the decision is not grounds for reconsideration\".\nIt is understood the Parole Board will comment on the next steps in the process once the justice secretary's formal application has been received.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,Coronavirus vaccines,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government's expansion of the UK's green travel list does not go far enough, industry leaders have warned.\nArrivals from 16 places, including Spain's Balearic islands, will not have to quarantine from 04:00 on Wednesday.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps also said the government plans to drop quarantine for fully vaccinated people returning from amber list countries \"later in the summer\".\nBut EasyJet has said the timetable \"simply isn't ambitious enough\".\nAmong the places being added to the UK's green list is Malta, which has since tightened travel rules for British holidaymakers.\nFrom 30 June, only arrivals from the UK who have been fully vaccinated - with a vaccine certificate recognised by the Maltese Health Authorities - will be allowed into Malta without having to quarantine. \nSome in the travel industry have reacted more positively to the UK government's latest travel announcement, including Thomas Cook, with the company describing the announcements as \"a good first step\" that opened up more holiday options for customers. \nEasyJet Holidays chief executive Garry Wilson said there had been a \"huge surge\" in people booking holidays to countries that had been placed on the green list. \nHowever, he questioned why more destinations, such as the Canary Islands and the Greek islands, were not added to the list.\nAnd he criticised what he described as the \"delay\" to opening up travel to double-vaccinated people, saying the UK was \"falling behind Europe\".  \nThe transport secretary said several issues still needed to be resolved before the system could be introduced, including whether children should be given the vaccine and how people from outside the UK could prove their vaccination status. \nMr Shapps told BBC Breakfast there was also a \"fairness issue\" because younger people had not yet had the opportunity to have their second jab. \nHe also defended the green watch list as a \"maximal transparency approach\" but even for countries on the regular green list he said there was no guarantee their status would not change at short notice. \nThe destinations added to the green list from 04:00 BST on 30 June are:\nSix destinations will also be added to the government's red list on 30 June. They are the Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda.\nAll the additions to the green list, with the exception of Malta, have also been added to the green watch list, signalling they are at risk of moving back to amber. Israel and Jerusalem have also been put on the watch list, the government said. \nAre you planning to go to a green list country soon? Email: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nThe Department for Transport said the plan to allow fully vaccinated people to arrive from amber list countries without having to quarantine will take place in phases, starting with UK residents. \nIt also said it plans to remove the guidance that people should not travel to amber countries, and will take clinical advice on whether regular testing could provide a safe alternative to quarantine for children accompanied by vaccinated adults.\nHowever, a spokesman said further details - such as when these changes might happen - will not be set out until next month.\nThis is the longest the green list has been since the traffic light system was introduced this year. \nThe addition of Spanish and Caribbean holiday islands is helpful for the travel industry, but it still leaves most of Europe on amber. \nThe majority of destinations have also been placed on the green watch list - a sign that they are at a higher risk of tipping to amber. Will this dissuade potential travellers from booking? \nAfter more than a week of build up, there's some disappointment that there's no guarantee of when quarantine will be dropped for fully vaccinated arrivals from amber list countries. \nWhile some in the industry are celebrating a small step in the right direction, others have already said that this is not enough to save the summer. \nReacting to the news, Sean Doyle, chief executive of British Airways, said the announcement was not enough to help the sector recover from the pandemic.\n\"We cannot afford another missed summer. There are jobs at stake, Britons separated from family members and we cannot afford to allow the success of our vaccine programme to be wasted,\" he said.\nAnd industry body Abta said the announcement \"will not on its own deliver the meaningful restart of international travel that the industry desperately needs\".\nAirline Jet2 cautiously welcomed the announcements as \"a step in the right direction\". \nHowever, chief executive Steve Heapy said the traffic light system still did not set out the criteria for placing countries in different lists. \nLabour also called for the government to publish the criteria by which it was assessing each country and said the amber list was a concern. \n\"It's essentially a nod and a wink to go if you want to go. But it doesn't give confidence to consumers to book ahead,\" shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \nMr Shapps said the Joint Biosecurity Centre, which advises the government on which countries to open up to travel, publishes the data behind its decisions including case rates, vaccination levels, the amount of sequencing of variants and the quality of data from a country. \nHowever, the prospect of European holidays does, however, face another hurdle, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested earlier this week all EU countries should make British travellers quarantine on arrival to slow the spread of the Delta variant.\nCurrently, people travelling from the UK to Greece, Spain and Portugal are not required to quarantine when they get there.\nBut those going to Italy have to self-isolate for five days then take a test, while fully-vaccinated UK visitors to France can enter without quarantining.\nCases numbers are continuing to rise in the UK, with a further 16,703 reported on Thursday. Another 21 deaths were also reported. \nMore than 60% of UK adults have now been fully vaccinated, while 82% have had at least one dose."

      "title": "Covid-19: Hancock admits breaching guidelines, and travel bookings surge",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has admitted breaking social distancing guidance with a close aide, after pictures of him kissing Gina Coladangelo - whom he appointed - were published in the Sun. In a statement, he acknowledged the breach and said he was \"very sorry\" he had \"let people down\". Labour has urged the prime minister to sack Mr Hancock - calling his position \"hopelessly untenable\". But the health secretary insists he will stay \"focused\" on dealing with the pandemic. Downing Street said Boris Johnson accepted Mr Hancock's apology and \"considers the matter closed\".\nTravel operators are reporting a surge in bookings to many of the 16 destinations added to the UK's green list on Thursday. The destinations, which include Malta and the Balearic islands, will be added to the green list from 04:00 BST on 30 June, meaning UK visitors will not have to quarantine on return. Prices of flights and hotels on the green list have swung sharply in both directions since the destinations were announced, with Jet2Holidays reporting bookings for Malta and Madeira up by almost 1,500%. But the travel industry insists the latest developments do not go far enough - while the EU is considering imposing tougher quarantine measures on UK arrivals amid concerns over the Delta variant.\nData from the Office for National Statistics show coronavirus cases have risen to their highest level since early April, but experts say vaccines have \"begun to break the link between cases and hospitalisations\". The study estimated around 153,000 people had Covid in the week to 19 June - almost 30% more than the week before. The biggest increase in positive tests was found in older teenagers and younger adults - aged 17-24 - who are most likely to mix with lots of other people, while being the least likely to be vaccinated. Friday saw another 15,810 new infections reported - and a further 18 coronavirus deaths in the UK.\nMore than one million people in the central and eastern suburbs of Sydney are in lockdown for a week, following a rise in Covid cases. Australia's biggest city is trying to contain an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant, with a further 17 new cases reported on Friday - taking the cluster to 65 cases. It is the first lockdown in Sydney since December, where residents have enjoyed almost no restrictions on daily life for the past six months. Australia has consistently maintained very low rates of Covid transmission, which has been attributed to the government's strict border control. The current outbreak has been linked to a driver who transported international arrivals from the airport.\nTours of Arsenal's famous Emirates Stadium are being offered as part of a mass Covid vaccination clinic in north London. From this Friday until Monday, advance or walk-in appointments are available to anyone over 18 who has not yet had a first dose of the vaccine - with all those who receive a jab offered a free behind-the-scenes tour. The Gunner Get Jabbed event - a pun on Arsenal's nickname - follows similar events at the Tottenham and Charlton Athletic football stadiums last weekend - and is part of a concerted push to get Londoners vaccinated.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nWith the traffic-light list of overseas travel destinations being updated, here are the rules about visiting green and amber countries.

      "tags": "Policing,Reality Check,United States",
      "text": "More people are killed by police in the US than in any other developed country, and there are growing calls for improved training to reduce the use of lethal force. \nWe've looked into what training US police officers receive, and how it compares with other parts of the world.\nAbout 1,000 people a year are killed by police officers in the US, according to an independent project that tracks police violence. Most are shot dead.\nThe majority of the world's police forces carry firearms, but no developed nation uses them against their citizens as often as officers in the US - and disproportionately against African-Americans, compared with the percentage of the population they represent. \nPart of this is to do with gun culture - the US is home to around half of the world's civilian-held firearms.\nIn 2020, fewer than 10% of people killed by police were recorded as unarmed.\nRashawn Ray, professor of sociology at the University of Maryland, says: \"In most states people can carry guns either on their body or in their vehicles, so that escalates things for police - they instantly perceive that anyone can be a threat.\"\nIn 2020, 49 police officers were shot dead while on duty.\nIn the same year, officers killed more than 20 times as many civilians - and some argue the use of force is disproportionate to the threat, with better training needed to de-escalate situations.\nProf Ray says: \"Nine out of 10 calls for law enforcement have nothing to do with violence at all, and while they definitely encounter violent situations that could escalate, often... it's police officers who are escalating the situation.\"\nThere are around 18,000 police agencies in the US, but with no national standards on training, procedures and timescales vary across the country.\nOn average, US officers spend around 21 weeks training before they are qualified to go on patrol.\nThat is far less than in most other developed countries, according to a report by the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform (ICJTR).\nThe report looked at police training requirements in more than 100 countries and found that the US had among the lowest, in terms of average hours required.\nAlso, many other countries require officers to have a university degree - or equivalent - before joining the police, but in the US most forces just require the equivalent of a high-school diploma.\nIn England and Wales, it has recently become mandatory for officers to have an academic degree.\nMaria Haberfeld, professor of police science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says: \"Some police forces in Europe have police university, where training lasts for three years - for me the standouts are Norway and Finland.\"\nFinland has one the highest gun-ownership rates in Europe, with around 32 civilian firearms per 100 people - but incidents of police shooting civilians are extremely rare.\nUS police academies spend far more time on firearms training than on de-escalating a situation - 71 hours against 21, on average, according to a 2013 US Bureau of Justice Statistics report.\nAnd in the US, the escalation of force is at the discretion of the officer, whereas in countries such as Norway and Finland, there are more rigorous rules as to what is considered justified use of force.\nProf Haberfeld says: \"Most of the training in the US is focused on various types of use of force, primarily the various types of physical force. The communication skills are largely ignored by most police academies.\n\"This is why you see officers very rapidly escalating from initial communication to the actual physical use of force, because this is how they train.\"\nICJTR executive director Randy Shrewsberry says more emphasis also needs to be put on mental-health training - both for when officers are responding to suspects and for officers themselves.\n\"Police officers are up to five times more likely to kill themselves than to be killed by homicide,\" he said. \"We'd like to see a greater emphasis on police officer mental-health training. Currently, they only get a few hours of training - if any - on self-care.\"\nThe US spends almost 1% of its GDP on policing - and some activists are calling for this to be cut and directed to other services.\nBut Mr Shrewsberry says: \"Unfortunately, when we look at defunding or budget cutbacks, training divisions are often the earliest to be hit.\"\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions"

      "text": "The pace of Europe's Covid-19 vaccination campaign has picked up and in many countries infection rates have been falling.\nLockdowns are gradually being eased as the summer tourist season gets under way, and there are plans for an EU-wide digital vaccination certificate to be in place by 1 July.\nNationwide curfew ended on 20 June, 10 days earlier than planned. Face masks are no longer required outdoors. \nRestaurants, cafes and bars can serve customers indoors, with 50% capacity and up to six people per table.\nStanding concerts will resume on 30 June and nightclubs on 9 July (with 75% capacity). People attending will need a health pass which shows either full vaccination, a negative test within the previous 72 hours, or else a previous coronavirus infection.\nRestaurants, bars, beer gardens, museums, hotels and concert halls have reopened.\nMedical grade masks are compulsory in shops and on public transport.\nLocal authorities can impose stricter rules in high infection rate areas. \nFrom 30 June, working from home will no longer be compulsory.\nOn 21 June, Italy's curfew was scrapped and the whole country, except for the northwest region of Valle d'Aosta, became \"white zone\" - the country's lowest-risk category.\nAmong the measures still in place are social distancing (1m) and the wearing of masks indoors (and in crowded outdoor places), and a ban on house parties and large gathering. \nNightclubs and discos are also closed. \nAll indoor businesses, with the exception of nightclubs, are open. \nThe government introduced a \"corona pass\" in April, the first to do so in Europe. \nThis shows - either on a phone or on paper - that you have been vaccinated, previously infected or that you have had a negative test within 72 hours. \nPeople need to show it for entry to cinemas, museums, hairdressers or indoor dining.\nThe Greek government is welcoming tourists from many countries, if they are fully vaccinated or can provide a negative coronavirus test.  \nFace coverings must be worn in all public places and there is a curfew from 01:30-05:00, but bars, restaurants, museums and archaeological sites are all open.\nCinemas, theatres, museums and restaurants are open at 50% capacity.

Most European travellers still have to present a negative Covid test on arrival.\nShops, cinemas, gyms, cafes and restaurants are open, with restrictions. Households can invite up to four people inside.\nFrom 1 July, working from home will no longer be mandatory, if the situation continues to improve. \nCultural performances, shows and sports competitions can also go ahead, with limited numbers, and more people will be allowed at weddings and other ceremonies and parties. \nPortugal has lifted many of its restrictions but face coverings must still be worn in indoor public spaces and some outdoor settings.\nBars and nightclubs remain closed, and it's illegal to drink alcohol outdoors in public places, except for pavement caf\u00e9s and restaurants. \nAlcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 unless it is with a meal.\nRestaurants, cafes and cultural venues have to close at 01:00 and have capacity limits. \nA weekend travel ban is in force in the Lisbon area, starting at 15:00 on Friday, with residents only allowed to leave for essential journeys. \nIn Lisbon and in Albufeira (Algarve), cafes, restaurants and non-essential shops have to close by 15:30 at the weekend and 22:30 on weekdays. \nRestaurants, cafes, museums and historic buildings have reopened with capacity limits. \nFrom 26 June, a number of restrictions are being lifted. \nAlcohol can be sold after 22:00, and nightclubs can open, with an entry pass system. \nEvents held in public venues such as cinemas, conference centres and concert halls will be allowed, subject to social distancing. \nMasks will no longer be compulsory except on public transport, airports and in secondary schools.\nOutdoor services in restaurants and bars returned in June. Theme parks, funfairs, cinemas and theatres, gyms and swimming pools, have reopened as well.\nFrom 5 July, restaurants and bars will be able to serve customers indoors. Weddings and other indoor events for up to 50 people will be permitted and the numbers at outdoor organised events will increase. \nSince June, pubs have been able to stay open until 22:30 and more people are now allowed at sports events, outdoor concerts, cinemas and markets.\nOn 1 July, limits on private gatherings will be raised, and the recommendation to interact with a small circle of people removed.\nFurther easing is planned on 15 July and in September.

      "tags": "Pets,Microchip implant",
      "text": "Problems with a website that holds the details of more than nine million microchipped pets across the UK are persisting, according to users.\nIn March, a database upgrade on Petlog left many owners unable to see details of their registered pets.\nCustomers report the issues are continuing three months later.\nPetlog said that all records remain safe and secure even if users can't immediately view them.\nBut some of the site's users are angry and frustrated. Dog-owner James Bricknell told the BBC he had repeatedly filled in forms, as requested by Petlog, in order to be reunited with his dog's details but had heard nothing back.\nEventually he was told his details were incorrect and he needed to fill in a \"keepership form\". He was asked to pay a \u00a317 fee even though he had updated his details on the website when he changed address.\n\"They suggest it is your fault. They are either dreadfully understaffed or the issue is far worse than they are letting on,\" he said.\nOn various pet-related Facebook groups, the BBC found a host of other complaints including: \nPetlog, which is managed by the Kennel Club, told the BBC: \"Losing a pet is traumatic and we give our absolute assurance that all pets are safely linked to their named owners on our Petlog database, so that they can be safely reunited.\n\"A very small proportion of customers will be unable to immediately view their pet's details after setting up a new online account, as we need to verify their details before making the record visible online, but this is no way affects the information held on our database or our 24/7 reunification line services.\"\nIt added that if customers were continuing to have problems, that was probably because the pet was registered under a different name, either that of their spouse, the breeder or rescue centre, or the previous owner.\nErrors with information provided by whoever microchipped the pet could also mean that \"details are not correct\".\nAnd it added:  \"We experienced a couple of rare instances when the system launched a third party implanter inputting on to a pet's record an email address that belonged to another Petlog customer, which resulted in the wrong customer record pulling through. \n\"We immediately apologised and put in place measures to ensure that the wrong customer record would no longer surface in the event of a similar third party error. We give our reassurance that this in no way affected our ability to reunite the pet and owner in question. We also contacted the ICO about this as a precautionary measure and it was decided that no further action is required.\"\nThe Information Commissioner's Office confirmed to the BBC it had received a small number of complaints and had offered advice to the Kennel Club.\nOn Petlog's Facebook page, it said its customer service team were \"working through high volumes and enquiries and resolving issues as quickly as possible\".\nIan Webb, who runs Dun-Roamin', a rehoming centre for dogs, said he believed the website has deteriorated over recent years.\n\"Every so-called improvement has, in my opinion, as a behavioural consultant and a rescuer, made everything worse and far less secure and reduced the chances of reunification in the event of your pet going missing.\n\"The most recent update has given me doubt over every chip I have ever registered over the past 14 years.\"\nThere are currently 15 Defra-compliant pet chip databases in the UK. All are connected to veterinary surgeries around the country in order to allow vets to check whether a lost pet is registered to an owner.\nFor a short while Petlog was not able to talk to one of these databases, but the issue has since been resolved.\nDefra told the BBC: \"We are a nation of dog-lovers, and microchips are often the only hope of reuniting people with their pets. Our databases are all connected, so if a lost pet is scanned, the microchip number is all that is needed to identify it and reunite it with its registered keeper.\n\"We are currently reviewing the microchipping regulations, which will consider if any changes to the way the databases operate are needed, and will publish proposals this year.\""

      "text": "Vaccination is offering Scotland the \"route out\" of the pandemic, according to Nicola Sturgeon. The first minister told MSPs this week that the link between new cases and the serious health harms caused by the virus hasn't gone away - but it is weakening significantly.\nScotland recorded 2999 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday - a record high. What do recent figures show us about this link? And does this mean we no longer have to worry about case numbers?\nCases are rising fast - and there are no signs yet that the rate of new infections is slowing.\nScotland had been enjoying a sustained decline in the number of new Covid-19 cases, but that all changed on 5 May.\nSince then, the number of new Covid cases per day has mainly been rising, and at an increasing pace in recent days.\nOn 5 May, the number of cases detected over the previous seven days was 1,046. By 23 June, this figure had gone up to 11,067 - a 10-fold increase.\nScotland also has the highest case rate among all of the UK nations, reaching almost 203 cases per 100,000 people on Wednesday.\nThe sharp rise is being driven by the more infectious Delta variant, first identified in India, which accounts for more than 90% of new cases in the UK, according to the UK government.\nHowever, the Scottish government says fewer people are being treated in hospital for Covid illness now and fewer people are dying, despite this increase.\nIn short, yes.\nBut according to the government's analysis, only about 5% of people who are infected end up in hospital, rather than the 10% we were seeing before vaccination started to offer us protection.\nPeople are also staying hospital for shorter periods after being admitted.\nThe easiest way to see this is in a graph which shows the link between new cases and the number of people in hospital being treated for Covid.\nDuring the outbreaks in the autumn and over the winter, the daily figure on hospital occupancy has closely tracked the daily cases figure, but it's different this time.\nThe number of people in hospital is trending upwards, but the gap between the two lines is obvious.\nTo draw a comparison with the end of 2020, when the average number of new cases being recorded a day was similar to now, there were 1,174 Covid patients in hospital. On 23 June, there were 170.\nPublic Health Scotland publishes data on daily hospital admissions of people with a positive test for Covid, and again there appears to be a different pattern this time.\nOn 28 August, as the second wave took hold in Scotland, an average of seven people were being admitted a day. It was a similar figure on 5 May 2021, as the Delta variant began to drive a new wave of cases.\nThis next chart compares hospital admissions from those dates.\nFor the first three weeks there is not much difference at all between the two lines, but then the rate of new admissions in the autumn begins to rise at a much faster rate.\nThere is generally a lag of several weeks between new cases and Covid-related deaths, which means it is harder to draw firm conclusions on whether the link between the two figures is weakening.\nCertainly, the number of new death certificates mentioning Covid-19 in Scotland has been reasonably stable over the last few weeks.\nHowever, the rate of new deaths in the autumn did not begin to rise fast until the latter half of October - six to eight weeks after case numbers began going up.\nIn the seven days up to 6 September just two death certificates mentioned Covid-19, the lowest figure in any week since the pandemic began in Scotland.\nAfter that, weekly deaths began to rise, with 76 recorded in the seven days up to 18 October.\nLast week, there were 13 death certificates mentioning Covid-19, according to the National Records of Scotland - three weeks after this spring's low of four deaths in the middle of May.\nWhat happens to this rate in the next few weeks will give a clearer indication on how much the link with deaths has weakened.\nLinda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland she was expecting the number of deaths to go up.\n\"We will see more deaths if cases continue to increase and we're going to see those deaths in two groups - the unprotected by full vaccination and, in a small number of cases, people who have had both doses, because the vaccines are not 100% protective,\" she said. \n\"So I think it will go up, but I'm hoping that it won't go anywhere near where we were before.\"\nIn the first minister's statement to Holyrood on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon announced a \"revised strategic framework\" for tackling Covid, which took into account the protection being offered by vaccination against Covid sickness.\nShe said that previously the Scottish government was intent on suppressing the virus to the \"lowest possible level\", but this has been replaced with an aim of suppressing the virus \"to a level consistent with alleviating its harms\".\nThis essentially means that higher numbers of cases will be tolerated than in past waves of the pandemic.\nThe Scottish government's new strategy reflects the latest guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) on public health and social measures to tackle Covid.\nIn this document, the WHO says the focus can shift from case numbers to hospital admissions and intensive care rates in countries where the most vulnerable are fully vaccinated - a position Scotland will be in by next week, according to the first minister.\nBut there is a balance to be struck here.\nIf case rates are allowed to get completely out of control, then pressure will inevitably increase on the NHS and more will die, Prof Bauld said.\n\"If we really see these numbers continue to increase, it's still going to translate into some hospital admissions and people becoming very unwell.\n\"So we've just got to hold the course for a few more weeks and try and send the behavioural message that this is not a free-for-all - we all need to do our bit.\"\nA high case rate also increases the risk of new variants of concern emerging - ones that are more infectious, more deadly or which are resistant to current vaccines.\nThe WHO's document says that some form of Covid restrictions - for example isolating after a positive test - will need to be used \"for the foreseeable future\".\n\"Things are improving but it's not going away,\" Prof Bauld said.\n\"Into the winter months we're still going to have to have some mitigations... there may be [restrictions] that are put in place again, rather than everything just continuing open indefinitely.\"\nAnd Prof Bauld also cautioned against governments coming up with an acceptable death rate for Covid-19.\n\"I think there's pressure on politicians to come up with a number of tolerable deaths from this disease in the future and quite rightly they're resisting that,\" she said.\n\"There are also these constant comparisons with flu which is unfortunate, because its much more deadly than influenza - and more transmissible.\"\nThe vaccination programme has been operating for more than six months and has been made possible thanks to the hundreds of people who give the jabs. If you are one of those vaccinators, we'd like to hear from you. Why did you get involved and how many jabs have you administered? \nYou can now get in touch with BBC Scotland on the phone messaging service, WhatsApp. \nTo start using the app, simply download WhatsApp on to your smartphone free from the internet.\nThen add our WhatsApp number +44 7902 704679 to your phone's contact list.\nPlease make sure you read our terms of use and privacy policy."

      "text": "MSPs have agreed to extend emergency measures prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic until March 2022.\nThe move covers temporary rules around court hearings, evictions, care homes and bankruptcy and debt arrangements.\nSome opposition parties argued against extending the powers beyond September, with the government aiming to drop most legal restrictions from early August.\nBut Deputy First Minister John Swinney said some \"essential\" measures would have to continue beyond that date.\nLegislation making the change of dates was pushed through Holyrood in three days under emergency procedures, with the parliament now going into recess until September.\nMSPs have already been told that they will be recalled in July and August when decisions are made about easing restrictions further.\nThe number of Covid-19 cases in Scotland has increased sharply in recent days, with 2,999 positive tests recorded on Wednesday - a higher daily figure than at any point during the \"second wave\" in January.\nHowever with the vaccine programme continuing to roll out the government aims to move the whole country to the lowest level of restrictions from 19 July, before lifting most legal curbs from 9 August.\nMany of the most stringent coronavirus restrictions, such as the travel ban and stay at home orders, were underpinned by UK legislation.\nHowever MSPs also passed emergency bills in April and May 2020 making provisions about issues within Holyrood's remit, including a block on evictions and changes to the courts system to allow trails to take place over video links.\nThese measures - which the government said would \"only last as long as is required\" - were due to expire on 30 September, but this has now been extended for six months, to 31 March 2022. \nMSPs could then make a further extension of six months, to September 2022, without passing a new law.\nMr Swinney told MSPs that further legislation would be drawn up after recess to \"look at longer-term issues\" and deal with the legacy of the pandemic - saying that some temporary provisions may be made permanent.\nThe new legislation rolls back some seldom-used provisions, such as an extension to the time limit for people to complete Community Payback Orders and for delays in responding to Freedom of Information requests.\nHowever many others are to be extended, including rules allowing court and tribunal hearings to be held remotely, emergency directions for care homes, and an extended notice period for tenants facing eviction.\nSome of these are measures which are still in regular use, while others - like the provision allowing the government to release prisoners in the event of major Covid outbreaks among prison staff - are being kept on in case they may be needed later.\nThe Scottish Conservatives argued that \"excellent progress\" had been made in tackling the pandemic via the vaccine programme, and that Covid was \"no longer the serious threat to health that it was this time last year\".\nMSP Murdo Fraser said it was \"right to ask how long the extraordinary, unprecedented powers that have been given to ministers should continue\", pointing out that Holyrood is sitting in September and could consider the bill then after further scrutiny and consultation.\nHowever Mr Swinney said waiting months to decide on the bill would \"leave a note of uncertainty in the minds of a whole range of organisations\" about the future, saying it was sensible to settle \"deeply practical and operational issues concerning the running of public services\".\nThe Lib Dems joined the Conservatives in opposing the bill, saying powers would be in place \"far longer\" than were needed and would give the government \"unprecedented rights\" to push through legislation without scrutiny.\nHowever with Labour and the Greens joining the SNP in supporting the legislation, it passed by a vote of 90 to 32."

      "text": "Covid measures like wearing facemasks could be just advice and not legal once all adults in Wales have had a second Covid jab, the first minister has said.\nMark Drakeford also said Wales' rising case numbers in the third Covid wave could peak in July as he confirmed a delay in more lockdown easing.\nHe said any changes could come once the link between rising cases and people in hospital with Covid is broken.\nHealth chiefs said rising cases were mainly among children and young people.\nAnnouncing the latest review of lockdown rules in Wales, Mr Drakeford confirmed there would be no  changes to the restrictions over the next three weeks \"because of the spread of the Delta variant in Wales and across the UK\".\nIt comes as Wales became the first UK nation to fully vaccinate half of its population on Friday.\n\"When everybody has had two doses we will have a much clearer understanding of the relationship between vaccination and falling ill and hospitalisation,\" Mr Drakeford said.\n\"So let us just for a moment take an optimistic view, because in so far as we understand the data at the moment it's looking a bit more optimistic, at that point the things that we would have restored at level one [of restrictions] would have been restored.\n\"People would be able to meet indoors in larger numbers, we would have been able to re-open some further parts of the Welsh economy, people would be able to mix in greater numbers.\n\"And it may - and this is more provisional, I think - we may be moving away from the mandation of those very important actions we all take in our own lives and continue to advise people to abide by them.\"\nThe decision not to ease more lockdown restrictions was backed by opposition parties.\nPublic Health Wales (PHW) incident director Dr Giri Shankar had warned there is \"concern\" over a \"significant\" rise in cases across north Wales. PHW is now closely monitoring whether hospitalisations will increase.\nHe said case rates, that have been increasing across Wales, are now doubling every seven to ten days.\nWales' national Covid infection and test positivity rates have continued to rise as PHW reported on Friday one more person has died and 336 further people have tested positive for coronavirus.\nPHW said Wales' case rate is now 37.6 per 100,000 people while the positivity rate is up to 2.9% - the highest rates since March.\nWales' first minister said there were about 1,100 cases of the Delta variant of concern, that originated in India, in Wales - more than double last week's total.\nMr Drakeford warned that cases of the more transmissible variant are \"rising\" and this is driving up the all-Wales coronavirus case rate.\nBut he said it is highest in north Wales, where as many as 97% of new coronavirus are caused by the delta variant. \nHe also added Covid cases are higher and rising faster in younger people compared with older people.\nMr Drakeford said there was \"a big gap\" between the two age groups with the all-Wales rate around 67 cases per 100,000 people in the under 25s compared to 9 cases for the over 60s.\n\"In north Wales, where cases are at their highest, the rates are more than seven times higher for the under 25s in Flintshire than for the over 60s,\" he said.\nMr Drakeford added that more than nine out of 10 people over 65, together with healthcare staff and people living in older people's care homes in Wales have had two doses of the vaccine.\nPHW said it will take another two to three weeks to see the impact of the rise on hospital admissions, given most of the vulnerable and elderly have been fully vaccinated.\n\"We are concerned about the significant increase in new cases over the past few weeks,\" said Dr Shankar.\n\"It's the younger age groups in whom we are seeing the most new cases. \n\"We are closely observing whether this level of community activity is having any impact on hospital admissions. At the moment there are no signals to suggest they are going up but we are keeping a very close eye on that.\"\nWhile rates are rising across Wales, it is across the north that it seeing the steepest rise amid a series of clusters.\nFlintshire has the highest Covid-19 rate per 100,000 of population with 110 cases with fellow north Wales counties Conwy and Denbighshire second and third.\nPHW believes the increase in north Wales is linked to travel across from cities such as Manchester and \nAt the press conference, the first minister said that in previous waves there has always been a lag between infections in the community and an increase in hospitalisations and deaths. \n\"If this wave follows the same pattern, we can expect to see hospitalisations and deaths peaking in August,\" Mr Drakeford said.\n\"What we don't yet know is what impact our high rates of vaccination will have and how much the relationship between infections and hospitalisations has been weakened.\"\nOpposition parties have broadly supported the delay any easing of lockdown rules in Wales as daily Covid case numbers hit a four-month high on Thursday.\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth, whose Ynys Mon constituency has seen a cluster in Rhosneigr, said he was \"hopeful\" but felt restrictions should not be eased yet.\n\"We need to know what effect the rise in cases and the vaccinations are having on hospital admissions,\" he told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"Whilst we are waiting for the scientific and data evidence we still need to keep things pretty tight.\"\nHowever the Welsh Conservatives have called on the Welsh government to follow the UK and Scottish governments with a proposed date for lifting lockdown.\n\"Wales is the only mainland UK nation not to have a date for easing lockdown restrictions,\" Vale of Clwyd MS Gareth Davies told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We had only one death with Covid recently and minimal hospitalisations so the data is showing positive signs.\n\"So the Welsh government needs to respond to this and give the people of Wales some hope with a roadmap out of lockdown.\""

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "The BBC has complained to the UN about Iran's harassment of staff at the BBC Persian service.\nIt says Iranian intelligence agents have threatened to kidnap London staff and take them to Iran.\nThis is not the first time the BBC has taken the rare step of appealing to the UN for their safety. \nIran has previously denied the allegations, and accused BBC Persian of spreading false information to encourage its government's overthrow.\nThe BBC's legal representatives have urged the UN's Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to take action on the issue.\nAn estimated 18 million Iranians - almost a quarter of Iran's population - regularly use the BBC's Persian service online, on radio or via satellite television.\nBut the Farsi language service is banned in Iran, and authorities there have previously detained people for alleged links to the BBC outlet.\nIn an internal survey of 102 BBC Persian staff, carried out in March 2020, 71 said they had experienced harassment. A third have also had one or both parents harassed or called in for questioning by Iranian authorities, and over half say they feel under pressure to leave their jobs.\nOn Thursday, the BBC hosted a virtual side event, coinciding with a UNHRC meeting, to raise concern about what it says is an escalating campaign of harassment by Iran towards BBC Persian journalists and other Farsi-language media. \nAmong those speaking at the event was BBC Persian reporter Kasra Naji, who spoke about the threats and cyberbullying, which he, his colleagues and their families had endured.\nMr Naji said that, over the 2020 Christmas period, six staff had family members called in for questioning by Iranian intelligence agents. All were allegedly told to pass on death threats to their London-based relatives. \nDuring every interrogation, officials made reference to Ruhollah Zam - a Paris-based opposition journalist who was enticed to travel to Baghdad in 2019, where he was kidnapped and taken to Iran. Mr Zam was executed last year for allegedly fomenting unrest with his writing.\n\"Perhaps the most shocking thing is the intelligence officers who made these threats against our lives were so comfortable that they handed over their phone numbers for us to contact them - acting with total impunity on behalf of the state,\" said Mr Naji.\n\"We ask you to help shine a light on what's happening to us. It's the only way to safeguard us,\" he added. \"It's a matter of life and death for us - and our families - to speak out.\"\nThe BBC says Iran began targeting its Persian service after the country's 2009 presidential elections, when millions of Iranian took to the streets claiming their votes had been stolen.\nAllegations of fraud led to months of unrest, which Iranian authorities blamed on Western governments and international media - including the BBC.\nSince then, the BBC says staff have been subjected to a campaign of harassment and death threats, which has escalated in recent years, warranting UK police protection in a number of cases. \nIn one instance, a reporter received threats to her life via Skype, and was told to quit - or to spy on her colleagues - in return for the freedom of her 27-year-old sister, who had been arrested in Iran.\nBack in 2017, Iran's judiciary also issued a freeze on all assets of BBC Persian staff. Then in 2018, Iran accused 152 current and former staff and contributors of \"conspiracy against national security\", and initiated criminal investigations.\nThat year, the BBC made its first complaint to the UN, and in March 2019 a group of UN experts condemned Iran's treatment of the broadcaster, saying that its actions violated international law and \"ultimately [constituted] serious threats to global security\"."

The least they deserve is to have been made aware of the risk facing them as soon as it came to light. \n\"It is astounding to learn that throughout this Nicola Sturgeon was aware of this scandal and did not say a word.\n\"It is hard to see this as anything other than playing politics with people's health.\" \nAnd Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton claimed the error had been \"deliberately hidden from the public\" until after last month's Scottish Parliament election. \nHe added: \"It is a cynical abuse of power to only disclose this serious adverse event months later and on the afternoon when parliament breaks up for the summer. \n\"It is an insult to the women who were failed by the errors in this screening programme.\"\nThe error came to light in a routine audit of a single unnamed health board. \nAll health boards were then examined and 434 women were found to have been wrongly excluded from screening.\nMs Todd said a \"small number\" of the women had subsequently developed cervical cancer. \nShe said the number was less than five but she could not say exactly how many because it risked identifying the women.\nMost hysterectomies involve the removal of the cervix and then there is no further need for cervical cancer screening. \nHowever, sometimes a hysterectomy is performed where part or all of the cervix remains and those women should remain on the screening programme if they are within the eligible age range.\nMs Todd told parliament it was an \"extremely complex issue, spanning a number of decades and involving a variety of potential errors\".\nShe told BBC Scotland the errors included: \nScottish Conservative health spokeswoman Annie Wells said it was concerning that further cases were still to be potentially identified.\nShe added: \"SNP ministers have serious questions to answer as to how urgently they addressed this issue. \n\"They were first made aware of these errors in March well before Parliament shut down for the election, but only started sending out letters to women this week. That is simply not good enough.\n\"It is now imperative that the SNP government clearly outline every step they are taking to encourage women who are concerned about being affected to get in touch.\"\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "text": "Men who were sexually abused as boys at a training school for Roman Catholic priests have welcomed a bishop's \"momentous\" apology.\nThe group were pupils at St Peter Claver College in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, when they were molested in the 1960s and 70s.\nAt a meeting with the men, the Bishop of Leeds said their abusers were people they should have been able to trust.\nOne victim said the apology marked a changing attitude from the church.\nSt Peter Claver was a seminary run by a Roman Catholic mission, The Verona Fathers, now known as the Comboni Order.\nFormer students who experienced sexual abuse at the school said their complaints had been ignored for decades by the church.\nOne victim, Bede Mullen, said the abuse and the way the victims had been treated had a major impact on all of their lives, with the message up until now being: \"Go away and forget it.\"\n\"It's a constant presence, it's always there - the feeling you are not being believed,\" he said.\n\"Two of our members have died before this apology. Many have suffered fractured lives largely due to their experiences as children,\" he said.\nHe said the bishop's apology was the first time a senior figure in the church had acknowledged what had happened to them.\n\"It has been a long journey, it has taken decades. It is a tremendous gesture by the bishop and we are deeply appreciative of it.\"\nMr Mullen has previously said that boys at the seminary were called from their dormitory at night to visit the priests in their room, often on the pretext of saying prayers together.\nThere were occasions when one priest joined boys in the showers on the pretence of hurrying them up, he said.\nAt a meeting attended remotely by high-ranking church officials, The Bishop of Leeds, the Rt Rev Marcus Stock, said he had spent much time \"praying and reflecting\" on how to express the shame he felt for the victims' abuse and their subsequent treatment. \nWhile he accepted the personal apology could be viewed as \"too little, too late\", he offered the men his \"heartfelt apology for the pain and trauma\" they had experienced.\n\"I wish, therefore, here and now, to apologise to you personally and unreservedly for the childhood sexual abuse you suffered,\" he said.\n\"Because they have been ignored, because they have not been listened to, and that too is a form of abuse and that is why it was important I had this meeting with them.\"\nHe said the Pope was aware the men had not had an \"adequate pastoral response\" from the leadership of the Comboni Order.\nAnother victim, Mark Murray, from St Asaph, Denbighshire, Wales, said the apology was \"a momentous thing\".\n\"We've never had that. We've always been ignored, really,\" he said.\nMr Murray added that the only time the church had previously engaged with the victims was through the courts.\n\"I think it highlights a change in the Catholic church, where more people are beginning to listen to victims and survivors,\" he said.\nThe meeting was also attended by Cardinal Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, and Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, who is Adjunct Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith - the body responsible for dealing with clerical sexual abuse cases within the Catholic church.\nMr Mullen said the men hoped to get a meeting with the Pope and were encouraged by the presence of Archbishop Scicluna.\nThe Comboni Order paid compensation in 2014 to 11 men who said they had been abused at the college, however it has never formally acknowledged the abuse.\nMr Murray said he did not think he would trust any apology from the order: \"An apology from the Combonis may be seen as a forced apology and I wouldn't want that. It has to come from the heart.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr Mullen said: \"You can't wait for over a decade for an apology and believe it.\"\nDuring the meeting, the Bishop of Leeds acknowledged he had not been successful in arranging a meeting between the victims and the Comboni Order.\nIn a statement issued following the bishop's apology, The Comboni Order said: \"It was with great sadness and regret that we learned about the allegations of non-recent abuse relating to our former junior seminary which closed in 1984.\n\"We acknowledge the harm caused by child abuse and have publicly apologised for any abuse suffered by former seminarians.\"\nIt said it had worked to respond with \"seriousness and sensitivity to the complaints and claims made\" and had co-operated with the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse.\nIt said it condemned any action which caused \"harm or distress\" to others.\n\"The health, safety and wellbeing of every child remains our absolute priority, and we subscribe to the comprehensive national safeguarding policies and procedures of the Catholic Church in the UK to ensure this is paramount,\" the statement added.\nWest Yorkshire Police investigated reports of historical sexual abuse at the seminary, but said as two of the named suspects were dead, the investigation could go no further.\nA third suspect is alive, but is in Italy and cannot be extradited because of ill health.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Israel has reintroduced a requirement to wear masks indoors amid a rise in coronavirus cases, just days after it lifted the measure.\nConcern has grown after the country recorded more than 100 new daily cases in successive days after registering zero earlier this month.\nMost of the cases have been linked to the Delta variant from abroad.\nIsrael has been one of the most successful countries in the world in tackling the pandemic.\nIt implemented the fastest vaccination programme, under which well over half the population of 9.3m has been partially or fully immunised.\nBut on Thursday, 10 days after the mandate was lifted, Israel's coronavirus response chief Nachman Ash said people would once again need to wear masks indoors to try to stem the rise in cases.\n\"We are seeing a doubling every few days,\" Mr Ash told public radio. \"Another thing that's worrying is that the infections are spreading.\"\nThe requirement to wear masks had been the last remaining restriction after all other measures, imposed during lockdown earlier this year, had been gradually dropped.\nAmid fears of a resurgence of the disease, the town of Binyamina in the north which registered the highest rate of cases in the country was designated a \"red zone\" on Wednesday - the first to be listed as such for months.\nIsrael has also postponed the reopening of the country to vaccinated tourists by one month.\nFollowing the outbreak of the pandemic in late-2019, Israel became one of the worst affected countries in the world, registering about 60,000 infections per week at its peak in January. It imposed three lockdowns and ultimately saw a dramatic decline in cases as its vaccination programme was rolled out.\nMore than 6,400 people have died with the virus in Israel. "

      "text": "Covid measures like wearing facemasks could be just advice and not legal once all adults in Wales have had a second Covid jab, the first minister has said.\nMark Drakeford also said Wales' rising case numbers in the third Covid wave could peak in July as he confirmed a delay in more lockdown easing.\nHe said any changes could come once the link between rising cases and people in hospital with Covid is broken.\nHealth chiefs said rising cases were mainly among children and young people.\nAnnouncing the latest review of lockdown rules in Wales, Mr Drakeford confirmed there would be no  changes to the restrictions over the next three weeks \"because of the spread of the Delta variant in Wales and across the UK\".\nIt comes as Wales became the first UK nation to fully vaccinate half of its population on Friday.\n\"When everybody has had two doses we will have a much clearer understanding of the relationship between vaccination and falling ill and hospitalisation,\" Mr Drakeford said.\n\"So let us just for a moment take an optimistic view, because in so far as we understand the data at the moment it's looking a bit more optimistic, at that point the things that we would have restored at level one [of restrictions] would have been restored.\n\"People would be able to meet indoors in larger numbers, we would have been able to re-open some further parts of the Welsh economy, people would be able to mix in greater numbers.\n\"And it may - and this is more provisional, I think - we may be moving away from the mandation of those very important actions we all take in our own lives and continue to advise people to abide by them.\"\nThe decision not to ease more lockdown restrictions was backed by opposition parties.\nPublic Health Wales (PHW) incident director Dr Giri Shankar had warned there is \"concern\" over a \"significant\" rise in cases across north Wales. PHW is now closely monitoring whether hospitalisations will increase.\nHe said case rates, that have been increasing across Wales, are now doubling every seven to ten days.\nWales' national Covid infection and test positivity rates have continued to rise as PHW reported on Friday one more person has died and 336 further people have tested positive for coronavirus.\nPHW said Wales' case rate is now 37.6 per 100,000 people while the positivity rate is up to 2.9% - the highest rates since March.\nWales' first minister said there were about 1,100 cases of the Delta variant of concern, that originated in India, in Wales - more than double last week's total.\nMr Drakeford warned that cases of the more transmissible variant are \"rising\" and this is driving up the all-Wales coronavirus case rate.\nBut he said it is highest in north Wales, where as many as 97% of new coronavirus are caused by the delta variant. \nHe also added Covid cases are higher and rising faster in younger people compared with older people.\nMr Drakeford said there was \"a big gap\" between the two age groups with the all-Wales rate around 67 cases per 100,000 people in the under 25s compared to 9 cases for the over 60s.\n\"In north Wales, where cases are at their highest, the rates are more than seven times higher for the under 25s in Flintshire than for the over 60s,\" he said.\nMr Drakeford added that more than nine out of 10 people over 65, together with healthcare staff and people living in older people's care homes in Wales have had two doses of the vaccine.\nPHW said it will take another two to three weeks to see the impact of the rise on hospital admissions, given most of the vulnerable and elderly have been fully vaccinated.\n\"We are concerned about the significant increase in new cases over the past few weeks,\" said Dr Shankar.\n\"It's the younger age groups in whom we are seeing the most new cases. \n\"We are closely observing whether this level of community activity is having any impact on hospital admissions. At the moment there are no signals to suggest they are going up but we are keeping a very close eye on that.\"\nWhile rates are rising across Wales, it is across the north that it seeing the steepest rise amid a series of clusters.\nFlintshire has the highest Covid-19 rate per 100,000 of population with 110 cases with fellow north Wales counties Conwy and Denbighshire second and third.\nPHW believes the increase in north Wales is linked to travel across from cities such as Manchester and \nAt the press conference, the first minister said that in previous waves there has always been a lag between infections in the community and an increase in hospitalisations and deaths. \n\"If this wave follows the same pattern, we can expect to see hospitalisations and deaths peaking in August,\" Mr Drakeford said.\n\"What we don't yet know is what impact our high rates of vaccination will have and how much the relationship between infections and hospitalisations has been weakened.\"\nOpposition parties have broadly supported the delay any easing of lockdown rules in Wales as daily Covid case numbers hit a four-month high on Thursday.\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth, whose Ynys Mon constituency has seen a cluster in Rhosneigr, said he was \"hopeful\" but felt restrictions should not be eased yet.\n\"We need to know what effect the rise in cases and the vaccinations are having on hospital admissions,\" he told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"Whilst we are waiting for the scientific and data evidence we still need to keep things pretty tight.\"\nHowever the Welsh Conservatives have called on the Welsh government to follow the UK and Scottish governments with a proposed date for lifting lockdown.\n\"Wales is the only mainland UK nation not to have a date for easing lockdown restrictions,\" Vale of Clwyd MS Gareth Davies told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We had only one death with Covid recently and minimal hospitalisations so the data is showing positive signs.\n\"So the Welsh government needs to respond to this and give the people of Wales some hope with a roadmap out of lockdown.\""

      "tags": "Grant Shapps,Matthew Hancock",
      "text": "Labour has called on Boris Johnson to sack Matt Hancock amid reports of an extra-marital affair with a close aide.\nIt said that if the health secretary had been \"secretly having a relationship\" with Gina Coladangelo - whom he appointed - this would be a \"blatant abuse of power\".\nBut Mr Hancock's colleagues rallied around him, calling allegations of an affair \"a personal matter\".\nThe Sun published pictures of Mr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo kissing.\nIt said these had been taken in the Department of Health offices in May this year.\nMr Hancock cancelled a visit to a Covid vaccination centre at Newmarket Racecourse, in his constituency, on Friday morning, a few hours after the Sun's story was published. \nMs Coladangelo, who has known the health secretary since they were at Oxford University together, was made a non-executive director of the Department of Health last September.\nThe role comes with a \u00a315,000 salary and involves 15-to-20 days of work per year.\nA government spokesman said Ms Coladangelo's appointment had been \"made in the usual way\" and had \"followed correct procedure\".\nBut Labour Party chairwoman Annaliese Dodds said: \"If Matt Hancock has been secretly having a relationship with an adviser in his office - whom he personally appointed to a taxpayer-funded role - it is a blatant abuse of power and a clear conflict of interest.\n\"The charge sheet against Matt Hancock includes wasting taxpayers' money, leaving care homes exposed and now being accused of breaking his own Covid rules.\n\"His position is hopelessly untenable. Boris Johnson should sack him.\"\nBorn in Cheshire in October 1978, he studied at Oxford and Cambridge universities.\nHe worked for his family software firm and as a Bank of England economist before becoming chief of staff to George Osborne when he was shadow chancellor. \nMr Hancock was elected MP for West Suffolk in 2010, becoming a minister in 2012 and being promoted to culture secretary in January 2018.\nHe has been health secretary since July 2018 and ran for Conservative leader in 2019, pulling out of the contest after coming sixth in the first MPs' ballot. \nMr Hancock is married with three children and is a keen cricketer and horse rider, having won a race at the Newmarket course, in his constituency, in 2012.\nThe Liberal Democrats called on Mr Hancock to resign and accused him of \"hypocrisy\" over social distancing.\nHealth spokeswoman Munira Wilson said: \"He was telling families not to hug loved ones, while doing whatever he liked in the workplace.\"\nFollowing the publication of the Sun's story, a friend of the Mr Hancock told the BBC he had \"no comment on personal matters\", adding: \"No rules have been broken.\"\nTransport Secretary Shapps also told Sky News that Ms Coladangelo - who is also marketing and communications director at fashion and homeware retailer Oliver Bonas - would have gone through an \"incredibly rigorous\" process to get her government role.\nInternational Development Secretary Truss told the BBC: \"[Mr Hancock] does have my support [in cabinet]. This is a personal matter. I understand that he hasn't broken any of the rules.\"\nMs Coladangelo, 43, is married to Oliver Bonas founder Oliver Tress and Mr Hancock's wife of 15 years, Martha, is an osteopath.\nThe government's guidelines for England on hugging friends who are not part of your household states that people can exercise \"personal judgement\", but should remain cautious.\nIn May last year, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson resigned from the government's scientific advisory group (SAGE) after it emerged he had broken lockdown rules when a woman he was reportedly in a relationship with visited his home.\nMr Hancock called Prof Ferguson's actions \"extraordinary\", adding that social distancing rules were \"there for everyone\" and were \"deadly serious\"."

      "tags": "Tourism,Easyjet,British Airways,Travel & leisure industry,Ryanair,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The prices of flights and hotels for new green list travel destinations have swung sharply in both directions since the guidance was changed on Thursday. \nThe government added 16 destinations to the list. Travellers returning from these do not have to isolate on return. \nDestinations include Malta and Spain's Balearic Islands, and some holidays have doubled in price, the Independent's travel editor Simon Calder said.\nAirlines have added extra capacity.\nInitially when these new flights have become available, prices have fallen as extra supply takes up the demand.\nBut this has proved to be short-lived in many cases: \"Availability is changing by the minute,\" said Mr Calder, who has been checking prices regularly since the announcement.\n\"Immediately after it was made there was still quite a lot of keenly priced flights and holidays, but we're back down to 'last seat' showing.\"\n\"Madeira and Malta, for example, were looking pretty reasonable, but then things really took off. Unless you're sitting in front of a screen there's no way of gauging which trend line you're on,\" he added.\nEasyJet said: \"When new flights are put on sale the starting fares may be lower compared to existing flights with many seats already booked.\n\"Like all airlines, our pricing is dynamic which means that our fares start low and increase the closer it is to the date of departure and as more seats on the aircraft are booked.\"\nThe destinations added to the green list from 04:00 BST on 30 June are:\nEurope: The Balearic Islands (which include Ibiza, Menorca, Majorca and Formentera), Malta and Madeira\nCaribbean: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat and Turks and Caicos Islands\nOther British Overseas Territories: Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory and Pitcairn\nSix destinations will also be added to the government's red list on 30 June. They are the Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda.\nOperators contacted by the BBC were concentrating mainly on satisfying demand for the Balearic Islands, Majorca, Menorca and Ibiza, and Malta. \nBA said it was reviewing its schedule and had added some additional flights and upgraded some routes to larger aircraft, for example to Malta and the Balearic Islands.\nEasyJet said it was also adding seats and holiday packages and new routes, also focussing on Malta and the Balearics.\nNew routes to Malta from Bristol and Luton will launch next month and offer some seats at \u00a327.99.\nRyanair said it was selling 200,000 extra seats on flights from the UK to Malta, Ibiza and Palma for July, August and September.\nRyanair's Dara Brady called the latest announcement a \"small step in the right direction\" but called on the government to add Cyprus, the Canary Islands and Greek islands to the green list.\nJet2holidays said there had been a \"huge surge\" in bookings.\nIt reported the highest volume of bookings to the Balearic Islands in almost a year, with bookings for July alone up more than 3,000%.\nBookings for Malta and Madeira also jumped by almost 1,500%.\nSeveral factors influence the price of airline tickets. These include how many seats are available, how many people are looking for tickets, the popularity of the route, and the time of the day the journey takes place. \nDue to computer algorithms, airlines can alter the price of tickets by the minute. For example, an algorithm can pick up when lots of customers are looking to purchase a particular ticket and then trigger an automatic response. \nHowever, it's not all computers that set the price, humans play a role too. Revenue managers will sometimes manage automatic systems from time-to-time.\nPeter Morris, chief economist at Ascend consultancy and a veteran with 25 years in aviation, says approaches do differ between airlines and they typically sell tranches of tickets with prices increasing as long as sales are going well.\nRead more about how prices rise for flights.\nJet2.com and Jet2holidays have put more than 70 additional flights on sale to Malta and Madeira with immediate effect and a new route to Malta from London Stansted is being added.\nSteve Heapy, chief executive of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays, said the response from customers had been \"truly incredible\".\n\"Bookings to Majorca, Menorca, Ibiza, Malta and Madeira have gone through the roof, which shows just how much UK holidaymakers want to get away.\"\nThe Independent's Mr Calder said: \"It's now a matter of 'can you time it right' so you go in just when the new flight goes on. \n\"If you do you can still get a bargain. Otherwise you are competing with people prepared to spend many of hundreds of pounds to get away to what are, after all, still a very small number of destinations compared with normal years.\"\nThe new rules on travel will, of course, change as situations develop.\nAnd the countries on the UK's Green List have their own set of rules.\nFor example, Malta will only allow people in to the country without quarantine if they present an approved valid vaccine certificate. \nAn email from its High Commission in London said on Friday afternoon: \"This means that only people who have a vaccination certificate recognized by the Superintendent for Public Health can enter Malta from the United Kingdom without the need of quarantine.\"\nIt said anyone who did not meet the entry requirements should make a formal request to the Public Health Superintendence to authorise entry to Malta at covid19.vetting@gov.mt. Further conditions may then apply. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps has said the UK government plans to drop quarantine for fully vaccinated people returning from amber list countries \"later in the summer\".\nHowever, EasyJet has said the timetable \"simply isn't ambitious enough\".\nThe transport secretary said issues such as whether children should be given the vaccine and how people from outside the UK could prove their vaccination status needed to be resolved before the system could be introduced.\nHe added there was also a \"fairness issue\" with young people yet to receive their second jabs."

Some could be technologies from another nation like China or Russia, others could be natural atmospheric phenomena like ice crystals that could register on radar systems, while the report also suggested some could be \"attributable to developments and classified programs by US entities\".\nThe one case they could identify \"with high confidence\" was identified as \"a large, deflating balloon\", the report said. \nIt added that the UAP posed \"a clear safety of flight issue and may pose a challenge to US national security\".\nThe taskforce is now \"looking for novel ways to increase collection\" of reports and gather more information, adding that \"additional funding\" could \"further study of the topics laid out in this report\".\nThe US Department of Defense released videos of the UAPs in April 2020.

All but one have been dismissed by US courts, or withdrawn by prosecutors.\nLawyers for Mr Giuliani said they were disappointed with the New York ruling.\n\"Our client does not pose a present danger to the public interest,\" they said in a joint statement. \"We believe that once the issues are fully explored at a hearing Mr Giuliani will be reinstated as a valued member of the legal profession that he has served so well in his many capacities for so many years.\"\nIn their decision, the judges said Mr Giuliani had made several false statements about voting in the states of Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania - including claims that hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots and other votes had been improperly counted.\nThe court rejected Mr Giuliani's argument that investigations into his conduct violated his right to free speech. It also suggested the suspension may eventually be permanent.\nThe suspension itself marks a big change in fortunes for Mr Giuliani, who once had a prominent legal and political career in New York.\nHe was admitted to the state bar in 1969 and eventually served as US Attorney for the Southern District of New York under the Ronald Reagan administration.\nHe became the city's mayor in 1994 and later earned widespread national praise for his response to the 11 September 2001 attacks.\nThursday's development comes only months after Mr Giuliani's home and office were raided by the FBI as part of an unrelated investigation into his alleged dealings with Ukraine."

      "text": "A school did its best to help boys with their \"rage and frustration\" after they got HIV through contaminated blood, a public inquiry has heard.\nAt least 72 pupils died after being treated at Lord Mayor Treloar College in Hampshire in the 1970s and 1980s.\nFormer headmaster Alex Macpherson told the Infected Blood Inquiry the revelation of the boys' HIV positive status \"had a dreadful effect on them\".\nHe said: \"They were going to die and that was it. You just had to help.\"\nThe boarding school, at Holybourne near Alton, catered for haemophiliac children via a specialist NHS centre on site.\nFrom 1974 to 1987 boys were given the factor VIII clotting agent, which was often imported from overseas.\nBatches were widely contaminated with hepatitis A, B, C and later HIV, infecting thousands of haemophiliacs across the UK.\nMr Macpherson, who was the headmaster from 1974 to 1990, said infected pupils were offered counselling and distractions.\nHe told the inquiry: \"What they had was a rage inside them, a frustration, that suddenly they had been made ill and they were going to die in the not-too-distant future.\n\"You could see it when you talked to them... It was a result of this disease. It had a dreadful effect on them.\"\nInquiry lead counsel Jenni Richards QC said some pupils were not properly informed of their HIV status.\nShe said \"There are witnesses who recall being told in a group with other pupils... 'You have it, you don't, you have it, you don't'.\n\"We've heard evidence this week which suggests that some pupils may not have been told at all.\"\nMedical records seen by the inquiry earlier this week showed the school's NHS centre began to monitor pupils for HIV as early as 1983.\nMr Macpherson said: \"If they didn't take immediate action when they knew that infected blood was being used, I'm very surprised.\n\"I think that was remiss, that was a mistake, which I would say was culpable. If that is true, that's disgraceful.\"\nThe public inquiry is due to resume in July."

      "text": "Before the image of George Floyd lying under the knee of a policeman set off shock, anger and protests across the US, the arch of his life crossed crests and troughs.\nThere were highs, as when he, as a teenager in Houston, played American football for the 1992 Texas state champion runners-up Yates High School Lions.\nThere were lows, as when he was arrested for robbery in 2007 and served five years in prison.\nBut mostly, it would seem that Floyd, who was 46 when he died in Minneapolis on 25 May, 2020, was simply trying to live life as any other American, in search of betterment in the face of both personal and societal challenges.\nHis death amid a public health crisis and economic calamity that has killed more than 100,000 Americans and left over 40 million unemployed has become the latest totem of the ills that plague the country in 2020.\nA native of Houston, Texas, Floyd grew up in the neighbourhood at the heart of the city's black community, the Third Ward, just to the south of the city centre.\nBeyonc\u00e9 grew up there, as did Bayou City's blues music scene. Drake, a Canadian rapper, paid homage to its musical vibrancy, and Floyd himself is thought to have 'spit bars' as part of the hip-hop group in the 1990s in Houston. \nBut poverty, racial division and economic inequalities mark its history, too, as with any American city. Marred by segregation in the 20th Century, the Third Ward Floyd left in recent years has seen gang violence and tensions over housing. \n\"Anytime I take somebody who's not from there, people actually are like 'man, oh my God, I've never seen poverty like this.\n\"It looks like a bomb went off, what happened?'\" Ronnie Lillard, a friend from the neighbourhood tells the BBC. \n\"People are still living in shot-gun shacks that were erected in the 1920s. The poverty is thorough... and being from that area, it's hard to escape,\" says Mr Lillard, a rapper who performs under the name Reconcile.\nFloyd was well known in the council estate housing project, Cuney Homes, he adds. \"Cuney Homes is known as 'The Bricks' and if you're from there they call you 'a brickboy'. He was a brickboy.\"\nGrowing up a gifted athlete standing at six feet six inches, friends who knew Floyd as a teenager described him as a \"gentle giant\" who shone on the field in two sports, basketball as well as American football.\n\"I was blown away, cause at 12 years old he was six-foot-two,\" Jonathan Veal, a childhood friend and former teammate, told local media. \"I had never seen anyone that tall before\".\nAt John Yates High School, he wore number 88 in the tight end position for the football team, and was later recruited to play basketball at South Florida State College in Avon Park, Florida, where he was a student from 1993 to 1995, according to CNN.\nHe returned to Texas for a school year at Texas A&M University, Kingsville, but did not complete his degree.\nHis life then took a different turn, with a string of arrests for theft and drug possession culminating in an armed robbery charge in 2007, for which he was sentenced to five years in prison.\nHe became involved in his local ministry, Resurrection Houston, after his release and was intent on making changes in himself and his neighbourhood, says Mr Lillard.\n\"While he was embracing his own life change, he was looking around at his community.\" \nA video of Floyd decrying gun violence, believed to be filmed in 2017, has circulated on social media, in which he implored young people to \"come home\".\nHis family told the Houston Chronicle he moved to Minnesota in 2018 after being encouraged by friends through a Christian work programme.\nChristopher Harris, a friend and former classmate, told US media Mr Floyd \"was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning\".\n\"He was happy with the change he was making,\" he added.\nThe former athlete found work as a security guard at a local Salvation Army charity, and then took on jobs as a lorry driver and dance club bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro, where he was known as \"Big Floyd.\"\nLike many Americans, however, he found himself laid off amid mass business closures resulting from the Covid-19 crisis. \nOn the day of his arrest, he was said to have been attempting to buy cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill.\nAnger over Mr Floyd's death has spurred protests across the US, with some descending into chaos and violence.\nOver 1,600 people have been arrested in nearly two dozen cities, and the National Guard deployed in 15 states. \nMr Lillard, who described his friend as a \"person of peace\", would have supported people's rights to be heard and for change, but would not have condoned the looting or the violence. \n\"He had a heart bent towards forgiveness, but he also was a man of the people, too,\" he said. \"Even before his death, he was aware that people were hurting.\"\n\"I think this thing has grown into something more than George Floyd,\" he added, speaking of the protests. \"I think you're watching frustration that America has with America [itself].\""

      "text": "Researchers working in Israel have identified a previously unknown type of ancient human that lived alongside our species more than 100,000 years ago.\nThey believe the remains uncovered near the city of Ramla represent one of the \"last survivors\" of a very ancient human group.\nThe finds consist of a partial skull and jaw from an individual who lived between 140,000 and 120,000 years ago.\nDetails have been published in the journal Science.\nThe team members think the individual descended from an earlier species that may have spread out of the region hundreds of thousands of years ago and given rise to Neanderthals in Europe and their equivalents in Asia.\nThe scientists have named the newly discovered lineage the \"Nesher Ramla Homo type\".\nDr Hila May of Tel Aviv University said the discovery reshaped the story of human evolution, particularly our picture of how the Neanderthals emerged. The general picture of Neanderthal evolution had in the past been linked closely with Europe.\n\"It all started in Israel. We suggest that a local group was the source population,\" she told BBC News. \"During interglacial periods, waves of humans, the Nesher Ramla people, migrated from the Middle East to Europe.\"\nThe team thinks that early members of the Nesher Ramla Homo group were already present in the Near East some 400,000 years ago. The researchers have noticed resemblances between the new finds and ancient \"pre-Neanderthal\" groups in Europe. \n\"This is the first time we could connect the dots between different specimens found in the Levant\" said Dr Rachel Sarig, also from Tel Aviv University. \n\"There are several human fossils from the caves of Qesem, Zuttiyeh and Tabun that date back to that time that we could not attribute to any specific known group of humans. But comparing their shapes to those of the newly uncovered specimen from Nesher Ramla justify their inclusion within the [new human] group.\"\nDr May suggests that these humans were the ancestors of Neanderthals.\n\"The European Neanderthal actually began here in the Levant and migrated to Europe, while interbreeding with other groups of humans.\"\nOthers travelled east to India and China, said Prof Israel Hershkovitz, suggesting a connection between East Asian archaic humans and Neanderthals in Europe. \n\"Some fossils found in East Asia manifest Neanderthal-like features as the Nesher Ramla do,\" he said.\nThe researchers base their claims on similarities in features between the Israeli fossils and those found in Europe and Asia, though their assertion is controversial. Prof Chris Stringer, from the Natural History Museum in London, UK, has recently been assessing Chinese human remains.\n\"Nesher Ramla is important in confirming yet further that different species co-existed alongside each other in the region at the time and now we have the same story in western Asia,\" he said.\n\"However, I think it's a jump too far at the moment to link some of the older Israeli fossils to Neanderthals. I'm also puzzled at suggestions of any special link between the Nesher Ramla material and fossils in China.\"\nThe Nesher Ramla remains themselves were found in what used to be a a sinkhole, located in an area frequented by prehistoric humans. This may have been an area where they hunted for wild cattle, horses and deer, as indicated by thousands of stone tools and bones of hunted animals.\nAccording to an analysis by Dr Yossi Zaidner at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, these tools were constructed in the same manner that modern humans of the time also made their implements.\n\"It was a surprise that archaic humans were using tools normally associated with Homo sapiens. This suggests that there were interactions between the two groups,\" Dr Zaidner said.\n\"We think that it is only possible to learn how to make the tools through visual or oral learning. Our findings suggest that human evolution is far from simple and involved many dispersals, contacts and interactions between different species of human.\"\n Follow Pallab on Twitter."

      "tags": "NI Health,Organ donation,Northern Ireland Assembly,DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Robin Swann",
      "text": "About 180 lives could be \"changed\" each year by a long-awaited law on opt-out organ donation in Northern Ireland, Health Minister Robin Swann has said.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan announced the legislation had been given approval to proceed on Thursday.\nIt followed talks between Mr Givan, Mr Swann, who proposed the legislation, and organ donation campaigners.\nThe proposed bill would mean people automatically become donors unless they specifically say otherwise.\nIt needed approval from the Stormont executive before it could go to the assembly.\nThe first minister said the legislation could proceed by way of urgent procedure.\nMr Swann said discussions on the law had been \"going on for quite a while\".\nThe Ulster Unionist MLA said Mr Givan's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had \"concerns that we needed to address\" and he believed that conversations with campaigners \"convinced them that this bill was able to go to the next step\".\nIt was \"not a done deal\", he added, \"but we have got it on to the floor of the assembly\".\nEarlier, he had accused the DUP of blocking the bill on a \"point of principle\" and described the delay as very frustrating.\nMr Givan announced the movement on legislation in a social media post in which he thanked campaigners \"for their efforts\".\nIt will be up to Speaker Alex Maskey to decide when the bill can be introduced in the assembly before the summer recess begins on 10 July.\nMr Maskey has a minimum of seven days to conduct legal scrutiny of any bill.\nMr Swann told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme: \"We think it will see an additional 10 to 20 donors in Northern Ireland per year.\n\"That's the possibility of eight to nine organs per donor so that could have the impact of changing up to 180 lives in Northern Ireland per year.\n\"These are about live-saving operations and life-changing operations so that's the real step that we are going to see with this legislation when it does come in.\"\nNorthern Ireland is the only part of the UK without a soft opt-out system, after the law in England changed last year.\nCurrently donation will only proceed in Northern Ireland if a person has given their express consent, usually by signing on to the NHS Organ Donor Register or by speaking to their family.\nIn the absence of that, the family is asked to make a decision on behalf of the patient.\nM\u00e1irt\u00edn MacGabhann, whose four-year-old son D\u00e1ith\u00ed has been waiting for a new heart for three years, said he \"was shaking\" after he was personally told the news by Mr Givan ahead of the first minister's social media post on Thursday.\n\"We are just so happy that it has got to this stage because what Robin Swann said there is time is still of the essence,\" he told Good Morning Ulster.\n\"It gives us a chance, it gives us a fighting chance.\"\nMr MacGabhann and his family met Stormont's first and deputy first ministers and health minister at Stormont Castle on Friday.\nSpeaking afterwards, he said he was \"so delighted and so proud of our wee D\u00e1ith\u00ed\".\n\"His wee smile has united all those on the hill,\" he continued.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan, who said he signed up to the donor register \"many years ago\", explained he was \"delighted\" that the legislation would now go forward.\n\"It became very clear to me that we needed to get progress on this issue,\" he said.\n\"What this is about is people like D\u00e1ith\u00ed, people that are in need of that life-saving organ, and we need to encourage more people to do that.\"\nMr Givan said his party was in support of the decision taken on Thursday.\nAll of the executive parties apart from the DUP had expressed backing for the minister's bill.\nAhead of the announcement, it is understood some DUP ministers held concerns about the wording of the bill, while others in the party supported an opt-in system, rather than presumed consent for organ donation.\nSome of Northern Ireland's most senior clinicians had warned that Northern Ireland was not ready for such a system and described that bill as unhelpful.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the legislation was \"powerful\" and D\u00e1ith\u00ed was \"the face\" of the campaign. \n\"It is very much a positive day,\" she said.\n\"This is, for me, a demonstration of good politics and politics in action and actually politics making a difference in people's lives.\"\nDr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association Council in Northern Ireland, welcomed the legislation move \"after years of delay\".\nHe said: \"Up to 115 people in Northern Ireland are on the transplant waiting list and last year 11 people died waiting for an organ, so ensuring this legislation is progressed as quickly as possible is vital to saving lives. \n\"We hope our elected representatives continue to work towards introducing a soft opt-out system and we look forward to continuing to engage with them on this important issue.\"\nMr Swann's bill is not the only piece of legislation that has faced delay due to disagreement within the executive.\nThis week, Justice Minister Naomi Long said her proposals to strengthen protections for victims of sexual abuse were being blocked.\nThe DUP had opposed her Justice Bill as it was too wide-ranging, she said, but on Thursday ministers supported an amended version.\n\"It is a very good day for people who have been victims and are victims of sexual abuse or human trafficking because this is the green light for us to be able to take forward some really key provisions from Sir John Gillen's review of serious sexual offences procedures,\" Mrs Long told Good Morning Ulster.\nSir John Gillen reviewed Northern Ireland's sex crime procedures after a high-profile rape trial in 2018 and he made more than 250 recommendations, many of which were aimed at making the system less traumatic for abuse victims.\nMrs Long explained that the new legislation agreed by Stormont minsters includes:\nMrs Long, the Alliance Party leader, said she believed it was \"public pressure of public campaigning\" which made ministers agree the legislation before the impending deadline of this assembly term.\nShe said: \"I mean, can you imagine the public anger if these serious sexual offence cases had not been able to be dealt with?\""

      "text": "Coronavirus cases have risen to their highest level since early April, when lockdown restrictions first began to be lifted, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures suggest.\nBut these and other figures indicate the vaccination programme is making a significant difference.  \nThe study estimated around 153,000 people had Covid in the week to 19 June - almost 30% more than the week before.\nIt's still ten times lower than the January peak, though.\nThe ONS study, which has run throughout most of the pandemic, takes swabs from a sample of the UK population, whether or not they have symptoms. \nThis allows it to monitor the virus, even in those who don't know they have it or won't otherwise come forward for testing. \nAlthough cases, hospital admissions and deaths have been on the rise, the deaths haven't risen nearly as much as we'd expect, based on this number of cases pre-vaccines. \nDr Jenny Harries - Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency- said the vaccines had \"begun to break the link between cases and hospitalisations\". \nBut she warned that while they \"provide excellent protection, they do not provide total protection\" - so caution was still needed.\nThe ONS found a clear increase in the percentage of people testing positive in England and Scotland, while the trend was \"uncertain\" in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe highest percentage of people testing positive was in the North West of England, followed by the North East (0.3%) - but Scotland saw a bigger increase in cases than England, despite having fewer cases overall. \nThe biggest increase in positive tests was found in older teenagers and younger adults - those aged 17-24. This group is among the most likely to mix with lots of other people, while being the least likely to be vaccinated.\nPeople aged 25-34 had been on a similar upward trend but this appears to have been curtailed by the introduction of vaccines, and cases in this age group are falling again.  \nThis comes as Public Health England figures - also published on Friday - show a 46% increase in the number of Delta variant Covid cases in the last week, with most cases being in the under-50s. \nThe 80,000 (or 90% of) Delta cases found in under-50s have led to eight deaths - none of these had been double-vaccinated.

      "text": "People from Wales going abroad for \"urgent\" travel can now access their Covid-19 vaccination status online, the Welsh government has said. \nPaper vaccine certificates have been available since May, with documents posted to those who needed to urgently travel internationally. \nEluned Morgan, the health minister, said people should only travel abroad if it is essential.\nMore than half of the Welsh population are now fully vaccinated. \nPaper certificates will still be available for those who are unable to access the digital pass, which can be downloaded to display on a person's phone, tablet or laptop.\nThe Welsh government has advised people to register to download the digital pass at least two weeks before they are due to travel abroad, as well as to check entry requirements for the destination country and follow travel rules. \nBaroness Morgan said she was \"pleased that people in Wales can now access their vaccination status via the NHS Covid Pass if they need to travel urgently and have completed their vaccine course\".\n\"It's important to remember that the Welsh government advice on travel hasn't changed, and people should only consider international travel if absolutely essential,\" she added.\nWork is ongoing to allow people in Wales to use England's NHS App to show proof of their vaccination status, as has been possible over the border since May.\nOn Wednesday, First Minister Mark Drakeford told the Senedd 10,000 people had already received vaccine certificates in Wales.
