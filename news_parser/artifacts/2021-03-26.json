      "tags": "Alba Party,Scottish independence,Alex Salmond,Scottish Parliament",
      "text": "Former SNP leader Alex Salmond has announced the creation of a new pro-independence party which will contest the Scottish Parliament election.\nThe former first minister said he would be among the candidates who will stand for the Alba Party on regional lists.\nMr Salmond said the aim was to build \"a supermajority for independence\" at Holyrood after the election in May.\nOther parties described Mr Salmond as \"discredited\" and questioned his suitability for public office.\nThe announcement came at the end of a dramatic week at Holyrood.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Salmond said he would take fresh legal action over the conduct of the Scottish government's top civil servant.\nA report by MSPs on Tuesday described the government's handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond as \"seriously flawed\".\nThe previous day, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was cleared of breaching the ministerial code over her involvement in the Alex Salmond saga.\nAlex Salmond is no stranger to making a political comeback - he was twice elected leader of the SNP and served for two separate spells as an MSP. \nOn the day he stood down from Holyrood for the second time, he told me he would consider returning if Scotland became independent. \nFive years later, he's decided to attempt a comeback anyway - on the basis that the SNP and Greens need his help to make independence happen. \nThe SNP has questioned the appropriateness of his return to public life given the controversy over his personal conduct in recent years. \nWhen I asked him today if he owed an apology to any or all of the women who have complained about his behaviour, Mr Salmond said he accepted the outcomes of the two court cases and three inquiries and wanted to move on.\nMr Salmond was acquitted of all charges in a criminal trial and successfully challenged the Scottish government's process for handling harassment complaints against him in the civil court. \nThat his reputation has suffered damage along the way would come as no surprise. But it will now be for voters to decide whether or not they want one of the biggest figures in modern Scottish politics back in the frontline. \nMr Salmond said that under his leadership, the Alba Party was seeking to \"build a supermajority for independence in the Scottish parliament\".\n\"The party's strategic aims are clear and unambiguous - to achieve a successful, socially just and environmentally responsible independent country,\" he said.\n\"We intend to contribute policy ideas to assist Scotland's economic recovery and to help build an independence platform to face the new political realities.\"\nIt plans to field at least four candidates on the regional lists in every part of the country.\nPeople have two votes in Holyrood elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another in a regional ballot designed to make the overall result more proportional.\nMr Salmond claimed that if Alba won regional list seats, this could lead to there being 90 or more MSPs at Holyrood who support independence.\nSCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat elections are happening? On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government. Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Scottish Parliament have? MSPs pass laws on most aspects of day-to-day life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and welfare benefits. Defence, foreign policy and immigration are decided by the UK Parliament.\nHow do I vote?\u00a0Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You can\u00a0register to vote online. \nHe said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has already dismissed the SNP's request for a second independence referendum, would \"find it much more difficult to say no to a parliament and a country.\"\nThe SNP said there were \"real questions\" about Mr Salmond's suitability to return to public office.\nA spokesperson said: \"This is perhaps the most predictable development in Scottish politics for quite some time.\n\"At this time of crisis, the interests of the country must come first and should not be obscured by the self interest of someone who shows no sign whatsoever of reflecting on serious concerns about his own conduct.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: \"Alex Salmond is a discredited figure who admitted appalling behaviour towards women during his time as SNP first minister and right-thinking people will want nothing to do with him or his new party.\"\nHe added that his party would do \"everything possible\" to block another independence referendum and \"ensure the Scottish Parliament works towards rebuilding and recovery after the pandemic\".\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the people of Scotland deserved more than \"score settling\" and \"old politics\".\nHe said: \"We are still in the midst of a pandemic. Lives and livelihoods are still at risk.\n\"This election must be about our national recovery and the people of Scotland's priorities, not the old arguments between personalities who believe their interest matters more than the national interest.\"\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrats chair Alistair Carmichael MP said the move was evidence of a feuding within the Nationalist movement.\nHe said: \"There are no questions about Scotland's future to which Alex Salmond is the answer.\n\"This astonishing announcement shows just how divided the SNP are. A few years ago no one could have imagined that the former first minister and his protege would be at one another's throats.\"\nThe Scottish Greens' Ross Greer told the BBC News Channel: \"This is the very public meltdown of a thoroughly disgraced individual.\"\nHe said the election should be about the future and described Mr Salmond as \"a man from Scotland's past who is obsessively pursuing personal vendettas\".\n\"Alex Salmond is less popular in Scotland than Boris Johnson. I'm quite sure that very quickly after today we can go back to ignoring what is a very sad sideshow.\"\nIn 2019, the Scottish government admitted it had acted unlawfully while investigating allegations of sexual harassment against Mr Salmond, which he strongly denied.\nThe following year he was acquitted of all 13 charges of sexual assault after a trial at the High Court.\nGiving evidence, Mr Salmond said that in hindsight he wished he had been \"more careful with people's personal space\".\nHis defence lawyer, Gordon Jackson, told the court Mr Salmond had not always behaved well and could have been \"a better man on occasions\" - but had never sexually assaulted anyone."

      "tags": "Ursula von der Leyen,Coronavirus vaccines,Emmanuel Macron,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "France has accused the UK of \"blackmail\" over its handling of coronavirus vaccine exports, amid continuing tensions over supply chains.\nForeign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was asked whether the EU had been \"scammed\" by sending millions of doses to the UK while its own rollout stuttered.\n\"We need to build a co-operative relationship,\" he told France Info radio. \"But we cannot deal this way.\"\nFrance has called for the EU to implement tougher export controls.\nVaccine rollouts have started sluggishly across the bloc, and the EU has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering its promised doses. AstraZeneca has denied that it is failing to honour its contract.\nThe EU is expecting to receive about 30 million AstraZeneca doses by the end of March, less than a third of what it was hoping for.\nThe UK's vaccination drive, meanwhile, has so far been more successful than that of the EU's 27 member states.\nOn Thursday, following a virtual summit where EU leaders discussed vaccine supplies, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was the \"region that exports most vaccines worldwide\" and invited other countries to \"match our openness\".\nShe also said AstraZeneca must \"catch up\" on its deliveries to the EU before exporting doses elsewhere.\nOn Friday, Mr Le Drian said the EU \"shouldn't be paying the price\" for the UK's vaccination policy.\nHe also criticised its approach to purchasing jabs, claiming the UK would struggle to source and supply second shots.\n\"The United Kingdom has taken great pride in vaccinating well with the first dose except they have a problem with the second dose,\" he said.\n\"One can't play with blackmail,\" he added. \"You can't be playing like this.\"\nThe foreign minister did not specify what he considered to be blackmail, but earlier this week UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that strict EU export controls could negatively hit investment in member states.\n\"I would just gently point out to anybody considering a blockade... that companies may look at such actions and draw conclusions about whether or not it is sensible to make future investments,\" he said.\nMr Le Drian is not the only senior French figure to have called for tighter controls on doses sent from the EU. \nPresident Emmanuel Macron told reporters on Thursday that the virtual summit marked \"the end of naivety\" from the bloc. \"I support the fact that we must block all exports for as long as some drug companies don't respect their commitments,\" he said.\nEU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, meanwhile, singled out AstraZeneca for criticism. \n\"AstraZeneca has been an issue,\" he said. \"I just remind you that we were expecting to have 120 million doses... and finally we got 30 million. So we had a problem with this company.\"\nOn Thursday, following hours of talks, EU leaders gave their backing in principle to toughening vaccine export controls.\nBut they stopped short of a banning exports altogether, and a post-summit statement emphasised the importance of maintaining the global supply chains needed to produce vaccines.\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen, however, voiced frustration at AstraZeneca and threatened to block exports from the UK-Swedish company until it delivered its promised doses to the EU.\n\"The company has to catch up, [it] has to honour the contract it has with European member states, before it can engage again in exporting vaccines,\" she said.\nElements of the AstraZeneca vaccination are manufactured in a number of EU states.\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said while his fellow leaders had found the Commission's tougher export measures \"acceptable\", he hoped they would never be used - a message echoed by his Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo.\nMember states also agreed to try and ramp up the production of vaccines within the bloc. They called on manufacturers to \"ensure predictability of their vaccine production and respect contractual delivery deadlines\".\nA third wave of infections is sweeping across much of mainland Europe.\nEU states have seen some of the deadliest outbreaks of the pandemic, with Italy recording more than 106,000 deaths, France 93,000, Germany 75,000 and Spain 73,000.\nYet recent figures show just 12.9 doses of vaccine have been administered per 100 people in the EU compared with 44.7 in the UK and 37.2 in the US.\nFrance's Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said 400,000 people had been vaccinated on Friday, which is just under the UK's daily average. The country is hoping to step-up its vaccination programme in the coming weeks.\nAlso on Friday, Europe's medicines regulator approved three factories for the production of coronavirus vaccines. A site in the Netherlands was cleared to produce the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, while a German factory was given the go-ahead to make Pfizer/BioNTech doses.\nA manufacturing site for the Moderna jab in Switzerland was also approved.\nSpeaking earlier this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the British variant had become the dominant strain circulating in Germany and amounted to \"a new pandemic\".\n\"The situation is serious,\" she said. \"Case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive care beds are filling up again.\"\nLockdowns have been re-imposed or extended in countries like Belgium or the Netherlands but there is particular concern over eastern EU states.\nPoland will close nurseries, pre-schools and hairdressers for two weeks from Saturday after coronavirus cases surged."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "\"Stay-local\" rules will lift in Wales from Saturday and unrestricted travel within its borders will be allowed.\nIt means Wales will be the first UK nation to scrap travel restrictions within country boundaries since lockdowns were re-imposed in winter.\nSelf-contained tourist accommodation - including many hotels and cottages - will also be able to open on Saturday.\nBut non-essential travel to and from other UK nations will be banned for at least two weeks.\nThe move by the Welsh government will also see six people from two households able to meet up outside, an increase from the current four-person limit.\nOrganised outdoor activities and sports for under-18s can resume, and libraries and archives will be able to reopen their doors.\nRules will also allow a limited opening of outdoor areas of some historical places and gardens.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the \"public health position remains stable\" and there was \"headroom\" to make changes.\nResponding to criticism that England has a roadmap further into the future, he said: \"There's no guarantee those dates will turn out to mean anything in reality, that's why I'm reluctant to provide what I think of as a spurious certainty about what can happen that far into the future.\n\"We will do things where we can be definite... we will try to be as definite as we can. I want to give sectors sufficient warning, but I don't want to be suggesting that we can see the future that far ahead sufficiently precisely.\"\nThe relaxation of rules on who and how many people you can meet outdoors means Deio, Gwenlli and Osian will be able to meet their grandparents - at a safe distance - for the first time since Christmas Day.\nThe children live near Llanbrynmair, Powys, while their grandparents live about 40 miles (64km) away in Llangwyryfon, Ceredigion.\n\"It's been very, very difficult not seeing them,\" said Osian, 15.\n\"I'm looking forward to seeing family and friends, and hopefully getting back to playing football and things like that.\"\nGwenlli, 10, said it had been \"sad\" not being able to see her grandparents, but she understood it was for a good reason.\n\"I would love to go shopping again and do gymnastics in my gymnastics club,\" she added.\nDeio, 12, said it had been \"hard\" but was looking forward to going on a picnic with his grandparents.\nThe ending of Wales' Covid travel restrictions coincides with the Easter school holiday and a spell of warmer weather.\nWelsh beaches \"were much busier last year\" as more people took holiday staycations because of coronavirus travel restrictions abroad, and lifeguards are expecting this year to also be busy.\nBut people who may be considering heading to the beach have been warned they could get in difficulty with cold seas and many unseen strong currents.\n\"The sea around the Welsh coast has still not warmed up,\" said Matt Childs, the RNLI's lifesaving manager for south Wales.\n\"It is really cold and you're likely to get yourself into difficulty with cold water shock hitting you. The sea only needs to be 13 to 15 degrees to be in trouble and its much colder than that now.\"\nHuw Pendleton, the managing director of Celtic Holiday Parks in Pembrokeshire, said he expected to be \"extremely busy\" at the weekend. \nHe said all three of his parks were fully booked and they were expecting up to 600 people to arrive over the weekend.\n\"We will be very grateful to let people back into the business,\" he said.\n\"We hope that people will act responsibly because health comes first. But these communities are very reliant on tourism.\"\nKevin Burt of Llandegfedd Visitor and Watersports Centre, near Pontypool, said: \"We know that people have been desperate to get out, to enjoy the countryside, to enjoy the walks and to take it all in.\n\"We're really excited to welcome our customers back, but we are very conscious as well that it needs to be safe for them and for the people who work here as well.\"\nLeighton Phillips, is the owner of Aeron Coast Holiday Park in Aberaeron, Ceredigion, which has 200 static caravans and space for 100 tourers. \nAbout 90% of the statics are owned by people from south Wales, many of whom have been calling Mr Phillips, asking when they can come back.\nThe park's shared facilities - the club, children's playroom, gym and pool - have to stay closed, but Mr Phillips is expecting a busy weekend.\n\"I suppose from one minute past 12 they could come, but they will be coming I'm sure from eight o'clock on in the morning,\" he said.\n\"I think mainly they want to be able to just get out, have a stroll around and see people at a distance. \n\"They're so used - as we all have been - to being locked in at home and looking at the garden wall or what's outside. Now they really want to see their friends and they're a very very close community here.\"\nTegryn Jones, chief executive of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority, told BBC Radio Wales \"there is concern\" about an influx of visitors, and urged people to \"act responsibly\".\nMeanwhile, the chief executive of North Wales Tourism welcomed the further easing, but said it was \"a great shame\" that many attractions and hospitality businesses will not be allowed to reopen at the same time.\n\"There is still a real and palpable sense of frustration in the sector, as it feels that the Welsh government haven't been listening to the mood on the ground,\" said Jim Jones.\n\"If they had, then we would have a plan to take us forward post April.\u00a0\n\"It is very difficult to understand why they won't map this out, especially as the other three home nations have now done so.\"\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Wales' Breakfast programme, Mr Drakeford said people in England were expected to be able to travel from 12 April, and if those restrictions are lifted they will be able to come to Wales.\nIn the meantime, people taking bookings are expected to ensure they are only taking them from people living in Wales.\nMr Drakeford said: \"Avoid crowded places. We are such a lucky country, we've got so many fantastic places people can explore and visit. Look for those other opportunities, respect other people, keep a distance.\n\"If there are people knowingly and deliberately breaking the law then action will be taken.\"\nHe added vaccine passports for entering pubs was something which \"we should be exploring\".\nNot at the moment. Travel in and out of Wales is not permitted unless you have a reasonable excuse which includes:\nThere is also a list of reasons deemed \"reasonably necessary\", which include accessing education or childcare when \"there is no practicable alternative\".\nWhen the next review of the regulations takes place on Thursday, Welsh ministers will consider allowing people to travel outside of Wales from 12 April.\nEngland's travel restrictions are also expected to end on 12 April so, subject to law changes in by both governments, travel into England could be possible. \nThe same goes for Scotland and Northern Ireland - in Scotland, travel to other parts of the UK should be permitted from 26 April or soon after and in Northern Ireland the stay-at-home message is expected to be relaxed from 12 April.\nRetailers may be allowed to fully reopen, and teaching of pupils not yet back in school could restart, from 12 April.\nPrimary schools and some secondary school children have already resumed classes.\nA decision on whether to permit pubs, restaurants and cafes to reopen outdoors will not be taken until at least 22 April.\nThe UK government does not plan to ease stay at home restrictions in England until 29 March, but ministers will urge people to remain local as much as possible.\nIt plans to allow trips to self-catering accommodation from 12 April.\nThe Welsh government said the level of restrictions was \"starting\" to move from alert level four to alert level three. \nMembers of the Welsh Hospitality industry are backing an appeal for money to fund a legal challenge to the rules on the reopening of pubs and restaurants in Wales.\nThe chairman of Cardiff Licensees forum said he was \"100%\" behind a bid to raise money for a judicial review of the Welsh government's timeline. \nIt follows a similar challenge of the UK government's rules in England. \nNick Newman, chairman of Cardiff Licensees Forum, said he has had \"a terrific response\" to a crowdfunding proposal by Matt Connolly, the owner of a restaurant in Cardiff.\nDylan's, which has restaurants in Menai Bridge, Criccieth and Llandudno, has called for a road map of of lockdown for the industry.\nMaria McLean from the company said: \"Hospitality is at the heart of a lot of what we do in north Wales and we run the risk of undoing all that good work we've done to promote this fabulous destination over the last 10 or so years. \n\"If we're not open and the destination across the border are, it makes it very difficult for us to compete on an even footing.\" \nCerys Furlong, who owns two pubs and a restaurant in Cardiff, called for more financial support for the sector. \n\"It really is urgent, funding is running out in five days for many businesses and people are really, really feeling the strain,\" she told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales. \n\"To fail at this last hurdle, to provide this support that is necessary, would just be catastrophic.\" \nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: \"It's a difficult balance to strike... but I think one of the areas I don't think the Welsh government are getting it right is giving sufficient forewarning to businesses.\n\"Having a series of dates as far out as June is excessive... but businesses tell us the one thing they need is notice.\"\nCalum Davies, from the Welsh Conservatives, said: \"This change is very welcome, better late than never, really, but this is the first step of what businesses need to hear especially in the tourism industry.\n\"We still need more clarity and detail in other areas.\nJane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: \"This will come as welcome news to many who have been cut off for a long time.\n\"The public have a duty to follow these new rules carefully as the virus is still very much circulating amongst us. I hope this will the start of the end of our final lockdown.\"\nStay local rules were in place for just two weeks, replacing a stay-at-home order - in place since the start of the third national Welsh lockdown.\nLockdown was imposed in Wales at the end of December after a rise in cases increased pressure on the Welsh NHS.\nWales' case rate has been below 50 cases per 100,000 people - the threshold used as the guide for bringing areas into lockdown last year - for the past 21 days.\nAt the moment it is 38.5 per 100,000 over the past seven days compared to the peak on 17 December, when it was 636 per 100,000.\nThe rate that tests are coming back as positive is the lowest point since mid-September, at 3.1%"

      "tags": "North Korea weapons programme,North Korea missile tests,North Korea\u2013South Korea relations,North Korea,Joe Biden",
      "text": "North Korea has claimed the missiles it launched Thursday were a \"new-type tactical guided projectile\", in its first statement since the test. \nIt was the country's first ballistic launch in almost a year and the first since Joe Biden became US President. \nMr Biden has said the US will \"respond accordingly\". The US, Japan and South Korea have condemned the tests. \nUnder UN Security Council resolutions, North Korea is banned from testing ballistic missiles.\nThe country's Friday statement, issued through state media outlet KCNA, says the two weapons struck a test target 600km (373 miles) off North Korea's east coast, disputing Japanese assessments that they flew just over 400km.\nIt added that the new missile is able to carry a payload of 2.5 tons, which would make it capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. \n\"The development of this weapon system is of great significance in bolstering up the military power of the country and deterring all sorts of military threats,\" Ri Pyong Chol, the senior leader who oversaw the test, was quoted as saying. \nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un was not present.\nThe question I always get asked is why is North Korea testing now?\nThere's no easy answer to this. First, because they can and Pyongyang has new weapons to try out.\nBut the recent messages warning the United States not to cause \"a stink\" and that the Biden administration would \"pay a price\" would suggest the North is making a point.\nSouth Korea's spy agency said it believed North Korea had timed the missile launch ahead of President Biden's press conference. It also claimed that Pyongyang was protesting against the extradition of its citizen, Mun Chol Myong from Malaysia to the US, and the recent UN Human Rights Council resolution against North Korea.\nWhatever the reason, the message North Korea is sending the world is very different to the message it is sending its people.\nThe front page of the state newspaper showed Kim Jong-un checking out new passenger buses - not supervising the test of new missiles.\nMr Kim is flexing his military muscles for the world but trying to portray an image of economic reformer to his people.\nMr Biden told reporters that the launch was a violation of UN resolutions and that the US was consulting with partners and allies.\n\"There will be responses - if they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly,\" he said.\n\"But I'm also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearisation.\"\nIt remains unclear what exact type of missile the North Koreans have launched. State media said it had an \"improved version of a solid fuel engine\" and described it as a tactical guided missile that could perform \"gliding and pull-up\" manoeuvres, which could mean it is harder to intercept.\nBut the test highlights the progress the country's weapons programme has seen since denuclearisation talks with the US stalled under former President Donald Trump.\nAnalysts have suggested the missiles were the same as the ones unveiled at a military parade in the capital Pyongyang last October. \n\"If that is the case, they appear to have an improved variant of the previously tested KN-23 missile with \"a really big warhead,\" Jeffrey Lewis of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) told Reuters. \nSuch a new missile would allow North Korea to put heavier nuclear warheads on its rockets, Vipin Narang, a security studies professor at MIT said on Twitter. \nDeveloping miniaturised nuclear warheads is difficult, although some observers believe that North Korea has this capability already. \nNorth Korea last fired ballistic missiles a year ago amid stalled relations between then-US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.\nThe Biden administration says it has unsuccessfully tried to make diplomatic contact with North Korea. \nPyongyang has yet to acknowledge that Mr Biden is now in office, and the two countries remain at loggerheads over the North's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes."

      "tags": "Transplants,Organ donation",
      "text": "Everyone in Scotland is now an automatic organ donor - unless they opt out of a new system.\nFrom Friday, it is presumed that people have consented to donation unless they have stated otherwise.\nExperts say this will mean that many more people can be given life-saving and life-changing transplants. \nPeople who do not want their organs to be donated for a transplant can opt out through the Organ Donation Scotland website.\nUnder the old system, more than half of Scotland's population were registered to donate their organs or tissue after their death.\nBut it is hoped the number of potential donors could increase further under the new scheme. \nIn two years, a similar system in Wales has increased family consent by 50%.\nThe Scottish law was due to change in November but was postponed due to the Covid pandemic.\nOrgan donation means people like 27-year-old Ross Peters, who was diagnosed with a heart condition at 21, have a second chance at life.\nBy last summer Ross' health was so bad that he was put on the urgent transplant list - just months before his wife Shauni was about to have their first child. \nLuckily for Ross, he got his new heart in August, and now he is able to play a more active role as dad to baby Louis, who was born in November.  \n\"It's just perfect,\" he said. \"I can do things now I wasn't able to do before without even thinking about it. I was always breathless and tired. All the symptoms of heart failure, I had them all and now I'm just living a totally normal life. It's perfect.\"\nRoss was in hospital for two months before he got the transplant. His wife Shauni, 28, said getting the new heart had changed their lives. \nShe said: \"There's a huge difference. We can go for walks for hours, and even just lifting the pram - before he wouldn't have been able to do that. \n\"He's a lot healthier now than he was last year, so he'll be so much better bringing Louis up and able to play with him when he's ready to kick footballs and run about in the garden.\n\"It was a hard, crazy start, but thankfully because of organ donation, it's been a brilliant end.\" \nSome are not as lucky as Ross. \nOnly about 1% of people die in circumstances where their organs can be used for transplants, which means there is always a shortage, and a long waiting list. \nAnother obstacle has been that people who would be in favour of donating their organs have not got round to registering.\nConsultant transplant surgeon John Casey said the new system should make more organs available.\nHe said: \"About 500 patients are waiting for a transplant every year and a significant number die on the waiting list. It's extremely important that we try to provide a transplant service for as many of these patients as possible.\n\"The opt out legislation is really part of a whole package of measures we've been taking to increase the number of donors, and therefore transplants, that we do.\" \nThere is a small group of exemptions, including:\nExperts stress the importance of families discussing the issue so they know what to do should one of them die in a situation where they could be a donor. \nIt was something that Jamie Murray had talked about with his brother Craig who had a heart and lung condition and died at the age of 26.  \n Jamie told the BBC: \"It gives us a massive sense of pride also a sense of relief to know that Craig has helped other people extend their lives.\n\"Obviously for us it's difficult because Craig was taken away at 26, but Craig ended up donating his pancreas, liver and kidneys and they went on to help three men.\n\"To know there are people walking about because of Craig, that otherwise wouldn't have been here gives us a massive sense of pride as a family and a sense of comfort as well. \"\nPublic Health Minister Mairi Gougeon said it was important to know what your family's wishes are.\n\"This is still going to be a very personal decision for people and it's absolutely vital that people have that discussion with their families,  so that any decision they make, whether they want to opt in or opt out, that they make their families aware. \n\"We think that's what's really important and hopefully all the information will have started to arrive at households across Scotland and we hope that will encourage those kind of conversations to take place.\"   \nBritish Heart Foundation spokesman David McColgan said evidence from other countries suggested it made a positive difference. \nHe said: \"Of the top 10 countries in terms of donation rates, nine of them operate an opt-out system.  \n\"This is not a new system. It's been in place in countries for nearly half a century now, so we know it increases the families' ability to make the decision and we know it then increases the pool of individuals available for organ donation, and that will ultimately increase the number of people whose lives can be saved.\"\nWales adopted the opt-out system in 2015 and England started its opt-out system last year. \nIf people want to opt out - or opt in - they can go onto the Organ Donations Scotland website to register their wishes."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Mark Harper,Steven Baker,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "MPs have voted to extend emergency coronavirus powers for another six months.\nThey backed the health secretary's call to renew \"essential\" emergency rules to deal with the pandemic as England moves out of lockdown. \nBut some Conservatives voted against the measures saying they were \"out of step\" with the roadmap for lifting restrictions. \nMinisters say the powers will stay in place \"only as long as necessary\". \nThe Coronavirus Act came in to force in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic with ministers pledging to use the measures \"when strictly necessary\".\nThe law gave the government wide-ranging powers unlike others seen before - from shutting down pubs, through to detaining individuals deemed at risk as part of efforts to contain the spread of the virus.\nMPs voted by 484 to 76 to extend it - 36 Conservative MPs rebelled, by opposing the legislation. Twenty-one Labour MPs also voted against it. \nMPs agreed to extend it until the end of September as well as voting on England's roadmap out of lockdown and the continuation of virtual proceedings in the Commons. \nOpening the debate ahead of the vote, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the legislation had been a \"crucial part\" of the government's response to coronavirus, enabling ministers to bring forward measures such as furlough and statutory sick pay for those self-isolating.\nBut he said 12 provisions in the legislation were no longer needed because of progress that had been made in dealing with the virus.\nThese include easing some responsibilities on the social care sector, laws governing the retention of biometric data for health and security purposes, and obligations on businesses that work in the food supply chain. \nMr Hancock acknowledged some people were concerned about the powers contained in the act.\nHe said: \"Although this act remains essential and there are elements of it which we are seeking the renewal of, we have always said we will only retain powers as long as they are necessary.\"\nBut the chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, Sir Graham Brady, said he would vote against because \"it is important we make the case for a return to normality and trusting people with their own lives\".\nHe said: \"These powers were given by Parliament to government last March as a very temporary set of extreme emergency measures. Nobody then envisaged that they would still be in place a year later, still be in use 18 months on. \n\"I think we need to be very cautious about the dangers of normalising what is actually a very extreme policy response.\"\nThe deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown sceptics, Conservative Steve Baker, said the vote was a \"rare opportunity\" for MPs to \"say no to a new way of life in a checkpoint society\".\nHe said he was reassured by the prime minister's comment at the Liaison Committee on Wednesday that \"anything that is redundant will go\".\nTonight's rebellion by 35 Conservatives won't trouble Boris Johnson - overall MPs backed the renewal of sweeping powers to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. \nMany of the Tories who voted against the government have been persistent critics of its approach to restrictions and lockdowns. \nFor them, it's about trust. \nReassurances from ministers about powers only being used when necessary in extreme circumstances don't cut it. \nThere is deep unease about the scope of these powers and the very fact they are available to the government, even if they're not being used. \nBut the pandemic has changed expectations of what governments can and should do in extreme circumstances. Freedoms considered sacrosanct have been suspended in the spirit of saving lives. \nThe public may have been willing to largely comply, but there are at least a few dozen MPs willing to argue the price society has paid has been too high. \nLabour backed the extension of the emergency powers but said its support was not offered \"with any enthusiasm\". \nThe shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \"Given the loss of life we have suffered and given the risks of mutations that could set us back, we must have zero tolerance to letting the virus rage unchecked.\n\"For that reason we do accept that restrictions have to stay in place and for that reason we support the renewal of the act and the public health regulations.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats also voted against the measures. \nOne of its MPs, Tim Farron, said the powers were \"an over-reach\" that the government \"does not need\" and he described them as a \"default knee-jerk attempt to seek draconian powers\" that he said \"fit in to a pattern\" of eroding civil liberties. \nA government review into the possible use of coronavirus passports or status certificates to allow people to visit pubs and other venues is taking place under the plans to ease England's lockdown.\nThe prime minister said there would be an update on the idea in April, and a review will report in June.\nThe leader of the Covid Recovery Group, Conservative Mark Harper, said the idea of vaccine certificates to enter pubs was \"unconscionable\" and raised \"practical, moral and ethical issues\".\n\"We've asked young people to do a lot over the last year and I think the least we can do is to get the economy open, so that their futures are not damaged any further,\" he said. \nSpeaking on a visit to west London, the prime minister rejected suggestions he was no longer concerned about protecting individual freedoms.\nHe said: \"The libertarian in me is also trying to protect individual's fundamental right to life and their ability to live their lives normally and the only way really to restore that for everybody, is for us to beat the disease.\n\"The best path to freedom is down the cautious but irreversible roadmap that we've set out. That's what the freedom lover wants.\""

      "text": "A scheme to bring all rough sleepers indoors at the start of the pandemic has seen a large disparity in the outcomes of those supported across England, new data has revealed.\nIn some areas over 80% of those helped are in longer-term accommodation. In others it is less than 15%.\nThe charity Crisis said the government must provide a clear national strategy.\nRough sleeping minister Eddie Hughes said many councils were \"doing an exceptional job\".\nHe said local authorities were best placed to allocate funding in their area, and that the UK government had provided \u00a34.6bn of support to be spent by them.\nMartin, from Shrewsbury, was one of those helped by Everyone In.\nHe slept rough in a concrete alcove under a bridge next to the River Severn for a year prior to the pandemic.\n\"I used to have a bit of carpet underneath me, and a sleeping bag and a pillow basically. And that's it,\" he said.\n\"I never felt so down in my whole life.\"\nHe said he had asked his local council for support when he first became homeless, and was told he did not qualify as he was not considered a priority need.\nThen on 26 March 2020, the government announced all rough sleepers in England should be brought indoors regardless of their situation. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland had similar schemes.\nOver the course of a few days, thousands of vulnerable people were placed in emergency housing.\nMartin was given a hotel room - and has since been helped into privately rented accommodation.\nHe admits to being \"a bit emotional\" when he first found out he would be living in his new home.\n\"It's just opened doors for me. I'm now able to work again,\" he said.\nThe stability had also enabled him to become closer to his family and given him a sense of purpose again, he added.\nHe said he believed he would still be homeless if it was not for the pandemic.\nThe scheme has so far helped around 37,000 people.\nBut figures obtained by the BBC through the Freedom of Information Act, from 174 councils that responded, have shown a disparity in the levels of long-term support provided by different local authorities.\nAmong the top 20 best-performing councils, on average 82.5% of those helped by the scheme have been moved into supported or settled accommodation.\nThis includes social housing, privately rented homes, longer-term placements in hostels and refuges, and self-contained accommodation with support worker visits.\nBut in the worst-performing councils, an average of just 13% have had that same outcome.\nJasmine Basran, policy manager at Crisis, said the government's decision to end its emergency funding for the scheme in May created a \"lack of clarity\" for councils.\nShe said it meant there was no longer the nationwide approach that had proved so successful at the start of the pandemic.\nThis led to vulnerable people's housing needs being affected by their local authority's financial situation and individual decision-making as to who remained eligible for support, she added, alongside the availability of social housing.\nCrisis said the government must ensure England moved away from \"a postcode lottery approach\".\nIt has written an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, alongside charities The Trussell Trust and Joseph Rowntree Foundation, calling for a long-term strategy to tackle poverty and destitution.\nAccording to the latest government figures, of the 37,000 helped by the Everyone In scheme in England, 11,263 are currently in emergency housing.\nPaul, in Oxford, has been in emergency accommodation since the start of the pandemic.\nHe said being housed had been a \"blessing\", enabling him to get better support for his medical conditions and ease his mental health problems.\n\"The depression began to fall away,\" he said.\nBut he now fears that support will run out.\nOriginally from Zimbabwe, he has lived in the UK for 21 years. But as he has an immigration status, there is no duty for the council to help him long-term.\n\"The uncertainty of not knowing what the future holds means the anxiety is starting to creep back into life,\" he said.\n\"[If the scheme ends] it's back to square one, isn't it?\"\nMinister Eddie Hughes said councils had always had to make \"difficult decisions\", but the government had been working to help ensure those with an immigration status could access support where eligible.\nHe said its Rough Sleeper Accommodation Programme would be providing 3,000 new homes this year, and 6,000 in total.\nThe Welsh government has said it plans to ensure all those placed in emergency accommodation during the pandemic are helped into permanent housing.\nScotland has said it is \"transforming temporary accommodation by transitioning to rapid rehousing [of homeless individuals] by default\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Patrick Vallance,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Lockdown is, step-by-step, beginning to ease across the UK. Next week, the stay-at-home order will be lifted in England and people can start mixing in small groups outdoors.\nBut with infection rates rising in Europe, the British public is also being warned of the risk of a third wave.\nThe prime minister himself says it is only a matter of time before the wave from Europe washes up on our shores. But with more than half of adults vaccinated, what would that look like?\nWhile the outbreaks in Europe have been portrayed as the threat, we should not forget the virus is still lurking here. Infection rates have dropped dramatically since the turn of the year - there has been a 12-fold fall in daily cases being reported.\nBut that still leaves more than enough infection circulating that could easily take off. The Office for National Statistics estimates that, along with asymptomatic cases, there could be more than 100,000 infectious people out there.\nAlready there are signs of a slight increase in cases among children following the return to schools in England.\nProf Christina Pagel, from University College London, says some of the increase is undoubtedly because of more testing - secondary school pupils have been offered regular on-the-spot rapid tests since their return to school to pick up asymptomatic cases.\nBut that, she says, cannot account for it all. She is concerned this is the start of an upward trend, pointing out that many parents will not have had their first dose yet - rollout has been limited to the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions. The break for Easter will help slow the spread but that will only be temporary, she fears.\nBut if cases continue to rise, does this matter? After all, 99% of Covid deaths have been in the groups now vaccinated.\nThe link between infections and serious illness or death has been \"severely weakened\", says diseases expert Prof Mark Woolhouse, of Edinburgh University.\nBut if infection levels rise high enough the virus \"will find those\" who are unvaccinated and those for whom the vaccine hasn't worked, he says.\nWhile the vaccines are good - they significantly reduce the risk of falling ill and for those who do develop symptoms there is a strong likelihood it will be a fairly mild cough, fever or short period of breathlessness - they are not 100% perfect.\nSo Prof Woolhouse warns there could still be significant numbers of deaths, even if the threat to the NHS is much reduced.\nWhat nobody can be sure of is just how quickly and by how much infection levels could rise in the coming months.\nThe natural R rate - how many people the average person who is infected passes the virus on to - was between three and four for this coronavirus, but with the new more contagious variant dominant, it could now be around five, some believe.\nDr Duncan Robertson, a disease modeller at Loughborough University, believes we are in \"essentially a new epidemic\". \"This is the first time we are lifting restrictions with the new variant - it could take off and those areas with the lowest vaccination rates will be vulnerable.\"\nThere are a number of issues that will be crucial in determining exactly what happens from here.\nAs well as protecting those vaccinated, the vaccine programme will also help slow transmission. Early evidence suggests the AstraZeneca jab could stop two-thirds of people who are vaccinated from passing it on.\nOn top of that those who have already been infected - estimated to be about a quarter of the population - will have some immunity.\nSecondly, seasonality could help. Respiratory viruses tend to thrive in the winter, but are less likely to spread in the spring and summer.\nBecause this is a new virus, it could take some time to settle into a seasonal pattern, but certainly the changing seasons are likely to have some impact.\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says it is possible a significant rise may not actually come until the winter, giving more time for the vaccination programme to rollout.\nSpeaking this week, he said the UK should be confident the \"path from here does look better\", but we should still expect \"bumps and twists\" along the way. \nThe most immediate problem, he said, was likely to be local outbreaks - and variation in uptake between different areas leaves some places particularly vulnerable. \nMeanwhile, in the longer term, variants that can spread more easily because they can evade some of the immune response could come into play, Prof Whitty said.\nThe next unknown is the behaviour of the public. By far the biggest risk factor for spreading the virus is mixing indoors in homes, says Prof Woolhouse. \"We know most outdoor activities are very safe, we know there has never been a surge in cases following school opening and the risks in retail and hospitality can be mitigated. \n\"But we cannot police what happens in people's homes - that is the perfect environment for the virus to spread.\"\nThe \"gut reaction\" of most people will be to think everything will be fine, says Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a Cambridge University expert in understanding risk, and that we can \"start enjoying ourselves again\".\nBut we should not \"trust our intuition on this\", he says. That means taking each step very cautiously.\n\"The government is determined to not take steps back so that could mean taking longer to take steps forward.\"\nThe aim, of course, is to balance the need to open society while trying to control the virus. While some people have called for a \"Zero Covid\" approach, the government and its advisers are clear this cannot be achieved given the nature of the virus, which can spread without people being aware they are infected.\nThis week, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said there was basically \"zero chance\" of zero Covid.\nSo how bad will the third wave get? Modelling done for the government has suggested as many as 30,000 people could die by the summer of 2022, even with a gradual reopening and good vaccine rollout.\nThat is four times fewer than the number of deaths we have seen over the past year. And while it sounds high, it is worth noting that in a bad winter, 25,000 people can die from flu. But the toll could be much much higher - more than double that - if things do not go as well as assumed, the modelling suggested.\nThere are, of course, as always caveats around these models. But they should act as a warning - while the UK may be in a strong position, nothing should be taken for granted with this virus.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "Many doctors from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds say key risk assessments have still not taken place, or have not been acted on.\nAbout 40% of UK doctors in the UK are from BAME backgrounds, yet 95% of the medics who have died from coronavirus were from minority backgrounds.\nThe NHS said last June that its trusts should offer risk assessments to staff.\nBut hundreds told a poll for BBC News that they were still awaiting assessments or action.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) says the government has a duty to protect ethnic minority doctors.\nOf 2,000 doctors who responded, 328 said their risks hadn't been assessed at all, while 519 said they had had a risk assessment but no action had been taken. \nAnother 658 said some action had been taken, with just 383 reporting their risks had been considered in detail and action put into place to mitigate them.\nDoctors were polled via a questionnaire sent to BAME medics across the UK via 70 medical associations on behalf of BBC News in January.\nOne of those who responded was Dr Temi Olonisakin, a junior doctor in London who has Type 1 diabetes. She had her risk assessment early on in the pandemic.\n\"It was as comprehensive as a side A4 paper can be,\" she says.\n\"I think for a lot of people it felt more like a tick-box exercise, and one that could be used to say: 'We've done what we need to do to make people feel safe' - but I'm not sure in reality that's how people felt.\"\nDr Olonisakin scored high risk on her assessment and it was recommended that she limit patient contact. But during the second wave of the pandemic, she was working in an acute medical unit and had problems getting her risk assessment implemented.\n\"I had to do a lot of chasing and occupational health weren't as helpful as they could have been.\n\"It took a few weeks for me to be moved off patient-facing work. I felt I really had to fight for my safety.\"\n\"It was very stressful. I was very aware of the dangers of working in hospital and possibly picking up virus and what that could mean for me.\"\nBMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said it remained vital that risk assessments happened and were acted on, and weren't a \"tick-box exercise\".\nHe added: \"What's at stake here is serious ill health, and potentially death.\"\nSeveral doctors reported difficulties in getting redeployed, and that it appeared easier for white doctors to avoid patient-facing work.\nDr Nagpaul said there were \"longstanding inequalities\" within the NHS.\n\"Career progression isn't great for BAME doctors, so they tend to be in patient-facing roles more than white doctors, and more of them have been on the frontline during the pandemic.\"\nNHS England said it had written to all hospital trusts and Clinical Commissioning Groups last June, asking them to undertake risk assessments for BAME staff within four weeks - and that most BAME doctors had been offered them.\nA spokesman said there had been more than a million risk assessments of staff, with 95% of those from BAME backgrounds having had one.\nHe added: \"Every employer is required to support workers who raise discrimination issues\" and that trusts had to \"help ensure that NHS staff feel safe to speak up\".\nNHS bodies in Scotland and Wales said they had also implemented measures to address the concerns of BAME staff.\nOne GP, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC the PPE (personal protective equipment) she was offered wasn't adequate.\nThe doctor, who has had to take time off work after developing long Covid, said: \"I was working in walk-in centres at the time, and was only given basic surgical masks and an apron to use.\n\"At no point during the pandemic was I offered a risk assessment. I asked for technology to do remote consultations but was told it was oversubscribed.\n\"Working during the pandemic was so stressful - I feel burned.\"\nDr Leon Francis, a psychiatrist who set up the Black Medics Forum at the end of last year, said the pandemic had been \"another assault on the mental health of black doctors\". \nHe added: \"People have spoken about pressure to work - but they don't want to say anything that might rock the boat.\"\nMore than 700 doctors who took part in our research said they felt discriminated against by colleagues or managers during the pandemic; and a further 700 said they felt bullied at work.\nDr Nagpaul said that echoed the BMA's own research. \n\"BAME doctors are more fearful of speaking up about issues in workplace because of the repercussions it might have on their careers.\n\"What's required is a cultural transformation within the NHS, where there is equal experience, equal support and equal opportunity. This is a lesson that must be acted upon now.\"\nNHS England recommends a number of tools to calculate an individual's risk, one of which is the SAAD Scorecard that was created in memory of Dr Saad Al-Dubbaisi, a GP from Bury who died from the virus last year.\nHis daughter Zainab, a medic herself, said it was vital doctors were assessed.\n\"Now that we have identified that there's an increased risk of severe disease and mortality for BAME people, it's important these tools are used to identify at-risk healthcare workers so that they can be protected.\""

      "tags": "Alba Party,Scottish Parliament election 2021,Scottish independence,Alex Salmond",
      "text": "The return of Alex Salmond to the political fray has sent a shockwave through the Holyrood election campaign. \nFew would have imagined in the years that followed his defeat as an MP in the 2017 general election that his comeback would be at the helm of a new party.\nHe insists that Alba is not a threat to the SNP. But given he has also announced a series of high-profile defections, the idea of a split seems inescapable.\nMr Salmond believes that adding a bloc of Alba Party MSPs would create an independence \"supermajority\" at Holyrood.\nThe former first minister has no designs on going back into government, in a coalition or other formal agreement with the SNP.\nHe may hope his group could act a bit like a pressure group that has enough votes to bend the rest of parliament to its will, and hold First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's feet to the fire on a second independence referendum. \nIt remains to be seen if there is a public appetite for Mr Salmond's new vehicle.\nBut by running candidates across Scotland, it has the potential to change the nature of the race in more or less every seat - partly because of the way Scotland's voting system works.\nUnder that system, MSPs can be elected either as a representative of a constituency, or from one of eight regions of Scotland using a \"top up\" system of proportional representation.\nThe more constituency seats you win in any area, the harder it is to win list seats. In 2016, the SNP won the vast majority of constituency seats - and as a direct result returned just four regional list MSPs.\nMr Salmond believes this means most SNP list votes are \"wasted\", and could instead be given to his new list-only party - which would have zero constituency MSPs, and thus a better chance of winning regional seats.\nHowever, the SNP cannot afford to just ignore the lists. When they won a majority in 2011, it was with the help of no fewer than 16 list seats. \nThey are unlikely to win every single constituency, and thus must try to balance out any local defeats with list seats - from a pragmatic standpoint, their campaign has to be \"both votes SNP\".\nThere is an impact on other parties beyond the SNP, too. Two start-up groups, Action for Independence and the Independence for Scotland Party, have already withdrawn all of their candidates in support of Mr Salmond's goals.\nThe Scottish Greens stand primarily on the regional lists, and usually aim to sweep up the \"second votes\" of pro-independence types who vote SNP in their constituencies.\nThe party has put independence at the heart of its campaign for 2021, pledging that all of its MSPs in the next term will back a push for indyref2.\nThe likes of the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats will no doubt have watched Mr Salmond's announcement with popcorn in hand, hoping it will put a dent in the SNP's electoral juggernaut.\nHowever, there are only 56 list seats to go around, so even the Unionist parties might be casting a nervous eye over the margins in some regions. \nThey might not be chasing the same voters, but they could still face being edged out if Alba wins some of those seats.\nSCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat elections are happening? On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government. Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Scottish Parliament have? MSPs pass laws on most aspects of day-to-day life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and welfare benefits. Defence, foreign policy and immigration are decided by the UK Parliament.\nHow do I vote?\u00a0Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You can\u00a0register to vote online. \nThere may be two different ways of winning seats at Holyrood, and two different ballot papers - but there is only one campaign.\nThe emergence of a new party could have a huge impact on the debate as a whole, and on the questions posed each day - potentially recasting the whole campaign.\nNicola Sturgeon had hoped to spend this campaign talking about her pandemic leadership, and about her vision for independence - not Alex Salmond's.\nNow, she may be doomed to the \"Sturgeon vs Salmond\" psychodrama of recent months dragging on for another six weeks.\nOne immediate example of how Mr Salmond may change the debate was when he was asked about an independence referendum at the Alba launch event, and mused about what other routes there may be to securing self-determination.\nSo already there are questions for Ms Sturgeon about her strategy. She could now be continually asked to react to Mr Salmond's position on independence, rather than dictating the debate on a topic which should really be home turf for her.\nMr Salmond also wants to move on from the questions of recent years about the government's mishandling of complaints against him and about the \"malicious plot\" he claims there was against him.\nIn every interview, he has been asked about his own conduct. Each time he responds that there have been several court cases and judges, a jury - which acquitted him of charges of sexual assault in March 2020 - and a number of inquiries. And that should be the end of the matter.\nHowever, the problem for politicians is that they cannot control the questions they are asked on the campaign trail.\nMr Salmond will not be able to make questions about his past behaviour and the events of the last three years simply go away. If he is to make a success of his new party, he needs to maintain convincing answers to them."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus testing,Hospitality industry,Pubs,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It may only be possible to introduce a vaccine passports scheme once all adults have been offered a jab, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested.\nHe said no decisions had been made but there would be an update on the idea in April. A review will report in June.\nThere were \"difficult issues... moral complexities, ethical problems that need to be addressed\", the PM added.\nAny passport could also reflect a negative test result as well as whether someone was vaccinated or has immunity.\nOn Thursday afternoon, MPs voted to extend emergency coronavirus powers in England for another six months, with 484 in favour, and 76 against, giving a majority of 408. \nThe Coronavirus Act was introduced in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic.\nMeanwhile, the UK has recorded another 6,397 new infections and 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the government's daily figures.\nToday's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure - but the number of Covid-related deaths has fallen by 32, compared with a week ago.\nThe latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine.\nMeanwhile, publicans have case doubt on a suggestion from Mr Johnson that pub-goers might have to prove their vaccination status when venues reopen.\nA government review into the possible use of coronavirus passports or status certificates to allow people to visit pubs and other venues is taking place under the plans to ease England's lockdown. \nMr Johnson said previous coronavirus infections could be a feature, if the certificates are adopted.\n\"There are three basic components. There's the vaccine, there's your immunity you might have had after you've had Covid, and there's testing - they are three things that could work together.\"\nHowever he added: \"No decisions have been taken at all. One thing I will make clear is none of this is obviously going to apply on April 12 when it will all be outdoors anyway.\" \nSpeaking on a visit to a nursery in west London, Mr Johnson said: \"There are some people who for medical reasons can't get a vaccination, pregnant women can't get a vaccination at the moment, you've got to be careful about how you do this.\n\"You might only be able to implement a thorough-going vaccination passport scheme even if you wanted such a thing in the context of when absolutely everybody had been offered a vaccine.\" \nIn the Commons, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who is leading the review, told MPs: \"A system that relied purely on vaccination would not be appropriate.\n\"What would be right was a system that ensured we could open up our economy to the maximum extent that takes into account both vaccine status but also of recent test status and indeed potentially also antibody status as well,\" he added.\nUnder government plans to ease the lockdown in England, pubs will be able to start serving customers indoors - with a size limit applied to groups - from 17 May at the earliest. \nThe idea of asking pub-goers to show a so-called vaccine passport or certificate was raised at Wednesday's House of Commons Liaison Committee hearing when Boris Johnson was asked whether they were \"compatible with a free society such as ours\".\nMr Johnson said the concept \"should not be totally alien to us\" - pointing out that doctors already have to have hepatitis B jabs - although he stressed such a move in future \"may be up to individual publicans\".\nA Downing Street source earlier said the review would include looking at how people's vaccination and testing status could be stored securely and displayed on a mobile phone, and the circumstances under which such a system could apply.\nSpeaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said \"all sorts of things were being considered\" and it was \"really a bit premature\" to speculate on details about how a possible vaccine passport would apply to pubs.\nThe boss of Young's pubs said requiring vaccine passports would be \"unworkable\", while Greene King and the City Pub Group also voiced their opposition to any such measure.\nThe chief executive of the Shepherd Neame pub chain said asking pub-goers to show vaccine passports was a \"fairly poorly thought out idea\" he would not be adopting.\nJonathan Neame told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's absolutely fine to exclude people where there is a situation of bad behaviour or drunkenness, and that's already enshrined in law.\n\"But if you're going to exclude people for what they are, or what they have not done, that's a wholly different issue which does touch on discrimination, civil liberties, and in this case data protection issues.\"\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said the industry was \"very nervous\" about the \"damage\" such a measure could do to it and \"the future of the Great British Pub\".\nShe told BBC News: \"They're asking us to enforce this at each venue and that's impossible for some of our venues to do - particularly our smaller community pubs in rural locations.\"\nHowever, Peter Marks, from nightclub owner Rekom UK, said a vaccine certificate \"could work\" in his industry and would probably be accepted by customers already used to carrying IDs to get into venues. However, he said he was concerned introducing such a measure could delay the reopening of businesses.\nShadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Labour was \"happy to look\" at any government proposals for vaccine and testing certification, but he called for clarity for the hospitality industry about how the measures could work in practice. \nHe said the hospitality industry had been through \"incredibly difficult times over the last year\", adding: \"And suddenly the prime minister comes along, out of the blue, to say here's a new responsibility you're going to have to deal with, without much clarity.\"\nSenior Tory backbencher Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Tory Covid Recovery Group, also expressed concern that businesses would be able to turn away customers \"from communities which have shown an unfortunate hesitancy to take up the offer of a vaccine\"."

      "tags": "Diversity,Television,Bafta Awards,Film,Riz Ahmed,Black interest",
      "text": "An actress who took part in a Bafta initiative aimed at improving diversity in the film and TV industry has said she was subjected to racist comments while on the scheme and was not given appropriate disability support. \nIndia Eva Rae - who starred in the Channel 4 TV series On the Edge - was one of 21 actors to join the Elevate scheme's 2019 intake. \nShe described Elevate as a \"PR exercise\" that failed to open doors for its participants, who she says were recruited to \"clean up\" Bafta's image. \nBafta said the vast majority of its participants have a positive experience on the programme.\nElevate was established in 2017, shortly after the academy was criticised for releasing all-white nomination lists in the leading actor and actress categories for its annual film awards. \nThe backlash that followed the announcement saw #BaftaSoWhite trending on social media.  \nRae said that Elevate participants were promised bespoke programmes tailored to their needs, including meetings with casting directors and other influential figures within the industry. \nBut, in one such meeting, she said a casting director referred to her as an \"exotic talent\", adding: \"I can't understand the English coming out your mouth.\" Rae said she was then advised to learn English, and to take pronunciation lessons.\nShe said that after the meeting at Bafta HQ, she turned for advice to one of the mentors on the scheme, who advised her not to report the incident. \"This mentor told me and other members of the group that we will never work again if we speak up.\" \nBafta said it hasn't received any complaints about either incident, but that if it had they would have been taken extremely seriously. Its CEO Amanda Berry told the BBC they were made aware Rae had had a negative experience with a casting director, but denied that the incident had happened at an Elevate event.\nBafta's website says Elevate is \"designed to support people from under-represented groups in the screen industries to progress their careers and encourage inclusion across the industries\".\n\"I'm not really from this world,\" Rae said. \"At the time Channel 4 spotted me I was living in a refuge\u2026 I was homeless.\" It was while she was filming On the Edge that she was encouraged to apply for the Bafta scheme.\nRae said she's worried that if she doesn't speak up, nothing will change. \"I'm very conscious of my privilege of being in these rooms and my duty of care to speak up.\"\nThe actress has an auditory processing disorder (APD) that makes understanding spoken information more difficult. Actors with a disability were among the groups specifically encouraged to apply to Elevate by Bafta.\nDespite, that Rae said she had to ask Bafta repeatedly for support with her needs. \"Why would Bafta create a system where we were set up to fail?\" she added. \"Why did Bafta fail to organise any access co-ordinators, any access audits?\"\nShe is calling for an independent organisation to be allowed to investigate Bafta's procedures. The academy recently announced a new anti-bullying initiative in association with the British Film Institute, and backed by over 40 organisations across film, television and gaming.\nBafta's Head of New Talent, Tim Hunter, told Variety that \"one of the key reasons people don't report this behaviour is because they don't have faith in the structures that exist to deal with it\".\nRae said when she tried to raise a formal complaint with Hunter regarding the Elevate scheme, he told her that her place on the initiative could be at risk as a result. \"I'm shocked because he's currently out there speaking about systems of bullying in our industry\u2026 The only difficulties in access, bullying, and a culture of fear that I've experienced are at Bafta.\"\nBafta said Rae misunderstood Hunter. It said that if a formal complaint is launched, it might pause participation to ensure a complainant was supported, but that they would consider extending their place on the programme.\nBafta CEO Amanda Berry also told the BBC that Elevate asks every participant about their needs on application forms, and in conversations when they start. \nShe said they don't have in-house disability advisers, but that they draw on a wealth of independent experts - and that if an access support worker were needed, Bafta would cover the costs. She said in this case she is confident everything was done to support Rae.\n\"It is a matter of great sadness and regret for me that anyone would feel this way, and our door remains completely open to find a solution, and to ensure that every participant benefits from the scheme,\" she added. \n\"I know that other participants have found this to be a truly fantastic opportunity.\""

The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. \nThere are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are: \nThis means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region.\nThe Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. \nIt is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance.\nIn previous elections, votes were counted as soon as the polls closed at 22:00, with the results being announced overnight. \nThe pandemic means that the votes in this election will not start to be counted until the morning after, with a final result not expected until the weekend of 8/9 May.\nThe SNP, led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, lost its overall majority in the 2016 election, but continued in power after forming a minority government.\nThe Scottish Conservatives - led by Ruth Davidson - finished second after overtaking Scottish Labour for the first time, while the Scottish Greens were fourth - ahead of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. \nThe SNP has won every Scottish Parliament election since 2007.\nThe election campaign is likely to be dominated by the question of whether there should be another referendum on Scottish independence. \nThe SNP has already said it wants to hold a vote once the Covid pandemic ends - if the election returns another pro-independence majority.\nThe Scottish Greens also back independence, but the Scottish Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats are all opposed and say the country's focus should be on recovering from the pandemic rather than the constitution.\nHealth, education, the environment and the economy are among the other important issues for voters, and all are likely to feature prominently during the campaign.\nSocial distancing rules mean the campaign will look and feel very different to normal.\nParty campaigners will not be able to knock on doors, for example, and there will be no large gatherings for set-piece events such as TV debates or manifesto launches. \nMuch of the campaign is likely to play out online instead, with BBC Scotland planning to hold two virtual debates. \nIt is also expected that more people than ever before will choose to vote by post rather than going to a polling place. \nThere are three ways to vote:\nThe deadline to register to vote is Monday 19 April.\nThe deadline to register for a postal vote is 6 April.\nThe deadline to register for a proxy vote is 27 April.\nYou can register to vote online.\nUse our concise manifesto guide to compare where the parties stand on key issues like Covid-19, independence and the environment."

      "tags": "Human rights,Myanmar",
      "text": "As violence against Myanmar's civilians mounts, Western powers have been ratcheting up economic pressure on the country's military following its internationally condemned coup on 1 February.\nThe US and UK, for instance, have imposed sanctions on Myanmar's two military conglomerates - Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (MEHL) - which control significant portions of Myanmar's economy and have interests across many major industries. \nThe US Treasury Department has also blocked assets and transactions with Myanmar's state-run gem company, a key source of income for the military authorities, while the EU has imposed sanctions on several individuals linked to the military.\nHuman rights groups and democracy activists have long pushed for sanctions, arguing that they fund the military's repression of protesters. More than 600 people have been killed by security forces since the coup began.\n\"These actions will specifically target those who led the coup, the economic interests of the military, and the funding streams supporting the Burmese military's brutal repression,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said. \"They are not directed at the people of Burma.\"\nBut while the West, most notably the US, has been keen to take the lead in imposing sanctions, Myanmar's biggest trade partners in Asia have rejected that approach.\nCritics worry that the uneven pressure won't be enough to force change.\n\"The leverage is not really there,\" said Richard Horsey, a Myanmar expert with the International Crisis Group. \nOne example that lays out the complexity of imposing sanctions and enforcing them is Golden City, a Yangon mixed-use development with an unobstructed view of the city's most famous landmark Schwedagon Pagoda. \nThe activist group Justice for Myanmar says the development is a cash cow for Myanmar's military that channels millions into the military department \"which buys weapons of war that are used on the people of Myanmar in the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\"\nSingapore-listed company Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC) - which owns a 49% stake in the development through a number of local companies - halted trading in February after Justice for Myanmar published the allegations, and the stock exchange demanded the company explain its part in the project.\nThe company admits its partner in Myanmar has ties to the military. It makes lease payments for Golden City into an account administered by the Quartermaster General's Office, which reports to the Ministry of Defence. \nBut ETC denies those funds could have been used to commit human rights abuses, saying that under Myanmar law, the Quartermaster General must turn over all funds to the government's budget account. And it told the Singapore stock exchange (SGX) that's where its responsibilities end. \n\"The company is entitled to assume that the application of funds administered by Myanmar government ministries is in conformity with existing provisions of Myanmar law, and as such, makes no comment on the actual use of the lease payments it is obligated to make,\" ETC said in its responses to questions from the SGX.  \nThe company suspended trading in early March on the Singapore exchange while it seeks out an \"independent\" review to clarify its dealings in Myanmar to investors.\nETC declined interview requests, and Myanmar's embassy in Singapore didn't respond to requests for comment.  \nThe row over the development is a reflection of the fragmented international response to the 1 February coup.  Activists might cause headaches for ETC, but the company can't be in breach of sanctions because Singapore hasn't imposed any.\nBoth critics and proponents of a tougher approach agree that up until now the sanctions  - which only targeted Myanmar's top brass - have been fairly weak.  \n\"The Myanmar military are not going to fall down on the floor, cry and say 'oh my god, I've lost my visa to the US, my life is over'. They'll probably laugh,\" said Kishore Mahbubani, a former Singapore diplomat and a Distinguished Fellow at the Asia Research Institute at the National University of Singapore. \nMore broadly, sanctions as a policy tool have a patchy record. \nResearchers from the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) evaluated over 200 cases and found that only a third were a complete or partial success. Others using the same data put the hit rate at just 5%, arguing the PIIE researchers were too generous in their definition of success. \nTheir track record in Myanmar - which was not part of the PIIE study - is hotly debated. \nSome say they played a key role in forcing the military regime to release Aung San Suu Kyi and reopen the country a decade ago, while others say they either weren't significant or only made a difference after the ruling junta decided to change course.    \nGary Hufbauer, who led the PIIE's research, said sanctions tend to have a higher chance of success against poor countries like Myanmar. \nBut they tend to be most successful when the goals are modest, the target countries are not autocratic, and they lack external \"black knights\" who might throw their economy a lifeline. \nPrevious sanctions on Myanmar have had a humanitarian impact. For example, the US state department estimated that a 2003 US ban on Burmese textile imports cost 50-60,000 jobs (although orders from the EU mitigated the effect). \nMr Horsey worries that ordinary people rather than the government could again pay the price, especially if the sanctions turn into a broader attempt to bankrupt the state.  But human rights groups say the current sanctions are more targeted than those Myanmar faced previously, and point out that democracy activists in Myanmar are themselves boycotting military-linked companies.\n\"We're not doing anything that the Myanmar people aren't doing themselves,\" said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch. \nIf sanctions are aimed at hurting the military without shutting down the economy, the question then becomes whether or not foreign businesses can still operate in Myanmar while tiptoeing around the two conglomerates. \nHtwe Htwe Thein, an Associate Professor of International Business at Curtin University in Perth, said the two businesses are not all-encompassing, and many consumer goods companies could probably continue to operate. But the same isn't true for Myanmar's resources sector.   \n\"The ownership of the military is rampant in there. It's everywhere in the extractive sector,\" she said. \nBut if sanctions force western oil and gas companies to withdraw, Mr Horsey expects that businesses from China or Thailand would replace them. \n\"If companies like Woodside and Total are forced to divest, they're going to have to sell off their assets rather cheaply, and it's pretty obvious who's going to buy them up,\" said Mr Horsey.   \nChina and Thailand account for more than half of the country's trade volume, while Singapore is the single largest foreign investor, generating $11bn over the past five years according to Myanmar government figures. \nWhile the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) has called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis, the group has flatly rejected sanctions. \nMr Mahbubani argues that quiet diplomacy behind the scenes could accomplish more.\n\"It's the southeast Asian way of avoiding confrontation. And frankly, you have to acknowledge that has kept Southeast Asia at peace for 30, 40 years now, finding diplomatic solutions, talking to each other and changing people's minds,\" he said.\nPhil Robertson attributes Asean's reluctance to self-interest.\n\"If it was left to Asean, nothing would happen at all,\" he said.   \n\"And the idea that they're somehow going to be part of the solution is rather laughable\". \nMr Mahbubani sees it very differently. He thinks the west's brash, critical approach during the Rohingya crisis, loudly condemning Aung San Suu Kyi for her reluctance to act, may have convinced the military that they could move against her because she no longer had allies. And he thinks it's unlikely that sanctions will change their mind now.  \n\"They are very stubborn people. The more public pressure you put on them, the more they'll dig their heels in,\" he said.

AstraZeneca has denied that it is failing to honour its contract.\nThe EU is expecting to receive about 30 million AstraZeneca doses by the end of March, less than a third of what it was hoping for. \n\"I think it is clear that first of all the company has to catch up,\" Mrs von der Leyen told a news conference after the virtual leaders' summit.\n\"[It] has to honour the contract it has with European member states before it can engage again in exporting vaccines,\" she said. \"We want to explain to our European citizens that they [can] get their fair share.\"\nThe EU was accused, primarily by the UK and the World Health Organization (WHO), of so-called vaccine nationalism after it introduced export controls on jabs produced within the bloc.\nIn response, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that \"blockades\" were not \"sensible\".\nHe said a ban would imperil the UK's vaccination drive, which has so far been more successful than EU member states' vaccine programmes.\nMr Johnson also warned that a ban that extended beyond AstraZeneca's disputed supply could also block jabs produced for BioNTech/Pfizer in Belgium. \nFrance's foreign minister said on Friday that the EU \"shouldn't be paying the price\" for the UK's vaccination policy.\n\"One can't play with blackmail, having given a lot of first jabs and then run into problems with the second,\" Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Info radio.\nMrs von der Leyen said on Thursday that EU was the \"region that exports most vaccines worldwide\" and invited other countries to \"match our openness\". \nHer comments came a day after the EU issued a joint statement with the UK in which both sides pledged to work together after weeks of tensions over the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nMeanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron backed the EU's export controls. \n\"I support the fact that we must block all exports for as long as some drug companies don't respect their commitments with Europeans,\" he said.\nEarlier, he expressed frustration at the slow pace of much of Europe's vaccine rollout. \"We didn't shoot for the stars,\" he told the Greek television channel ERT before the summit. \"We were wrong to lack ambition.\"\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said while his fellow leaders had found the Commission's tougher export measures \"acceptable\", he hoped they would never be used - a message echoed by his Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo.\nBoth those two countries are home to factories involved in the production of the AstraZeneca shot, which it's suggested may soon be sending increased supplies to European nations - a move that may assuage some EU anger, BBC Brussels correspondent Nick Beake reports.\nMr Rutte said an agreement with the UK over AstraZeneca components produced in the Netherlands could be announced this weekend.\nFollowing the virtual summit, the EU's 27 member states agreed to try and ramp up the production of vaccines within the bloc.\n\"Accelerating the production, delivery and deployment of vaccines remains essential and urgent to overcome the crisis. Efforts to this end must be further intensified,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\"We underline the importance of transparency as well as of the use of export authorisations,\" they added.\nThe EU also called on vaccine manufacturers to \"ensure predictability of their vaccine production and respect contractual delivery deadlines\".\nUS President Joe Biden also attended the virtual meeting, in an effort to repair ties with the EU after the strained relationship between the bloc and his predecessor, Donald Trump.\nAhead of Thursday's meeting, a former president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, urged the bloc to avoid a \"stupid vaccine war\" with the UK.\n\"We are not in war, and we are not enemies,\" he told the BBC's Hardtalk programme.\nHe added that threats of export bans could cause \"major reputational damage\" to the EU.\nA third wave of infections is sweeping across much of mainland Europe.\nEU states have seen some of the deadliest outbreaks of the pandemic, with Italy recording more than 106,000 deaths, France 93,000, Germany 75,000 and Spain 73,000.\nYet recent figures show just 12.9 doses of vaccine have been administered per 100 people in the EU compared with 44.7 in the UK and 37.2 in the US.\nSpeaking earlier this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the British variant had become the dominant strain circulating in Germany and amounted to \"a new pandemic\".\n\"The situation is serious,\" she said. \"Case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive care beds are filling up again.\"\nLockdowns have been re-imposed or extended in countries like Belgium or the Netherlands but there is particular concern over eastern EU states.\nPoland will close nurseries, pre-schools and hairdressers for two weeks from Saturday after coronavirus cases surged."

      "text": "Britain has lost \"significant\" access to EU policing data under the Brexit deal negotiated at the end of last year, a House of Lords report has said. \nIt also concluded that post-Brexit law enforcement arrangements are \"complex\" and \"untested\".\nAnd peers warned it would take much longer for vital data to be passed to frontline police officers.\nA government spokesman said the UK \"continues to be one of the safest countries in the world\".\nWhen the UK left the EU it lost automatic access to EU databases with information on criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons.\nUnder a deal struck between the two sides at the end of last year, the UK secured access to certain sets of information, for example air passenger data.\nThe Lords EU Security and Justice Sub-Committee has been examining the deal reached. \nIt found that the agreement \"avoids a cliff-edge departure\" by ensuring data, such as DNA, fingerprints and criminal records could still be shared. \nCommittee chairman Lord Ricketts, a former national security adviser, said the government had \"succeeded in avoiding an abrupt end to years of effective UK-EU joint working, which would have put the safety of citizens in the UK and across the EU at greater risk.\"\nHowever he added that there were \"grounds for considerable caution\". \nHe said new arrangements were \"complex and untested... and their effectiveness will depend crucially on how they are implemented at the operational level\". \nSpecifically the report draws attention to the UK's loss of access to the EU's criminal database - the Schengen Information System (SIS II).\nLeaving the system meant the UK lost access to 40,000 alerts about investigations in other European countries. \nThe committee said this represented a \"most significant gap\" for law enforcement and that the SIS II replacement meant information was available in \"a matter of hours, not seconds\".\nIt also warned that data sharing between the sides meant the EU would hold the UK to \"higher standards\" on data protection and could suspend any agreement \"if the UK chooses not to stay aligned with EU data protection rules in the future\".\nResponding to the report, Home Office Minister Kevin Foster said: \"The UK agreed a comprehensive security agreement with the EU that ensures the UK continues to be one of the safest countries in the world.\n\"We continue to work closely with domestic and EU partners to monitor the new arrangements and have excellent cooperation with EU member states on a wide range of law enforcement and criminal justice issues.\" "

      "tags": "Scottish Parliament election 2021,Scottish independence,Brexit,John Curtice",
      "text": "On the first official day of campaigning in the 2021 Scottish Parliament elections, polling expert Sir John Curtice considers the \"intense\" battle for every vote ahead of polling day on 6 May. \nVoters go to the polls in six weeks to elect a new Scottish Parliament. The ballot looks set to be another crucial chapter in Scotland's continuing debate about how it should be governed.\nAccording to the polls, voters are evenly divided on whether Scotland should be an independent country or whether it should remain part of the United Kingdom. On average recent polls put Yes to independence on 50%, No on 50%.\nThe issue seems set to influence the way in which many people will vote in an election in which voters will have two votes - one for their local constituency MSP, the other for a regional party list.\nThe SNP and the Greens will be arguing that there should be another referendum on independence. The Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats take the opposite view. \nAs our graph above shows, recent polls suggest that nearly nine in 10 of those who currently support independence are currently minded to support the SNP on the constituency vote. \nLess than one in 10 of those who oppose independence indicate that they will vote for Nicola Sturgeon's party.\nHowever, whereas most Yes supporters are nearly all backing the same party, the preferences of No voters are scattered across different parties.  \nSlightly less than half are supporting the Conservatives, just under a third Labour while one in eight are backing the Liberal Democrats.\nTrue, the Greens have the support of 11% of Yes supporters on the list vote (and only just 3% of No voters), but this still leaves the SNP a long way ahead among those who back independence.\nNot least of the reasons why support for independence, at 50%, is higher than the 45% recorded in the 2014 referendum, is that there has been swing in favour of leaving the UK among those who oppose Brexit.\nOn average the polls suggest that while just 34% of those who voted Leave in 2016 are in favour of independence, well over half (56%) of those who supported Remain now back the idea.\nThis has also opened up a division in party support that was largely not in evidence at the last Scottish Parliament election - which took place seven weeks before the EU referendum.\nAs our Brexit graph above shows, in 2016 SNP support differed little between those who went on to vote Remain and those who backed Leave. Now support for the party is 25 points higher among Remain supporters as it Leave voters.\nIn contrast, support for the Conservatives is now three times higher among Leave voters (45%) than among Remain supporters (15%).\nThe increased support for independence together with opposition to Brexit has enabled the SNP to establish a substantial lead in the polls, as the graph above shows. \nOn average the party is 26 points ahead of the Conservatives on the constituency vote and 20 points ahead on the list vote. Labour are trailing a little further behind in third place.\nAs the opposition parties have acknowledged, it will take a dramatic change of fortunes between now and the beginning of May for anyone other than the SNP to come first.\nHowever, the target the unionist parties appear to have set themselves is to try to deny the SNP an overall majority - something which is very difficult to achieve under Scotland's proportional representation system.\nIt was the SNP's success in winning an overall majority in 2011 that paved the way for the independence referendum in 2014. \nIf the SNP were to repeat that feat it would be more difficult for the prime minister simply to say 'No' to another referendum.\nFrom the figures in our chart, the SNP might just miss out on an overall majority - or might just make it. With the outcome of the election seemingly on such a crucial knife edge, it looks as though there will be an intense battle for every vote between now and polling day in May.\nJohn Curtice is Professor of Politics and Senior Research Fellow, ScotCen Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'"

      "text": "Jackie Weaver has joined critics of a government move to end virtual council meetings in England from May.\nMinister Luke Hall has written to local authorities saying the government is under too much pressure to fit in legislation to allow them to continue.\nMs Weaver, who rose to fame after a meeting of Handforth Parish Council went viral, said it would be \"dreadful\" to bring them to an end.\nThe Local Government Association also called for the decision to be reversed.\nChair of the organisation, Councillor James Jamieson, said reintroducing face-to-face meetings \"could easily involve up to 200 people in one room, even before adding in members of the public and reporters\" - so their return would pose a \"significant challenge\" to councils to make them Covid-secure.\nLawyers in local government, along with Hertfordshire County Council, have now made an application to the courts to declare authorities already have the powers needed to hold online meetings.\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it had asked councils to share their experiences of remote meetings, saying they will use the evidence \"to inform any potential future legislation regarding their use beyond the pandemic\".\nLike many other organisations, local councils were forced to go online in 2020 due to the pandemic and restrictions on public meetings. \nEmergency legislation was passed in the Commons to give them the power to do business over video conferencing tools, but the temporary law is due to run out the day after the local elections on 6 May. \nIn his letter, Mr Hall - the minister for regional growth and local government - praised the efforts of local authorities in England, saying they had \"risen magnificently to the challenges of this period\". \nBut he said extending virtual meetings past May would involved primary legislation in the Commons, which would have a \"significant impact... on the government's legislative programme, which is already under severe pressure in these unprecedented times\".\nMrs Weaver - the chief officer of the Cheshire Association of Local Councils - told BBC Radio Derby it would be \"dreadful\" to bring virtual meetings to an end. \nShe added: \"I think all the evidence is out there to show that actually Zoom has done more... [and] has been instrumental in getting people involved.\n\"We can see it in the figures [with] people turning up. We are seeing it in the people that are showing interest in elections. \n\"I am not saying all council meetings should be held virtually and I know a lot of my councils are keen to get back to face-to-face meetings, but it would be so helpful, so valuable to be able to hold Zoom meetings.\" \nMr Jamieson agreed the move risked \"damaging the gains seen in public participation in remote council meetings during the pandemic and our vital local democratic process\".\nHe also pointed to the imbalance when it came to the rules in Westminster.\n\"MPs will retain the right to participate remotely until at least 21 June, but the powers-that-be in the House of Commons will not make time available to legislate for councillors to do the same,\" he added.\nThe County Councils Network said the government's decision was \"deeply disappointing, considering the success of remote meetings\".\nIts chairman, Councillor David Williams, said he had concerns over whether face-to-face council meetings could be done safely, adding: \"The decision is illogical when you bear in mind the government's own guidance stipulates that indoor events cannot be organised until 17 May at the earliest.\"\nAsked for a response to the criticism, the ministry sent a statement from Mr Hall, who said: \"Councils continue to play a vital role in our response to the pandemic and I am grateful for how they have used emergency powers introduced a year ago to continue to operate at a difficult time.\n\"As the vaccine roll-out continues and restrictions are lifted, councils holding face-to-face meetings from 7 May are being given the support and guidance they need to do so in a safe and secure way.\"\nHe added: \"I am keen to hear from councils and local residents about their experiences of virtual meetings so that we can properly consider whether to make these a permanent option.\" "

      "tags": "Domestic abuse,Housing,Landlords",
      "text": "Domestic abuse support groups have warned that women will be unsafe if unregulated refuges are allowed to continue offering accommodation.\nOne organisation said \"women could die\" if the practice does not stop.\nThey fear the government's Domestic Abuse Bill could see private landlords offering rooms for vulnerable women fleeing violence.\nThe government said it was introducing a new legal duty for councils to provide safe accommodation.\nThose working in the domestic abuse support sector say the bill - which is going through Parliament - could allow people with no expertise in such cases to compete for funding to provide accommodation.  \nThis could lead to more victims being placed in unsafe housing, the groups said. \nThe word refuge isn't mentioned in the Domestic Abuse Bill, only \"relevant accommodation\". Charities want a definition included for what a specialist refuge service should be, or a set of standards by which providers have to abide.\nLucy Hadley from domestic abuse charity Women's Aid said: \"You cannot just set these services up on the cheap, and without the experience and expertise and quality that a specialist woman's refuge, like a Women's Aid member service would have.\n\"We're really worried that in those circumstances the actual place, the housing, is unsafe for women and children to be in - but also that they will not see that as a suitable option for them and they may well return to the perpetrator that puts them at further risk of harm.\"\nExamples of this include hostels being opened in places with high rates of anti-social behaviour and criminal activity, which the charities say leave women vulnerable to exploitation.\nOnline web chats and text services are also available.\nFiona Dwyer, chief executive of women's organisation Solace, said: \"We've already seen in one case in Birmingham where a woman was murdered by her perpetrator when they were both living in the same so-called refuge.\"\nShe warned unregulated spaces provided by groups with no expertise could be dangerous and that \"more women could die\".\nIt comes amid a massive increase in appeals for help over the past year from people suffering domestic abuse, which campaigners have said exposes the scale of the problem.  \nFor the past few months Zara (not her real name) has been living in a refuge run by Solace in the south of England. She left her violent partner in 2020 after experiencing more than a decade of abuse. \n\"He tried to control everything and completely broke me - what I wore, who I spoke to, where I went. He would pull my hair, strangle me and there was sexual violence too: he'd pin me down and rape me.\"\nNow she says she finally feels safe - but the refuge does not only provide her with a secure and secret place to live. \nStaff there are trained to help women find permanent accommodation as well as how to help with family court issues and applying for benefits. They can provide solicitors and offer counselling too. \nRefuges are partly funded by the housing benefit received by the women living there. \nCampaigners call the trend of outside organisations offering properties for victims \"rent-farming\". Once they are set up as \"exempt\" accommodation providers, a category of supported housing in which landlords have to provide care or support, they are eligible for higher housing benefit rates. \n\"Many of the rent farmers are doing it because they get huge profits\u2026 so they're essentially profiting out of really vulnerable people,\" said Ms Dwyer.\nJess Phillips, shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, said: \"I call it the Wild West because there is literally no regulation to stop any landlord buying up a property today and... whacking that house full of a random selection of vulnerable people... and charging the taxpayer five times more.\"\nShe said she tried to get a definition of \"safe accommodation\" included in the bill but the government rejected it. \nThe Domestic Abuse Bill covers England and Wales, but the duty on local authorities to provide support and funding for victims of domestic abuse only applies in England. The issues it focuses on are devolved matters for Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nWhen it becomes law, the bill will place a legal duty on councils to fund what it calls \"relevant accommodation\" for victims of domestic abuse and their children. \nAnd while Women's Aid welcome this, they say it does not go far enough.\n\"The new duty on local authorities to fund support for survivors could be a real step forward in tackling the funding crisis that specialist women's refuges are currently facing,\" said Lucy Hadley. \n\"But it doesn't have any expectation about the types of organisation that can deliver this support. \n\"It doesn't make clear that they should be women's organisations that have expertise and knowledge and experience in supporting survivors of domestic abuse.\"\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it had provided \"unprecedented support\" throughout the pandemic \"to help the most vulnerable in society\". \n\"We are introducing a new legal duty on councils to provide support for domestic abuse victims and their children within safe accommodation, including refuges, and backed by \u00a3125m to ensure services are available to all,\" they said. \nIn the meantime, Zara said there is no way she could have got her life back on track without the full wrap-around support and services from Solace.\n\"I wouldn't have been able to do it,\" she said. \"I had no-one, literally no-one to support me or help me. You can't do it on your own - it's impossible.\"\nListen to more on this issue on Newscast on BBC Sounds"

      "text": "The stranded Ever Given mega-container ship in the Suez Canal is holding up an estimated $9.6bn (\u00a37bn) of goods each day, according to shipping data.\nThis works out at $400m an hour in trade along the waterway which is a vital passageway between east and west.\nData from shipping expert Lloyd's List values the canal's westbound traffic at roughly $5.1bn a day, and eastbound daily traffic at around $4.5bn. \nDespite efforts to free the ship, it could take weeks to remove experts say.\nThe Ever Given, operated by the Taiwanese company Evergreen Marine, is the length of four football pitches and one of the world's biggest container vessels. The 200,000-tonne ship is capable of carrying 20,000 containers.\nIts blockage is causing huge tailbacks of other ships trying to pass through the Suez Canal.\nThe canal, which separates Africa from the Middle East and Asia, is one of the busiest trade routes in the world, with about 12% of total global trade moving through it.\nAccording to Lloyd's List tracking data there are more than 160 vessels waiting at either end of the canal. These include 41 bulk carriers and 24 crude tankers.\nAlong with oil, the sea traffic is largely consumer products such as clothing, furniture, manufacturing components and car parts. \n\"We're hearing reports now that shipping companies are starting to divert their ships around the southern tip of Africa, the Cape of Good Hope, which adds about 3,500 miles to the journey and up to 12 days,\" Guy Platten, the secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, told the BBC's Today programme.\nHe said the ship appeared to be \"hard fast aground\", adding that freeing the vessel from the bank was taking much longer and was more complicated than had been initially expected.\nMr Platten added there would be \"some major real-world effects on the supply chain\", explaining that consumers would would ultimately bear the cost.\nThe Ever Given had been scheduled to arrive in the port of Felixstowe in early April.\nContainer ships have nearly doubled in size in the past decade as global trade expands, making the job of moving them much harder when they get stuck.\n\"What are we thinking? Have vessels gotten too large? Containers being jettisoned overboard, delayed transits due to terminal congestion and let us not forget the long line of vessels at many ports waiting for a berth,\" said Jon Monroe, who runs his own ocean transportation consultancy.\nBIMCO, an international shipping association, says the delays will only continue to grow and affect supplies.\n\"For each day of delay my thought is it will take two days to undo the delays,\" said Alan Baer, president of logistics provider OL USA.\n\"Right now three days creates six days of ongoing delays.  I'm not sure this is a perfect formula, but it will be close,\" he told the BBC.\nIn addition to delaying thousands of containers loaded with consumer items, the stranded ship has also tied up empty containers which are needed for exports.\nIf the delays are short, most companies will absorb the extra delay in transit times. But salvage officials said the congestion could last days or even weeks, in a blow to global supply chains already strained by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nSome companies will be considering flying replacement merchandise for higher value products, or transporting them via trains.\nTwo major shipping companies, Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, said they are looking into options to avoid the Suez Canal.  \nEgypt's Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said it was doing all it could to refloat the ship with tug boats, dredgers and heavy earth-moving equipment.\nKitack Lim, secretary general of the International Maritime Organisation, said: \" I am aware of the implications of the temporary closure of the canal, and I ask for patience from stakeholders across the supply chain as everyone works to ensure that the ship, its crew, its cargo and the environment remain protected.\" "

He said they were aggressively \"hounded for them\" - adding that pupils would buy and sell them.\nOn Thursday, pupils at Highgate School walked out of classes following the publication of accounts of alleged abuse. \nThe BBC has also seen a dossier of allegations made by more than 200 current and former pupils at Highgate School. The document includes first-hand accounts of alleged abuse as well as claims that rape was \"tolerated\" by staff.\nThe anonymous testimonies made in the document were written by pupils in response to the question: \"What is your experience of rape culture at Highgate School?\"\nMany include claims of abuse in classrooms or away from school, with one describing how they were raped by one boy, sexually assaulted by two others, \"and sexually harassed by too many to keep count\".\n\"I have to walk around school seeing the guy who raped me every single day,\" the testimony read.\nMany of the testimonies are anonymous and cannot be verified by the BBC.\nAsked about the allegations, Dame Rachel - England's new children's commissioner - said it was \"alarming\". She said: \"It's really distressing, and we get lots of testimony like this.\" \nShe said there was \"very clear advice on sexual violence and harassment\" for schools. \"When it is serious it must be escalated to both social care and to the police and schools need to follow that.\"\nMaria Miller, a Conservative MP and former chair of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, said the problem was not unique to independent schools. \n\"It's a problem with the way that we're allowing culture to develop in our schools,\" she said. \"And if we hear the testimony of young women from across the country, it will be difficult to simply dismiss it out of hand.\"\nIn a statement, Highgate School's governing body said it was \"truly sorry\" and had commissioned an immediate external review into the allegations.\nIt will be lead by a former High Court judge and ex-Lady Justice of Appeal of England and Wales, Dame Anne Rafferty.\n\"We will make public its findings when they are available, and we are committed to taking whatever action is required to achieve the necessary culture change at Highgate,\" the statement said. \nA Department for Education spokesperson said any abuse towards a child was unacceptable and \"school should be a place where all children feel safe and are protected from harm\".\nIt said the regulation of independent schools had been strengthened in 2016, adding: \"Where schools do not meet those strict standards, we take strong action quickly.\"\nIt comes as numerous other schools and universities have faced similar allegations in recent weeks as a part of an online campaign where users post anonymous testimonies of sexual assault and harassment they had experienced.\nMore than 5,600 accounts feature on the Everyone's Invited site."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus testing,Hospitality industry,Pubs,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It may only be possible to introduce a vaccine passports scheme once all adults have been offered a jab, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested.\nHe said no decisions had been made but there would be an update on the idea in April. A review will report in June.\nThere were \"difficult issues... moral complexities, ethical problems that need to be addressed\", the PM added.\nAny passport could also reflect a negative test result as well as whether someone was vaccinated or has immunity.\nOn Thursday afternoon, MPs voted to extend emergency coronavirus powers in England for another six months, with 484 in favour, and 76 against, giving a majority of 408. \nThe Coronavirus Act was introduced in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic.\nMeanwhile, the UK has recorded another 6,397 new infections and 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the government's daily figures.\nToday's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure - but the number of Covid-related deaths has fallen by 32, compared with a week ago.\nThe latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine.\nMeanwhile, publicans have case doubt on a suggestion from Mr Johnson that pub-goers might have to prove their vaccination status when venues reopen.\nA government review into the possible use of coronavirus passports or status certificates to allow people to visit pubs and other venues is taking place under the plans to ease England's lockdown. \nMr Johnson said previous coronavirus infections could be a feature, if the certificates are adopted.\n\"There are three basic components. There's the vaccine, there's your immunity you might have had after you've had Covid, and there's testing - they are three things that could work together.\"\nHowever he added: \"No decisions have been taken at all. One thing I will make clear is none of this is obviously going to apply on April 12 when it will all be outdoors anyway.\" \nSpeaking on a visit to a nursery in west London, Mr Johnson said: \"There are some people who for medical reasons can't get a vaccination, pregnant women can't get a vaccination at the moment, you've got to be careful about how you do this.\n\"You might only be able to implement a thorough-going vaccination passport scheme even if you wanted such a thing in the context of when absolutely everybody had been offered a vaccine.\" \nIn the Commons, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who is leading the review, told MPs: \"A system that relied purely on vaccination would not be appropriate.\n\"What would be right was a system that ensured we could open up our economy to the maximum extent that takes into account both vaccine status but also of recent test status and indeed potentially also antibody status as well,\" he added.\nUnder government plans to ease the lockdown in England, pubs will be able to start serving customers indoors - with a size limit applied to groups - from 17 May at the earliest. \nThe idea of asking pub-goers to show a so-called vaccine passport or certificate was raised at Wednesday's House of Commons Liaison Committee hearing when Boris Johnson was asked whether they were \"compatible with a free society such as ours\".\nMr Johnson said the concept \"should not be totally alien to us\" - pointing out that doctors already have to have hepatitis B jabs - although he stressed such a move in future \"may be up to individual publicans\".\nA Downing Street source earlier said the review would include looking at how people's vaccination and testing status could be stored securely and displayed on a mobile phone, and the circumstances under which such a system could apply.\nSpeaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said \"all sorts of things were being considered\" and it was \"really a bit premature\" to speculate on details about how a possible vaccine passport would apply to pubs.\nThe boss of Young's pubs said requiring vaccine passports would be \"unworkable\", while Greene King and the City Pub Group also voiced their opposition to any such measure.\nThe chief executive of the Shepherd Neame pub chain said asking pub-goers to show vaccine passports was a \"fairly poorly thought out idea\" he would not be adopting.\nJonathan Neame told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's absolutely fine to exclude people where there is a situation of bad behaviour or drunkenness, and that's already enshrined in law.\n\"But if you're going to exclude people for what they are, or what they have not done, that's a wholly different issue which does touch on discrimination, civil liberties, and in this case data protection issues.\"\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said the industry was \"very nervous\" about the \"damage\" such a measure could do to it and \"the future of the Great British Pub\".\nShe told BBC News: \"They're asking us to enforce this at each venue and that's impossible for some of our venues to do - particularly our smaller community pubs in rural locations.\"\nHowever, Peter Marks, from nightclub owner Rekom UK, said a vaccine certificate \"could work\" in his industry and would probably be accepted by customers already used to carrying IDs to get into venues. However, he said he was concerned introducing such a measure could delay the reopening of businesses.\nShadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Labour was \"happy to look\" at any government proposals for vaccine and testing certification, but he called for clarity for the hospitality industry about how the measures could work in practice. \nHe said the hospitality industry had been through \"incredibly difficult times over the last year\", adding: \"And suddenly the prime minister comes along, out of the blue, to say here's a new responsibility you're going to have to deal with, without much clarity.\"\nSenior Tory backbencher Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Tory Covid Recovery Group, also expressed concern that businesses would be able to turn away customers \"from communities which have shown an unfortunate hesitancy to take up the offer of a vaccine\"."

      "text": "An Army major general who dishonestly claimed \u00a348,000 for his children's boarding school fees has been jailed.\nNick Welch, 57, claimed to live in London rather than Dorset, near their schools.\nWelch was convicted of fraud by a panel of senior officers after a four-week trial at Bulford Military Court and handed a 21-month sentence.\nHe is believed to be the most senior officer to be court-martialled since 1815.\nJudge Advocate Gen Alan Large also sentenced Welch to retrospective dismissal from the Army, meaning he can no longer benefit from his rank of retired major general.\nWelch, who left the military in 2018, has been ordered to pay back the fraudulently claimed cash. \nThe Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA) allows children to remain at the same schools to enable their serving parent to be accompanied by their spouse as they are posted to different locations.\nHowever, it cannot be claimed if a soldier's spouse is away from the military home for more than 90 days per year, the trial heard.\nThe prosecution said Welch applied for the allowance on the basis both he and his wife would not be living close to the children.\nBut it said his wife Charlotte actually spent most of her time at a cottage in Blandford Forum, Dorset, close to the \u00a337,000-a-year Clayesmore School and the \u00a322,500-a-year Hanford School.\nAn investigation was launched after a neighbour told authorities about the family's absence from London.\nJudge Large said: \"A disciplined organisation such as the Army relies on those in rank and authority to set an example and to be beyond reproach.\n\"The higher your rank, the more important it is that you uphold the values and standards of the Army in which you serve and when an officer of the rank of major general offends as you have, the potential to erode discipline and undermine morale is considerable.\"\nWelch joined the Army in 1984 and when he retired he held the position of the assistant chief of general staff at Ministry of Defence (MoD) headquarters in London.\nHe had been awarded medals for his service in Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and for long service with good conduct.\nJudge Large told him: \"In stark contrast to the events leading to your conviction in this trial, you had a highly successful military career, served your country with distinction on operations and you were a fine ambassador for your service and nation.\"\nDuring the trial, Welch denied being dishonest and said his wife was living with him for the majority of the time.\nHis barrister, Sarah Jones QC, had argued that the CEA system and the 90-day rule were a \"mess\" and not strictly enforced.\nMiss Jones said the sentence would \"shake the foundations of the man and what he has achieved and what he has failed in two things he cared about most\".\nShe said his career had been \"brought to an ignominious end and his family life has been shattered as his children are distraught and his wife puts a brave face on things\".\nWelch was remorseful and acknowledged \"he had not taken enough care\", she added.\nA character reference from the former Commander of Joint Forces Command, General Sir Richard Barrons, said Welch was of \"unimpeachable integrity\".\nBut prosecutor Sarah Clarke QC said he had attempted to manipulate the figures regarding his family's locations to cover up his dishonesty.\nWelch will spend half his sentence in prison before being released on licence.\nFollowing his sentencing, an MoD spokesperson said: \"It has been proven in this case that retired Major General Nicholas Welch OBE did commit fraud and he has been sentenced accordingly.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Mark Harper,Steven Baker,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "MPs have voted to extend emergency coronavirus powers for another six months.\nThey backed the health secretary's call to renew \"essential\" emergency rules to deal with the pandemic as England moves out of lockdown. \nBut some Conservatives voted against the measures saying they were \"out of step\" with the roadmap for lifting restrictions. \nMinisters say the powers will stay in place \"only as long as necessary\". \nThe Coronavirus Act came in to force in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic with ministers pledging to use the measures \"when strictly necessary\".\nThe law gave the government wide-ranging powers unlike others seen before - from shutting down pubs, through to detaining individuals deemed at risk as part of efforts to contain the spread of the virus.\nMPs voted by 484 to 76 to extend it - 36 Conservative MPs rebelled, by opposing the legislation. Twenty-one Labour MPs also voted against it. \nMPs agreed to extend it until the end of September as well as voting on England's roadmap out of lockdown and the continuation of virtual proceedings in the Commons. \nOpening the debate ahead of the vote, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the legislation had been a \"crucial part\" of the government's response to coronavirus, enabling ministers to bring forward measures such as furlough and statutory sick pay for those self-isolating.\nBut he said 12 provisions in the legislation were no longer needed because of progress that had been made in dealing with the virus.\nThese include easing some responsibilities on the social care sector, laws governing the retention of biometric data for health and security purposes, and obligations on businesses that work in the food supply chain. \nMr Hancock acknowledged some people were concerned about the powers contained in the act.\nHe said: \"Although this act remains essential and there are elements of it which we are seeking the renewal of, we have always said we will only retain powers as long as they are necessary.\"\nBut the chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, Sir Graham Brady, said he would vote against because \"it is important we make the case for a return to normality and trusting people with their own lives\".\nHe said: \"These powers were given by Parliament to government last March as a very temporary set of extreme emergency measures. Nobody then envisaged that they would still be in place a year later, still be in use 18 months on. \n\"I think we need to be very cautious about the dangers of normalising what is actually a very extreme policy response.\"\nThe deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown sceptics, Conservative Steve Baker, said the vote was a \"rare opportunity\" for MPs to \"say no to a new way of life in a checkpoint society\".\nHe said he was reassured by the prime minister's comment at the Liaison Committee on Wednesday that \"anything that is redundant will go\".\nTonight's rebellion by 35 Conservatives won't trouble Boris Johnson - overall MPs backed the renewal of sweeping powers to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. \nMany of the Tories who voted against the government have been persistent critics of its approach to restrictions and lockdowns. \nFor them, it's about trust. \nReassurances from ministers about powers only being used when necessary in extreme circumstances don't cut it. \nThere is deep unease about the scope of these powers and the very fact they are available to the government, even if they're not being used. \nBut the pandemic has changed expectations of what governments can and should do in extreme circumstances. Freedoms considered sacrosanct have been suspended in the spirit of saving lives. \nThe public may have been willing to largely comply, but there are at least a few dozen MPs willing to argue the price society has paid has been too high. \nLabour backed the extension of the emergency powers but said its support was not offered \"with any enthusiasm\". \nThe shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \"Given the loss of life we have suffered and given the risks of mutations that could set us back, we must have zero tolerance to letting the virus rage unchecked.\n\"For that reason we do accept that restrictions have to stay in place and for that reason we support the renewal of the act and the public health regulations.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats also voted against the measures. \nOne of its MPs, Tim Farron, said the powers were \"an over-reach\" that the government \"does not need\" and he described them as a \"default knee-jerk attempt to seek draconian powers\" that he said \"fit in to a pattern\" of eroding civil liberties. \nA government review into the possible use of coronavirus passports or status certificates to allow people to visit pubs and other venues is taking place under the plans to ease England's lockdown.\nThe prime minister said there would be an update on the idea in April, and a review will report in June.\nThe leader of the Covid Recovery Group, Conservative Mark Harper, said the idea of vaccine certificates to enter pubs was \"unconscionable\" and raised \"practical, moral and ethical issues\".\n\"We've asked young people to do a lot over the last year and I think the least we can do is to get the economy open, so that their futures are not damaged any further,\" he said. \nSpeaking on a visit to west London, the prime minister rejected suggestions he was no longer concerned about protecting individual freedoms.\nHe said: \"The libertarian in me is also trying to protect individual's fundamental right to life and their ability to live their lives normally and the only way really to restore that for everybody, is for us to beat the disease.\n\"The best path to freedom is down the cautious but irreversible roadmap that we've set out. That's what the freedom lover wants.\""

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\".

They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden was pressed on how he would address the surge in migrants at the southern border at his first official press conference.\nMore than 17,000 children are being kept in government detention centres and Mr Biden was challenged on whether his policies could be contributing to the increase in child arrivals.\nThe president defended his record and vowed to be transparent.\nThe hour-long event also covered subjects from guns to foreign policy.\nHe also doubled his administration's vaccine rollout goal, saying that he now aims to have 200 million jabs be given before his 100th day in office.\nBut questions about the situation at the US-Mexico border dominated the event.\nDuring the White House news conference, Mr Biden blamed his predecessor Donald Trump for the growing humanitarian crisis on the southern  border, and said it was normal for the US to experience an influx of migrants in cooler months.\n\"The truth of the matter is, nothing has changed,\" he said, adding: \"The reason they're coming is that it's the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert.\"\n\"I'd like to think it's because I'm a nice guy, but it's not,\" he said, calling the surge a cyclical event.\nHe also blamed the \"circumstances in their country,\" including natural disasters, crime and lack of economic opportunity.\nAsked when he would make government-run detention centres open to visits from reporters, Mr Biden said he \"will commit to transparency\". \n\"You'll have full access to everything,\" he said, but declined to give a timeline.\nTopics raised during the press conference ranged from questions over gun control to whether the US would keep its commitment to withdrawing troops from Afghanistan by a 1 May deadline agreed to by the previous administration.\nMr Biden admitted that it would be difficult to meet that timeline, and punted on answering questions over what he could accomplish on what he called \"long-term\" problems such as gun legislation.\nHe also made news by saying he planned to run for re-election in 2024 - a question that had been a source of speculation until today.\nMr Biden opened the event with an update on the US Covid-19 response, saying that he would aim to deliver 200m jabs in his first 100 days - a plan he said was \"ambitious\" but possible.\n\"No other country in the world has even come close, not even close, to what we are doing,\" he claimed.\nThe US has so far delivered over 130 million doses of the vaccine - but it still lags behind other countries in terms of the number of shots administered relative to the size of the population.\nAccording to US health experts, approximately 2.5m doses are now being distributed per day.\nThe US Customs and Border Protection agency releases monthly figures of the number of \"encounters\" at the southwest land border.\nIn January and February 2021, 78,442 and 100,441 people were apprehended, respectively. This is a significant increase from previous years.\nStill, the highest number in the last few years was in May 2019 during Mr Trump's presidency - when over 140,000 people were apprehended by the authorities.\nThere are several factors driving the surge at the southern US border. They include: "

      "text": "Germany could see 100,000 infections a day if the third wave of coronavirus spreads unchecked, the head of the RKI public health institute has warned.\nFears that the third Covid wave could be the worst so far have prompted a clampdown on borders.\nNegative tests will be required for airport arrivals from Tuesday and all of France has been declared high-risk.\nFrom Sunday anyone travelling from France will have to submit a negative test and go into 10 days' quarantine.\nRandom German checks and compulsory tests will be enforced on the French border, says France's foreign minister. \"The pandemic in Germany is exploding faster than they thought,\" said Jean-Yves Le Drian.\nWith infections running at more than 20,000 a day, German Health Minister Jens Spahn warned: \"If this continues unchecked we run the risk of our health system hitting breaking point in April.\"\nGermany is among a number of European countries where Covid infections have been rising fast this week. Cases are also up in Poland by 35%, and health officials in both countries say the spread of the UK (Kent) variant is behind the surge.\nSlovakia and the Czech Republic are also now seen as high-risk, but they have been downgraded from the highest alert level of \"virus mutation area\", aimed at stopping almost all travel. Czech infection levels have begun to fall, down a quarter on last week.\nAustria's Tyrol was also classed as a \"virus mutation area\" but from Sunday is being downgraded even further.\nFrance has seen a big increase in cases in recent weeks.\nNineteen areas have been placed under lockdown and more than 4,700 people are now being treated in intensive care. The greater Paris region is one of the worst affected areas with almost 600 cases per 100,000 people. The average French incidence rate in the past week is above 200 cases, while in Germany it is 119 per 100,000 people.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron said late on Thursday there would be \"no taboo\" as far as further measures were concerned. On Friday, the government spoke of a \"race against time\" as it beefed up checks at stations, airports and road tolls in the 19 affected areas.\nAlthough schools are still open in these areas, which now include the Rh\u00f4ne region around Lyon, most businesses are shut and travel in or out is barred without a compelling reason.\nEurope's Covid vaccine drive started slowly, partly because of delivery delays. But France has stepped up vaccinations, announcing almost 400,000 on Friday alone. A drive to start vaccinating people aged 70-75 will begin on Saturday.\nIn Germany about 10% of adults have now had a first dose of vaccine (with 14 doses per 100 people), well below UK levels. The German health minister said his country was in the final stages of a \"pandemic marathon\" but it would take some time before the goal could be reached. He appealed to Germans not to travel over Easter and minimise their contacts with other people."

      "tags": "Egypt,Global trade,Suez canal",
      "text": "The blockage of Egypt's Suez canal by a giant container ship is causing a \"traffic jam\" in the Red Sea, according to a merchant seaman on a nearby ship.\nJoe Reynolds, chief engineer of the Maersk Ohio, told the BBC the number of vessels waiting at the canal's southern entrance was \"growing exponentially\".\n\"It's going to affect shipping schedules around the world,\" he warned.\nTugboats and dredgers are trying to dislodge the Ever Given, which is wedged diagonally across the waterway. \nThe 400m-long (1,300ft), 200,000-tonne vessel ran aground on Tuesday morning amid high winds and a sandstorm that affected visibility.\nSpecialist salvage companies have been brought in to help refloat the ship, and an adviser to Egypt's president has said he hopes the situation will be resolved within two to three days. But experts have said it could take weeks if the vessel's containers need to be removed.\nAbout 12% of global trade passes through the 193km (120-mile) canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe.\nAn alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, can take two weeks longer.\nMr Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Maersk Ohio, a US-flagged container ship that is 292m long and weighs 50,000 tonnes, was \"stacked up\" alongside dozens of other vessels near Port Suez.\n\"I think you can imagine there was a queue of ships waiting to go through to begin with, and now that queue has just grown exponentially,\" he said. \"Standing outside, as you look, everywhere around you is ships.\"\nHe said there was still a lot of work to be done on board his ship, and that he and his fellow crewmembers had not yet had a chance to communicate with the other vessels.\n\"It's just a long waiting game. There's not a lot to see... We are ships sitting at anchor, just waiting as if you were in a traffic jam on the M5,\" he added, referring to a British motorway.\nDespite the delay, Mr Reynolds expressed sympathy for the Ever Given's 25 Indian crew members.\n\"As sailors, we complain a lot about things. But we also understand when other sailors are in a fix or other seamen are working really hard day and night to try to correct a situation. We've all been there,\" he said.\nAbout 10 tugboats and two dredger vessels are working to refloat the Ever Given. Diggers and other machinery operating on the banks are also assisting.\nThe Ever Given's technical mangers, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said another attempt to refloat the vessel on Friday had failed, and that the salvage operation was now focused on removing sand and mud from around the port (left) side of the vessel's bow.\nA specialised suction dredger, which can shift 2,000 cubic metres (70,000 cubic feet) of material every hour, arrived on site on Thursday, it added. \nArrangements are also being made for high-capacity pumps to reduce the water levels in the vessel's forward void space and the bow thruster room.\nAnother two tugs will arrive by Sunday, when a higher tide is expected.\nJohn Denholm, president of the UK Chamber of Shipping, told the BBC that if the diggers and tugs were not successful, salvage teams would have to start the slow process of \"lightering\" the ship - transferring its cargo to another vessel or the canal bank. \nThat would involve bringing in specialist equipment, including a crane that would need to stretch more than 60m (200ft) high, he said.\n\"If we go through the lightering process, I suspect we're talking weeks.\"\nMr Reynolds said the Maersk Ohio, which started its voyage in the Gulf and was headed to northern Europe via the Mediterranean, still had a \"little wriggle-room\" in its schedule.\n\"If it goes more than five days, then we start to see our schedule back up. I'm sure other ships are on a much tighter schedule than we were... It's going to affect shipping schedules all around the world.\"\nService provider Leth Agencies said a total of 237 vessels were waiting in the area on Friday - 107 at Port Suez in the Red Sea, 41 at the canal's midway point in the Great Bitter Lake, and 89 at Port Said in the Mediterranean. \nThe blockage is holding up an estimated $9.6bn (\u00a37bn) of goods each day - or $400m an hour - according to data from Lloyd's List.\nThe shipping journal said two major companies, Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, were looking into whether to re-route their vessels.\nThe first container ship to opt for the longer journey around the Cape of Good Hope was the Ever Given's sister ship, the Ever Greet, both of which are operated by the Taiwanese firm Evergreen Marine, it added.\nRichard Meade, the editor of Lloyd's List, told the BBC that the risk of piracy to vessels off the coast of Africa had been overblown to some extent. \n\"Obviously, we did see a major piracy surge a few years ago off the Somali coast. That has largely been brought under control,\" he told the BBC. \"The Gulf of Guinea is the hotspot. But I think realistically you would see ships move well outside the Gulf of Guinea as the route.\"\nDid you witness the incident? Are you on board another vessel on the Suez Canal?

      "tags": "Xinjiang,Boris Johnson,China,Uighurs",
      "text": "Five UK parliamentarians sanctioned by China have released a joint statement vowing to \"redouble\" their efforts to campaign against human rights abuses. \nThree MPs, including ex-Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, and two peers said the action by China was an attempt to stifle \"free and open debate\".\nThe PM said he \"stands firmly\" with those targeted by China for criticising its treatment of the Uighur people.\nThe sanctions follow similar moves by the UK, US, Canada and the EU on China.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson and US president Joe Biden \"expressed their concern about retaliatory action taken by China,\" during a phone call on Friday, Downing Street said.\nChina has imposed sanctions on nine UK citizens in total - including the five parliamentarians - who are among its most vocal critics in the UK.  \nIt said it was sanctioning the group for spreading what it called \"lies and disinformation\" about China. \nIn response, Sir Iain, along with MPs Nusrat Ghani and Tim Loughton, and the peers Lord Alton and Baroness Kennedy, said: \"Today's sanctions have unmasked the Chinese Communist Party.\n\"These actions are not only an attack on us as individuals but an attempt to stifle the free and open debate that is at the heart of our parliamentary democracy.\"\nThe group added that \"intimidation\" would only encourage them to \"redouble\" their efforts, as they pledged to continue advocating on behalf of \"the Uighurs, Tibetans, Hong Kongers and all other persecuted groups in China\".\n\"These are the true victims of the Chinese government's authoritarian rule, not us,\" they added.\nIn common with the government, the group also called for \"international investigations into the alleged abuses\" in Xingjian against the Uighur people.\nBritain's relations with China are going from bad to worse.\nOn Monday, the UK imposed its first ever sanctions on Chinese officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang.\nNow Beijing has retaliated, announcing sanctions on some of its most vocal critics in Britain.\nIt matters because the government is trying to strike a balance in its relations with Beijing.\nIn its recent foreign policy review, the UK described China as a \"systemic competitor\" and \"the biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security\".\nBut it also spoke of pursuing \"a positive trade and investment relationship\" and co-operating with China on climate change and biodiversity. All that just became a little harder still.\nOn Friday afternoon, the Foreign Office (FCDO) said the minister for Asia, Nigel Adams, had summoned Yang Xiaoguang, the Chinese embassy in London's charg\u00e9 d'affaires, over Beijing's actions.\nAn FCDO spokesperson said Mr Adams had made it clear that China's decision to impose sanctions on Britons and UK entities was \"unwarranted and unacceptable\".\nMr Adams also noted that China's decision to target those \"seeking to shine a light on human rights violations\" would \"not distract attention away from those very violations taking place in Xinjiang\".\nEarlier Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that the British citizens facing sanctions were \"performing a vital role\" in highlighting the treatment of Uighur Muslims, adding: \"Freedom to speak out in opposition to abuse is fundamental and I stand firmly with them.\"\nMore than a million Uighurs and other minorities are estimated to have been detained at camps in the north-west region of Xinjiang, where allegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged. \nUighurs living in the region speak their own language, similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations.\nThe Chinese government has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on Uighur women and separating children from their families.\nIt has denied the allegations of abuse and claimed the camps are \"re-education\" facilities used to combat terrorism.\nSanctions were imposed on Chinese officials on Monday, as part of a co-ordinated action by the European Union and the UK, the US and Canada.\nAfter UK sanctions were announced on Monday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the abuse of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang \"one of the worst human rights crises of our time\".\nMr Raab also said that if Beijing wanted to \"credibly rebut\" the claims, it should allow the United Nation's commissioner for human rights to access Xinjiang.\nThe nine Britons now facing sanctions from China are:\nThey will all be banned from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau, their property in China will be frozen and Chinese citizens and institutions will be prohibited from doing business with them.\nMs Ghani said the move had made her \"even even more determined\" to speak out about the Uighurs, while Sir Iain argued that those who lived free lives \"must speak for those who have no voice\".\nMr Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, told the BBC: \"I view this as a direct assault on British democracy and an attempt to silence the British people who have chosen me to speak for them.\"\nHe added that the government had been too soft on China, which he said had been \"constantly and continuously seeking to intervene\" in the internal matters of the UK.\nAcademic Dr Smith Finley tweeted: \"I have no regrets for speaking out, and I will not be silenced.\"\nFour groups have also been sanctioned - the China Research Group, the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, the Uighur Tribunal, and Essex Court Chambers.\nA legal opinion by senior barristers at Essex Court Chambers had concluded there was a \"very credible case\" that the Chinese government was committing genocide against the Uighurs. \nLabour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the sanctions were a \"direct attempt to silence those who criticise the actions of the Chinese government\". \nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the UK's decision to impose sanctions \"flagrantly breaches international law and basic norms governing international relations, grossly interferes in China's internal affairs, and severely undermines China-UK relations\".\nHe added that the Chinese foreign ministry had summoned the British Ambassador to China to \"lodge solemn representations, expressing firm opposition and strong condemnation\". \nHua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, later told a press briefing China was forced to act \"in self-defence\" in response to UK sanctions \"based on lies\"."

      "text": "New parents will have more co-ordinated access to help and services under plans to improve children's health in England, the government says.\nA \"family hub\" network will be set up and the \"red books\" used to log babies' health information will be digitised.\nAndrea Leadsom, who chaired the government review on early years health, said the plans would identify those families most in need of support.\nLabour called them \"a smokescreen for a decade of failure on early years\".\n\"Red books\" - or personal child health records - are given to parents around the time that their baby is born, and are used to record details like weight, height and vaccinations. \nThe government said it will bring forward plans to digitise them, meaning they will go online by April 2023.\nLocal authorities will be asked to produce a single \"Start for Life\" document for parents with information about support services in their area - from health visits to help quitting smoking. \nUnder the plans, published as part of a review on Thursday, there will also be \"family hubs\" - centres where parents could access a range of services.\nThe government says these services could include birth registration, midwifery, health visiting, mental health support and feeding advice.\nDeborah Gibb, a 32-year-old teacher from Bradford, is trying to calm her four-month-old, Freyja, when she picks up the phone. \"I think she's started to teethe, which is ridiculously young,\" she laughs.\nShe seems to breathe a sigh of relief when I tell her that the red book will be moving online (although that might just be because Freyja has settled down).\n\"As a mother, going out of the house you pack your entire life with you. But remembering that red book that's in the back of the cupboard?\" she says. \"It seems ridiculous.\"\nShe thinks having a single publication that lists local services would be useful, so long as it's digitised. She was given leaflets \"left, right and centre\" when she left hospital after giving birth to her older daughter, Eilidh, now three.\n\"They just go in a pile and you don't get time to read them. What you do spend hours doing is using your phone looking for information in the middle of the night.\"\nShe says her job meant she felt reasonably clued up about what support services were available in her area - but many new parents don't.\n\"I was having a conversation the other day about how I've signed Freyja up for nursery for when I return to work in September. They were like, 'you've already put her name down?'\"\nShe says it is important for first-time parents to have \"somewhere to go centrally to get all the information that isn't an intimidating place\".\nMs Leadsom, a former cabinet minister, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the plans would also help identify families who \"would go on to have real difficulties\" without support.\n\"What families will see differently is they will receive a joined-up Start for Life offer, which will show them explicitly what services they can get to support them in the period from conception to the age of two,\" she said.\nShe said the digitisation of the red books would \"make a huge difference\".\n\"For families, they won't have to keep telling their story again and again. For professionals, they will be able to see what's happened to that family to provide them with the support that they need,\" she added.\nTulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years, called the plans \"a smokescreen for a decade of failure on early years\".\nShe said ministers had spent years \"dismantling\" Sure Start, an early intervention policy launched by Labour under Tony Blair to support the wellbeing of children before they started school.\nA report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in 2019 found the Sure Start scheme had a positive impact, but that funding had been cut and 500 sites had closed.\nSir Peter Lampl, head of the Sutton Trust, said there was a \"postcode lottery of provision\" at present and the pandemic has \"highlighted pre-existing inequalities\".\n\"We welcome the renewed focus on this crucial stage in life and the development of the Family Hub initiative as a universal service which will also identify the most vulnerable families,\" he said.\nAngela McConville, chief executive of parents' charity the NCT, welcomed the \"commitment to strong, coherent services\" to tackle \"health and wellbeing inequalities that... have been further exacerbated by the pandemic\".\n\"This focus has been strikingly absent from previous policy and investment, with sometimes disastrous consequences for parents and babies,\" she said.\nImran Hussain of charity Action for Children also welcomed the plan.\nHe said children's centres and family hubs \"will be more important than ever\" following the Covid-19 pandemic, helping to tackle \"the growing educational attainment gap\" between children from higher and lower socio-economic backgrounds. \nJudith Blake, chairwoman of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said the report \"rightly recognises the crucial support provided by councils\".\nShe said the LGA was \"keen\" to work with Ms Leadsom on the next phase of the review, but stressed that \"it will need to be properly resourced\"."

A school in Portland is also named after Cleary.\nShe also went on to inspire generations of children's authors, including the best-selling writer Judy Blume.\n\"Beverly just beautifully captures the essence of childhood,\" Blume told the New York Times. \n\"We might not all have childhoods like that, but there's still something so universal about it.

      "title": "Covid: Infections level off and Jackie Weaver wades in",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThe number of people testing positive for coronavirus is levelling off in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - but has risen in Scotland, official figures suggest. Infections remain at a low level after falling steeply since January, according to the ONS analysis. It estimates that in the week up to 20 March, 1 in 340 people in England had coronavirus, or 0.3%. It's the same figure in Northern Ireland and 0.2% in Wales. In Scotland, 1 in 240, or 0.4% tested positive. To put it into context - at the height of the winter peak, the percentage of people testing positive was around 2% in most of the UK. The same set of figures show that infection levels in 11 to 16-year-olds have risen slightly in England.\nGermany is tightening its borders amid fears that a third wave of coronavirus could be harder to curb than the first two. Infections are running at more than 20,000 a day and that could rise to 100,000 a day if the spread is left unchecked, the head of the RKI public health institute has warned. Germany's public health agency has officially listed France as a high-risk Covid area. Random checks and compulsory tests will be enforced on the French border. France's foreign minister says the pandemic in Germany \"is exploding faster than they thought\".\nFrance has accused the UK of \"blackmail\" over its handling of coronavirus vaccine exports. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian had been asked how he felt about the EU sending millions of doses to the UK while its own rollout lagged behind. He said the EU \"shouldn't be paying the price\" for the UK's vaccination policy. \"One can't play with blackmail,\" he added. He did not specify what he meant by blackmail but earlier this week, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a \"gentle point\" to \"anybody considering a blockade\" of vaccine exports. He said: \"Companies may look at such actions and draw conclusions about whether or not it is sensible to make future investments.\"\nAn 11-year-old boy who has been sleeping in a tent since the first coronavirus lockdown will have his final night outside this weekend. Max Woosey, from Braunton, Devon, will reach one year of sleeping in his garden on Monday. He has raised more than \u00a3270,000 in memory of two family friends. He's encouraging children around the world to take part in a \"big camp-out\" on Saturday night. \nFinally, she may have \"no authority here\" but Jackie Weaver has spoken out against a plan to end virtual council meetings in England from May. The government has told local authorities it is under too much pressure to fit in legislation to allow them to continue. Ms Weaver, who rose to fame after a chaotic meeting of Handforth Parish Council went viral, called the move \"dreadful\". And the Local Government Association is with her. Chairman, councillor James Jamieson, said reintroducing face-to-face meetings \"could easily\" involve up to 200 people in one room so their return would pose a \"significant challenge\" to councils to make them Covid-secure.

However, a bar on non-essential travel to and from other UK nations will continue for at least another fortnight. The Welsh government is also relaxing rules on meeting outdoors and in gardens, allowing for six people from two households.\nA haulage industry source says the government has warned them to expect drivers to have to take a Covid test on arrival into the UK from mainland Europe. Truckers had previously been exempt from testing coming into the UK. The Department for Transport says it's \"carefully monitoring\" an increase in cases in Europe and keeping all measures under review.\nLockdown is, step-by-step, beginning to ease across the UK. But with infection rates rising in Europe, the British public is also being warned of the risk of a third wave.

      "title": "Uighurs: China bans UK MPs after abuse sanctions",
      "tags": "Xinjiang,Uighurs",
      "text": "China has imposed sanctions on nine UK citizens - including five MPs - for spreading what it called \"lies and disinformation\" about the country. \nThe group are among the most vocal critics of China in the UK. \nIt comes in retaliation for measures taken by the UK government on Monday over human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslim minority group. \nBoris Johnson said those sanctioned were \"shining a light\" on \"gross human rights violations\". \n\"Freedom to speak out in opposition to abuse is fundamental and I stand firmly with them,\" the prime minister said in a tweet. \nThe foreign secretary said if Beijing wanted to \"credibly rebut\" the claims it should allow UN access to Xinjiang.\nThose targeted by China include former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, two peers, a lawyer and an academic. \nSir Iain said he would wear the sanctions \"as a badge of honour\".\nThe response by China follows similar sanctions imposed on the European Union, which was part of the co-ordinated action on Monday, along with the UK, the US and Canada.\nChina has detained Uighurs at camps in the north-west region of Xinjiang, where allegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged.\nIt has denied the allegations of abuse, claiming the camps are \"re-education\" facilities used to combat terrorism.\nThe nine people facing sanctions are: \nThey will all be banned from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau, their property in China will be frozen and Chinese citizens and institutions will be prohibited from doing business with them.\nSir Iain said: \"Those of us who live free lives under the rule of law must speak for those who have no voice. If that brings the anger of China down upon me then I shall wear that as a badge of honour.\"\nMr Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, told the BBC: \"I view this as a direct assault on British democracy and an attempt to silence the British people who have chosen me to speak for them.\"\nHe added that the government had been too soft on China, which he said had been \"constantly and continuously seeking to intervene\" in the internal matters of the UK. \nMs Ghani told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the move was a \"wake-up call\" for democratic countries, that China would sanction law-makers who were just doing their job. \nShe added: \"I won't be intimidated. This has now made me even more determined to speak out about the Uighurs.\"\nAcademic Dr Smith Finley tweeted: \"I have no regrets for speaking out, and I will not be silenced.\"\nLord Alton said: \"The imposition of tit-for-tat sanctions is a crude attempt to silence criticism,\" adding that the \"first duty of a parliamentarian is to use their voice on behalf of those whose voices have been silenced\". \nThis retaliation by the Chinese government was not unexpected. \nFrom the moment the UK imposed its first ever sanctions on Chinese officials earlier in the week, a response from Beijing was inevitable. \nBut that does not mean the tit-for-tat exchange of sanctions is unimportant. It will ensure that the UK's already poor relationship with China will deteriorate further. \nAnd that matters because the government is trying to strike a balance in its relations with Beijing. \nIn its recent foreign policy review, the UK described China as a \"systemic competitor\" and \"the biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security\". \nBut it also spoke of pursuing \"a positive trade and investment relationship\" and co-operating with China on climate change and biodiversity. All that just became a little harder still.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government \"stands in total solidarity\" with those sanctioned by China. \n\"It's not going to stop them, it's not going to stop the British government speaking up about the industrial scale human rights abuses taking place in Xinjiang,\" he told the BBC. \nHe added that China should allow access to Xinjiang for the United Nation's commissioner for human rights if it wanted to continue with \"blanket denials\". \nLabour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the sanctions were a \"direct attempt to silence those who criticise the actions of the Chinese government\". \nShe welcomed Mr Raab's condemnation of the sanctions but criticised the government's \"mixed messages\" on trade deals with China. \nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the UK's decision to impose sanctions \"flagrantly breaches international law and basic norms governing international relations, grossly interferes in China's internal affairs, and severely undermines China-UK relations\".\nHe added that the Chinese foreign ministry had summoned the British Ambassador to China to \"lodge solemn representations, expressing firm opposition and strong condemnation\". \nA Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, later told a press briefing China was forced to act \"in self-defence\" in response to UK sanctions \"based on lies\".\nA spokesman from the Chinese embassy in London criticised the UK's use of sanctions adding that China \"never provokes confrontation\" but if others do \"we are ready to keep them company\". \nChina has gone for the people exerting the most pressure on Boris Johnson to be tough on China. \nIt's gone for the people who say \"genocide\" has happened in Xinjiang. \nThe measures are essentially tokenistic - it's unlikely these people or entities did any business with Chinese firms or people anyway. \nTargeting Neil O'Brien is personal for the UK prime minister. The MP is in charge of leading policy in Downing Street. \nGoing after Essex Court Chambers - a group of self-employed barristers - for a legal opinion it reached also shows you how China views an independent judicial system. It doesn't believe in them.\nFour groups have also been sanctioned - the China Research Group, the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, the Uighur Tribunal, and Essex Court Chambers.\nA legal opinion by senior barristers at Essex Court Chambers had concluded there was a \"very credible case\" that the Chinese government was committing genocide against the Uighurs. \nAn Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China spokesman said: \"The decision to sanction five of our British members is a flagrant assault on those parliamentarians' rights to conduct their duties. \n\"We will be making urgent representations to ministers and the House authorities to see that they're protected from danger or harm as a result of the communist party's bullying.\"\nAfter UK sanctions were announced on Monday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the abuse of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang \"one of the worst human rights crises of our time\".\nMore than a million Uighurs and other minorities are estimated to have been detained in camps in Xinjiang.\nXinjiang lies in the north-west of China and is the country's biggest region. Like Tibet, it is autonomous, meaning - in theory - it has some powers of self-governance. But in practice, both face major restrictions by the central government.\nUighurs living in the region speak their own language, similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations.\nThe Chinese government has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on Uighur women and separating children from their families.\nThe country initially denied the existence of the camps, before defending them as a necessary measure against terrorism. It has denied allegations of human rights abuses.\nChina is forcing hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other minorities into hard, manual labour in the vast cotton fields of Xinjiang, according to research seen by the BBC. It's the first clear picture of the potential scale of forced labour in the picking of a crop that accounts for a fifth of the world's cotton supply and is used widely throughout the global fashion industry.\nChina's 'tainted' cotton"

      "title": "'Their goal is to destroy everyone': Uighur camp detainees allege systematic rape",
      "tags": "Sexual violence,Xi Jinping,Xinjiang,Human rights,China,Uighurs",
      "text": "Women in China's \"re-education\" camps for Uighurs have been systematically raped, sexually abused, and tortured, according to detailed new accounts obtained by the BBC. \nYou may find some of the details in this story distressing.\nThe men always wore masks, Tursunay Ziawudun said, even though there was no pandemic then. \nThey wore suits, she said, not police uniforms.\nSometime after midnight, they came to the cells to select the women they wanted and took them down the corridor to a \"black room\", where there were no surveillance cameras.\nSeveral nights, Ziawudun said, they took her.\n\"Perhaps this is the most unforgettable scar on me forever,\" she said. \n\"I don't even want these words to spill from my mouth.\"\nTursunay Ziawudun spent nine months inside China's vast and secretive system of internment camps in the Xinjiang region. According to independent estimates, more than a million men and women have been detained in the sprawling network of camps, which China says exist for the \"re-education\" of the Uighurs and other minorities.\nHuman rights groups say the Chinese government has gradually stripped away the religious and other freedoms of the Uighurs, culminating in an oppressive system of mass surveillance, detention, indoctrination, and even forced sterilisation.\nThe policy flows from China's President, Xi Jinping, who visited Xinjiang in 2014 in the wake of a terror attack by Uighur separatists. Shortly after, according to documents leaked to the New York Times, he directed local officials to respond with \"absolutely no mercy\". The US government said last month that China's actions since amounted to a genocide. China says reports of mass detention and forced sterilisation are \"lies and absurd allegations\".\nFirst-hand accounts from inside the internment camps are rare, but several former detainees and a guard have told the BBC they experienced or saw evidence of an organised system of mass rape, sexual abuse and torture.\nTursunay Ziawudun, who fled Xinjiang after her release and is now in the US, said women were removed from the cells \"every night\" and raped by one or more masked Chinese men. She said she was tortured and later gang-raped on three occasions, each time by two or three men.\nZiawudun has spoken to the media before, but only from Kazakhstan, where she \"lived in constant fear of being sent back to China\", she said. She said she believed that if she revealed the extent of the sexual abuse she had experienced and seen, and was returned to Xinjiang, she would be punished more harshly than before. And she was ashamed, she said.\nIt is impossible to verify Ziawudun's account completely because of the severe restrictions China places on reporters in the country, but travel documents and immigration records she provided to the BBC corroborate the timeline of her story. Her descriptions of the camp in Xinyuan county - known in Uighur as Kunes county - match satellite imagery analysed by the BBC, and her descriptions of daily life inside the camp, as well as the nature and methods of the abuse, correspond with other accounts from former detainees.\nInternal documents from the Kunes county justice system from 2017 and 2018, provided to the BBC by Adrian Zenz, a leading expert on China's policies in Xinjiang, detail planning and spending for \"transformation through education\" of \"key groups\" - a common euphemism in China for the indoctrination of the Uighurs. In one Kunes document, the \"education\" process is described as \"washing brains, cleansing hearts, strengthening righteousness and eliminating evil\". \nThe BBC also interviewed a Kazakh woman from Xinjiang who was detained for 18 months in the camp system, who said she was forced to strip Uighur women naked and handcuff them, before leaving them alone with Chinese men. Afterwards, she cleaned the rooms, she said.\n\"My job was to remove their clothes above the waist and handcuff them so they cannot move,\" said Gulzira Auelkhan, crossing her wrists behind her head to demonstrate. \"Then I would leave the women in the room and a man would enter - some Chinese man from outside or policeman. I sat silently next to the door, and when the man left the room I took the woman for a shower.\" \nThe Chinese men \"would pay money to have their pick of the prettiest young inmates\", she said.\nSome former detainees of the camps have described being forced to assist guards or face punishment. Auelkhan said she was powerless to resist or intervene.\nAsked if there was a system of organised rape, she said: \"Yes, rape.\"\n\"They forced me to go into that room,\" she said. \"They forced me to take off those women's clothes and to restrain their hands and leave the room.\"\nSome of the women who were taken away from the cells at night were never returned, Ziawudun said. Those who were brought back were threatened against telling others in the cell what had happened to them.\n\"You can't tell anyone what happened, you can only lie down quietly,\" she said. \"It is designed to destroy everyone's spirit.\"\nMr Zenz told the BBC that the testimony gathered for this story was \"some of the most horrendous evidence I have seen since the atrocity began\".\n\"This confirms the very worst of what we have heard before,\" he said. \"It provides authoritative and detailed evidence of sexual abuse and torture at a level clearly greater than what we had assumed.\" \nThe Uighurs are a mostly Muslim Turkic minority group that number about 11 million in Xinjiang in north-western China. The region borders Kazakhstan and is also home to ethnic Kazakhs. Ziawudun, who is 42, is Uighur. Her husband is a Kazakh.\nThe couple returned to Xinjiang in late 2016 after a five-year stay in Kazakhstan, and were interrogated on arrival and had their passports confiscated, Ziawudun said. A few months later, she was told by police to attend a meeting alongside other Uighurs and Kazakhs and the group was rounded up and detained. \nHer first stint in detention was comparatively easy, she said, with decent food and access to her phone. After a month she developed stomach ulcers and was released. Her husband's passport was returned and he went back to Kazakhstan to work, but authorities kept Ziawudun's, trapping her in Xinjiang. Reports suggest China has purposefully kept behind and interned relatives to discourage those who leave from speaking out. On 9 March 2018, with her husband still in Kazakhstan, Ziawudun was instructed to report to a local police station, she said. She was told she needed \"more education\".\nAccording to her account, Ziawudun was transported back to the same facility as her previous detention, in Kunes county, but the site had been significantly developed, she said. Buses were lined up outside offloading new detainees \"non-stop\".\nThe women had their jewellery confiscated. Ziawudun's earrings were yanked out, she said, causing her ears to bleed, and she was herded into a room with a group of women. Among them was an elderly woman who Ziawudun would later befriend.\nThe camp guards pulled off the woman's headscarf, Ziawudun said, and shouted at her for wearing a long dress - one of a list of religious expressions that became arrestable offences for Uighurs that year.\n\"They stripped everything off the elderly lady, leaving her with just her underwear. She was so embarrassed that she tried to cover herself with her arms,\" Ziawudun said.\n\"I cried so much watching the way they treated her. Her tears fell like rain.\"\nThe women were told to hand over their shoes and any clothes with elastic or buttons, Ziawudun said, then taken to cellblocks - \"similar to a small Chinese neighbourhood where there are rows of buildings\".\nNothing much happened for the first month or two. They were forced to watch propaganda programmes in their cells and had their hair forcibly cut short.\nThen police began interrogating Ziawudun about her absent husband, she said, knocking her on the floor when she resisted and kicking her in the abdomen.\n\"Police boots are very hard and heavy, so at first I thought he was beating me with something,\" she said. \"Then I realised that he was trampling on my belly. I almost passed out - I felt a hot flush go through me.\"\nA camp doctor told her she might have a blood clot. When her cellmates drew attention to the fact that she was bleeding, the guards \"replied saying it is normal for women to bleed\", she said.\nAccording to Ziawudun, each cell was home to 14 women, with bunk beds, bars on the windows, a basin and a hole-in-the-floor-style toilet. When she first saw women being taken out of the cell at night, she didn't understand why, she said. She thought they were being moved elsewhere.\nThen sometime in May 2018 - \"I don't remember the exact date, because you don't remember the dates inside there\" - Ziawudun and a cellmate, a woman in her twenties, were taken out at night and presented to a Chinese man in a mask, she said. Her cellmate was taken into a separate room.\n\"As soon as she went inside she started screaming,\" Ziawudun said. \"I don't know how to explain to you, I thought they were torturing her. I never thought about them raping.\"\nThe woman who had brought them from the cells told the men about Ziawudun's recent bleeding.\n\"After the woman spoke about my condition, the Chinese man swore at her. The man with the mask said 'Take her to the dark room'.\n\"The woman took me to the room next to where the other girl had been taken in. They had an electric stick, I didn't know what it was, and it was pushed inside my genital tract, torturing me with an electric shock.\"\nZiawudun's torture that first night in the dark room eventually came to an end, she said, when the woman intervened again citing her medical condition, and she was returned to the cell.\nAbout an hour later, her cellmate was brought back.\n\"The girl became completely different after that, she wouldn't speak to anyone, she sat quietly staring as if in a trance,\" Ziawudun said. \"There were many people in those cells who lost their minds.\"\nAlongside cells, another central feature of the camps is classrooms. Teachers have been drafted in to \"re-educate\" the detainees - a process activists say is designed to strip the Uighurs and other minorities of their culture, language and religion, and indoctrinate them into mainstream Chinese culture.\nQelbinur Sedik, an Uzbek woman from Xinjiang, was among the Chinese language teachers brought into the camps and coerced into giving lessons to the detainees. Sedik has since fled China and spoken publicly about her experience.  \nThe women's camp was \"tightly controlled\", Sedik told the BBC. But she heard stories, she said - signs and rumours of rape. One day, Sedik cautiously approached a Chinese camp policewoman she knew.\n\"I asked her, 'I have been hearing some terrible stories about rape, do you know about it?' She said we should talk in the courtyard during lunch.\n\"So I went to the courtyard, where there were not many cameras. She said, 'Yes, the rape has become a culture. It is gang rape and the Chinese police not only rape them but also electrocute them. They are subject to horrific torture.'\"\nThat night Sedik didn't sleep at all, she said. \"I was thinking about my daughter who was studying abroad and I cried all night.\"\nIn separate testimony to the Uyghur Human Rights Project, Sedik said she heard about an electrified stick being inserted into women to torture them - echoing the experience Ziawudun described. \nThere were \"four kinds of electric shock\", Sedik said - \"the chair, the glove, the helmet, and anal rape with a stick\".\n\"The screams echoed throughout the building,\" she said. \"I could hear them during lunch and sometimes when I was in class.\"\nAnother teacher forced to work in the camps, Sayragul Sauytbay, told the BBC that \"rape was common\" and the guards \"picked the girls and young women they wanted and took them away\".\nShe described witnessing a harrowing public gang rape of a woman of just 20 or 21, who was brought before about 100 other detainees to make a forced confession.\n\"After that, in front of everyone, the police took turns to rape her,\" Sauytbay said.\n\"While carrying out this test, they watched people closely and picked out anyone who resisted, clenched their fists, closed their eyes, or looked away, and took them for punishment.\"\nThe young woman cried out for help, Sauytbay said. \n\"It was absolutely horrendous,\" she said. \"I felt I had died. I was dead.\"\nIn the camp in Kunes, Ziawudun's days drifted into weeks and then months. The detainees' hair was cut, they went to class, they underwent unexplained medical tests, took pills, and were forcibly injected every 15 days with a \"vaccine\" that brought on nausea and numbness.\nWomen were forcibly fitted with IUDs or sterilised, Ziawudun said, including a woman who was just about 20 years old. (\"We begged them on her behalf,\" she said.) Forced sterilisation of Uighurs has been widespread in Xinjiang, according to a recent investigation by the Associated Press. The Chinese government told the BBC the allegations were \"completely unfounded\".\nAs well as the medical interventions, detainees in Ziawudun's camp spent hours singing patriotic Chinese songs and watching patriotic TV programmes about Chinese President Xi Jinping, she said.\n\"You forget to think about life outside the camp. I don't know if they brainwashed us or if it was the side effect of the injections and pills, but you can't think of anything beyond wishing you had a full stomach. The food deprivation is so severe.\"\nDetainees had food withheld for infractions such as failing to accurately memorise passages from books about Xi Jinping, according to a former camp guard who spoke to the BBC via video link from a country outside China.\n\"Once we were taking the people arrested into the concentration camp, and I saw everyone being forced to memorise those books. They sit for hours trying to memorise the text, everyone had a book in their hands,\" he said.\nThose who failed tests were forced to wear three different colours of clothing based on whether they had failed one, two, or three times, he said, and subjected to different levels of punishment accordingly, including food deprivation and beatings.\n\"I entered those camps. I took detainees into those camps,\" he said. \"I saw those sick, miserable people. They definitely experienced various types of torture. I am sure about that.\"\nIt was not possible to independently verify the guard's testimony but he provided documents that appeared to corroborate a period of employment at a known camp. He agreed to speak on condition of anonymity.\nThe guard said he did not know anything about rape in the cell areas. Asked if the camp guards used electrocution, he said: \"Yes. They do. They use those electrocuting instruments.\" After being tortured, detainees were forced to make confessions to a variety of perceived offences, according to the guard. \"I have those confessions in my heart,\" he said.\nPresident Xi looms large over the camps. His image and slogans adorn the walls; he is a focus of the programme of \"re-education\". Xi is the overall architect of the policy against the Uighurs, said Charles Parton, a former British diplomat in China and now senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. \n\"It is very centralised and it goes to the very top,\" Parton said. \"There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that this is Xi Jinping's policy.\"\nIt was unlikely that Xi or other top party officials would have directed or authorised rape or torture, Parton said, but they would \"certainly be aware of it\".\n\"I think they prefer at the top just to turn a blind eye. The line has gone out to implement this policy with great sternness, and that is what is happening.\" That left \"no real constraints\", he said. \"I just don't see what the perpetrators of these acts would have to hold them back.\"\nAccording to Ziawudun's account, the perpetrators did not hold back.\n\"They don't only rape but also bite all over your body, you don't know if they are human or animal,\" she said, pressing a tissue to her eyes to stop her tears and pausing for a long time to collect herself.\n\"They didn't spare any part of the body, they bit everywhere leaving horrible marks. It was disgusting to look at.\n\"I've experienced that three times. And it is not just one person who torments you, not just one predator. Each time they were two or three men.\"\nLater, a woman who slept near Ziawudun in the cell, who said she was detained for giving birth to too many children, disappeared for three days and when she returned her body was covered with the same marks, Ziawudun said.\n\"She couldn't say it. She wrapped her arms around my neck and sobbed continuously, but she said nothing.\"\nThe Chinese government did not respond directly to questions from the BBC about allegations of rape and torture. In a statement, a spokeswoman said the camps in Xinjiang were not detention camps but \"vocational education and training centres\".\n\"The Chinese government protects the rights and interests of all ethnic minorities equally,\" the spokeswoman said, adding that the government \"attaches great importance to protecting women's rights\".\nZiawudun was released in December 2018 along with others who had spouses or relatives in Kazakhstan - an apparent policy shift she still doesn't fully understand. \nThe state returned her passport and she fled to Kazakhstan and then, with the support of the Uyghur Human Rights Project, to the US. She is applying to stay. She lives in a quiet suburb not far from Washington DC with a landlady from the local Uighur community. The two women cook together and take walks in the streets around the house. It's a slow, uneventful existence. Ziawudun keeps the lights low when she is in the house, because they shone brightly and constantly in the camp. A week after she arrived in the US, she had surgery to remove her womb - a consequence of being stamped on. \"I have lost the chance to become a mother,\" she said. She wants her husband to join her in the US. For now, he is in Kazakhstan.\nFor a while after her release, before she could flee, Ziawudun waited in Xinjiang. She saw others who had been churned through the system and released. She saw the effect the policy was having on her people. The birth rate in Xinjiang has plummeted in the past few years, according to independent research - an effect analysts have described as \"demographic genocide\".\nMany in the community had turned to alcohol, Ziawudun said. Several times, she saw her former cellmate collapsed on the street - the young woman who was removed from the cell with her that first night, who she heard screaming in an adjacent room. The woman had been consumed by addiction, Ziawudun said. She was \"like someone who simply existed, otherwise she was dead, completely finished by the rapes\".\n\"They say people are released, but in my opinion everyone who leaves the camps is finished.\"\nAnd that, she said, was the plan. The surveillance, the internment, the indoctrination, the dehumanisation, the sterilisation, the torture, the rape.\n\"Their goal is to destroy everyone,\" she said. \"And everybody knows it.\"\nPhotographs by Hannah Long-Higgins\nReaders in the UK affected by sexual abuse or violence can find support information via the BBC website here."

      "text": "More than 700,000 people in Northern Ireland have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. \nIt means that nearly half the adult population - 703,334 people - has received at least one jab.\nOfficial figures showed 104,907 people have now received a second dose. \nNo further coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, which means the total number of deaths remains at 2,107.\nThe executive has agreed to introduce \"managed isolation\" for those arriving into NI from certain countries once international flights resume.\nTravellers from so-called \"red list\" countries will have to quarantine in a pre-booked hotel for 10 days, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said.\nPassengers must also complete a pre-departure Covid test and undertake two tests after arrival. \nIt comes after the health minister said foreign travel in the summer should be ruled out.\nThe red list is part of travel regulations aimed at stopping Covid variants entering the UK. \nMs O'Neill and First Minister Arlene Foster were speaking at a joint press conference in Dungannon, County Tyrone, on Thursday.  \nThey revealed the 'R' number, which measures how fast the virus is spreading, is now estimated to be between 0.75 and 0.95. \nThere are currently no direct international flights arriving in Northern Ireland, but passengers can travel from abroad through Dublin and airports in the UK. \nFrom this week, anyone who travels into the Republic of Ireland from from a red list country must now complete a mandatory 14-day quarantine period in a hotel there.\nThe Irish Department of Health said people travelling the Republic of Ireland via Northern Ireland who have been in or through a red list country in the previous 14 days must make their own way to a pre-booked quarantine hotel within four hours.\nEarlier, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said there were ongoing discussions between the Stormont Executive office, and the governments in Dublin and London to ensure there was alignment in terms of travel arrangements for people flying into airports in the Republic of Ireland and the UK. \nDr McBride said co-operation on the issue was \"good\" and progress was being made. \nMs O'Neill said there were too many uncertainties to give assurances over travel. \n\"It's important that we work across these islands in relation to travel,\" Ms O'Neill said. \nMrs Foster said it was too soon to be able to say when people would be able to travel abroad, noting the government's global travel taskforce is not due to report until April.\nThe taskforce is considering a tiered or traffic light system for international travel.\n\"It's perhaps too soon to be booking your holidays, but it is also too soon to be ruling them out,\" Mrs Foster said. \nBrian Ambrose, chief executive of Belfast City Airport, said \"ministers and senior civil servants must carefully consider the severe economic consequences of their public comments\".\n\"As an airport we would never challenge decisions made by the health minister in relation to the running of the health service,\" he said. \u00a0\"However, we would expect decisions on international air travel to emanate from the NI Executive, rather than the health minister or an advisor.\"\nThe executive also agreed the limited reopening of Sure Start and Youth Services programmes. \nPayments will also be extended under two business support schemes - the Covid Restrictions Business Support Scheme (CRBSS), Part A and Part B, and the Large Hospitality and Tourism Business Support Scheme (LHTBSS) will continue beyond 31 March.\nA virologist at Queen's University has also raised concerns about foreign travel in the coming months. \nProfessor Ultan Power told Good Morning Ulster that at least 80% of the population of Northern Ireland should have two doses of a coronavirus vaccine before travel to Europe is allowed again. \nHe said: \"If we have mass foreign travel we run the risk of picking up new variants that may not be covered by the vaccine and that could being us back to a pretty bad place.\"\nHe urged caution, and said it would be a shame if the success of the vaccination rollout in Northern Ireland \"came to naught\" if a vaccine-resistant strain was brought back here because of travel abroad. \n\"We can't lose sight of the fact the virus isn't going away\", he added."

      "text": "Liverpool City Council awarded a contract to a firm run by a son of then-mayor Joe Anderson, despite it not being on an approved contractors' list.\nA government-commissioned report has revealed Safety Support Consultants (SSC) got the deal managing safety work when a flyover was demolished.\nSSC chief executive David Anderson said he was considering defamation action in relation to the report's claims.\nThe government is appointing officials to oversee parts of the council.\nLocal Government Secretary Robert Jenrick announced the decision on Wednesday, saying a \"serious breakdown of governance\" compelled him to act.\nHe told Parliament a \"Best Value inspection\" of the council had found \"multiple apparent failures\" and said he was proposing to appoint commissioners to run some aspects of the council.\nInspector Max Caller raised questions about why and how a 2019 contract came to be awarded to SSC, which in addition to not being on the approved contractors list had never before worked directly for the council, according to the report.\nMr Caller's report also said the mayor's \"myopic view that suppliers of services must have a Liverpool postcode... demonstrates, at best, a lack of understanding... and at worst, an attempt to stifle healthy competition in tender processes\".\nOf the awarding of the Churchill Way flyover project contract to SSC, the report said this \"exposed the site teams to considerable Health and Safety risk\".\n\"It also increased the commercial risk to the council of budget over run and additional compensation event claims,\" it added.\nThe council has been under scrutiny since police began investigating building and development contracts.\nMr Jenrick sent in inspectors following allegations of fraud, bribery, corruption, misconduct in public office and witness intimidation at the authority.\nDavid Anderson was one of the five men - including his father Joe Anderson and Liverpool's former deputy leader Derek Hatton - arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation.\nNo charges have been brought and all deny wrongdoing as the police investigation continues. \nReferring to the report's findings, David Anderson described the allegations as \"false accusations which are slanderous, unfounded, biased, tactical and politically motivated\".\n\"I refute strongly the claims made regarding the experience, payments, contract and work facilitated by SSC on the dismantling of the Churchill Way Flyovers for Amey plc,\" he added. \n\"The report regarding SSC is factually incorrect and damaging to the company. SSC was not invited to assist Max Caller in the preparation of the report or respond to the accusations made.\n\"I am seeking legal advice on defamation and will not be making any further comments regarding this matter at this stage. Evidence held by my legal team refutes the claims made.\"\nJoe Anderson, who stepped aside as mayor in December after being arrested, has questioned why the government was taking action against the council.\nHe said the reality of the situation \"does not reflect the dramatic success that we have generated over the last 11 years. With success brings jealousy\".\nMr Caller's report also found many people described the atmosphere in the council's regeneration department as \"intimidating\". \nIn a letter to Mr Jenrick dated 19 March, the inspector wrote: \"It would be my normal practice to include in the report a complete list of people to whom we spoke or received documentation from.\n\"However, the number of individuals who spoke to us as 'whistle-blowers' or who did not want to be identified, because of concerns about their safety, but who provided information that could be separately verified meant that I concluded that it was safer to not include this information at all.\"\nMr Jenrick is proposing to appoint the commissioners for a minimum of three years.\nHe said it was only the fifth time a \"statutory intervention\" had happened in England, as the move was regarded as a \"last resort\".\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Xinjiang,Human rights,China,Uighurs,European Union",
      "text": "Several Western countries have imposed sanctions on officials in China over rights abuses against the mostly Muslim Uighur minority group.\nChina has detained Uighurs at camps in the north-west region of Xinjiang, where allegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged.\nThe sanctions were introduced as a coordinated effort by the European Union, UK, US and Canada.\nChina responded with its own sanctions on European officials. \nIt has denied the allegations of abuse, claiming the camps are \"re-education\" facilities used to combat terrorism. \nBut UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the treatment of Uighurs amounted to \"appalling violations of the most basic human rights\". \nThe EU has not imposed new sanctions on China over human rights abuses since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, when troops in Beijing opened fire on pro-democracy protesters. \nThe sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, target senior officials in Xinjiang who have been accused of serious human rights violations against Uighur Muslims. \nThose targeted have been named as:\nMr Raab called the abuse of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang \"one of the worst human rights crises of our time\". \n\"I think it's clear that by acting with our partners - 30 of us in total - we are sending the clearest message to the Chinese government, that the international community will not turn a blind eye to such serious and systematic violations of basic human rights and that we will act in concert to hold those responsible to account,\" he told fellow parliamentarians.\nIn a statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China was committing \"genocide and crimes against humanity\". The US said it sanctioned Wang Junzheng and Chen Mingguo for their connection to \"arbitrary detention and severe physical abuse, among other serious human rights abuses\". \nCanada's foreign ministry said: \"Mounting evidence points to systemic, state-led human rights violations by Chinese authorities.\"\nThe sanctions came amid increasing international scrutiny over China's treatment of Uighurs.  \nMore than a million Uighurs and other minorities are estimated to have been detained in camps in Xinjiang.\nXinjiang lies in the north-west of China and is the country's biggest region. Like Tibet, it is autonomous, meaning - in theory - it has some powers of self-governance.  But in practice, both face major restrictions by the central government.\nUighurs living in the region speak their own language, similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. \nThe Chinese government has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on Uighur women and separating children from their families. \nA BBC investigation published in February contained first-hand testimony of systematic rape, sexual abuse and torture of detainees.\nOne woman testified that women were removed from their cells \"every night\" and raped by one or more masked Chinese men.  A former guard at one of the camps, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described torture and food deprivation of inmates.\nChina has banned BBC World News television over coverage of the Uighur issue and coronavirus. \nThe country initially denied the existence of the camps, before defending them as a necessary measure against terrorism. It has denied allegations of human rights abuses. \nChina on Monday said the sanctions - initially announced by the EU - were \"based on nothing but lies and disinformation\". \nIt said it would sanction 10 people and four entities in Europe \"that severely harm China's sovereignty and interests and maliciously spread lies and disinformation\" in response.  Those affected by China's sanctions are barred from entering the country or doing business with it.  \nGerman politician Reinhard Butikofer, who chairs the European Parliament's delegation to China, was among the most high profile officials on China's list. Adrian Zenz, a leading expert on China's policies in Xinjiang, and Swedish scholar Bjorn Jerden were also targeted. \nMr Zenz has reported extensively on alleged abuses in Xinjiang. His report last year on the forced sterilisation of Uighurs prompted international calls for the United Nations to investigate. State media has called him an \"infamous anti-China\" figure, and accused him of spreading lies. \nDutch lawmaker Sjoerd Sjoerdsma, who was put on China's sanctions list, said the retaliatory measures \"prove that China is sensitive to pressure.\" \n\"Let this be an encouragement to all my European colleagues: Speak out,\" he wrote on Twitter.

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The rollout of Covid vaccines in European Union (EU) countries is picking up speed, with more than 300 million jabs  administered.\nAs of 20 June, nearly half of the EU's adult population have had at least one one dose, while 28% have been fully vaccinated.\nEarlier this year, the rollout was hit by delays in production and distribution and vaccine hesitancy in some countries.\nIn the week to 20 June 2021, Germany administered an average of 1 dose per 100 people a day, with Italy and France close behind on  0.9 dose per 100 people - all higher than the UK's 0.6 per 100.\nHungary - which is using Russian and Chinese vaccines as well as the EU-approved ones - has fully vaccinated 46% of its population, the same proportion as the UK. \nIn France, children who are 12 and over can be vaccinated, with parental consent. The government is hoping to avoid class closures when schools reopen after the summer holidays. \nThe EU authorised the use of the Pfizer vaccine in children aged 12-15 at the end of May. \nGermany said it would give it to those aged 12-17 with pre-existing conditions while a number of other EU countries said they would vaccinate children before the start of the next academic year.\nIn June 2020, all 27 member states joined a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines.\nHowever, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca and there were supply problems.\nIts deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also saw early problems with production and distribution.\nIn February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine difficulties, saying: \"We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.\" \nIn January 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initially refused to recommend its use for people over 65.\nFrance and Germany eventually revised their stance and approved the vaccine for 65-74 year olds at the beginning of March.\nThey were again among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again later in March, following reports that a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. \nOn 7 April, the EMA said there was a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and the clots, although it is still recommended the jab for all age groups. \nSeveral EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands now say only people over 55 or 60 should get the jab, while others like Denmark have suspended its use altogether. \nThe headlines surrounding AstraZeneca led to a drop in confidence in the jab. In March, the polling company YouGov suggested that only a third of Germans and 23% of French respondents considered it safe.\nThe EU took AstraZeneca to court to force it to deliver more doses of vaccine. The company blamed production problems but said it had \"fully complied\" with its contract.\nThe EU lost its legal battle. It had wanted AstraZeneca to deliver 120 million doses by the end of June but a court ruled that the company must instead provide 80 million doses by the end of September. \nThe EU said the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom have plants in the EU.\nEU leaders considered a ban on exports of vaccines to the UK but decided not to introduce one.\nInstead, they called for more transparency from the UK and other countries on the number of doses they export.\nThe EU says that by 1 June 2021, it had exported 245 million doses to 46 different countries. \nUnder the terms of the EU scheme, member states are not supposed to strike deals with any vaccine manufacturer with whom the EU already has an agreement, but they can make separate deals with vaccine makers which have not signed agreements with the EU.\nHungary has been using Russia's Sputnik vaccine for months and and Slovakia has also bought doses of it.\nGermany said in April it would begin talks to secure supplies of the Russian vaccine and Austria said it would buy one million doses, but only once the EU's medicines agency approves the jab for use in the EU. \nThe Czech Republic and Poland have entered talks with both Russia and China.\nThe UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November 2020, nearly three weeks before EU regulators. \nThe government claimed that being outside the EU allowed it to be more nimble in this area. \nHowever, the UK's approval of the vaccine would have been permitted anyway under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator.\nThe UK could have joined the EU vaccine scheme last year while it was still in a transition phase with the EU, but it chose not to. \nIf it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies."

      "text": "Coronavirus infection levels in secondary school-age children have risen slightly in England, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nTests carried out during the second week back at school, ending 20 March, found an increase in 11-16 year olds. \nBut infections fell in older teenagers and young people, the ONS estimates.\nOverall, the percentage of people testing positive has levelled off in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and risen in Scotland.\nOn Friday, the UK reported another 6,187 confirmed cases - an increase of 1,385 on last Friday's figure, but a decrease of 210 from Thursday.\nAnother 70 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported - a decrease of 31 from last week, but an increase of seven from Thursday.\nAccording to the ONS analysis, which tests a random sample of adults and children in the community, infections remain at a low level after falling steeply since January.\nIt estimates that in the week up to 20 March:\nAt the height of the winter peak, the percentage testing positive was around 2% in most of the UK.\nThis week's figures from the ONS also reflect the effect of schools re-opening in England on 8 March on infection levels, which were always expected to rise when children, staff and parents started mixing again in large numbers.\nThe findings show a slight rise in children testing positive in years 7-11, from 0.31% the previous week to 0.43% this week.\nHowever, in primary schools the trend among younger children is less certain and much flatter, and in children in year 12 and upwards, the ONS estimates that infections fell.\nYoung people in their 20s and 30s also saw infections fall during that week.\nSchools in Scotland opened to the youngest pupils at the end of February and ONS data has already suggested infections could be gradually rising there. Schools in Wales opened to some children on 22 February.\nBut identifying more infections in schools, which is possible through regular rapid testing, does not automatically mean there will be more cases and more serious illness across all age groups - because of the Covid vaccination programme.\nMore than half of the UK's adult population has now had one dose of a vaccine, which 'real-world' studies have shown to offer high levels of protection against Covid-19.\nAs a result, deaths as well as hospital admissions with Covid have fallen sharply, and particularly in older age groups which were vaccinated first. Millions of under-50s are yet to be offered a jab, however.\nProf James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, at the University of Oxford, said caution was still needed.\n\"Even in a full-blown third wave, the number of hospitalisation and deaths for every thousand people who become infected would be much lower because of vaccination.  \n\"However, no one who has not been vaccinated is entirely safe from serious illness and a large wave of infection in young people will lead to hospitalisations,\" he said.\nProf Lawrence Young, professor of molecular oncology at Warwick Medical School, said infections levelling off was \"inevitable\" as the country relaxes restrictions after lockdown.\n\"This is why the roadmap is taking a cautious approach - leaving gaps between each relaxation so that the impact on infections can be carefully monitored,\" he said.\nThe R number is now between 0.7 and 0.9, narrowing slightly from last week's estimate, but still below 1 in most regions. However, the government says the figure does not yet fully reflect the re-opening of schools in England.\nSarah Crofts, senior statistician for the ONS's Covid-19 Infection Survey, said their study found different trends in infections across regions.\n\"The North West saw an increase in the percentage of people testing positive while in the South East and East of England it decreased. There were slower decreases in London, West Midlands and the South West.\"   \nShe said the ONS would continue to closely monitor infections by age group."

      "text": "Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been cleared of breaking rules during an investigation into her predecessor, Alex Salmond, but she's been criticised in a separate report by MSPs.\nAn independent report found that Ms Sturgeon did not breach the ministerial code during the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints against Mr Salmond. \nHowever, a separate inquiry by MSPs has described the government's actions as \"deeply flawed\", and questioned some of Ms Sturgeon's evidence. \nThe pair dominated Scottish politics for more than a decade. They led the campaign for Scotland to become independent from the UK. \nAlex Salmond was Scotland's first minister and Scottish National Party leader before Ms Sturgeon, who had been his deputy. She took over after the 2014 independence referendum, which saw Scotland back remaining in the UK by 55% to 45%. \nThe row began when allegations of sexual harassment - strongly denied - were made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants in 2018.\nThe complaints were made after Ms Sturgeon asked for new government policies on sexual harassment to be put in place in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Mr Salmond believed the policy was aimed at him.  \nThe Scottish government eventually admitted it had acted unlawfully. It had to pay Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000.\nMr Salmond has accused officials close to Ms Sturgeon - including her husband Peter Murrell, the SNP's chief executive - of plotting against him. They all deny these claims.\nThen, in January 2019, Mr Salmond was arrested and charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, including attempted rape.\nMr Salmond was cleared of all 13 charges - which were alleged to have happened while he was first minister - after a trial last March. \nThe nine women who made the allegations included an SNP politician, a party worker and several current and former Scottish government civil servants and officials. \nIn court, Mr Salmond said the claims made about his alleged conduct were \"deliberate fabrications for a political purpose\", or \"exaggerations\".\nAfter being acquitted, he said there was \"certain information\" he had been unable to talk about during the trial, but which would \"see the light of day\" in the future. \nHe has since claimed there was a \"deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort\" from some in the Scottish government and leading SNP figures to damage him and even have him sent to prison.\nMs Sturgeon has accused him of peddling false conspiracy theories and suggested her predecessor is angry because she \"did not collude with him\" to make the sexual harassment allegations \"go away\". \nFollowing the trial, two separate inquiries began. One was by a committee of MSPs and the other by James Hamilton, Ireland's former director of public prosecutions.\nMr Hamilton's inquiry looked at whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave. It examined whether she had interfered with the civil service investigation into the allegations against Mr Salmond, or misled parliament about what she knew and when.\nThis report cleared Ms Sturgeon of breaching the ministerial code, but said it was up to parliament to decide whether she had misled them.\nSeparately, the committee of MSPs examined the Scottish government's handling of the initial complaints against Mr Salmond. \nIts report said the Scottish government's actions had been \"seriously flawed\". \nMSPs on the committee voted by five to four that Ms Sturgeon misled their inquiry during her marathon evidence session earlier this month. \nThe committee also said the female civil servants who had made the complaints against Mr Salmond had been badly let down by the government.\nThe row has divided the SNP ahead of the Scottish Parliament election on 6 May, with some prominent MPs and many grassroots activists openly backing Mr Salmond. \nSome opinion polls have suggested that the fallout could threaten the SNP's hopes of winning an overall majority in the election - although it remains on course to once again finish as the largest party.\nPanorama on Salmond v Sturgeon is available on BBC iplayer."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Patrick Vallance,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Lockdown is, step-by-step, beginning to ease across the UK. Next week, the stay-at-home order will be lifted in England and people can start mixing in small groups outdoors.\nBut with infection rates rising in Europe, the British public is also being warned of the risk of a third wave.\nThe prime minister himself says it is only a matter of time before the wave from Europe washes up on our shores. But with more than half of adults vaccinated, what would that look like?\nWhile the outbreaks in Europe have been portrayed as the threat, we should not forget the virus is still lurking here. Infection rates have dropped dramatically since the turn of the year - there has been a 12-fold fall in daily cases being reported.\nBut that still leaves more than enough infection circulating that could easily take off. The Office for National Statistics estimates that, along with asymptomatic cases, there could be more than 100,000 infectious people out there.\nAlready there are signs of a slight increase in cases among children following the return to schools in England.\nProf Christina Pagel, from University College London, says some of the increase is undoubtedly because of more testing - secondary school pupils have been offered regular on-the-spot rapid tests since their return to school to pick up asymptomatic cases.\nBut that, she says, cannot account for it all. She is concerned this is the start of an upward trend, pointing out that many parents will not have had their first dose yet - rollout has been limited to the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions. The break for Easter will help slow the spread but that will only be temporary, she fears.\nBut if cases continue to rise, does this matter? After all, 99% of Covid deaths have been in the groups now vaccinated.\nThe link between infections and serious illness or death has been \"severely weakened\", says diseases expert Prof Mark Woolhouse, of Edinburgh University.\nBut if infection levels rise high enough the virus \"will find those\" who are unvaccinated and those for whom the vaccine hasn't worked, he says.\nWhile the vaccines are good - they significantly reduce the risk of falling ill and for those who do develop symptoms there is a strong likelihood it will be a fairly mild cough, fever or short period of breathlessness - they are not 100% perfect.\nSo Prof Woolhouse warns there could still be significant numbers of deaths, even if the threat to the NHS is much reduced.\nWhat nobody can be sure of is just how quickly and by how much infection levels could rise in the coming months.\nThe natural R rate - how many people the average person who is infected passes the virus on to - was between three and four for this coronavirus, but with the new more contagious variant dominant, it could now be around five, some believe.\nDr Duncan Robertson, a disease modeller at Loughborough University, believes we are in \"essentially a new epidemic\". \"This is the first time we are lifting restrictions with the new variant - it could take off and those areas with the lowest vaccination rates will be vulnerable.\"\nThere are a number of issues that will be crucial in determining exactly what happens from here.\nAs well as protecting those vaccinated, the vaccine programme will also help slow transmission. Early evidence suggests the AstraZeneca jab could stop two-thirds of people who are vaccinated from passing it on.\nOn top of that those who have already been infected - estimated to be about a quarter of the population - will have some immunity.\nSecondly, seasonality could help. Respiratory viruses tend to thrive in the winter, but are less likely to spread in the spring and summer.\nBecause this is a new virus, it could take some time to settle into a seasonal pattern, but certainly the changing seasons are likely to have some impact.\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says it is possible a significant rise may not actually come until the winter, giving more time for the vaccination programme to rollout.\nSpeaking this week, he said the UK should be confident the \"path from here does look better\", but we should still expect \"bumps and twists\" along the way. \nThe most immediate problem, he said, was likely to be local outbreaks - and variation in uptake between different areas leaves some places particularly vulnerable. \nMeanwhile, in the longer term, variants that can spread more easily because they can evade some of the immune response could come into play, Prof Whitty said.\nThe next unknown is the behaviour of the public. By far the biggest risk factor for spreading the virus is mixing indoors in homes, says Prof Woolhouse. \"We know most outdoor activities are very safe, we know there has never been a surge in cases following school opening and the risks in retail and hospitality can be mitigated. \n\"But we cannot police what happens in people's homes - that is the perfect environment for the virus to spread.\"\nThe \"gut reaction\" of most people will be to think everything will be fine, says Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a Cambridge University expert in understanding risk, and that we can \"start enjoying ourselves again\".\nBut we should not \"trust our intuition on this\", he says. That means taking each step very cautiously.\n\"The government is determined to not take steps back so that could mean taking longer to take steps forward.\"\nThe aim, of course, is to balance the need to open society while trying to control the virus. While some people have called for a \"Zero Covid\" approach, the government and its advisers are clear this cannot be achieved given the nature of the virus, which can spread without people being aware they are infected.\nThis week, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said there was basically \"zero chance\" of zero Covid.\nSo how bad will the third wave get? Modelling done for the government has suggested as many as 30,000 people could die by the summer of 2022, even with a gradual reopening and good vaccine rollout.\nThat is four times fewer than the number of deaths we have seen over the past year. And while it sounds high, it is worth noting that in a bad winter, 25,000 people can die from flu. But the toll could be much much higher - more than double that - if things do not go as well as assumed, the modelling suggested.\nThere are, of course, as always caveats around these models. But they should act as a warning - while the UK may be in a strong position, nothing should be taken for granted with this virus.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "Science is winning the race between coronavirus and the vaccine, Pfizer's UK medical director has said.\nDr Berkeley Phillips told BBC News NI it was important people were \"allowed to start living again\".\nWhile the main threat continues to come from new variants, Pfizer is already designing an updated vaccine that will work, he said.\nDr Phillips said \"incredible progress\" had been made in the past year and \"we're winning that race\".\n\"If you look at what's happening in the UK there are dramatic reductions in the death rate, dramatic reductions in hospitalisations and in the number of cases,\" he said.\n\"I do think we have to start living again. \n\"It's obviously down to the governments of the devolved nations to decide exactly the right approaches - science is only one part of the decision making and that's why these decisions are so difficult.\"\nWhen asked about the importance of reopening society, Dr Phillips said the right balance should be struck.\n\"There are many cancers going undiagnosed and people are going into hospital with suspected heart attacks and strokes and there are so many other conditions,\" he added.\n\"It is a balance between lockdown and unlocking too quickly.\" \nPfizer UK has been at the heart of vaccine research and trials since the start of the pandemic and is forecast to deliver over two billion vaccines by the end of this year. \nAccording to the doctor, a turning point for him and the team based at Surrey, were the pictures of Irishwoman Margaret Keenan, the first person to receive the vaccine on the NHS.\n\"It was a momentous moment,\" he said. \n\"Obviously I knew of 44,000 people who had been given the vaccine as part of the trial, but this was the first person on the NHS.\n\"I recall watching it and thinking this is the beginning of the fight back. It has been a war and has been a war against an invisible enemy. \n\"That moment when I saw her wearing her Christmas jumper felt like the tables were turning and the fight back against the virus was beginning.\" \nDr Phillips, a cardiologist, joined Pfizer in 2001. \nHe said he never imagined he would be working on a vaccine that would have such a huge impact on society and the global population. \nRecalling the morning when he got the news the vaccine had worked, he said it was an amazing feeling.\n\"First the person told me it had worked, then he said it was 95% efficacious which was just unbelievable when we thought it might just be 50% to 60% - so yes it was incredible.\"   \nPfizer and its partner BioNTech have now launched clinical trials to study the safety and effectiveness of its coronavirus vaccine on pregnant women. \nBesides studying levels of protection, researchers will also assess the safety in infants of vaccinated women and whether protective antibodies have been transferred to the infants. \nWomen in the UK are part of the trials. \n\"We haven't seen any adverse effects which is reassuring but we have a long way to go,\" said Dr Phillips.\nAs the global rollout of vaccines continue and demand grows, Pfizer UK said it remained confident that it could honour its global supply commitments. \nThe company is \"absolutely committed to keeping all our contractual agreements around the world regarding supply and in terms of the UK we are completely on track for this and the next quarter,\" he added.\nWhen asked about its data on blood clots, the doctor said there had not been any signal that blood clots had been happening at any higher incidence than compared to the general population. \n\"We have been discussing it with the regulators all around the world and they have not seen anything to be concerned about, so that is very reassuring from our perspective,\" he said.\nThe pandemic has focussed minds on the readiness of countries to respond to a global health crisis and the need for public health to be better equipped to cope with a health emergency.  \nIt is referred to by scientists as \"pandemic preparedness\" - or the ability to be ready. \nThe pandemic has shone a spotlight on, among other things, the importance of research and science and how the two can no longer be separated, Dr Phillips said.\n\"I think research and science has come to our rescue to defeat this pandemic - they're also important for the health of our nation and its economy.\" \nThe medical director, who said he joined Pfizer to help improve people's lives, revealed they were now working on potential antiviral treatments, both intravenous and oral, for dealing with Covid-19. \n\"There are many exciting things to come, I am very optimistic about the future,\" he said."

      "text": "China is targeting more Western clothes retailers as international backlash grows over claims of abuses in the cotton-growing Xinjiang region.\nSeveral major brands have expressed concern over allegations that members of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority group are being used as forced labour.\nSome companies' online shops are blocked and their stores have vanished from some digital maps.\nIt comes after several Western countries imposed sanctions on China.\nChina initially targeted H&M and Nike but that has widened to include Burberry, Adidas and Converse, among others.\nWhile H&M's physical stores in China remain, it is no longer possible to hail a taxi to the shops using an app and consumers can't shop online. Instead China is championing local brands.\nChina is accused of committing serious human rights violations against Uighurs in Xinjiang.\nBeijing denies this, and has hit back with retaliatory sanctions on European lawmakers, scholars and institutions - with the latest imposed on UK entities and individuals on Friday.\nIn December the BBC published an investigation based on new research showing China was forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities including Uighurs into manual labour in Xinjiang's cotton fields.\nChina has now got other brands in its crosshairs - but will this campaign actually work? \nIn just 24 hours H&M has been all but erased from China's digital world; you can't buy its tops and dresses on the biggest online retail platforms, you can't get a taxi to take you to one of its shops on the biggest ride hailing app. \nThe physical stores are still there and open - almost all of them - but in the sphere where China's ruling Communist Party can coordinate most quickly, H&M has disappeared. \nOnly sales figures and decisions from the firm's Sweden HQ will accurately reveal the impact this campaign is having. \nBut previous efforts, targeting South Korea's Lotte chain in particular, show how effective it can be. Lotte stores are no more here after it got caught up in a diplomatic row between Beijing and Seoul. \nThe challenge for foreign brands has always been about how to sell your stuff to China's 1.4 billion at the same time as satisfying your global customers' growing demands to get your ethics right.\nThat's become even more salient in the era of Xinjiang abuses. Some see it as simply Sales vs Ethics; they choose which side to come down on. Others try to find a way to achieve both.\nThe Xinjiang cotton campaign began on Wednesday when Chinese state media outlets and netizens singled out H&M over a statement made last year, and soon expanded to include many other brands.\nThey have now called for boycotts of brands associated with the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) - a non-profit group that promotes sustainable cotton production - whose members include Nike, Adidas, New Balance, Burberry, Puma, and Tommy Hilfiger.\nBCI said in October it had suspended activities in Xinjiang as well as licensing of the region's cotton, citing allegations and \"increasing risks\" of forced labour, according to the cached version of a statement that is no longer accessible on the BCI website.\n\"If you boycott Xinjiang cotton, we'll boycott you,\" one person commented on Weibo.  \nTop celebrities in China, including singer Eason Chan and movie stars Zhang Yixing and Bai Jingting, have since said they would sever ties with some of these brands.\nChinese tech giant Tencent also halted its partnership with the British luxury brand Burberry, which had designed outfits for Honor Of Kings, one of China's biggest video games.\nMeanwhile, state media have highlighted a number of Chinese brands including Li Ning, Anta, Peak, and Meters/bonwe, with trending hashtags on Weibo praising the companies for specifically using Xinjiang cotton - Li Ning for instance lists this on its clothing tags.\nAnta, the world's third biggest sportswear company, said on Weibo it was a member of BCI, but was pulling out of the initiative. \"We have always bought and used cotton produced in China, including Xinjiang cotton, and in the future we will continue to do so,\" it said.\nJapanese sportswear label Asics also pledged support for Xinjiang cotton, while Japanese retailer Muji - which at one point had marketed a \"Xinjiang cotton\" line of products- told the Global Times it was still selling such items in China..\nRead more: Who are the Uighurs?"

      "text": "A Dutch travel firm will take nearly 200 people for an eight-day holiday in Greece aimed at seeing if tourism is feasible during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThose picked will have an all-inclusive getaway on the island of Rhodes at a cost of \u20ac399 (\u00a3344; $472) per person, but there are some catches.\nThey will not be allowed to leave the resort and will have to quarantine for up to 10 days when they return home.\nAt least 25,000 people have signed up for the government-backed experiment.\nThe Dutch government's travel advice otherwise is that all foreign trips should be avoided, unless essential, until at least the middle of May.\nWhile many people may like to swap a life of lockdown for a week of Greek sunshine, questions have been raised about whether enabling such escapism is responsible or reckless at a time when both the infection rate and hospital admissions in the Netherlands are on the rise, the BBC's Anna Holligan reports.\nThe Netherlands has recorded at least 16,536 deaths and 1,246,366 cases of infection during the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nBut with public pressure mounting to allow summer holidays to go ahead, experiments like this one could help to determine whether there is a Covid-secure way to allow people to take an overseas break during the pandemic, she adds.\nOver the weekend, a two-day trial music festival was held near Amsterdam.\nTour company Sunweb is offering 187 tickets for people aged 18-70, which will be awarded manually according to criteria set by the government.\nThey will be chosen by age group and people with high-risk conditions will be excluded, a Sunweb spokeswoman told BBC News. Final choices will be determined by who registered first. \nTravellers will be tested before and after their trip. If anyone develops Covid during the trip they will have to quarantine at a Greek Covid hotel but their costs will be covered by the tour company.\nSunweb says it has drawn up safety guidelines for the entire trip, which have been approved by the Dutch public health agency, the RIVM.\nThe visitors will be given exclusive use of a hotel on Rhodes, with staff the only other people there. They will have the use of the hotel's swimming pools and restaurants but will not be allowed to go out on to the beach.\nCorina Gouderjaan, 51, told Dutch broadcaster RTL Nieuws why she had applied for a ticket: \"First I got corona and got very sick. Then I lost my job. So now what? I'm looking forward to doing absolutely nothing at a resort and recovering from this turbulent year.\""

      "text": "Shops in England will be allowed to stay open until 22:00 six days a week when customers return from 12 April, the government has said.\nAfter months of coronavirus-related closures, non-essential retailers will be able to apply to trade from 07:00 BST Monday to Saturday.\nCommunities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the move would help businesses to recover and customers to shop safely.\nHe said councils will be asked to avoid \"unnecessary restrictions\" on hours.\nUnder the road map for easing England's coronavirus restrictions, non-essential shops are permitted to reopen from 12 April at the earliest, providing the government's four tests are met.\nShops will be able to extend their opening hours from 07:00 to 22:00 from Monday to Saturday, to help customers avoid peak times and to ease the pressure on transport, according to the Ministry of Local Government.\nDominic Curran of the British Retail Consortium said it welcomed the announcement of extended opening hours, as it would allow people to avoid the busier shopping periods.\nHe added: \"Retailers have invested hundreds of millions in making their stores Covid-secure, implementing additional hygiene measures, perspex screens, social distancing and more.\"\nMr Jenrick said the temporary measures would \"support businesses to reopen and recover\", alongside a \u00a356m \"Welcome Back Fund\" announced by the government last week.\nHe said: \"This will provide a much-needed boost for many businesses - protecting jobs, reducing pressure on public transport and supporting people and communities to continue to visit their high streets safely and shop locally.\"\nIn a written ministerial statement on Thursday, Mr Jenrick said he would ask local councils to take a \"positive and flexible approach\" to shops wishing to extend their opening hours.\nHe said the government acknowledged that longer retail hours could have a \"temporary impact\" on local residents, but this had to be balanced by the \"significant public interest in ensuring there is a safe retail environment when non-essential shops reopen\".\nThe government said it would also continue to allow pubs and restaurants to put up marquees to help increase seating capacity in a Covid-secure way.\nFlexible working hours on construction sites will also be extended, and food deliveries to supermarkets will be allowed over more time periods, No 10 said."

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus vaccines,State schools,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Coronavirus infection levels in secondary school-age children have risen slightly in England, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nTests carried out during the second week back at school, ending 20 March, found an increase in 11-16 year olds. \nBut infections fell in older teenagers and young people, the ONS estimates.\nOverall, the percentage of people testing positive has levelled off in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and risen in Scotland.\nOn Friday, the UK reported another 6,187 confirmed cases - an increase of 1,385 on last Friday's figure, but a decrease of 210 from Thursday.\nAnother 70 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported - a decrease of 31 from last week, but an increase of seven from Thursday.\nAccording to the ONS analysis, which tests a random sample of adults and children in the community, infections remain at a low level after falling steeply since January.\nIt estimates that in the week up to 20 March:\nAt the height of the winter peak, the percentage testing positive was around 2% in most of the UK.\nThis week's figures from the ONS also reflect the effect of schools re-opening in England on 8 March on infection levels, which were always expected to rise when children, staff and parents started mixing again in large numbers.\nThe findings show a slight rise in children testing positive in years 7-11, from 0.31% the previous week to 0.43% this week.\nHowever, in primary schools the trend among younger children is less certain and much flatter, and in children in year 12 and upwards, the ONS estimates that infections fell.\nYoung people in their 20s and 30s also saw infections fall during that week.\nSchools in Scotland opened to the youngest pupils at the end of February and ONS data has already suggested infections could be gradually rising there. Schools in Wales opened to some children on 22 February.\nBut identifying more infections in schools, which is possible through regular rapid testing, does not automatically mean there will be more cases and more serious illness across all age groups - because of the Covid vaccination programme.\nMore than half of the UK's adult population has now had one dose of a vaccine, which 'real-world' studies have shown to offer high levels of protection against Covid-19.\nAs a result, deaths as well as hospital admissions with Covid have fallen sharply, and particularly in older age groups which were vaccinated first. Millions of under-50s are yet to be offered a jab, however.\nProf James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, at the University of Oxford, said caution was still needed.\n\"Even in a full-blown third wave, the number of hospitalisation and deaths for every thousand people who become infected would be much lower because of vaccination.  \n\"However, no one who has not been vaccinated is entirely safe from serious illness and a large wave of infection in young people will lead to hospitalisations,\" he said.\nProf Lawrence Young, professor of molecular oncology at Warwick Medical School, said infections levelling off was \"inevitable\" as the country relaxes restrictions after lockdown.\n\"This is why the roadmap is taking a cautious approach - leaving gaps between each relaxation so that the impact on infections can be carefully monitored,\" he said.\nThe R number is now between 0.7 and 0.9, narrowing slightly from last week's estimate, but still below 1 in most regions. However, the government says the figure does not yet fully reflect the re-opening of schools in England.\nSarah Crofts, senior statistician for the ONS's Covid-19 Infection Survey, said their study found different trends in infections across regions.\n\"The North West saw an increase in the percentage of people testing positive while in the South East and East of England it decreased. There were slower decreases in London, West Midlands and the South West.\"   \nShe said the ONS would continue to closely monitor infections by age group."

      "tags": "Companies,Women,Gender pay gap,Pay,Asda",
      "text": "Thousands of Asda supermarket workers have won a major victory at the Supreme Court in their battle for equal pay. \nThe court upheld an earlier court ruling that lower-paid shop staff, who are mostly women, can compare themselves with higher paid warehouse workers, who are mostly men. \nThe judge stressed the ruling did not mean the 44,000 claimants had won the right to equal pay.\nHowever, they are now free to take further action.\nLauren Lougheed, a Leigh Day lawyer representing Asda store staff, said: \"We are delighted that our clients have cleared such a big hurdle in their fight for equal pay.\n\"Already an employment tribunal, the employment appeal tribunal and the Court of Appeal ruled that these roles can be compared, and now the Supreme Court has come to the same conclusion.\n\"It's our hope that Asda will now stop dragging its heels and pay their staff what they are worth.\" \nThe GMB union has members involved in the case. Its legal director, Susan Harris, said: \"Asda has wasted money on lawyers' bills chasing a lost cause, losing appeal after appeal, while tens of thousands of retail workers remain out of pocket.\n\"We now call on Asda to sit down with us to reach agreement on the back pay owed to our members - which could run to hundreds of millions of pounds.\"\nWendy Arundale, who worked for Asda for 32 years, said: \"I loved my job, but knowing that male colleagues working in distribution centres were being paid more left a bitter taste in my mouth.  \n\"It's not much to ask to be paid an equal wage for work of equal value.\"\nBut an Asda spokesman said there was a long way to go before the issues were finally settled: \"This ruling relates to one stage of a complex case that is likely to take several years to reach a conclusion. \n\"We are defending these claims because the pay in our stores and distribution centres is the same for colleagues doing the same jobs regardless of their gender. Retail and distribution are very different sectors with their own distinct skill sets and pay rates.\"\nIt said it remained confident in its case.\nLawyers say the ruling will have implications for supermarkets and other retailers.\n\"It would be difficult to underestimate the significance of this judgment which will send shockwaves far beyond Asda,\" said Anne Pritam, partner and employment lawyer at Stephenson Harwood.\n\"It is a watershed moment for the rest of the retail industry, particularly those defending their own equal pay claims - such as Sainsbury's, Tesco, Morrisons and Next - and which have similar staffing models and pay structures.\"\n\"Ultimately, if all of the retailers lose their equal pay claims, it is estimated they could face \u00a38bn in compensation payments to employees.\"  \nAsda store workers argued they were paid less because most store workers are women, while most distribution depot staff are men.\nLawyers representing the store workers say depot workers were paid between \u00a31.50-3.00 an hour more.\nAsda said it had always paid the correct rate for the job, whether male or female, and pointed out that both men and women worked in both supermarkets and the warehouses.\nAsda store workers may have won this battle in their long running equal pay claim - but the war is far from over.\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that for the purposes of equal pay the work of the mainly male distribution workers can be compared to the mainly female shop floor workers.\nBut next they need to prove their work is of equal value - in terms of skills and training. \nAnd finally that gender is the key reason that their pay is different. \nThe stakes here are high. Supermarkets could find themselves on the hook for more than \u00a38bn in back pay.\nAnd it could reverberate around other businesses too - where a majority of women carry out a certain role.\nIn 2016, an employment tribunal decided that Asda store workers were entitled to compare themselves to distribution staff and that decision was upheld by Court of Appeal judges in 2019.\nAsda bosses then appealed to the Supreme Court.\nLawyers say litigation could run on for years. \nThere are three stages in equal pay action:\nFollowing the Supreme Court ruling, lawyers say the next stage would involve an employment tribunal deciding whether specific store and distribution jobs were of \"equal value\".\nIf judges decided that different jobs were of \"equal value\", the litigation would then enter a third stage.\nUnder this, a tribunal would then consider whether there were reasons - other than gender - why people working in stores should not get the same pay rates as people working in distribution centres.

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

Cases are also up in Poland by 35%, and health officials in both countries say the spread of the UK (Kent) variant is behind the surge.\nSlovakia and the Czech Republic are also now seen as high-risk, but they have been downgraded from the highest alert level of \"virus mutation area\", aimed at stopping almost all travel. Czech infection levels have begun to fall, down a quarter on last week.\nAustria's Tyrol was also classed as a \"virus mutation area\" but from Sunday is being downgraded even further.\nFrance has seen a big increase in cases in recent weeks.\nNineteen areas have been placed under lockdown and more than 4,700 people are now being treated in intensive care. The greater Paris region is one of the worst affected areas with almost 600 cases per 100,000 people. The average French incidence rate in the past week is above 200 cases, while in Germany it is 119 per 100,000 people.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron said late on Thursday there would be \"no taboo\" as far as further measures were concerned. On Friday, the government spoke of a \"race against time\" as it beefed up checks at stations, airports and road tolls in the 19 affected areas.\nAlthough schools are still open in these areas, which now include the Rh\u00f4ne region around Lyon, most businesses are shut and travel in or out is barred without a compelling reason.\nEurope's Covid vaccine drive started slowly, partly because of delivery delays. But France has stepped up vaccinations, announcing almost 400,000 on Friday alone. A drive to start vaccinating people aged 70-75 will begin on Saturday.\nIn Germany about 10% of adults have now had a first dose of vaccine (with 14 doses per 100 people), well below UK levels. The German health minister said his country was in the final stages of a \"pandemic marathon\" but it would take some time before the goal could be reached. He appealed to Germans not to travel over Easter and minimise their contacts with other people."

France's president Emmanuel Macron said he wanted vaccinations \"morning, noon and night\" after an increase in intensive care cases and hospital admissions.\nNow, some in the haulage industry say they've been told to expect that lorry drivers will be required to take a Covid test after travelling from mainland Europe to England.\nFrance has stopped mandatory testing for hauliers travelling from the UK to France, a measure that had been in place from December due concerns about a UK variant of the disease. \nHauliers travelling from the UK to Denmark, Germany or the Netherlands still require a test.\nThe Department for Transport said: \"We are carefully monitoring the increase in cases in Europe and will keep all measures under review as we cautiously remove restrictions throughout our roadmap.\"\nThe government has been encouraging international hauliers due to be in the UK for more than 48 hours to take a free coronavirus test.\nHauliers leaving the UK can also take a free test.\nTrade volumes with the continent declined in January due to Covid-19 restrictions and the impact of new arrangements under Brexit.\nFigures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that UK goods exported to the European Union fell 40.7% in January, while imports tumbled 28.8%.\nNevertheless, the Prime Minister has indicated the government might further tighten restrictions on arrivals from France, including hauliers, to stop new variants of the Covid-19 virus spreading from the rest of Europe.\nBritain has banned foreign travel until at least 17 May, except for essential work, education or health reasons. Ministers are due to review that position in April.\nQuestioning the PM at the Liaison Committee on Thursday, Labour's Yvette Cooper said every week 20,000 people arrived from France, and two-thirds of them - including lorry drivers - were exempt from those restrictions."

teachers should be able to \"appropriately show images of the prophet\" in class.\nProtests have been staged outside Batley Grammar School, where a teacher has been suspended.\nThe West Yorkshire school has apologised \"unequivocally\". \nHead teacher Gary Kibble said the member of staff had been suspended since the image was used in a lesson on Monday. \nDemonstrators gathered for a second day on Friday morning, but had moved on by mid-afternoon.\nThe school, which had been due to break up for the Easter holiday, was understood to have switched to a day of remote learning and the gates remained locked.\nMr Jenrick called for the \"deeply unsettling\" scenes outside the school to \"come to an end\".\n\"In a free society we want religions to be taught to children and for children to be able to question and query them,\" he told the BBC.\n\"We must see teachers protected and no-one should be feeling intimidated or threatened as they go into school.\"\nProtesters had demanded the teacher's sacking, while some parents who spoke to the BBC said they didn't agree with the demonstrations and found them \"intimidating\".\nAs a crowd gathered on Friday, one protester read out a statement at the school gates.\nHe said the group \"do not accept that the school has taken this issue seriously, given that it's taken them four days to merely suspend only one of the teachers involved\".\nAnother protester, who gave his name only as Mr Hussain, told the PA news agency he was a parent at the school and said: \"We would not like any form of extremism, any extremist viewpoints, to be taught to children.\"\nMEND, which helps Muslims engage with British media and politics, said its Islamophobia Response Unit had been helping \"several\" parents liaise with the school over the issue.\nDeputy chair Dr Shazad Amin, said he saw \"no problem\" with blasphemy being discussed at the school but said the particular image shown to pupils was \"deeply offensive\" and \"furthered stereotypes and anti-Islamic tropes\".\nAs a result, he said people in the local community had \"a right to feel hurt and a right to feel angry\" but called for them to allow the matter to be properly investigated.\nHe said parents were \"fairly positive\" with the action taken so far by the school.\nFormer Conservative Party chairwoman Baroness Warsi said the debate has been hijacked by \"extremists on both sides\" to fuel a \"culture war\" at the expense of \"kids and their learning\".  \nShe told the BBC she had spoken to pupils and parents over the last 24 hours and \"that many pupils were left distressed because of what happened\".\nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"It's about safeguarding children and making sure the school look again, as should every school, to ensure that every pupil in their school is being taught in a way which creates a positive, unifying learning environment.\"\nBy Corinne Wheatley, BBC News\nAround a dozen or so protestors who remained outside Batley Grammar School for most of the morning have now left. \nThe school was due to break up for the Easter holiday today, but the gates are locked and the school is shut. \nThe protesters here this morning said they wanted to keep things peaceful after concerns were raised yesterday about threats and intimidation towards school staff. \nSome passers-by told me they wanted the protest to wind down so they could work on a dialogue with school and to bring an end to the disruption to the local community.\nLabour MP for Batley and Spen, Tracey Brabin, condemned those who \"seek to fan the flames of this incident\", and said she welcomed the school's apology.\nIn a statement, she said: \"No teacher should be facing intimidation or threats, there is no excuse for that.\n\"The focus must be on the welfare and education of the children at this school.\"\nWest Yorkshire Police said no arrests had been made and officers remained at the school. \nParts of the Koran are taken to mean that neither Allah nor Muhammad can be captured in an image by human hand and any attempt to do so is seen as an insult.\nHead teacher Mr Kibble said the teacher had \"given their most sincere apologies\" and been suspended pending an investigation.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, called for the school to be allowed to investigate the matter \"without a running commentary in the media, on social media, and outside the school gates\".\nA petition calling for the teacher to be reinstated has received more than 10,000 signatures.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Department for Education said it was \"never acceptable to threaten or intimidate teachers\" and that they encouraged dialogue between schools and parents when issues emerged.\nKirklees Council said Batley Grammar is an academy school so the authority only has a \"very limited role\" in its running but said it was pleased to see the school had taken \"swift action\".\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

It has been a war and has been a war against an invisible enemy. \n\"That moment when I saw her wearing her Christmas jumper felt like the tables were turning and the fight back against the virus was beginning.\" \nDr Phillips, a cardiologist, joined Pfizer in 2001. \nHe said he never imagined he would be working on a vaccine that would have such a huge impact on society and the global population. \nRecalling the morning when he got the news the vaccine had worked, he said it was an amazing feeling.\n\"First the person told me it had worked, then he said it was 95% efficacious which was just unbelievable when we thought it might just be 50% to 60% - so yes it was incredible.\"   \nPfizer and its partner BioNTech have now launched clinical trials to study the safety and effectiveness of its coronavirus vaccine on pregnant women. \nBesides studying levels of protection, researchers will also assess the safety in infants of vaccinated women and whether protective antibodies have been transferred to the infants. \nWomen in the UK are part of the trials. \n\"We haven't seen any adverse effects which is reassuring but we have a long way to go,\" said Dr Phillips.\nAs the global rollout of vaccines continue and demand grows, Pfizer UK said it remained confident that it could honour its global supply commitments. \nThe company is \"absolutely committed to keeping all our contractual agreements around the world regarding supply and in terms of the UK we are completely on track for this and the next quarter,\" he added.\nWhen asked about its data on blood clots, the doctor said there had not been any signal that blood clots had been happening at any higher incidence than compared to the general population. \n\"We have been discussing it with the regulators all around the world and they have not seen anything to be concerned about, so that is very reassuring from our perspective,\" he said.\nThe pandemic has focussed minds on the readiness of countries to respond to a global health crisis and the need for public health to be better equipped to cope with a health emergency.  \nIt is referred to by scientists as \"pandemic preparedness\" - or the ability to be ready. \nThe pandemic has shone a spotlight on, among other things, the importance of research and science and how the two can no longer be separated, Dr Phillips said.\n\"I think research and science has come to our rescue to defeat this pandemic - they're also important for the health of our nation and its economy.\" \nThe medical director, who said he joined Pfizer to help improve people's lives, revealed they were now working on potential antiviral treatments, both intravenous and oral, for dealing with Covid-19. \n\"There are many exciting things to come, I am very optimistic about the future,\" he said."

      "text": "Victims of IRA bombs have expressed anger at news the UK government cannot use frozen Libyan assets for compensation.\nThe father of a 12-year-old boy killed in the 1993 Warrington bomb has also questioned the government's rejection of calls to publish a report commissioned to examine the issue. \nColin Parry's son Tim died in 1993 alongside three-year-old Jonathan Ball.\nLibyan-supplied Semtex explosive was thought to have been used. \nSpeaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mr Parry said the public \"may never know\" the reasons behind the government's refusal to compensate the victims of Libyan-backed terrorism. \n\"It's not as if it's a financial block - it's clearly a political decision,\" he said. \n\"It's a decision I can only imagine is based on the multi-layered complexity when it comes to historical issues related to Northern Ireland terrorism.\nThe government has said it would be against international law to use some \u00a312bn in frozen Libyan assets to compensate victims.\nOn Wednesday, it emerged that a report examining compensation options, completed last year by government investigator William Shawcross, will not be published. \nMr Parry asked why William Shawcross was given the remit to look into the issue \"if [the government] weren't prepared to act upon what he might say\".\n\"It's easily resolved through seized Libyan assets, but for reasons we may never know, the government is sitting on this report. I can only conclude that the government fears it will open up all sorts of matters which have been buried deep for some time now.\"\nMervyn Lewers, from Londonderry, who lost his legs following an under-car booby-trap bombing in 1988, said the government \"wants all victims to die off and go away\".\nHe said his life is \"a continuing battle\".\nHe told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme: \"It's 33 years since I was injured and I'm heading again to Musgrave Hospital today.\" \nCompensation would have \"meant a lot\", he said, as he has to pay someone to assist with \"ordinary things around the house\". \nFormer Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's regime supplied large amounts of weapons and explosives to the IRA during the Troubles.\nMr Lewers questioned why William Shawcross, who was appointed by the government to look into the issue of compensation, met representatives of Sinn F\u00e9in, but not victims, before filing his report.\n\"It's public knowledge that members of Sinn F\u00e9in were convicted terrorists. For me, it's wrong.\"\nMr Shawcross, who appeared before the NI Affairs Committee on Wednesday, said he could not disclose details of his own report. \nIn a written statement to parliament on Tuesday, Minister for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly said the \"internal scoping report\" was commissioned to provide advice to ministers and draws on \"private and confidential conversations\". \nHe said the \"frozen assets may not be seized by the UK government\".\nHe also ruled out using public funds to pay compensation to victims and then recouping the money from the Libyan government.\nHe said the responsibility for providing compensation lies with the Libyan state and the government had urged the authorities at the \"highest level\" to engage with UK victims.\nUnionist peer Lord Empey described the refusal to use the assets to compensate victims as \"a very murky business\".\n\"Other countries - the United States, France and Germany - all of them have got compensation for their victims. The United Kingdom hasn't even asked for it. So there's something wrong.\"\nKenny Donaldson, of Innocent Victims United, said: \"For two years the UK government has been responsible for heaping further pain upon those already treated so shamefully. \n\"The Shawcross Report can't even be described as a 'whitewash' because it continues to be held back from victims, the full contents remain hidden.\""

      "text": "The father of a five-month-old boy killed when a van mounted the pavement and hit his pram said it was \"quite miraculous\" his wife survived.\nRachael Thorold, 36, was walking with her son Louis by the A10 in Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, on 22 January when they were hit.\nLouis died at the scene and his mother was left with serious injuries.\nChris Thorold said when he arrived at hospital, staff treating his wife \"prepared me for the worst\".\nHe added: \"I don't think they expected her to survive the first 72 hours to be perfectly honest. That's hard. I gave myself a bit of a talking to and said, 'you've got to be strong here'.\n\"The fact that Rachael has survived is quite miraculous, but I guess Louis, being a little guy, just wasn't strong enough.\"\nHe said he was \"prepared for everything\", adding: \"It sounds a bit sad but if she had not made it I kind of thought 'well at least she's with Louis'.\n\"Maybe there's not much solace in that and clearly, selfishly, I wanted her to survive, but I also made a little bit of peace that if things don't go well for her then at least she's with our little one.\"\nMr Thorold said he \"can't do enough\" to thank those involved in his wife's care.\nShe has been discharged from intensive care and was \"exceeding all expectations\", he said, adding she could now sit awake and talk to him.\n\"Clearly she has lots to do - a couple of weeks ago she didn't know what day of the week it was but now she does,\" he said.\nHe added that he hoped she would be out of hospital in the next four to six weeks.\nMr Thorold said: \"It's been hard but she's just an incredible woman and, given what's happened to her and Louis, her motivation and her strength is quite admirable.\"\nLouis was born in August and Mr Thorold said he \"felt so grateful we had him\".\n\"Him and Rachael were just inseparable, never spent a moment apart,\" he said.\n\"I couldn't have asked for a happier five-and-a-half months and a more beautiful little boy - smiley, happy, always giggling away.\"\nMr Thorold said he tried to delay Louis's funeral for as long as possible \"to see if Rachael was going to get better and there was any chance she could come\".\nHe said it became apparent in early February that was not a realistic prospect, and said they \"gave him a lovely funeral\", with support from the \"fantastic\" local community.\n\"His funeral, without a doubt, was the hardest day I've ever encountered. Let's just hope he's gone to a better place,\" said Mr Thorold.\nHe set up the Louis Thorold Foundation with the aim of eliminating infant pedestrian deaths, and called for immediate improvements at the junction of the A10 and Car Dyke Road.\nMr Thorold said: \"I don't know if there's a textbook on how to grieve. I guess my way of dealing with it is, yes it's sad but his life needs to mean something. \n\"With his plight and what he's been through, hopefully we can do something with it and prevent this happening to anyone else.\"\nHe said there were \"way too many stories of little ones not making it home and all of it is preventable\".\n\"The technology, systems, and approaches to prevent every single one of these deaths exists.\n\"I think if we can prevent one more child dying on the roads in Britain... then Louis has done something good for his friends.\"\nMr Thorold has met with Cambridgeshire County Council and it said it had brought forward a route safety study of the A10 and was working to start the construction of a path for walkers and cyclists.\nCambridgeshire Police said an investigation was ongoing.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "Belarus has been disqualified from the Eurovision Song Contest for twice fielding songs deemed to have broken the rules of the competition.\nThe country was told to submit a new song two weeks ago over concerns their entry had a political subtext.\nBut the re-submission, by the same group, has now also been deemed inappropriate by contest organisers.  \nThe band, Galasy ZMesta, is known for mocking anti-government protests.\nLarge-scale demonstrations took place across Belarus last year after Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory in a disputed presidential election. \nI Will Teach You, a song by Galasy ZMesta, featured lyrics such as \"I will teach you to toe the line\", prompting a backlash from opposition figures. \nMany worried that allowing such a song would legitimise Mr Lukashenko's violent suppression of protesters.\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the organisers of Eurovision, agreed the lyrics were inappropriate and ordered that Belarus re-submit their entry if they wanted to take part in May.\nMr Lukashenko weighed in on the controversy himself. \n\"They are starting to press us on all fronts. Even at Eurovision, I see,\" he said. \n\"We'll make another song,\" he added. \"You see that this is all politicised.\"\nBelarus went back to the drawing board, but their re-submission has now also been rejected.\nIn a statement, the EBU said it had \"carefully scrutinised the new entry to assess its eligibility to compete.\"\nHowever, \"it was concluded that the new submission was also in breach of the rules of the competition that ensure the Contest is not instrumentalised or brought into disrepute\".\n\"Regrettably, Belarus will not be participating in the 65th Eurovision Song Contest in May,\" it added.\nThe disputed election in August led to a political crisis in Belarus.\nThe main opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, said she had attracted between 60 and 70% of the vote but was forced into exile in neighbouring Lithuania immediately after the vote.\nMr Lukashenko, who has ruled the country for 26 years, refused to resign.  \nThe EU and the US government agree with the opposition that the August election was rigged.\nMr Lukashenko ignored repeated opposition calls for negotiations to re-run the election under free and fair conditions, to end police brutality and release political prisoners.\nThousands of demonstrators were arrested.

      "tags": "Xinjiang,China,Religion,Uighurs",
      "text": "China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang.\nHuman rights groups believe China has detained more than one million Uyghurs against their will over the past few years in a large network of what the state calls \"re-education camps\", and sentenced hundreds of thousands to prison terms.\nThere is also evidence that Uyghurs are being used as forced labour and of women being forcibly sterilised. Some former camp detainees have also alleged they were tortured and sexually abused.\nThe US is among several countries to have accused China of committing genocide in Xinjiang. The leading human rights groups Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have published reports accusing China of crimes against humanity.\nChina denies all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, claiming its system of \"re-education\" camps are there to combat separatism and Islamist militancy in the region.\nThere are about 12 million Uyghurs, mostly Muslim, living in Xinjiang, which is officially known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).\nThe Uyghurs speak their own language, which is similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. They make up less than half of the Xinjiang population.\nRecent decades have seen a mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) into Xinjiang, allegedly orchestrated by the state to dilute the minority population there.\nChina has also been accused of targeting Muslim religious figures and banning religious practices in the region, as well as destroying mosques and tombs.\nUyghur activists say they fear that the group's culture is under threat of erasure.\nMore on this story\nXinjiang lies in the north-west of China and is the country's largest region. Like Tibet, it is autonomous, meaning - in theory - it has some powers of self-governance. But in practice, both regions are subjected to major restrictions by the central government.\nXinjiang is a mostly desert region and produces about a fifth of the world's cotton. Human rights groups have voiced concerns that much of that cotton export is picked by forced labour, and in 2021 some Western brands removed Xinjiang cotton from their supply chains, leading to a backlash against the brands from Chinese celebrities and netizens.\nIn December 2020, research seen by the BBC showed that up to half a million people were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang. There is evidence that new factories have been built within the grounds of the re-education camps.  \nThe region is also rich in oil and natural gas and because of its proximity to Central Asia and Europe is seen by Beijing as an important trade link.\nIn the early 20th Century, the Uyghurs briefly declared independence for the region but it was brought under the complete control of China's new Communist government in 1949.\nSeveral countries, including the US, Canada and the Netherlands, have accused China of committing genocide - defined by international convention as the \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\".\nThe declarations follow reports that, as well as interning Uyghurs in camps, China has been forcibly mass sterilising Uyghur women to suppress the population, separating children from their families, and attempting to break the cultural traditions of the group.\nThe US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has said China is committing \"genocide and crimes against humanity\".\nThe UK Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, has said the treatment of Uyghurs amounts to \"appalling violations of the most basic human rights\", and the UK parliament declared in April 2021 that China was committing a genocide in Xinjiang.\nA UN human rights committee in 2018 said it had credible reports that China was holding up to a million people in \"counter-extremism centres\" in Xinjiang.\nThe Australian Strategic Policy Institute found evidence in 2020 of more than 380 of these \"re-education camps\" in Xinjiang, an increase of 40% on previous estimates.\nEarlier, leaked documents known as the China Cables made clear that the camps were intended to be run as high security prisons, with strict discipline and punishments.\nPeople who have managed to escape the camps have reported physical, mental and sexual torture. Women have spoken of mass rape and sexual abuse.\nAnti-Han and separatist sentiment rose in Xinjiang from the 1990s, sometimes flaring into violence. In 2009 about 200 people died in clashes in Xinjiang, which the Chinese blamed on Uyghurs who wanted their own state. But in recent years a massive security crackdown has crushed dissent.\nXinjiang is now covered by a pervasive network of surveillance, including police, checkpoints, and cameras that scan everything from number plates to individual faces. According to Human Rights Watch, police are also using a mobile app to monitor people's behaviour, such as how much electricity they are using and how often they use their front door. \nSince 2017, when President Xi Jinping issued an order saying all religions in China should be Chinese in orientation, there have been further crackdowns. Campaigners say China is trying to eradicate Uyghur culture.\nChina denies all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. It said it 2019 that it had released everyone from its \"re-education\" camp system, though testimony from the region suggests many are still detained and many were transferred from camps to formal prisons.\nChina says the crackdown in Xinjiang is necessary to prevent terrorism and root out Islamist extremism and the camps are an effective tool for re-educating inmates in its fight against terrorism.  \nIt insists that Uyghur militants are waging a violent campaign for an independent state by plotting bombings, sabotage and civic unrest, but it is accused of exaggerating the threat in order to justify repression of the Uyghurs.\nChina has dismissed claims it is trying to reduce the Uyghur population through mass sterilisations as \"baseless\", and says allegations of forced labour are \"completely fabricated\".

      "text": "More than 700,000 people in Northern Ireland have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. \nIt means that nearly half the adult population - 703,334 people - has received at least one jab.\nOfficial figures showed 104,907 people have now received a second dose. \nNo further coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, which means the total number of deaths remains at 2,107.\nThe executive has agreed to introduce \"managed isolation\" for those arriving into NI from certain countries once international flights resume.\nTravellers from so-called \"red list\" countries will have to quarantine in a pre-booked hotel for 10 days, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said.\nPassengers must also complete a pre-departure Covid test and undertake two tests after arrival. \nIt comes after the health minister said foreign travel in the summer should be ruled out.\nThe red list is part of travel regulations aimed at stopping Covid variants entering the UK. \nMs O'Neill and First Minister Arlene Foster were speaking at a joint press conference in Dungannon, County Tyrone, on Thursday.  \nThey revealed the 'R' number, which measures how fast the virus is spreading, is now estimated to be between 0.75 and 0.95. \nThere are currently no direct international flights arriving in Northern Ireland, but passengers can travel from abroad through Dublin and airports in the UK. \nFrom this week, anyone who travels into the Republic of Ireland from from a red list country must now complete a mandatory 14-day quarantine period in a hotel there.\nThe Irish Department of Health said people travelling the Republic of Ireland via Northern Ireland who have been in or through a red list country in the previous 14 days must make their own way to a pre-booked quarantine hotel within four hours.\nEarlier, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said there were ongoing discussions between the Stormont Executive office, and the governments in Dublin and London to ensure there was alignment in terms of travel arrangements for people flying into airports in the Republic of Ireland and the UK. \nDr McBride said co-operation on the issue was \"good\" and progress was being made. \nMs O'Neill said there were too many uncertainties to give assurances over travel. \n\"It's important that we work across these islands in relation to travel,\" Ms O'Neill said. \nMrs Foster said it was too soon to be able to say when people would be able to travel abroad, noting the government's global travel taskforce is not due to report until April.\nThe taskforce is considering a tiered or traffic light system for international travel.\n\"It's perhaps too soon to be booking your holidays, but it is also too soon to be ruling them out,\" Mrs Foster said. \nBrian Ambrose, chief executive of Belfast City Airport, said \"ministers and senior civil servants must carefully consider the severe economic consequences of their public comments\".\n\"As an airport we would never challenge decisions made by the health minister in relation to the running of the health service,\" he said. \u00a0\"However, we would expect decisions on international air travel to emanate from the NI Executive, rather than the health minister or an advisor.\"\nThe executive also agreed the limited reopening of Sure Start and Youth Services programmes. \nPayments will also be extended under two business support schemes - the Covid Restrictions Business Support Scheme (CRBSS), Part A and Part B, and the Large Hospitality and Tourism Business Support Scheme (LHTBSS) will continue beyond 31 March.\nA virologist at Queen's University has also raised concerns about foreign travel in the coming months. \nProfessor Ultan Power told Good Morning Ulster that at least 80% of the population of Northern Ireland should have two doses of a coronavirus vaccine before travel to Europe is allowed again. \nHe said: \"If we have mass foreign travel we run the risk of picking up new variants that may not be covered by the vaccine and that could being us back to a pretty bad place.\"\nHe urged caution, and said it would be a shame if the success of the vaccination rollout in Northern Ireland \"came to naught\" if a vaccine-resistant strain was brought back here because of travel abroad. \n\"We can't lose sight of the fact the virus isn't going away\", he added."

      "tags": "Ursula von der Leyen,Coronavirus vaccines,Emmanuel Macron,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "European Union leaders have stopped short of banning vaccine exports after a protracted row with the Anglo-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca.\nAt a summit on Thursday they gave backing in principle for toughening export controls.\nBut a post-summit statement emphasised the importance of global supply chains needed to produce vaccinations. \nElements of the AstraZeneca vaccination are manufactured in a number of EU states.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said AstraZeneca must \"catch up\" on deliveries to the EU before exporting doses elsewhere. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told reporters this marked \"the end of naivety\" from the EU.\nVaccine rollouts in EU states have started sluggishly, and the bloc has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering promised doses. AstraZeneca has denied that it is failing to honour its contract.\nThe EU is expecting to receive about 30 million AstraZeneca doses by the end of March, less than a third of what it was hoping for. \n\"I think it is clear that first of all the company has to catch up,\" Mrs von der Leyen told a news conference after the virtual leaders' summit.\n\"[It] has to honour the contract it has with European member states before it can engage again in exporting vaccines,\" she said. \"We want to explain to our European citizens that they [can] get their fair share.\"\nThe EU was accused, primarily by the UK and the World Health Organization (WHO), of so-called vaccine nationalism after it introduced export controls on jabs produced within the bloc.\nIn response, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that \"blockades\" were not \"sensible\".\nHe said a ban would imperil the UK's vaccination drive, which has so far been more successful than EU member states' vaccine programmes.\nMr Johnson also warned that a ban that extended beyond AstraZeneca's disputed supply could also block jabs produced for BioNTech/Pfizer in Belgium. \nFrance's foreign minister said on Friday that the EU \"shouldn't be paying the price\" for the UK's vaccination policy.\n\"One can't play with blackmail, having given a lot of first jabs and then run into problems with the second,\" Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Info radio.\nMrs von der Leyen said on Thursday that EU was the \"region that exports most vaccines worldwide\" and invited other countries to \"match our openness\". \nHer comments came a day after the EU issued a joint statement with the UK in which both sides pledged to work together after weeks of tensions over the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nMeanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron backed the EU's export controls. \n\"I support the fact that we must block all exports for as long as some drug companies don't respect their commitments with Europeans,\" he said.\nEarlier, he expressed frustration at the slow pace of much of Europe's vaccine rollout. \"We didn't shoot for the stars,\" he told the Greek television channel ERT before the summit. \"We were wrong to lack ambition.\"\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said while his fellow leaders had found the Commission's tougher export measures \"acceptable\", he hoped they would never be used - a message echoed by his Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo.\nBoth those two countries are home to factories involved in the production of the AstraZeneca shot, which it's suggested may soon be sending increased supplies to European nations - a move that may assuage some EU anger, BBC Brussels correspondent Nick Beake reports.\nMr Rutte said an agreement with the UK over AstraZeneca components produced in the Netherlands could be announced this weekend.\nFollowing the virtual summit, the EU's 27 member states agreed to try and ramp up the production of vaccines within the bloc.\n\"Accelerating the production, delivery and deployment of vaccines remains essential and urgent to overcome the crisis. Efforts to this end must be further intensified,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\"We underline the importance of transparency as well as of the use of export authorisations,\" they added.\nThe EU also called on vaccine manufacturers to \"ensure predictability of their vaccine production and respect contractual delivery deadlines\".\nUS President Joe Biden also attended the virtual meeting, in an effort to repair ties with the EU after the strained relationship between the bloc and his predecessor, Donald Trump.\nAhead of Thursday's meeting, a former president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, urged the bloc to avoid a \"stupid vaccine war\" with the UK.\n\"We are not in war, and we are not enemies,\" he told the BBC's Hardtalk programme.\nHe added that threats of export bans could cause \"major reputational damage\" to the EU.\nA third wave of infections is sweeping across much of mainland Europe.\nEU states have seen some of the deadliest outbreaks of the pandemic, with Italy recording more than 106,000 deaths, France 93,000, Germany 75,000 and Spain 73,000.\nYet recent figures show just 12.9 doses of vaccine have been administered per 100 people in the EU compared with 44.7 in the UK and 37.2 in the US.\nSpeaking earlier this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the British variant had become the dominant strain circulating in Germany and amounted to \"a new pandemic\".\n\"The situation is serious,\" she said. \"Case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive care beds are filling up again.\"\nLockdowns have been re-imposed or extended in countries like Belgium or the Netherlands but there is particular concern over eastern EU states.\nPoland will close nurseries, pre-schools and hairdressers for two weeks from Saturday after coronavirus cases surged."
