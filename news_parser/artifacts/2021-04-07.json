      "title": "Covid: How does the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine work?",
      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts.\nThe UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that \"adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nData from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. \nBased on the current data, the following is advised:\nThe MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April.\nThe MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate.\nAnd the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. \nIts head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was \"firming up\", more evidence would be needed. \nThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\".\nThe MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nPlatelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\nAmong these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT).\nCVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. \nAs a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke.  \nThe clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. \nThe MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice:\nCovid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clotting should be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect.\nAfter a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link.\nNevertheless, Denmark has stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - and Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. \nFrance is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, while Australia says people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness.\nOnce injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus.\nExperts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. \nThe government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is \"plenty of evidence\" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant which is dominant in the UK.\nThere is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. \nHowever a study of around 2,000 people suggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease."

      "text": "Identical clothing was sold at different prices across Boohoo's brands due to a \"genuine mistake and not business practice\", the retailer says.\nThe same coat was sold by Dorothy Perkins at \u00a355 and Coast at \u00a389 and the Coast item had the brand name cut off.\nJoanna Sikora ordered a skirt from Karen Millen and found it had an Oasis label with that branding crossed out. \nBoohoo said it had not realised its companies had bought the same items and branded and priced them differently.\nIt comes as the BBC was sent further examples of coats on the Oasis and Coast websites at different prices.\nJess, who asked us not to use her last name, spotted the khaki coats pictured, which have since been removed from both sites.\nShe said: \"You buy a brand in good faith that what you are getting is exclusive to the company. I initially assumed that the previous instances were a slight mix up, however after finding these myself I now realise that this is common practice in Boohoo. It doesn't speak well for the company if fooling the customer is their main method for turning a profit.\"\nBoohoo said these coats were part of an issue that arose when the coronavirus pandemic hit.\nThe closure of non-essential stores to stop the spread of Covid saw thousands of High Street fashion chains shut their shops for good.\nBoohoo bought up the online businesses of some of the fashion brands that went into administration.\nMost recently, it bought Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton from Arcadia. It acquired Karen Millen and Coast in August 2019.\nRetailers that were forced to close their doors cancelled their orders with suppliers, a statement from Boohoo said.\nThese suppliers then offered products they had already made for sale to other retailers that were still trading, it said.\nSome of Boohoo's brands bought some of this excess stock to fill gaps in their ranges as clothing stock began to run down.\n\"Our mistake was not realising that some of our brands had purchased the same items from suppliers,\" the statement said.\n\"Therefore we failed to make sure prices were the same across our group of brands.\"\nBoohoo said the problem affected \"about 10 lines out of thousands\", it was confident the issue was fixed and has apologised to customers.\nIt is not an offence for different retailers to sell the same item at different prices even if they are owned by the same company.\nBut \"it could be misleading if consumers think they are buying a particular brand, when this is not the case,\" said Sylvia Rook, a lead officer from the Chartered Trading Standards institute.\n\"Consumers may expect that items from one retail outlet are superior to another, and therefore be willing to pay a premium for this,\" she said.\nA trader could be in breach of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 if an advert misleads consumers and causes them, either to make a purchase they would not have made, or to pay a higher price,\" she explained.\nOli Townsend, assistant deals and features editor at MoneySavingExpert.com said irregular pricing was not unique to one group.\nIn 2019, an MSE investigation found shoppers were paying up to 34% more for the exact same item at Littlewoods compared to Very - even though both are owned by the same company.\nMr Townsend said: \"There's a question of ethics when there's such a price disparity between retailers under the same parent company - especially when in some cases they may share the same warehouse, courier and returns department.\n\"These brands risk their customers feeling ripped off and losing trust in that brand.\"\nHe said MSE encouraged shoppers to do price comparisons online to make sure they were getting the best deal. \n\"But if some retailers are cutting off or obscuring the original brand name, it makes this difficult and puts consumers at a disadvantage,\" he said.\nAdam French, Which? consumer rights expert, said customers would \"understandably see this practice as dishonest\". \nHe said: \"Companies who switch items between brands for different prices and cover up or remove the previous label risk losing consumer trust.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Pfizer,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Jair Bolsonaro,Brazil,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Brazil has recorded more than 4,000 Covid-related deaths in 24 hours for the first time, as a more contagious variant fuels a surge in cases.\nHospitals are overcrowded, with people dying as they wait for treatment in some cities, and the health system is on the brink of collapse in many areas. \nThe country's total death toll is now almost 337,000, second only to the US.\nBut President Jair Bolsonaro continues to oppose any lockdown measures to curb the outbreak.\nHe argues that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the virus itself, and has tried to reverse some of the restrictions imposed by local authorities in the courts. \nSpeaking to supporters outside the presidential residence on Tuesday, he criticised quarantine measures and suggested without evidence that they were linked to obesity and depression. He did not comment on the 4,195 deaths recorded in the previous 24 hours.\nTo date, Brazil has recorded more than 13 million cases of coronavirus, according to the health ministry. Some 66,570 people died with Covid-19 in March, more than double the previous monthly record.\n\"Brazil now... is a threat to the entire effort of the international community to control the pandemic,\" Dr Miguel Nicolelis, who has been closely tracking cases in the country, told the BBC.\n\"If Brazil is not under control, then the planet is not going to be safe, because we are brewing new variants every week... and they are going to cross borders,\" he said.\nIn most states, patients with Covid-19 are occupying more than 90% of intensive care unit beds, according to the health institute Fiocruz (in Portuguese).\nSeveral states have reported short supplies of oxygen and sedatives. But despite the critical situation, some cities and states are already easing measures limiting the movement of people.\n\"The fact is the anti-lockdown narrative of President Jair Bolsonaro has won,\" Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil's Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials, told the Associated Press.\n\"Mayors and governors are politically prohibited from beefing up social distancing policies because they know supporters of the president, including business leaders, will sabotage them,\" he said.\nThe far-right president - who has played down the virus, raised doubts about vaccines and defended unproven drugs as treatment - has seen his popularity plummet amid heavy criticism of his handling of the crisis.\nHe has shifted his tone on immunisations recently, pledging to make 2021 the year of vaccinations. But the country has struggled with the rollout of its programme.\nCritics say his government was slow in negotiating supplies. Only around 8% of the population has been given at least one dose, according to the Our World in Data tracker.\nEpidemiologist Ethel Maciel said Brazil was in a \"dreadful situation\", telling AFP news agency: \"At the rate we're vaccinating... the only way to slow the extremely fast spread of the virus is an effective lockdown for at least 20 days.\"\nFiocruz says it has detected 92 variants of coronavirus in the country, including the P.1, or Brazil variant, which has become a cause for concern because it is thought to be much more contagious.\nIt is thought to have emerged in Amazonas state in November 2020, spreading quickly in the state capital Manaus, where it accounted for 73% of cases by January 2021, according to figures analysed by researchers in Brazil.\nExperts fear the proliferation of the Brazil variant will mean increasing cases for several months. \nDr Nicolelis, who until recently was the co-ordinator of the pandemic response team in north-eastern Brazil, told the BBC that the country's response amounted to a \"complete calamity\".\n\"It's the largest human tragedy in Brazilian history,\" he said.\n\"We may get to 500,000 deaths by 1 July, that's the latest estimate,\" he said. \"But the University of Washington released an estimate on Friday suggesting that if the rate of transmission goes up by about 10%, we could get to 600,000 deaths.\"\nThe Brazil variant has also been linked to a spike in infections and deaths in a number of South American countries.

      "text": "The Welsh Liberal Democrats promised to spend \u00a31bn a year on tackling the \"climate emergency\",  as they launched their Senedd election campaign.\nSpeaking at the event, the party's leader Jane Dodds said the Lib Dems are the \"only party\" that would \"put recovery first\".\nThe Liberal Democrats head into the election having held one seat in the Senedd since 2016.\nPolling day is on 6 May.\nThe Liberal Democrats are the last of the main parties to launch their election campaign.\nAt the event in Cardiff, Ms Dodds outlined some of the party's main policies.\nThey include:\nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat elections are happening? On 6 May, people across Wales will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party or parties that can command the support of a majority of members will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Welsh Parliament have? MSs pass laws on many aspects of day-to-day life in Wales, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes. Defence, foreign policy and immigration are decided by the UK Parliament.\nHow do I vote? Anyone who lives in Wales and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You can register to vote online.\nMs Dodds said: \"The past year has been tough, life as we know it has changed, but I know Wales is a resilient country and we have the chance to build a better future for our children and our children's children.\n\"The Welsh Liberal Democrats are the only party pledging to put recovery first. \n\"We will secure our economic recovery, an environmental recovery and a recovery for our mental health services.\n\"The next Welsh government will face a huge challenge in the problems that already existed in our country and which have been made worse as a result of Covid.\u00a0\n\"With ambitious and fully achievable policies ranging from building 30,000 new homes, to investing in our high streets, and freezing the business rates which cripple so many small and medium sized firms, the Welsh Liberal Democrats are presenting radical yet realistic options for Wales' future.\u00a0\n\"Wales cannot afford for any party or any government to put anything other than our recovery first.\"\nThe promise to spend \u00a31bn a year on the \"climate emergency\" meets a call made by the Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe.\nThe Welsh Government's annual budget is about \u00a318bn.\nAsked how the party would fund its pledge, Ms Dodds said: \"We're not going to cut anything\".\nShe explained that the party would use money that is currently used \"in a different way\".\n\"We also want to be able to access private funding and entrepreneurship in order to make sure that we've got the infrastructure there to put the climate at the heart of everything we do.\n\"We have a well-costed, very clear-funded way of doing that,\" Ms Dodds added.\nChallenged on her claim that the Liberal Democrats are the only party that would prioritise post-pandemic recovery, Ms Dodds said: \"I don't think there's any other party that has as it's headline, 'put recovery first'.\n\"That is our very clear message right now in the middle of this pandemic.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats are defending one seat at this election.\nThat was held by Kirsty Williams who has served as education minister in the Labour-led Welsh government since 2016.\nMs Williams is standing down at this election. \nThis is a big election for the Liberal Democrats, who are fighting to maintain a presence in the Senedd.\nThey say the achievements of their single retiring Senedd member, Kirsty Williams, who has been education minister in the Labour government, prove that holding even one seat can still make a difference. \nThe big question is whether that argument will convince their supporters to transfer their allegiance to Ms Williams' successor.\nThis may be a national campaign launch, but the battle for the Lib Dems will be intensely local."

      "tags": "Aung San Suu Kyi,Myanmar coup ,Myanmar",
      "text": "Myanmar's ex-ambassador in London spent Wednesday night in his car after saying he was locked out of his embassy.\nKyaw Zwar Minn said staff were asked to leave the building by Myanmar's military attach\u00e9, and he was dismissed as the country's representative.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has condemned the \"bullying actions,\" but the UK has accepted the change.\nMyanmar's military seized power in a coup on 1 February, sparking protests and escalating violence.\nKyaw Zwar Minn has criticised the military coup, and called for Myanmar's ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi to be released.\nAbout 600 people - including dozens of children - have been killed so far as pro-democracy protesters demand a return to power of elected leader Ms Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) party.\nThrough a spokesman out the front of the embassy on Thursday morning, Kyaw Zwar Minn urged the UK government not to recognise the military junta's newly appointed ambassador, and to send them back to Myanmar.\n\"There was a coup in Myanmar in February. Now there is the same situation in central London,\" he said, adding embassy staff were being threatened with \"severe punishment if they don't continue to work for the military general\".\nPolice were reportedly called to stop staff re-entering the building. Protesters gathered outside after news spread that the ambassador had been locked out. \nAccording to the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, an ambassador's job officially ends once the host country has been informed.\nThe Foreign Office confirmed it received the notification, and that it \"must accept the decision taken by the Myanmar regime\".\nDeputy ambassador Chit Win is said to have taken over as charg\u00e9 d'affaires in London, Reuters reported, citing diplomats with knowledge of the matter. However, the Foreign Office said it has \"received no formal notification of his replacement\".\nA charg\u00e9 d'affaires serves as the head of a diplomatic mission in the absence of an ambassador. \nIn March, Kyaw Zwar Minn called for the release of Ms Suu Kyi and told the BBC that Myanmar was \"divided\" and could be at risk of civil war. \nHe maintained that his remarks were not \"betraying the country\", adding that he was standing on \"middle\" ground. In response, the Myanmar government issued a statement saying he had been summoned home, but he stayed in London.\n\"He's trying to work in the middle ground but there is no doubt which is the right side,\" the spokesman for Kyaw Zwar Minn said.\nDiplomacy has its rules. Most are set out in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. These are clear that governments choose who they want to represent them abroad. \nSo if the military regime in Myanmar wants to sack its ambassador in London, it can. Under Article 43 of the Convention, it simply has to notify the Foreign and Development Office formally that \"the function of the diplomatic agent has come to an end\". And that is what has happened here. The UK government has no choice but to accept that. \nThe foreign secretary can say as many supportive things as he likes about the ambassador but he can't get him back in his job. \nThis presents a dilemma for the government. By accepting the ambassador has been sacked, it will face accusations that it is tacitly accepting the authority of the regime in Myanmar. And this is something it does not want to do. So the question may turn to whether the UK will also recognise the now ex-ambassador as some kind of representative of the deposed administration. \nIt follows another day of deadly protests in Myanmar. In the northwest town of Taze, at least 11 anti-coup demonstrators were killed in clashes with security forces on Wednesday night. Local media are reporting the troops fired at protesters who fought back with hunting rifles and firebombs.\nMyanmar's military seized power on 1 February after overthrowing the government and declared a state of emergency.\nJust days later, a protest movement began to emerge, which quickly gained momentum, leading to hundreds of thousands of people taking part in street protests.\nA popular model and actor, Paing Takhon, was arrested as part of a growing crackdown on artists and actors. The 24-year-old was active in both online protests and in-person rallies, and has millions of fans in Myanmar and Thailand.\nLast week, Ms Suu Kyi was charged with breaking a colonial-era official secrets law, which carries a term of up to 14 years in prison. \n8 April: This story was updated after the UK Foreign Office amended the wording of its statement.

      "text": "The NI Policing Board chairman has called for a redoubling of efforts to calm loyalist tensions and for dialogue with police at all levels of the force.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster has condemned the recent loyalist violence, but has not spoken to Chief Constable Simon Byrne. \nMr Byrne briefed the Policing Board on Wednesday about the trouble over the Easter period in a private session.\nForty-one police officers have been hurt and 10 people arrested.\nThere were no reports of serious disorder on Tuesday night, but police maintained a presence in many areas. \nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Steve Aiken said the fact that Mrs Foster had not engaged with Mr Byrne in the wake of the violence was a mistake.\n\"I have issues with the chief constable because of past actions and decisions, but that should not be the cause for us to refuse to engage,\" Mr Aiken said. \n\"He is the head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and while he is in post, we should continue to work with him and all his officers.\"\nFollowing the Policing Board meeting, chair Doug Garrett said members were unanimous in their condemnation of the recent disorder.\n\"At this time, there must be a redoubling of efforts to calm tensions and for continued dialogue between the community and police officers at all levels of the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland),\" Mr Garrett said. \n\"Nothing is achieved without talking, and leadership is needed from all those with influence so that any concerns can be addressed through the democratic structures in place; and through the board mechanisms for policing oversight and accountability.\"\nSome have linked the violence in parts of greater Belfast and Londonderry in recent days to the decision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) not to prosecute anyone who attended the funeral of former IRA man Bobby Storey in June 2020.\nIt was attended by 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid restrictions were in place. \nHer Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) is to examine the PSNI's role in the funeral, after being called in by Justice Minister Naomi Long at the request of the Policing Board. \nThe Policing Board meeting was an opportunity in private session - it lasted about 90 minutes - for the chief constable to update the 19-member board on the events of the last number of days. \nIt was a factual analysis. He pointed out that 41 officers had been injured in a range of violent incidents. \nThis was not a re-examination or a questioning of policing around the Bobby Storey funeral, although I'm told that some members did express support for the chief constable, while others obviously didn't.\nBoard chairman Doug Garrett said afterwards that members were unanimous in condemnation of the violence. \nHe did say that there must be a redoubling of efforts to calm tensions and that nothing is achieved without talking.\nThat will be seen, certainly in some quarters, as implied criticism of Arlene Foster's position in terms of not talking to the chief constable. \nMrs Long has asked it to complete the inspection \"by no later than May 14\". Last week, Mr Byrne expressed surprise at the conclusion by the PPS. \nMr Garrett told BBC's Evening Extra programme that it was \"not an ideal position\" for senior politicians and police not to talk. \nMrs Foster earlier reiterated her calls for the chief constable to step down. \nThe leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), UUP, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) and Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) have said Mr Byrne's position is untenable over the PSNI's handling of the funeral.\nOn Wednesday, Jonathan Powell, the former adviser to Tony Blair at the time of the Good Friday Agreement, said politics has got \"quite hot\" again in Northern Ireland and people are \"playing with matches\".\n\"Politicians trying to second guess the police when they're making operational decisions is really a mistake and I hope that the first minister will back off on this and allow the police to proceed with their job,\" Mr Powell said. \nIt was view shared by former NI Secretary Shaun Woodward, who said it was \"potentially a dangerous situation\".\n\"There's a moment here, where, to borrow Jonathan Powell's words, you need to state your position but now back off,\" he said. \n\"Continuing to needle this particular thing will undo much greater issues of community policing in Northern Ireland.\"\nMrs Foster said she had a duty to speak out about the PSNI's failure to uphold Covid restrictions during Bobby Storey's funeral.\n\"The police, of course, have my full support,\" Mrs Foster told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, but added that ordinary police officers had been let down by their senior management. \nMrs Foster said Mr Byrne had not asked to meet her and she had not asked to meet him.\n\"I have spoken to him [Simon Byrne] on many occasions and told him that the differential treatment for Sinn F\u00e9in has to stop,\" Mrs Foster said. \n\"He has been warned about it on a number of occasions. However, it continues to happen. That sort of specialised treatment for a political elite is very, very damaging.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in's John O'Dowd said at a time when the police were \"under nightly attack\" from loyalists, it would be \"helpful and send out the right signals\" if the first minister would agree to meet the chief constable, along with the deputy first minister.\nMr O'Dowd said such a meeting would \"show unity of purpose across the board, across the political spectrum\".\nHe said it would \"ensure that those who are orchestrating this violence, those who are putting petrol bombs into the hands of 12-year-olds, get a very, very clear message that it's not acceptable\".\nDUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell told BBC's Talkback programme that he had no doubt that Mrs Foster will speak to the chief constable.\nHe said ongoing loyalist violence may be hampering unionist efforts to force Mr Byrne to resign.\nJustice Minister Naomi Long told the Today programme that policing had been \"undoubtedly\" politicised at a difficult time.\"When any politician declares they have no confidence in the chief constable that is a very serious matter, and when that is the first minister of Northern Ireland, that becomes even more serious.\n\"It is incumbent on all of us in public life and those of us in positions of leadership not simply to declare whether or not we believe the chief constable has our confidence, but to work to ensure that he has the confidence of the public and of the community.\"\nThe disorder has also been linked to loyalist frustrations over the Northern Ireland Protocol in the Brexit deal.\nThe NI Protocol has increased checks and caused disruption for some goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, creating an Irish Sea border.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said politicians need to \"dial down\" the rhetoric around Brexit and policing.\n\"We can't use that kind of language, calling for people to resign, calling for protocols to be scrapped that are never going to be scrapped,\" he said.\"Eleven year olds with petrol bombs don't understand the intricacies of the trading relationship between Northern Ireland and Britain or Northern Ireland and the EU, but tension has been whipped up by politicians.\"\nShadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said the prime minister should be speaking out about the recent violence. \n\"The consequences of Brexit always had the potential to upset the very delicate balance of identities in Northern Ireland,\" she told BBC Radio Foyle.\"I don't think enough consideration was given to the consequences of the border down the Irish Sea.\"\nNI Secretary Brandon Lewis tweeted that he was being kept \"closely appraised\" of developments by the PSNI and that he was appalled that officers had been injured. \nMeanwhile, the HMIC review into the Bobby Storey policing operation will examine whether the PSNI's approach \"was within the parameters of national policing standards in the context of the Covid health protection regulations\", according to the Department of Justice. \nIt will also \"offer relevant learning\" to assist policing the regulations going forward."

      "tags": "Social media,Media,Television,Celebrity",
      "text": "As a member of one of the most famous and glamorous families on the planet, Khloe Kardashian is rarely pictured looking less than a million dollars.\nThe TV star and social media influencer and her team usually know how to produce the impossibly perfect image.\nSo after an unfiltered picture was shared to her social media \"by mistake\" they were keen to have it taken down.\nThey have asked social media platforms to remove it, although their efforts have spurred others to repost it.\nThe natural-looking family photo showed the 36-year-old by a pool in a bikini.\nThe star appeared unusually unairbrushed: more like an image you would see from your friend's lockdown lido swim session than from any of the Kardashians' previous personal campaign shots for their various brands.\nKardashian's team said this week the photo infringed her copyright.\n\"The color edited photo was taken of Khloe during a private family gathering and posted to social media without permission by mistake by an assistant,\" Tracy Romulus, chief marketing officer for KKW Brands, told Page Six.\n\"Khloe looks beautiful but it is within the right of the copyright owner to not want an image not intended to be published taken down.\"\nAccording to Twitter, the photo is subject to a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice. \n\"Per our copyright policy, we respond to valid copyright complaints sent to us by a copyright owner or their authorized representatives,\" a Twitter spokeswoman told BBC News on Wednesday.\nSome users who posted it found the picture had been replaced by a message saying: \"This image has been removed in response to a report from the copyright holder.\"\nIt also disappeared from Reddit, with a message saying it was \"removed in response to a copyright claim by a third party\".\nBut others reposted it, while media websites including Page Six also published it. \nElizabeth Ward, the boss of intellectual property lawyers Virtuoso Legal, said any attempts to remove the photo may only serve to draw more attention to it.\n\"Quite frankly they're trying to put the finger in the dike that's already broken,\" she told the BBC. \"If this is so widely spread they're never going to put the toothpaste back in the tube.\n\"What's quite interesting about it from a legal perspective is it doesn't actually say who was taking the photograph - it says she owns the copyright. The first owner of copyright is normally the photographer, so if I took a photo of Khloe Kardashian I own the copyright, so it would be my copyright to do as I wanted.\"\nSpeaking as a mum of a teenage daughter, Ms Ward said she felt it was \"so sad\" this was an issue at all, due to the widespread use of approved images online that appear to have been \"tampered with\" in some way.\n\"They're not natural, they're all photoshopped, and every teenage girl that you ask seems to know,\" she said. \"But it's in their face day in, day out, so it must have an effect on them - that unnatural, unrealistic sort of image.\"\nEric Schiffer, chairman the Los Angeles-based Reputation Management Consultants, agreed that the key was to never let what he called \"digital spill\" happen in the first place.\nBut once it has occurred, too much press attention, he said, \"can create an amplification that can [cause] tremendous heartache for a period of time\".\n\"Ultimately the law and the tools are on the side of a firm that is able to eviscerate any digital history, but not without some cycles, because the media can take a shot of it [and then] it becomes a public domain issue,\" Mr Schiffer added. \"And then the press is not likely to delete an image because it falls under fair use.\"\nThe issue of whether there was any problem with the image itself was down to how Khloe wished to be perceived, he added.\n\"Does she want to relate to fans on the most authentic level?\" he asked. \"Overall the brand is oriented that way, but she does have an aspect that is hyper glamorous and depending upon her own discretionary desires, this picture may just made bother her.\n\"I mean, there's a narcissistic element to these things and I suspect that this is one where it's just not the image she wants for a host of reasons.\"\nHe added: \"The last thing she wants is the media talking about the process that she's dealing with. But the public is fascinated by this.\""

      "text": "Forty-one police officers have been injured as a result of violence in Northern Ireland in recent days.\nOn Monday, petrol bombs were thrown in Carrickfergus, a car was set alight in Londonderry and nine officers were injured in disorder in Ballymena.\nPolice said the officers were injured after they tried to engage with people present at an un-notified parade.\nIn total, 10 arrests have been made across Northern Ireland during disorder over the past week.\nOn Tuesday, First Minister Arlene Foster urged young people not to get a criminal record by getting involved in violence. \nBut she also said confidence had gone in the senior management of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) over the decision by prosecutors not to charge anyone over the Bobby Storey funeral.  \n\"It is right that people speak out, but it is right that we say to those young people that two wrongs don't make a right,\" she said. \nMrs Foster said she had spoken to the chairman of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland to offer her support to rank-and-file officers. \n\"The chief constable needs to resign, and needs to resign quickly. Confidence is gone in his leadership, and confidence is gone in his senior management team.\"\nOn Tuesday evening, about 80 loyalist protesters took part in a peaceful demonstration at the Antiville roundabout in Larne, while police looked on. \nThe A8 was closed in both directions for a short time but has since reopened. There were reports of minor trouble in nearby Linn Road in the town.\nDuring the disturbances on Monday night, police said petrol bombs and masonry were thrown at officers \"as they worked to restore order in the areas\".\nA stretch of the M2 in Ballymena was also closed for a time after debris and bins were thrown onto it.\nIn Derry, a group of about 20 young people were involved in setting a car on fire in Sperrin Park, a seventh night out of eight in which there has been violence in the city. \nDetectives are also investigating parades in Portadown and Markethill on Monday.\nSocial media footage showed a number of masked men taking part in a loyalist band parade in the Jervis Street area of Portadown.\nThe police and political parties have repeatedly called for calm, with the disturbances blamed on loyalist frustrations over a PPS (Public Prosecution Service) decision not to prosecute people who attended the large-scale funeral of republican Bobby Storey in June 2020, as well as concerns about the NI Protocol in the Brexit deal.\nThe leaders of the DUP, UUP and TUV have called for Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign over the PSNI's handling of the funeral, which was attended by a number of senior Sinn F\u00e9in politicians, including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill.\nThe NI Protocol has increased checks and caused disruption for some goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nThere has been a concern that loyalist anger would eventually make its way onto the streets.\nYou could say the writing was on the wall - literally - since January and growing tension over the Irish Sea border.\nBut there is a melting pot of grievances, largely bottled up by lockdown.\nThis ranges from policing, to politics to societal problems.\nThe rioting was low-level, relatively scattered and localised - there is no sense of a broader, joined-up orchestration.\nAnd then there were incidents - unlawful marches - where there was no violence at all.\nIn short, no one reason sparked successive days of unrest.\nSeveral agendas are at play, including the South East Antrim UDA kicking back at the PSNI after a clampdown on its criminality.\nOnce on the streets, will things gather momentum?\nOr will a combination of police action against rioters and a de-escalation of tension and political rhetoric calm things down?   \nCh Supt Davy Beck said he believed there were a number of \"small disaffected groups that are linked to criminality that are involved in orchestrating and promoting this violence\".\nHe said while there were tensions across communities there was \"no justification for violence and attacks on police officers and members of public\".\n\"When our officers have arrived to deal with situations they are met with petrol bombs, debris, wheelie bins and that takes a degree of orchestration - which is evidence this is not spontaneous,\" he added.\nThe senior police officer said he did not want to see young people being criminalised.\n\"Not only did their reckless and criminal behaviour place the lives of our officers in danger, but such senseless behaviour shows the blatant disregard those responsible have for the safety of others by throwing debris onto a motorway. \n\"It is extremely fortunate no one was seriously injured, or worse.\"\nThe assembly is to be recalled on Thursday morning to discuss the violence.\nThe Alliance party secured the 30 signatures needed for the recall.\nLast week, the assembly was recalled early as MLAs debated a motion of censure against Sinn F\u00e9in politicians in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey.\nDuring the Easter weekend, officers were injured during violence in Belfast, Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus and Derry.\nThe Police Federation said some of those who were hurt had potentially \"career-impacting\" injuries.\nPolice said the officers injured in Ballymena on Monday were expected to be able to return to duty on Tuesday."

      "tags": "Cities,Climate change,Environment,Motoring",
      "text": "Drivers in crowded cities should think twice before buying a big SUV, says the head of a motoring organisation.\nSteve Gooding, from the RAC Foundation, said: \"We should all choose the right vehicle for the right trip to cut the size of our carbon footprint.\n\"It is right to question if suburban drivers need a car capable of ploughing over rivers, across fields and up steep hills just to pop to the shops.\"\nHis comments come as research confirms most SUVs are bought by urban drivers.\nIt shows that large SUVs - often known as Chelsea tractors - are indeed most prevalent in places such as Chelsea. \nThey are typically defined by their extreme size, and off-road features such as high ground clearance and four wheel drive.\nThey often face complaints from other road users about their bulk and their pollution - especially during the school run.\nThe report from the think-tank New Weather Institute said: \"The numbers stand up long-held suspicions that these vehicles ostensibly designed for off-road are actually marketed successfully to urban users where their big size and higher pollution levels are a worse problem.\" \nThe report says:\nThe report says areas where SUV owners dominate are also the places where road space is most scarce, and where the highest proportion of cars are parked on the street. It says many large SUVs are too big for a standard UK parking space.\nAndrew Simms, from the New Weather Institute, said: \"It turns out that the home of the 'Chelsea tractor' really is Chelsea. One of advertising's biggest manipulations has persuaded urban families that it's perfectly 'normal' to go shopping in a two-tonne truck. \n\"But the human health and climate damage done by SUVs is huge and needs to be undone. Just as tobacco advertising was successfully ended, it's time to stop promoting polluting SUV's.\"\nThe UK Citizens' Assembly on climate change has supported restrictions on SUVs. But motoring organisations said the analysis was too simplistic. \nWhile Mr Gooding supported the principle of making appropriate choices of vehicles, he told the BBC it was wrong to protest against medium sized cars that look like SUVs but don't clog the streets and are economical to run.\n\"The term SUV has become so broad as to be unhelpful,\" he said. \"(Some) motorists might just be seeking the comfort and convenience of relatively tall but still modestly-sized cars that come with the SUV badge but are economical to run.\n\"The popularity of the SUV body-style looks like it's going to be with us for some time as some auto companies have already released fully electric versions with more to come later this year.\"\nEdmund King, from the AA, told the BBC: \"Talk of banning the advertising of SUVs is a na\u00efve approach. Some of the cleanest cars come in the SUV shape but are all electric such as the Jaguar I-Pace, Tesla Model X or Hyundai Kona. \n\"The auto industry is developing a wide range of cleaner, greener vehicles with some of the best in SUV styles,\" he said. \"Not all SUVs are large. Small SUVs are among the most popular cars on sale, because they usually offer the high-set driving position, practicality, safety and looks of more traditional off-roaders, but without the high price, running costs or emissions.\"\nHe added: \"Cars like the Nissan Juke are often the family car of choice in suburban areas.\"\nThe report says advertisers have misled consumers by pushing messages around SUVs such as 'get back to nature' and 'help the environment'. \nThe authors have written to the advertising agency Spark44, which runs multiple SUV campaigns, asking them to outline how they plan to meet the UK government's climate change targets. \nThe agency says it can't supply a response because it hasn't had long enough to consider the report properly. \nA study by the International Energy Agency said increasing demand for SUVs is the second biggest contributor to the growth in carbon emissions.\nAnnual emissions from SUVs rose to more than 700 megatonnes of CO2, and if SUV drivers were a country, they would be the seventh in the world for carbon emissions.\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

The magazine alleged her family had inflated the value of her cosmetics business.\nForbes calculated that the 40-year-old's worth had risen to $1bn from $780m in October thanks especially to her stakes in the KKW Beauty cosmetics business and the Skims shapewear company.\nKKW Beauty was launched in 2017 and Skims just two years ago after the initial brand name Kimono was dropped following accusations of cultural appropriation.\nMs Kardashian West sold 20% of KKW Beauty to cosmetics giant Coty last year for $200m, in a deal valuing the business at $1bn.\nHer most recent project Skims offers underwear and loungewear in the founder's signature minimalist style, and has proven successful during the work-from-home era. \nThe celebrity has used her huge social media presence (213m followers on Instagram; 69.7m followers on Twitter) during the coronavirus lockdowns to promote Skims loungewear.\nShe first found fame in 2007 as the star of the E! Television reality series about her family, Keeping up with the Kardashians, and has remained hugely popular since.\nIn February she reportedly filed for divorce from rapper Kanye West after being married for almost seven years and having four children together."

This should set a precedent.\n\"We have a duty to ensure that access to enough nutritious food is a fundamental right for everyone in the UK, which is why, for the second time in a year, our committee urges the government to appoint a new minister specifically to address food security.\" \nA government spokesman responded that \"the recent pandemic has proven that the UK has a large, diverse and highly resilient food supply chain that has coped well in responding to unprecedented challenges - and we will review the recommendations set out within this report and respond accordingly\".\n\"Since March last year, we have spent more than \u00a3280bn to deliver an impressive package of economic and welfare support to protect and support the incomes and needs of families and children - and we continue to work closely with the food industry to ensure people across the country have the food and supplies they need,\" he added.

A way back to normality.\"\nJohn Sanders, from Carmarthenshire, was the fifth person to receive the jab. \nHe said: \"It's massively important. I'm a carer for my disabled son who's now 22. He's had brain cancer and various chemotherapies and he's got immune problems as well, so it's obviously important for us.\"\nThe UK is committed to buying 17 million doses of Moderna, the third of seven vaccines developed in the UK or around the world that it has put in orders for.\nIt has not been confirmed when the rest of the UK will start using the jab, but Scotland received its first batch on Monday. \nLike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs which are already in use, the Moderna jab is given in two doses, several weeks apart.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said he was delighted its UK rollout was starting. \n\"The UK government has secured vaccines on behalf of the entire nation and the vaccination programme has shown our country working together at its best,\" he said.\nWales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said a third vaccine for use in Wales \"significantly adds\" to the nation's defences against Covid-19.\nAcross the whole of the UK, more than 31.6 million people have now had a first dose of a Covid vaccine - while 5.4 million have been fully vaccinated.\nIn Wales, more than 1.49 million people have had a first dose, while more than 469,000 people have had both doses.\nBut the UK's Covid vaccine supplies are set to be delayed by \"up to four weeks\" in April and Wales expects to have 250,000 fewer Oxford-AstraZeneca doses.\nMr Scully told Sky News the vaccination programme remained on track to cover all adults in England by the end of July. \nOn Tuesday, the trial of the Oxford vaccine on children stopped giving out jabs as a precaution.\nThe Moderna vaccine is a two-dose jab given at an interval of between four and 12 weeks.\nLike Pfizer's, it is an RNA vaccine and works by injecting part of the virus's genetic code into the body, where it enters cells and tells them to create antigens.\nThese antigens are recognised by the immune system and prepare it to fight coronavirus.\nNo actual virus is needed to create an mRNA vaccine, meaning the rate at which it can be produced is accelerated.\nIt also only requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer.\nTrial results suggested efficacy against the disease was 94.1%, and vaccine efficacy against severe Covid-19 was 100%.\nMore than 30,000 people in the US took part in the trial, from a wide range of age groups and ethnic backgrounds.\nThe government has bought 17 million doses - enough to vaccinate about 8.5 million people.\nScotland is due to receive more than one million of the UK's order, and the doses will arrive over a period of months.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon cautioned that the supply does not mean the vaccine programme will be accelerated.\nModerna said the vaccine was generally well-tolerated, with no serious safety concerns identified.\nEvents after the first dose included injection-site pain, and after the second dose fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, other pain and redness at the injection site.\nBut these were generally short-lived.\nRos Jervis, director of public health for Hywel Dda University Health Board, said the Moderna vaccine would be used alongside the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab in the rollout to communities in Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire.\n\"We are incredibly lucky to have a third vaccine in Wales, with a long shelf life and the ability to be easily transported, to help deliver the vaccination programme to small clinics across our rural communities,\" she said.\nDarren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health boards, told BBC Radio Wales the Moderna rollout would help the country make up for a reduction in Oxford-AstraZeneca supplies in April. \nMr Gething said every vaccine given in Wales was \"a small victory\" against the virus and people should go for their jab when invited.\nA Welsh Conservatives spokesman said the UK government's vaccination strategy had been \"fully vindicated\". \nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"We need to know what this milestone now means for further easing of restrictions.\"\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said the third vaccine came as \"welcome news\", adding the priority should be to vaccinate everyone \"as quickly and safely as possible\".

      "text": "Arkansas has become the first US state to outlaw gender confirming treatments and surgery for transgender people under the age of 18. \nThe bill also in effect bans doctors from providing puberty blockers, or from referring them to other providers for the treatment.\nThe Republican state governor had vetoed the bill, calling it a \"vast government overreach\".\nBut the state's Republican-controlled House and Senate overruled him.\nThe bill has faced much opposition from groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics, which said the law would block trans youth from important medical care and increase their already high risk of suicide.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said it was preparing litigation, stating that the bill \"will drive families, doctors and businesses out of the state and send a terrible and heart-breaking message to the transgender young people who are watching in fear\".\n\"This is a sad day for Arkansas, but this fight is not over - and we're in it for the long haul,\" Holly Dickson, executive director of ACLU in Arkansas, said in a statement.\nBy Shrai Popat, BBC News, Washington DC\nOver the past few weeks Arkansas has played a game of legislative ping-pong, with gender-affirming care hanging in the balance. Now, the state has become the first to prohibit physicians from providing gender-affirming healthcare to trans youth. Medical experts have said this will likely have disastrous consequences for trans youth, particularly when it comes to mental health.\nDr Jack Turban, a fellow in child and adolescent psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine, told the BBC that access to gender-affirming care for trans youth is \"consistently linked to better mental health outcomes\".\nHe added that much of the political discourse around this care has been shrouded in unscientific misinformation that implies  \"transgender youth are 'confused' or invalid.\"\nThe issue goes beyond Arkansas' borders. Trans children in states like Alabama and Tennessee await their lawmakers' decisions on similar legislation. According to Dr Morissa Ladinsky, an associate professor of paediatrics at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, \"the anticipation, uncertainty and fear\" of losing gender-affirming care is \"chipping away\" at trans youth's resilience.\nGovernor Asa Hutchinson had called the bill \"a product of the cultural war in America\". He argued it created \"new standards of legislative interference with physicians and parents as they deal with some of the most complex and sensitive matters involving young people\".\nThe override of Governor Hutchinson's veto needed only a simple majority, but passed easily in both chambers, with the House voting 72-25 in favour and the Senate 25-8.\nAt least 16 other states are considering similar legislation.\nSupporters of the bill, who are almost all Republican, say they want to protect children from life-changing procedures they will later regret. They also point to side-effects of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, and cite occasional cases where transgender people reverse their decision to transition.\nBut experts say each step is undertaken with the consultation of doctors, therapists and social workers, often over extended periods of time."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Unusual blood clots in the brain have been detected in a handful of people after they were injected with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThese \"cerebral venous sinus thromboses\" or CVSTs have led some countries - including Germany, France and Canada - to restrict who can be given the jab. The World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency say the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks.\nScientists and medicines safety regulators around the world are trying to figure out if the vaccine is genuinely causing these strokes, how big any risk might be and what that might mean for vaccination programmes. \nAt the moment, we do not know. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA), which has been reviewing the safety data, says it is \"not proven, but is possible\".\nThe organisation has to figure out whether the reported clots are a side-effect or a coincidence that would have happened naturally. This is incredibly hard when dealing with rare events. If, on the other hand, one in every 10,000 people was having serious blood clots then the answer would be obvious.\nI have spoken to respected scientists some of whom are sceptical, others increasingly convinced. \nSome point to the highly unusual nature of the clots as a sign something could be going on. They are often appearing at the same time as low levels of blood platelets, which are one of the main components of a clot, and antibodies linked to other clotting disorders appearing in the blood. \nOthers say there is not enough proof and the reported cases could plausibly be down to Covid, which itself is linked to abnormal clotting. \nIt remains entirely possible the risk is zero as vaccines are not proven to cause the brain clots. \nGermany's Paul Ehrlich Institute has reported 31 cerebral venous sinus thromboses and nine deaths out of 2.7 million people vaccinated there. \nThe most recent UK data reported 30 clots linked with low platelet counts and seven deaths out of 18 million people vaccinated. \nThe European Medicines Agency, which has assessed data from around the world, estimates there is around a one in 100,000 risk of a CVST in people under the age of 60 who have been given the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nThe organisation's head of safety monitoring, Dr Peter Arlett, said that was \"more than we would expect to see\". \nHowever, it is uncertain what the background rate of these blood clots in the brain truly is. Estimates vary from around two cases per million people every year to nearly 16 in every million in normal times and coronavirus itself may be causing them too. \nYou might expect to see the same numbers of CVSTs in different countries if they were genuinely being caused by the vaccine. Yet the UK has reported roughly the same number of cases despite giving the vaccine to nearly seven times as many people as Germany.\nOne argument is the type of people being vaccinated is different. \nThe UK has, largely, been working from the oldest age groups down, while Germany was one of the countries that initially refused to use the vaccine in the over 65s because of a lack of trial data. Instead nearly 90% of Germans given AstraZeneca are thought to be under 60.\nSide-effects in general tend to be more severe in younger people as they have a stronger immune response, which has been one speculated reason why the UK has had fewer cases. \nHowever, CVSTs are inherently more common in younger women and taking the pill increases the risk. So the natural risk levels - whether people are vaccinated or not - could have a role too. \nTeasing all this apart is challenging, but the EMA said it had found no specific risk factors such as age, gender or medical history. \nNothing in medicine in completely safe and even therapies that are highly toxic are used in the right circumstance. \nChemotherapy drugs can have brutal side effects, but are hugely valuable; and even over-the-counter painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen have severe side-effects, they are just incredibly rare. \nThe real decision is always whether the benefits outweigh the risks. \nThis is particularly challenging in a pandemic. Normally medicine would rely on the \"precautionary principle\" to prove adequate safety before giving a new medicine to large numbers of people. But in a pandemic, any delays in vaccinating people will also cost lives. \nBased on the Germany data alone, if you vaccinate a million people then you would expect 12 to have a blood clot and four of them to die. \nBut if a million 60-year-olds catch coronavirus then around 20,000 would die of Covid-19. If a million 40-year-olds catch coronavirus then around 1,000 die. It would be a few hundred people in their 30s.\nThe benefits of vaccination clearly increase with age and countries like Germany and Canada have allowed the AstraZeneca vaccine to be used in older age-groups. These decisions will also be driven by which alternative vaccines they have available and who still needs to be immunised. \nThe world is scrutinising the data intensely, but clarity will still take time. \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children,European Union,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The EU's medicines regulator says unusual blood clots should be listed as a very rare side effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine for Covid-19.\nAfter a study looking at 86 European cases, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk.\nThe report reflected data on 25 million Europeans administered with the jab.\nThe EMA could not list specific risk factors such as age or gender, but most blood clot cases were women under 60.\nSeparately, the UK's vaccine advisory body said that under-30s there were to be offered an alternative jab to AstraZeneca due to the blood clots issue. Some 79 people had suffered rare blood clots after vaccination by the end of March in the UK - 19 of whom had died.\nAnd the World Health Organization's advisory vaccine safety panel said on Wednesday that although a blood clot link was \"plausible\" it was \"not confirmed\" and the cases were \"very rare\" among 200 million people vaccinated with AstraZeneca globally.\nMore than 132 million Covid-19 infections have been recorded across the world, along with more than 2.8 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University research.\nThere were two main elements to its report - the link with blood clots and how this could affect vaccination programmes.\nThe EMA had concluded there was a \"possibility of very rare cases of blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets occurring within two weeks of vaccination\" with the AstraZeneca jab.\nMost of the 86 cases studied in the European Economic Area (the EU, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein) up to 22 March were in women under 60. Eighteen were fatal.\nBut EMA executive director Emer Cooke said there was no available evidence of \"specific risk factors such as age, gender, or previous medical history of clotting disorders\".\nOn the safety side, she said: \"Our safety committee... has confirmed that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine in preventing Covid-19 overall outweigh the risks of side effects.\"\nMs Cooke added: \"This vaccine has proven to be highly effective - it prevents severe disease and hospitalisation, and it is saving lives.\"\nAstraZeneca has said its studies have found no causal link with blood clots.\nMs Cooke said that one \"plausible explanation for these rare side effects is an immune response to the vaccine\".\nThe condition is similar to one seen in people who have been treated with the drug heparin, a blood thinner used to prevent the formation of clots.\nIn some cases there has been a potentially dangerous immune-driven adverse reaction to the drug, leading to a condition called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or HIT.\nThe EMA's team concluded that a causal link between extremely rare blood clots and the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab was not just possible, but probable. \nIt will now be up to individual governments to make up their mind about who they would like to vaccinate, with what kind of vaccine. \nTheir decisions may depend on the access to alternatives. A clear vaccine roadmap is vital in paving the way out of the pandemic.\nThe EU needs to pump up the speed at which it's getting shots into arms, and is currently facing two major challenges, supply and public acceptance.\nMixed messages from European governments have fuelled vaccine hesitancy and restoring public trust requires transparency and consistency.\nIf an alternative to AstraZeneca is recommended for the majority of under 30 year olds in the UK, then many may ask, why not in the Netherlands, Germany or Sweden?\nWhile the picture is evolving and contested, many countries are battling a third wave, along with public pressure to reopen society.\nAlthough the EMA evaluates and supervises medicine use for all of the EU, including drug approval, this does not mean there has been unity on tackling Covid-19.\nAfter a virtual meeting of EU health ministers on Wednesday to discuss the EMA findings, European Commissioner for Health Stella Kyriakides said in a statement: \"Our decisions should now be based on the scientific work of EMA, and a rigorous, continuous assessment of risks and benefits.\n\"I have today called on Health Ministers to follow a coordinated approach across Europe to improve public confidence.\" \nBut earlier Belgium announced it would restrict AstraZeneca to those aged 56 and above and then Italy said it was recommending reserving it for the over 60s. But Italy also said there was no evidence to stop people having a second dose of AstraZeneca.\nSpain later said that it was restricting AstraZeneca to those between 60 and 64.\nCountries within the bloc have diverged widely on vaccination campaigns and on the use of the AstraZeneca jab.\nFrance recommends that AstraZeneca vaccinations be given only to those aged 55 or over. In Germany it is over 60, plus high-priority groups. Norway, not an EU member, and Denmark have a full suspension.\nGermany also says its under-60s who have received an AstraZeneca first dose should now get a different vaccine for their second.\nFrance, Finland and Norway could consider similar moves.\nStudies are still being done on the effectiveness of mixed vaccines.\nThe EU has ordered 400 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine but has been locked in a dispute over supply, saying AstraZeneca has not met its obligations.\nNevertheless, some EU nations have not used the AstraZeneca vaccines that have been supplied, with a drop in public confidence being blamed."

      "text": "Loneliness during the Covid lockdown has been much more intense in poorer, urban areas and places with a higher proportion of young people, says the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nA study has mapped the factors that makes loneliness more likely in different parts of Britain.\nFormer industrial towns with higher unemployment were more lonely.\nWhile affluent and older populations were less likely to experience high levels of lockdown loneliness.\nAnd high streets with good local businesses can make a positive difference.\nThe autumn and winter months - from October 2020 to February 2021 - saw rising levels of loneliness, says the ONS.\nAmong the adult population, 7% were \"always or often\" lonely - representing 3.7 million people - more than a million more than during the first lockdown last spring.\nThe latest research from the ONS shows the overlapping factors linked to the highest levels of loneliness.\nUrban areas, particularly those with declining industries, and higher rates of unemployment and crime, are more vulnerable to loneliness.\nThe study found a particularly strong link during the pandemic between joblessness and loneliness in towns and cities outside London.\nThe ONS cautions against reading too much into individual local figures, but levels of \"often or always\" lonely are double the national average in places including:\nAs previous studies have shown, young adults, even before they were cut off from their social lives during the pandemic, are much more likely to report feelings of loneliness than older people.\nIn these self-reported feelings of loneliness, 16 to 24-year-olds were five times more likely to say they had felt lonely in the past seven days than those 65 to 74-year-olds.\nThere have been been suggestions that older people become more \"resilient\" in their attitude towards loneliness.\nWhile Nick Crofts, head of the Co-op Foundation, which has also published research on loneliness, says it should be \"no surprise\" that young people are are particularly affected,\n\"Over more than a year of social distancing, they've seen schools and colleges close while physical interactions with each other have been hugely restricted,\" he said.\nThe areas of Britain least likely to have felt lonely during the pandemic are described as \"affluent England\", those with \"countryside living\" and places that feel safer from a lower level of crime.\nRural areas tend to have less loneliness than urban.\nOther protective factors against loneliness include having strong local businesses, and access to adult education - with these helping people to stay connected and keep in touch.\nPlaces with low levels of loneliness include:\nThe study grouped together areas such as \"London cosmopolitan\" and \"ethnically-diverse metropolitan living\", and found these to be less likely to be lonely than poorer, post-industrial towns - but more lonely than wealthier or rural locations.\nThere are personal factors in this mosaic of loneliness. \nThe study shows anxiety levels have also risen during the pandemic - particularly for those living in densely-populated areas - and that feelings of anxiety can be interlinked with loneliness.\nPeople who are living alone are more likely to be lonely, particularly those who are widowed or separated - with those with \"no-one to talk to\" being 10 times more likely to report loneliness."

      "text": "Driving lessons can restart in England and Wales on 12 April, the transport secretary has confirmed.\nGrant Shapps said driving tests will resume 10 days later on 22 April.\nThe Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will offer more tests and examiners, including at weekends and on bank holidays, \"so as many learners can take a test with all necessary safety measures in place\", Mr Shapps said.\nTests and lessons are currently suspended because of lockdown rules.\nIn Scotland, lessons will resume later on 26 April, with tests restarting on 6 May at the earliest. \nIn Northern Ireland, all driving lessons and tests have been cancelled as part of its current lockdown, which began on 26 December.\nAlong with car driving lessons, lorry and minibus lessons and driving theory tests can also resume from 12 April in England and Wales.\nDriving tests for motorcycles, lorries and cars with trailers can also take place from 12 April. All tests can now be booked online.\nThe pandemic has caused disruption for many people learning to drive, with lessons and tests cancelled across the UK.\nSome 2.97 million people in Britain aged 16-25 hold a full driving licence, down from 3.32 million people in March 2020.\nIt's the smallest total since at least November 2012, according to analysis of Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) records by the PA news agency.\nAmelia Sully initially had her driving test booked for November 2020. She moved that to February but then that got cancelled, and she's had to reschedule her test for June.\nDriving lessons with her parents have been \"stop-start\" due to the stay-at-home rules during lockdown.\n\"It's definitely frustrating. I've been a learner driver for over a year since I started on my 17th birthday,\" the 18-year-old from Oxfordshire tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\nHaving a car would have been helpful in cutting down her commute to sixth form from 45 to 15 minutes.\n\"It would be great to drive to friends' houses and go out, rather than having to rely on parents to take me to the nearest bus stop,\" she adds.\nAs she starts university in September, Amelia is worried if she doesn't pass in June, she'll have to wait even longer before trying again.\n\"I've had friends who have booked and they were moved to September. So if I had to book another one, you're looking at the end of the year.\"\nCovid safety measures include that learners and instructors should wear face coverings in lessons and tests, unless there is a good reason for them not to, the DVSA says.\nPeople doing a test in their own car should clean it beforehand, wiping down the dashboard and car controls.\nAt least one window on each side of the car must be open.\nThe return of driving lessons on Monday coincides with the next phase of England's lockdown easing - which will see people also returning to gyms, pub gardens and non-essential shops. \nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "text": "Mobile phones should be banned from schools because lockdown has affected children\u2019s \u201cdiscipline and order,\u201d the education secretary has warned.\nGavin Williamson told The Telegraph phones should not be \u201cused or seen during the school day\u201d, though he said schools should make their own policies.\nPhones can act as a \u201cbreeding ground\u201d for cyber-bullying and social media can damage mental health, he added.\n\"It\u2019s now time to put the screens away, especially mobile phones,\" he wrote.\n\u201cTechnology has been invaluable in keeping children learning during lockdowns and we support its use,\" he said.\n\u201cOutside the classroom, the use of mobile phones distracts from healthy exercise and good old-fashioned play. \n\u201cWorse, it acts as a breeding ground for cyber-bullying, and the inappropriate use of social media sites.\n\u201cWhile it is for every school to make its own policy, I firmly believe that mobile phones should not be used or seen during the school day, and will be backing head teachers who implement such policies.\u201d \nThe government will be consulting on how to help heads remove phones from schools, later this year, he added.\nThe vast majority of schools already have policies limiting the use of phones in lessons, according to data from Teacher Tapp, an app that conducts daily surveys of about 8,500 teachers.\nAccording to the app, about half of secondary schools and most primary schools do not allow phones to be used at break or lunchtime either.\n\u201cThe real issue flagged by secondary teachers is that rules and sanctions are inconsistently applied, and it isn't always clear whose responsibility it is to remove a phone, or if they are allowed to do so,\u201d Laura McInerney, co-founder of Teacher Tapp, said. \n\u201cHow the education secretary will change that problem isn't immediately clear.\"\nSchools have the power to ban phones from being taken on to the premises.\nBut government policy is that it is the responsibility of head teachers to determine whether this is appropriate.\nA ban has previously been backed by Nick Gibb, minister for school standards, Matt Hancock, former culture secretary and current health secretary, and Amanda Spielman, chief inspector of Ofsted.\nBut no laws have been made to enforce it in the UK.\nIn France, the law prevents children from using their phones inside school grounds. \nAnd, earlier this year, China\u2019s Ministry of Education announced that pupils would not be allowed to bring mobiles to school without written parental consent. \nMica-May Smith, from Bright Futures Education, an education training company, said a blanket ban was a bad idea \"as children may still bring them into school and hide them\".\nInstead, there should be a \"collaborative approach with rules in place\" including designated times and areas for use, she said.\n\"It is about bringing trust and preparing them for the adult world,\" she added.\nPhones should be incorporated into lessons as a \"fundamental part of the curriculum\", said Susan Wessels, deputy head of Framlingham College in Suffolk.\n\"Schools are designed to prepare students for the real world,\" she added. \"We must encourage pupils to use their phones constructively.\"\nBut half of parents support a ban on phones, a survey by price comparison site uSwitch last year suggested.\nShile Ismaila, a parenting blogger at African Mommy says banning phones would \"avoid distractions and helps kids focus on work\".\n\"Children spent more time than usual on their phones during the pandemic,\" she added.\n\"This was the main way to stay connected to peers which has more or less turned into an addiction now.\"\nMr Williamson also wrote about the need for discipline and structure as children return to schools.\n\u201cAlthough remote learning was a tremendous success in terms of enabling children to carry on with their lessons from home, the lack of regular structure and discipline will inevitably have had an effect on their behaviour,\u201d he said."

      "text": "People diagnosed with Covid-19 in the previous six months were more likely to develop depression, dementia, psychosis and stroke, researchers have found.\nA third of those with a previous Covid infection went on to develop or have a relapse of a psychological or neurological condition. \nBut those admitted to hospital or in intensive care had an even higher risk.\nThe study authors pointed to both the effects of stress, and the virus having a direct impact on the brain.\nUK scientists looked at the electronic medical records of more than half a million patients in the US, and their chances of developing one of 14 common psychological or neurological conditions, including:\nAnxiety and mood disorders were the most common diagnosis among those with Covid, and these were more likely to be down to the stress of the experience of being very ill or taken to hospital, the researchers explained.\nConditions like stroke and dementia were more likely to be down to the biological impacts of the virus itself, or of the body's reaction to infection in general.  \nCovid-19 was not associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a risk from flu).\nThe study, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, was observational. So the researchers couldn't say whether Covid had caused any of the diagnoses - and some people would have had a stroke or depression in the next six months regardless.   \nBut by comparing a group of people who had had Covid-19 with two groups - with flu and with other respiratory infections respectively - the researchers at the University of Oxford concluded Covid was associated with more subsequent brain conditions than other respiratory illnesses.\nThe participants were matched by age, sex, ethnicity and health conditions, to make them as comparable as possible.\nSufferers were 16% more likely to develop a psychological or neurological disorder after Covid than after other respiratory infections, and 44% more likely than people recovering from flu. \nOn top of this, the more severely ill with Covid the patient had been, the more likely they were to receive a subsequent mental health or brain disorder diagnosis\nMood, anxiety or psychotic disorders affected 24% of all patients but this rose to 25% in those admitted to hospital, 28% in people who were in intensive care and 36% in people who experienced delirium while ill. \nStrokes affected 2% of all Covid patients, rising to 7% of those admitted to ICU and 9% of those who had delirium. \nAnd dementia was diagnosed in 0.7% of all Covid patients, but 5% of those who'd experienced delirium as a symptom.\nDr Sara Imarisio, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"Previous studies have highlighted that people with dementia are at higher risk of developing severe Covid-19. This new study investigates whether this relationship may also hold in the other direction.\n\"The study doesn't focus on the cause of this relationship and it is important that researchers get to the bottom of what underlies these findings.\"\nThere is evidence the virus does enter the brain and cause direct damage, neurology professor Masud Husain at the University of Oxford, explained.\nIt can have other indirect effects, for example by affecting blood clotting which can lead to strokes. And the general inflammation which happens in the body as it responds to infection can affect the brain.\nFor just over a third of people developing one or more of these conditions, it was their first diagnosis.\nBut even where it was a recurrence of a pre-existing problem, researchers said this did not rule out the possibility that Covid had caused the episode of illness.\nProf Dame Til Wykes, at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, said: \"The study confirms our suspicions that a Covid-19 diagnosis is not just related to respiratory symptoms, it is also related to psychiatric and neurological problems.\n\"Looking over six months after diagnosis has demonstrated that the \"after-effects\" can appear much later than expected - something that is no surprise to those suffering from Long Covid.\n\"Although as expected, the outcomes are more serious in those admitted to hospital, the study does point out that serious effects are also evident in those who had not been admitted to hospital.\""

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "tags": "Companies,Deliveroo,Takeaway food,Gig economy",
      "text": "Deliveroo shares have edged up on their first fully open day of trading on the London Stock Exchange.\nShares rose more than2% to 286p at 12:00 on Wednesday, when 70,000 retail investors were allowed to trade.\nThey are still well below the 390p paid as the shares dived on their debut last week amid big investors' concerns over workers' rights and profits.\nHundreds of Deliveroo riders are expected to go on strike on Wednesday as they call for higher pay.\nDeliveroo said it was organised by a small \"union [that] does not represent the vast majority of riders\". \nThe firm employs 50,000 riders, but only 400 are expected to take part in the strike. They are calling for riders to be paid the living wage after accounting for costs such as fuel, as well as an end to unpaid waiting times.\nDeliveroo said its own survey data showed 90% of riders were happy with firm.\nThe food delivery firm's share sale marked London's biggest stock market launch for a decade, but the sharp fall seen saw it dubbed \"the worst IPO [initial public offering] in the history of London\".\nSmaller investors, known as retail investors, got their first chance to trade their shares on Wednesday as what is described as \"unconditional trading\" began.\nDespite small gains on Wednesday, the company's share price is still far below its 390p float price on its debut when big investors and Deliveroo customers could buy or sell shares. The company had initially hoped for a share price of up to 460p.\nDeliveroo, which has not yet made a profit, had to accept a lower price, saying it had chosen to \"price responsibly\" and sell its shares at the bottom of its planned price range due to \"volatile\" market conditions.\nInvestment bank Goldman Sachs, which was an adviser to Deliveroo and was responsible for stabilising the share price, had to buy about \u00a375m worth of Deliveroo shares to support the share price in the first few days, according to the Financial Times.\nAn IPO is one way for private companies to raise cash. An initial public offering sees shares offered to major investors, including pension and insurance companies, as well, sometimes, as private small investors. \nThey let the company know what they are prepared to pay for the shares, in conjunction with investment banks and other professional advisers hired by a company.\nThe shares then launch on a stock market. Deliveroo shares were only tradeable over the first week by major investors who had bought large chunks. Full trading, allowing anyone to buy and sell, began a week later. Trading on a stock market allows the price to be set freely in the open market by supply and demand.\nThe value of the shares, multiplied by how many there are, gives the market value of the company.\nSome of the UK's biggest investment fund managers, such as Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, charity fund manager CCLA, Legal and General Investment Management and M&G said they would not buy shares in Deliveroo, citing concerns, including over the working conditions of its riders.\nAnalyst Susannah Streeter at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown said that retail investors don't appear to share the same worries.\nShe said a surge of interest from smaller investors \"will be some comfort for Deliveroo customers who were encouraged to buy a slice of the company but appeared to have thrown the dice on a disastrous debut. \n\"They were locked out of selling their shares for a week, while the company's initial valuation fell sharply. Now they finally have a 'get out of jail' card, but it seems for now that many have kept it in their back pocket, waiting it out for prices to stabilise.\"\nNeil Wilson, chief market analyst of Markets.com, warned that the strike action by hundreds of UK riders due to start on Wednesday \"underlines the regulatory risk attached to the stock\".\nAbout 400 of the food couriers in five towns and cities are also expected to stage socially-distanced protests over pay and conditions.\n\"I'm going on strike for my basic rights and those of all the other riders struggling to get by and support families on Deliveroo poverty pay,\" said Greg Howard, a Deliveroo rider and the chair of the IWGB's couriers and logistics branch.\nHe said: \"I've seen conditions decline for years and then working through lockdown I contracted Covid-19 and got very little support from Deliveroo.\"\nBut Husain, a driver from Nottingham, told the Deliveroo survey: \"Deliveroo let you work whenever it suits you plus customers are so nice and respectful compared to other platforms. App is really easy to use and understand and shows you when to make good money.\"\nDeliveroo said it had surveyed 8,500 riders on Tuesday, and found 89% were happy with the company and flexibility it offers.\nA spokesperson said the IWGB union did \"not represent the vast majority of riders who tell us they value the total flexibility they enjoy while working with Deliveroo alongside the ability to earn over \u00a313 an hour. \n\"We are proud that rider satisfaction is at an all-time high and that thousands of people are applying to be Deliveroo riders each and every week. Riders are at the heart of our business and today we are beginning a new consultation with riders about how we should invest our new \u00a350m community fund.\" "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

She's disabled and can't get out of the house.\"\nHe said she had received an offer to come to the surgery, but it was known she was housebound: \"She has to have a home visit. She's got a letter saying she is on the priority list but she hasn't had a vaccine.\"\nSonja Milano's mother Manuela Levi moved to Bangor, Gwynedd, last summer from Italy.\nThe 50-year-old is registered with a GP but has been told to wait two more weeks for news of a vaccine appointment.\nMs Milano said: \"I phoned her GP surgery today and was told if nothing has happened by then, to call again.\n\"Everybody else around us over 50 has been offered one. I just want to make sure she will get a call.\"\nDr Giri Shankar, incident director for the Covid-19 response at PHW, said vaccinations were delivered by health boards.\n\"I can't think of any systematic issue that would have led to several people having not received their vaccinations,\" he said.\n\"There may be isolated cases where that has happened, which obviously needs to be looked into, and the health boards are best placed to do that.\n\"Without looking into the specific details of each of those cases, it's difficult to say what might have happened, but I think the main thing to say is it's never too late. \n\"If you feel you haven't been given an appointment, you should immediately make contact with the health board.\"\nIn a statement, the Welsh government said: \"Any person aged 50 or over will have had at least their first vaccination or been sent an appointment, and plans are in in place to make sure no-one is left behind. \n\"If health boards have been unable to contact someone on the list, or if an appointment has been missed, systems are in place to go back and check and re-arrange a new appointment for anyone who wants to be vaccinated.\"\nInformation is available on the Welsh government website for people who think they should have had an appointment but have not received one.\nDr Mair Hopkin, joint chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners Wales, said she did not think there was \"potentially a problem\" with delivering the vaccine. \nShe said she had heard cases of people not being offered the vaccine were \"few and far between\".\n\"There may be very many reasons why people have been left off a list,\" Dr Hopkin said, citing people moving house and records not being updated.\nDr Hopkin expressed concern younger people could be harder to reach for vaccination since they could be in education or at work and not \"sitting there waiting for that phone call\".\nShe said it was important the young were vaccinated even if they thought they were not at risk. \n\"You have to remember that you are putting everyone one else at risk,\" she said. \nOn Monday, PHW said 1,493,192 people had received a first dose of the vaccine and 469,251 people were fully vaccinated, having had both jabs.\nThe Welsh government also said on Monday it had achieved its \"second milestone\" of offering a vaccine to everyone over the age of 50 and those with underlying health issues.\nBut Hywel Dda University Health Board, which covers Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion, said it was on track to meet the UK's mid-April target by 18 April.\nChief executive Steve Moore encouraged people to get in touch to secure their first vaccine dose if they have not yet had an appointment.\nHe added: \"We have seen an overwhelming response from our wonderful communities across the three counties who have turned up in storms, snow, rain and sunshine to receive their vaccine.\"\nBetsi Cadwaladr health board's primary and community care boss, Dr Chris Stockport, said the \"vast majority\" of appointments for unvaccinated people in groups five to nine were now booked. \nInvitation letters, he said, were \"sent in the post last week\". \n\"Most of these letters have been delivered, but a small number may arrive in the coming days, because of bank holiday postal arrangements,\" Dr Stockport said.\nA \"significant number\" of invitations had also been sent to people in their 40s, he said. \n\"We are determined to not leave anybody behind,\" he said.\nThe uptake of first doses of those in their early 50s across Wales on average was up to 67.2%, while for those in their late 50s, the figure stands at more than 84%.\nThe top four priority groups in Wales, which is made up of all over-70s, including care home residents, were offered a jab by mid-February."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Young people,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Under-30s in the UK are to be offered an alternative Covid vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab due to the evidence linking it to rare blood clots.\nThe recommendation comes after a review by the UK drugs regulator found that by the end of March 79 people had suffered rare blood clots after vaccination - 19 of whom had died.\nThe regulator said this was not proof the jab had caused the clots.\nBut it said the link was getting firmer.\nThe review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found: \nMeanwhile, the EU's medicines regulator says unusual blood clots should be listed as a possible very rare side effect of the AstraZeneca jab, but that the benefits outweighed the risks. Some European countries have restricted the vaccine's use.\nThe World Health Organization said the link between the vaccine and blood clots was \"plausible\" but not confirmed, adding that the clotting incidents were \"very rare\" among nearly 200 million people who have received the jab worldwide.\nNo treatment or vaccine is risk free. The key question is whether it does more good than harm.\nWednesday's update once again demonstrates the AstraZeneca vaccine does - even if you assume it's causing these clots, which has not been proven yet.\nThe risk of dying from one of them following vaccination is incredibly small - about one in a million.\nBy contrast, Covid kills one in eight people who are infected over the age of 75, and one in 1,000 infected in their 40s among those who develop symptoms.\nIt is less clear cut for those under 30, who are much less likely to die of Covid - although the AstraZeneca vaccine still presents more benefit than risk.\nHowever, other vaccines may be an even better bet.\nThe risk might look worrying, but it is actually very low, and usually we don't think about things just in terms of risk.\nFor example, travelling 250 miles in a car also carries with it a one-in-a-million chance of dying in an accident. How many think about that when they get behind the wheel?\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK's review confirmed that the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is \"safe, effective and the benefits far outweigh the risks for the vast majority of adults\". \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the AstraZeneca vaccine had \"already saved thousands of lives\" and the new advice should ensure people of all ages \"continue to have full confidence in vaccines\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer also urged people to \"trust in our doctors and scientists\" and said he was looking forward to receiving his second AstraZeneca dose.\nAstraZeneca said both the MHRA and the EMA reviews reaffirmed that the benefits of the vaccine \"continue to far outweigh the risks\". \nThe UK reported a further 45 deaths from Covid-19 and another 2,763 confirmed cases on Wednesday. Vaccinations remained low after the Easter weekend, with 186,793 second doses administered and 85,227 first doses.\nJune Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said the side-effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine were \"extremely rare\" - and more work was going to identify if the vaccine was definitely causing the clots. \n\"The balance of benefits and known risks is still very favourable for the majority of people,\" she said.\nBut she said for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\". \nShe added: \"The public's safety is at the forefront of our minds.\"\nDr Raine said there was a \"reasonably plausible\" link between the vaccine and the blood clots.\nThe review prompted the UK government's vaccine advisory group, the JCVI, to recommend that people aged 18 to 29 be offered an alternative vaccine where available.\nProfessor Lim Wei Shen, of the JCVI, said the move was being made \"out of the utmost caution rather than because we have any serious safety concerns\".\nProf Sir Munir Pirmohamed, chairman of the Commission on Human Medicines, said the risks had to be weighed against the consequences of Covid-19, which also causes clotting.\nHe said 7.8% of coronavirus patients suffer blood clots on the lungs, while 11.2% will suffer deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs.\nPeople who have had their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine should still get their second dose, the MHRA said. Only those who suffered one of these rare blood clots after the first dose should not get vaccinated, it added.\nPregnant women and people with blood disorders that leave them at risk of clotting should discuss the benefits and risks of vaccination with their doctor before going for a jab.\nAnyone who suffers symptoms such as a persistent headache, blurred vision or confusion for four days or more after vaccination or who experience unusual skin bruising, shortness of breath or chest pain are being asked to seek medical advice.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, described the move as a \"course correction\" - and said it was normal in medicine to change preferences in this way.\nHe also said the impact on the government's promise to offer all adults a jab by the end of July should be \"zero or negligible\" as long as the expected supplies of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines - the other two Covid vaccines in use in the UK - arrived as expected in the coming months."

      "text": "Loneliness during the Covid lockdown has been much more intense in poorer, urban areas and places with a higher proportion of young people, says the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nA study has mapped the factors that makes loneliness more likely in different parts of Britain.\nFormer industrial towns with higher unemployment were more lonely.\nWhile affluent and older populations were less likely to experience high levels of lockdown loneliness.\nAnd high streets with good local businesses can make a positive difference.\nThe autumn and winter months - from October 2020 to February 2021 - saw rising levels of loneliness, says the ONS.\nAmong the adult population, 7% were \"always or often\" lonely - representing 3.7 million people - more than a million more than during the first lockdown last spring.\nThe latest research from the ONS shows the overlapping factors linked to the highest levels of loneliness.\nUrban areas, particularly those with declining industries, and higher rates of unemployment and crime, are more vulnerable to loneliness.\nThe study found a particularly strong link during the pandemic between joblessness and loneliness in towns and cities outside London.\nThe ONS cautions against reading too much into individual local figures, but levels of \"often or always\" lonely are double the national average in places including:\nAs previous studies have shown, young adults, even before they were cut off from their social lives during the pandemic, are much more likely to report feelings of loneliness than older people.\nIn these self-reported feelings of loneliness, 16 to 24-year-olds were five times more likely to say they had felt lonely in the past seven days than those 65 to 74-year-olds.\nThere have been been suggestions that older people become more \"resilient\" in their attitude towards loneliness.\nWhile Nick Crofts, head of the Co-op Foundation, which has also published research on loneliness, says it should be \"no surprise\" that young people are are particularly affected,\n\"Over more than a year of social distancing, they've seen schools and colleges close while physical interactions with each other have been hugely restricted,\" he said.\nThe areas of Britain least likely to have felt lonely during the pandemic are described as \"affluent England\", those with \"countryside living\" and places that feel safer from a lower level of crime.\nRural areas tend to have less loneliness than urban.\nOther protective factors against loneliness include having strong local businesses, and access to adult education - with these helping people to stay connected and keep in touch.\nPlaces with low levels of loneliness include:\nThe study grouped together areas such as \"London cosmopolitan\" and \"ethnically-diverse metropolitan living\", and found these to be less likely to be lonely than poorer, post-industrial towns - but more lonely than wealthier or rural locations.\nThere are personal factors in this mosaic of loneliness. \nThe study shows anxiety levels have also risen during the pandemic - particularly for those living in densely-populated areas - and that feelings of anxiety can be interlinked with loneliness.\nPeople who are living alone are more likely to be lonely, particularly those who are widowed or separated - with those with \"no-one to talk to\" being 10 times more likely to report loneliness."

      "tags": "Minneapolis,United States",
      "text": "A police trainer has testified that ex-officer Derek Chauvin was not trained to use his knee in a neck restraint as he did during George Floyd's arrest.\nMinneapolis use-of-force expert Lt Johnny Mercil said Mr Chauvin should also have later moved the prone Mr Floyd to a different position.\nMr Chauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd for over nine minutes during Mr Floyd's arrest last May.\nMr Chauvin is on trial for murder and has denied the charges against him.\nThe footage of Mr Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on African-American Mr Floyd's neck sparked global protests against racism.\nWith the trial in its second week, jurors have now heard from more than 20 witnesses, including four police training experts on Tuesday. The trial is expected to last for at least one month.\nAs police officers are rarely convicted or charged at all for deaths that occur in custody, the verdict in this trial is being seen as an indication of how the US legal system will treat such cases in future.\nProsecutors are seeking to prove that Mr Chauvin's actions violated his training and have focused their questions on police guidelines and strategies taught to help officers de-escalate situations.\nMr Chauvin's defence attorneys have argued that Mr Floyd's efforts to resist arrest necessitated the restraint, and that the \"hostile\" crowd surrounding Mr Chauvin required \"unique situational awareness\".\nNo witnesses at the scene were arrested, and several of them have testified that they urged officers to check Mr Floyd's pulse and provide him with medical care.\nSpeaking at a group prayer session outside the heavily fortified courthouse on Tuesday, Mr Floyd's brother Philonise Floyd, said \"after we get the verdict and we get this conviction, we'll be able to breathe\".\nMinneapolis Police Department (MPD) training coordinator Mr Mercil told the court that officers are taught to use force in proportion to a suspect's level of resistance and it was \"very important to be careful with the person\".\n\"We tell officers to stay away from the neck when possible,\" he said, adding that officers are told to place body weight on a suspect's shoulders when reasonable.\nMr Mercil testified that based on the training that officers receive, Mr Chauvin should only have used that manner of neck restraint if there was \"active aggression\" involved. \nHe said that Mr Floyd had no ability to resist or show aggression once he was face down on the ground. \nMr Mercil told the court that Mr Chauvin should have recognised that it was \"time to de-escalate the [level of] force\" once Mr Floyd fell unconscious, and that Mr Floyd should have been moved into a different position to avoid asphyxiation.\nEarlier in the day, Sgt Ker Yang, a crisis intervention training coordinator, confirmed that Mr Chauvin had completed the department's 40-hour practical training course and his \"ultimate goal\" should have been to assess Mr Floyd's medical condition during his arrest.\nProsecutors have suggested that asphyxiation was the cause of Mr Floyd's death - contrasting with the ruling of the medical examiner who said Mr Floyd died of \"cardiopulmonary arrest\", which means a person's heart and lungs have stopped.\nMr Chauvin's defence team has contended that alleged drug use and an underlying heart condition contributed to Mr Floyd's death.\nSgt Jody Stiger, a use of force expert for the Los Angeles Police Department, testified that officers were initially justified in their actions because Mr Floyd was \"actively resisting\" arrest as he was being placed in the patrol car. \n\"However, once he was placed in the prone position on the ground, he slowly ceased his resistance and at that point the officers - ex-officers I should say - they should have slowed down or stopped their force as well,\" he testified.\nNicole Mackenzie, a Minneapolis police officer who trains officers on medical first aid, agreed with Mr Chauvin's defence, saying that \"if the environment was determined to be not safe, you may not start [CPR] right away\".\nProsecutors and fellow officers have criticised Mr Chauvin and the other arresting officers for not providing Mr Floyd with medical assistance before ambulances arrived.\nAnalysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC News, Minneapolis\nWhen prosecutors questioned Johnny Mercil, one of several officers who have been called to the stand, on Tuesday, they asked about the way that officers are taught to use force on suspects during an arrest, and the practice of \"neck restraints\".\nThe use of force, as it is known, lies at the heart of the prosecutors' strategy. They are trying to show that Mr Chauvin broke rules, and was a rogue officer.\nOne of their key witnesses, police chief Medaria Arradondo, testified on Monday that Mr Chauvin violated policies regarding the use of force.\nMr Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson has fought against that notion by emphasising that officers have to consider different factors while using force, such as potential threats from a nearby crowd.\nMr Nelson granted that, occasionally, an officer might \"look bad\" while restraining a suspect, but the officer could still be following the law, and the policies, on the use of force.\nMr Nelson's main argument - that Mr Floyd died largely because of alleged drug usage and a weak heart, not because of the way Mr Chauvin treated him - will be ramped up in the coming days, as medical evidence about his death is presented.\nBefore testimony began, lawyers argued over whether a man who was with Mr Floyd at Cup Foods on the day of his death should be forced to speak during the trial.\nMorries Hall and his lawyer appeared in court via video link to say that he would refuse to testify, in order to avoid possibly incriminating himself in Mr Floyd's death with details on illicit drug use.\nThe judge said he would push the decision until next week, and asked Mr Chauvin's defence lawyer to prepare a list of possible questions for Mr Hall."

      "text": "Plaid Cymru would hold an independence referendum within five years if it came to power in May's Senedd election.\nLaunching its manifesto, the party said it offered the \"most radical programme\" in \"any Welsh election since 1945\".\nIts plans include creating 60,000 green jobs, extending free school meals and social care free at the point of need.\nEconomists cost checking the promises called them \"achievable\" but could not say if \"the spending is adequate to achieve the desired results\".\nLaunching the manifesto, in Cardiff Bay, Plaid leader Adam Price said the \"practical, deliverable and fully costed policies\" would lead to a \"fairer, greener, and more prosperous future for Wales\".\nMr Price said his party would deliver a referendum within the next Senedd term if it was in government after 6 May.\n\"We believe independence to be the only sure and sustainable means to achieving social and economic progress,\" he said.\n\"So, a Plaid Cymru government will empower the people of Wales to decide the future of our nation in an independence referendum.\"\nHe added: \"Wales has incredible potential as a nation. The problems that we have had for generations are not inevitable.  \n\"We can solve these problems, together. But the first step is electing a new government that has the ambition to build a new Wales that's better than the old.\"\nMr Price told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers that Wales needed new leadership after years of Welsh Labour-led governments.\nHe said: \"I'm not prepared to accept defeat. The only way that we're going to put Wales on a different path is if we change the political leadership of Wales and have a government that has the vision and ambition for Wales that has sadly been lacking in the last two decades.\"\nHe said the \"central question\" for Wales is how to put the country on a \"different\" economic trajectory. He confirmed that if he was the next first minister, he would also take on the role of economy minister.\n\"For too long we have been under-delivering in terms of quality jobs and decent wages for our communities and that is the central task of the next government of Wales,\" he said.\nThe manifesto's five main policies areas are:\nThe pledges include a promise to spend \u00a36bn on a \"green economic stimulus\" to help create 60,000 new jobs, including \u00a34bn on infrastructure.\nOther pledges include helping Wales take part in Eurovision, and working towards a country \"transformed\" with racism eradicated by 2030.\nRead more on the key points from the manifesto here.\nPlaid's manifesto is a hefty document, running to 126 pages, and is full of lofty pledges.\nIt says it wants to \"transform\" Wales by 2030 with a long table of possible improvements to the country's economy and society.\nThe document aims to set out a positive vision for Wales' future, and at its heart is significant constitutional change, pulling Wales out of the UK.\nBut that would need the UK government to come to agreement on a referendum, and for Plaid to win a majority.\nThe latter is something no party has ever done, outright, in the Senedd. If it was able to put the manifesto into practice, Plaid might have to pick and choose what to run with.\nSo its handy for any future negotiations with other parties that Plaid's shopping list has a lot of options to choose from.\nThe party says its \"fully costed\" manifesto pledges had been \"independently verified by two of Wales' leading economists\".\nAccording to Prof Brian Morgan and Prof Gerry Holtham, the party says it would borrow \u00a34bn to support its \u00a36bn economic stimulus.\nThey concluded that Plaid's current spending commitments \"seem achievable\".\nBut they go on to say that the \"areas of greatest uncertainty surround the borrowing target and the estimates of efficiency savings\". \nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat elections are happening? On 6 May, people across Wales will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party or parties that can command the support of a majority of members will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Welsh Parliament have? MSs pass laws on many aspects of day-to-day life in Wales, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes. Defence, foreign policy and immigration are decided by the UK Parliament.\nHow do I vote? Anyone who lives in Wales and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You can register to vote online.\nThe authors say Plaid Cymru's proposed efficiency savings of 1% per year - aimed at helping to fund some of the manifesto promises - \"have not been specified in any detail\".\nOn the party's infrastructure proposals, the economists warn most borrowing would have to be through \"private finance\" which would be costly and take more time.\n\"We remain doubtful that the proposed borrowing programme could be completed within a single term of the Senedd,\" they say.\nThey also note that the assumptions around the block grant, the sum of money received from the UK Treasury providing the majority of Welsh government funds, is \"optimistic\" but \"not unreasonable,\" with the savings target \"challenging\" but \"not impossible\".\nSome manifesto promises, they note, also depend on specific UK government decisions that \"cannot be taken for granted\".\nThe document does not cost the independence referendum proposals."

      "tags": "LGBT,Transgender people",
      "text": "The \u00a3140 fee to apply for a gender recognition certificate will be cut to \"single figures\" from next month, according to government sources.\nMinisters pledged in September to slash the cost of legally changing gender after deciding against wider reforms.\nWhile cost has been cited as a barrier to applying, some LGBT groups say more work is needed.\nThe government is working \"at speed\" to make the process more straightforward, a spokesman said.\nA consultation was set up in 2018 to explore potential reforms to the way trans people can apply for a gender recognition certificate in England and Wales. This allows someone's acquired gender to be recorded on their birth and marriage certificates.\nThe existing process - which requires two medical reports - had been criticised as costly and bureaucratic, with fewer than 5,000 people successfully obtaining a GRC prior to the consultation.\nOne option was to remove the medical diagnosis element for England and Wales, and allow people to legally change gender through what's sometimes known as self-identification. This was the subject of a highly-charged debate.\nIn September 2020, the government announced it would not fundamentally reform the process, arguing that the \"balance struck\" in the existing legislation was \"correct\". \nThe Women and Equalities Minister, Liz Truss, said that there were \"proper checks and balances in the system\". \nBut she did promise to make applying \"kinder and more straightforward\", including reducing the fee from \u00a3140. \nThe cost of applying will fall to about \u00a35 from the start of May, government sources say. \nMaking the service completely free would take longer because it would require primary legislation, they added. \nNancy Kelley, chief executive of LGBT charity Stonewall, said any fee \"creates a barrier for some trans people\".\n\"It's also important that the government commit to a clear timeline of further changes to streamline the application process, and move it online. However, none of these changes are a substitute for meaningful reform to the Gender Recognition Act,\" she said. \nLee Clatworthy from national transgender charity Sparkle said that the process remains \"overly long-winded\" and a reduction in cost \"won't compel more to apply\". \nThe Equalities Office said: \"The government is committed to making the process of applying for a Gender Recognition Certificate as straightforward and dignified as possible.\n\"We are progressing work at speed to simplify this process as well as reducing the fee and further details will be available imminently.\"\nMinisters have also pledged to move the whole procedure online, but sources say that is not likely to happen by early May.\nWhile the fee reduction is understood to be UK-wide, the consultation does not affect how the gender recognition system operates in Northern Ireland. \nThe Scottish government has done its own consultation."

      "tags": "Energy industry,Climate change,Renewable energy in the UK,Renewable energy,National Grid",
      "text": "Great Britain's electricity system was the greenest it had ever been at lunchtime on Easter Bank Holiday Monday, its operator has said.\nSunny and windy weather, coupled with low demand for power, led to a surge in renewable sources of energy, National Grid Electricity System Operator said.\nIt meant low-carbon energy sources made up almost 80% of Britain's power.\nThere was no coal generation on the grid and just 10% of power was from gas plants, the operator added.\nThe National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) said levels of carbon pollution for each unit of electricity consumed dropped to just 39 grams of carbon dioxide - the lowest ever recorded for the grid - at 13:00 BST on Monday.\nIt said wind power made up 39% of the energy mix, with solar at 21% and nuclear accounting for 16%.\nThe burning of biomass accounted for around 4%. There is debate over the environmental costs of burning biomass, like wood, and the National Grid ESO categorises it separately from low-carbon sources and fossil fuels.\nBy comparison, on Tuesday, 24.8% of Britain's energy came from fossil fuels, most of which was gas (combined cycle), while 45.2% was renewable energy sources. \nThose fossil fuel figures have been dropping all year. In January, gas accounted for more than 43% of the energy mix, with coal at almost 5%, and then last month just 37% of Britain's electricity was generated from gas. \nThe previous record for Great Britain's greenest day was set during lockdown last year, on 24 May.\nWhen Britain went into lockdown, electricity demand plummeted and the National Grid responded by taking power plants off the network and the four remaining coal-fired plants were among the first to be shut down.\nThe new record may be a cause for celebration as the UK strives for a near zero-carbon society - but it's far from a surprise.\nTake the ingredients of a sunny, windy day on a bank holiday when factories are not working - coupled with a lockdown, and you're sure to cook up an impressive percentage of wind power. \nBut remember, as investment in renewables increases, these records will be happening regularly.\nThe real test for renewables comes when we face a cold, still, overcast February day when demand for heat and light soars and wind power is non-existent.\nThat will need much more energy storage than is currently available.\nThe government aims to have almost all electricity produced from low carbon sources by 2030 - and despite this week's impressive results, there's still a very long way to go. \nLast year as a whole saw many records broken for Britain's electricity mix, with an almost 68-day coal-free run between 10 April and 16 June, and solar providing more than a third of electricity supplies on several occasions during May. \nChristmas 2020 was also the first ever coal-free Christmas Day. \nMeanwhile, the highest ever amount of electricity generated by wind was on 13 February this year.\nFintan Slye, director at National Grid ESO, said: \"This latest record is another example of how the grid continues to transform at an astonishing rate as we move away from fossil fuel generation and harness the growth of renewable power sources.\n\"It's an exciting time, and the progress we're seeing with these records underlines the significant strides we're taking towards our ambition of being able to operate the system carbon free by 2025.\"\nThe record comes ahead of COP26, a UN international climate change summit, due to be held in Glasgow this November.\nKate Blagojevic, head of climate at Greenpeace UK, praised the progress on taking fossil fuels out of the energy mix, but added that it was \"no time for the UK government to rest on its laurels\".\n\"Carbon emissions from our homes, farms and roads remain stubbornly high, and only a major government intervention can unblock the impasse,\" she said.\n\"As the Glasgow climate summit looms closer, ministers really need to up their game on tackling UK carbon emissions right across the board.\""

      "text": "Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. \nA range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. \nIt is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. \nThe restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. \nVaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are \"the\" exit strategy from the pandemic.\nThe three vaccine frontrunners are those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca.\nPfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design.\nThey inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. \nThese have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. \nThe Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe.\nIt is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures.\nAll three are supposed to be given as two doses.\nA single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now been approved for use in the UK.\nTwenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year.\nBecause only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year.\nAnother jab, Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators.\nIt uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. \nThere are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. \nThe Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection.\nThe Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according to late stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised.\nThe vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death.\nIt is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. \nHowever, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid.\nNonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. \nUnderstanding which method produces the best results will be explored in challenge trials where people are deliberately infected with the virus.\nNew versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. \nHowever, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first \"real-world\" data on the new variants.\nBoth showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading.\nThe results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target.\nWe may need to change the vaccines we use in the future."

It would record whether people had been vaccinated, recently tested negative, or had already had and recovered from Covid-19.\nThe European Union is also working on plans to introduce certificates, while in Israel a \"Green Pass\" is already available to anyone who has been fully vaccinated or has recovered from Covid-19, which they have to show to access facilities such as hotels, gyms or theatres.\nThe World Health Organization on Tuesday said it did not currently support requiring vaccination passports for travel, because of uncertainty over whether inoculation prevents transmission, and discrimination concerns. \nMeanwhile, US President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that he had brought forward to 19 April the date by which all American adults will be eligible for a Covid vaccine. \n\"We have to ramp up a whole-of-government approach that rallies the whole country and puts us on a war footing to truly beat this virus,\" he said."

      "text": "The UK has suspended aid funding for Oxfam again after fresh allegations of sexual exploitation and bullying were made against staff.\nTwo Oxfam workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) were suspended last week following the latest claims.\nThe charity had only been allowed to start reapplying for aid funds in March.\nIt had served a three-year ban after evidence of sexual exploitation by staff in Haiti came to light in 2018.\nThe Foreign and Development Office said Oxfam would not be able to make any applications for UK aid money until the new allegations were resolved.\n\"All organisations bidding for UK aid must meet the high standards of safeguarding required to keep the people they work with safe,\" a spokesman said.\nThe recent reports \"call into question\" Oxfam's ability to meet those standards, he added.\nOxfam said its suspensions of the two members of staff showed \"our commitment to tackle abuses of power\".\nThe allegations of sexual exploitation by Oxfam staff in Haiti in 2018 lifted the lid on the dark underbelly of international aid charities. \nThe scandal and the reforms that followed were supposed to put an end to that. \nBut the latest allegations emerging from the Democratic Republic of Congo pose new questions about whether there has been enough change.\nCertainly, the Foreign Office does not think Oxfam yet meets the highest standards of safeguarding.\nAfter three years in the cold, just a month after it was finally able to resume applications for UK aid, Oxfam is once again shunned by Whitehall. \nEven if this is only a temporary pause in funding, the charity's reputation has suffered another blow. \nA spokesman for the charity said it was keeping the Foreign Office and the Charity Commission informed about its investigation in the DRC and it was seeking further information about the ban.\nLast week the charity revealed it had suspended the two workers in the DRC as part of an investigation set up in November. But the Times - which revealed the original scandal in 2018 - said whistleblowers were \"frustrated\" at the speed of the inquiry.\nCurrent and former Oxfam staff made allegations of sexual exploitation, bullying, fraud and nepotism against 11 people in a letter send to the charity's leadership in February, the paper said.\nSome of these complaints dated back to 2015.\nAfter claims that staff sexually exploited survivors of the 2010 Haiti earthquake were revealed in 2018, the Charity Commission concluded Oxfam had a \"culture of poor behaviour\" and was issued with a warning over its \"mismanagement\".\nWith thousands of people cancelling their regular donations and the government suspending its funding of the charity, Oxfam had to make \u00a316m of cuts."

      "text": "Drivers in crowded cities should think twice before buying a big SUV, says the head of a motoring organisation.\nSteve Gooding, from the RAC Foundation, said: \"We should all choose the right vehicle for the right trip to cut the size of our carbon footprint.\n\"It is right to question if suburban drivers need a car capable of ploughing over rivers, across fields and up steep hills just to pop to the shops.\"\nHis comments come as research confirms most SUVs are bought by urban drivers.\nIt shows that large SUVs - often known as Chelsea tractors - are indeed most prevalent in places such as Chelsea. \nThey are typically defined by their extreme size, and off-road features such as high ground clearance and four wheel drive.\nThey often face complaints from other road users about their bulk and their pollution - especially during the school run.\nThe report from the think-tank New Weather Institute said: \"The numbers stand up long-held suspicions that these vehicles ostensibly designed for off-road are actually marketed successfully to urban users where their big size and higher pollution levels are a worse problem.\" \nThe report says:\nThe report says areas where SUV owners dominate are also the places where road space is most scarce, and where the highest proportion of cars are parked on the street. It says many large SUVs are too big for a standard UK parking space.\nAndrew Simms, from the New Weather Institute, said: \"It turns out that the home of the 'Chelsea tractor' really is Chelsea. One of advertising's biggest manipulations has persuaded urban families that it's perfectly 'normal' to go shopping in a two-tonne truck. \n\"But the human health and climate damage done by SUVs is huge and needs to be undone. Just as tobacco advertising was successfully ended, it's time to stop promoting polluting SUV's.\"\nThe UK Citizens' Assembly on climate change has supported restrictions on SUVs. But motoring organisations said the analysis was too simplistic. \nWhile Mr Gooding supported the principle of making appropriate choices of vehicles, he told the BBC it was wrong to protest against medium sized cars that look like SUVs but don't clog the streets and are economical to run.\n\"The term SUV has become so broad as to be unhelpful,\" he said. \"(Some) motorists might just be seeking the comfort and convenience of relatively tall but still modestly-sized cars that come with the SUV badge but are economical to run.\n\"The popularity of the SUV body-style looks like it's going to be with us for some time as some auto companies have already released fully electric versions with more to come later this year.\"\nEdmund King, from the AA, told the BBC: \"Talk of banning the advertising of SUVs is a na\u00efve approach. Some of the cleanest cars come in the SUV shape but are all electric such as the Jaguar I-Pace, Tesla Model X or Hyundai Kona. \n\"The auto industry is developing a wide range of cleaner, greener vehicles with some of the best in SUV styles,\" he said. \"Not all SUVs are large. Small SUVs are among the most popular cars on sale, because they usually offer the high-set driving position, practicality, safety and looks of more traditional off-roaders, but without the high price, running costs or emissions.\"\nHe added: \"Cars like the Nissan Juke are often the family car of choice in suburban areas.\"\nThe report says advertisers have misled consumers by pushing messages around SUVs such as 'get back to nature' and 'help the environment'. \nThe authors have written to the advertising agency Spark44, which runs multiple SUV campaigns, asking them to outline how they plan to meet the UK government's climate change targets. \nThe agency says it can't supply a response because it hasn't had long enough to consider the report properly. \nA study by the International Energy Agency said increasing demand for SUVs is the second biggest contributor to the growth in carbon emissions.\nAnnual emissions from SUVs rose to more than 700 megatonnes of CO2, and if SUV drivers were a country, they would be the seventh in the world for carbon emissions.\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

      "text": "Human rights groups in Pakistan have accused Prime Minister Imran Khan of being a \"rape apologist\" after he blamed a rise in sexual assault cases on how women dress.\nDuring a live television interview, he advised women to cover up to prevent temptation.\nMr Khan added \"in any society where vulgarity is prevalent, there are consequences.\"\nHundreds of people have signed a statement demanding an apology.\nPakistan is ranked as one of the most dangerous countries in the world for women in terms of safety and equality.\nSexual abuse, so-called \"honour\" killings and forced marriage are common, and criminal complaints are rarely reported to police, or seriously investigated.\nIn a two-hour-long, question-and-answer interview with the public on live television, Imran Khan was asked what steps his government had taken to prevent sexual abuse. \nAfter denouncing crimes against women and children, he said that sexual violence was a result of \"increasing obscenity\", adding it was a product of India, the West and Hollywood movies.\nThe prime minister said women in Pakistan should remove \"temptation\" because \"not everyone has willpower\". He said women should observe purdah - a term referring to women wearing modest clothes around men or segregation between sexes. \nLast year Imran Khan was criticised following a similar national television interview, where he failed to challenge a Muslim cleric's opinion that women were to blame for the coronavirus pandemic.\nA statement condemning the prime minister's comments and demanding an apology has been co-signed by multiple human rights organisations and hundreds of individuals.\nIt said his words were \"factually incorrect, insensitive and dangerous\" and \"actively fostered and promoted rape culture\".\n\"Such statements have the effect of further traumatizing and silencing survivors of sexual violence by placing the blame on them, instead of on those who carry out the crime and the system that enables rapists,\" it reads.\nSoon after his comments, there was widespread outrage on social media.\nJournalist Zahid Hussain wrote in his column in Pakistan's leading newspaper, Dawn, that \"Imran Khan's views on rape are not very different from the callous comments made by a former Lahore police chief about the Motorway gang rape last year. He blamed the victim for driving late at night. His comments reflected the thinking of a large segment of society that prefers to blame the victim.\"\nThe Motorway gang rape, which sent shockwaves throughout Pakistan, has become a key example of the violence perpetrated against women, and the attitudes towards it by some senior officials.\nIn September 2020, a Pakistani-French mother and her two children were parked on the side of a highway near Lahore, waiting for help after running out of fuel.\nTwo men broke into the car, robbed them and raped the woman in front of her children.\nIn several TV interviews, Lahore's most senior police officer, Umer Sheikh, questioned why the victim had not taken a busier road or checked her fuel before departing, implying the woman was to blame.\nThe case sparked massive protests, as women took to the streets to voice their anger and demand change.\nThe outcry led to new anti-rape measures, including the creation of a national sex offenders register, the protection of victims' identities, and allowing chemical castration of some offenders.\nThere are at least 11 rape cases reported in Pakistan every day, according to official statistics. Over 22,000 rape cases were reported to police across the country in the past six years, however, only 77 accused have been convicted , which is 0.3% of the total figure."

      "tags": "Money,Personal finance,Air travel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "An elderly grandmother who can \"barely walk\" has finally been sent a refund - a year after her flight was cancelled.\nVeronica Brown, aged 85, had hoped to visit her son and grandchildren in Munich last Easter, until Covid restrictions put an end to her plans.\nHer daughter Clare D'Agostino said, with little prospect of rearranging, there was \"no way on earth\" they would have chosen a voucher over a refund.\nBut they were sent one anyway, until the BBC followed up the case.\nMrs Brown visited her family in Germany as much as she could. In her advancing years, her daughter Clare booked her flights for her. \nThe Easter trip was booked via Expedia, but then the Covid crisis intervened, and all such travel halted.\nFor a variety of reasons including an apparent disagreement between agent and the airline, Lufthansa, Clare then found it impossible to get a refund, and was sent a flight voucher instead.\nShe knew that was pointless, with the outlook suggesting little chance of travel - particularly for the elderly - for some time.\n\"My mum is now unable to walk properly and would never be able to use the voucher,\" she said.\nShe then heard a report on BBC 5 Live about issues with flight vouchers and, in her frustration, sent in a message explaining how she had been \"left in limbo\".\nAfter following up her case with Expedia, the BBC has now been told that a refund has finally been granted.\n\"We have looked into the case and can confirm that the customer is eligible for a full refund which has now been processed,\" a spokeswoman for the company said. \n\"We will contact them directly about this, and also, as a gesture of goodwill to apologise for any inconvenience, apply a \u00a3100 hotel coupon to their Expedia account.\"\nClare, and her mum, said the decision was \"really great news\".\nAlthough the cost of the flight was relatively small, at \u00a3170, they said it was a \"point of principle\" that the money should be returned.\nOther travellers have had similar difficulties securing a refund.\nWith considerable uncertainty over when international leisure travel will resume, that has meant holding on to a voucher worth hundreds of pounds for some time.\nThere is also the potential for prices to have risen considerably by the time that voucher can be used so, in effect, the money will not go so far.\nExperts say that vouchers have re-emerged as an issue as it is a year on from many of those cancelled trips and some vouchers are set to expire, which could make them worthless if unused.\nGenerally, anyone who accepted a voucher signed away the right to a refund. However, some airlines are allowing vouchers to be swapped for cash, and others are extending the validity of the voucher.\nSome holidaymakers say they were in a similar situation to Clare, not wanting a voucher but being sent one anyway, or having not been made aware that a cash refund was an option.\nIn those cases, if an airline or agent refuses to refund, individuals may be able to take their case to an independent dispute resolution service.\nThe travel industry has expressed its concern at the lack of clarity over the return of international travel.\nThe Business Travel Association said the latest government announcement was \"beyond disappointing\" and called for \"a clear pathway to international travel and trade\"."

      "text": "There have been calls for a ban on litter picking in villages near the site of a fatal Novichok poisoning to be lifted. \nPeople near Salisbury are still being told not to pick up discarded items, three years after the 2018 attack.\nResidents and councillors want Public Health England to reconsider its guidance. \n\"The common feeling is that the risk has passed,\" said Steve Milton, clerk of Alderbury Parish Council.\nFormer Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed in Salisbury after being poisoned on 4 March 2018. \nLocal residents Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were also exposed to Novichok in nearby Amesbury and Ms Sturgess later died.  \nPublic Health England (PHE) says that \"as a precaution\" its advice remains \"if you didn't drop it, then don't pick it up.\"\nMr Milton said the issue had arisen again as villages were planning clean-ups ahead of entering the Wiltshire Best Kept Village competition. \n\"We're definitely going ahead. We're five miles away from Salisbury so we think we would be pretty safe and perhaps they need to be a bit more nuanced in that advice,\" he said. \nWiltshire councillor for Alderbury and Whiteparish, Richard Britton, has asked PHE to \"urgently review\" its guidance, saying that he felt the risk was \"incredibly small\".\n\"After three years you would think that PHE would have got its act together and reconsidered their advice. Having left it so long I think they owe it to residents to sort this out very quickly,\" he said.\nPHE has said that that while the chances of anything dangerous being found is low, it was important to remember how serious the consequences could be if the chemical was discovered.\nA spokesperson said: \"The advice remains \"if you didn't drop it, then don't pick it up. We are keeping the advice under review and will update it in due course.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk "

      "tags": "Energy industry,Climate change,Renewable energy in the UK,Renewable energy,National Grid",
      "text": "Great Britain's electricity system was the greenest it had ever been at lunchtime on Easter Bank Holiday Monday, its operator has said.\nSunny and windy weather, coupled with low demand for power, led to a surge in renewable sources of energy, National Grid Electricity System Operator said.\nIt meant low-carbon energy sources made up almost 80% of Britain's power.\nThere was no coal generation on the grid and just 10% of power was from gas plants, the operator added.\nThe National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) said levels of carbon pollution for each unit of electricity consumed dropped to just 39 grams of carbon dioxide - the lowest ever recorded for the grid - at 13:00 BST on Monday.\nIt said wind power made up 39% of the energy mix, with solar at 21% and nuclear accounting for 16%.\nThe burning of biomass accounted for around 4%. There is debate over the environmental costs of burning biomass, like wood, and the National Grid ESO categorises it separately from low-carbon sources and fossil fuels.\nBy comparison, on Tuesday, 24.8% of Britain's energy came from fossil fuels, most of which was gas (combined cycle), while 45.2% was renewable energy sources. \nThose fossil fuel figures have been dropping all year. In January, gas accounted for more than 43% of the energy mix, with coal at almost 5%, and then last month just 37% of Britain's electricity was generated from gas. \nThe previous record for Great Britain's greenest day was set during lockdown last year, on 24 May.\nWhen Britain went into lockdown, electricity demand plummeted and the National Grid responded by taking power plants off the network and the four remaining coal-fired plants were among the first to be shut down.\nThe new record may be a cause for celebration as the UK strives for a near zero-carbon society - but it's far from a surprise.\nTake the ingredients of a sunny, windy day on a bank holiday when factories are not working - coupled with a lockdown, and you're sure to cook up an impressive percentage of wind power. \nBut remember, as investment in renewables increases, these records will be happening regularly.\nThe real test for renewables comes when we face a cold, still, overcast February day when demand for heat and light soars and wind power is non-existent.\nThat will need much more energy storage than is currently available.\nThe government aims to have almost all electricity produced from low carbon sources by 2030 - and despite this week's impressive results, there's still a very long way to go. \nLast year as a whole saw many records broken for Britain's electricity mix, with an almost 68-day coal-free run between 10 April and 16 June, and solar providing more than a third of electricity supplies on several occasions during May. \nChristmas 2020 was also the first ever coal-free Christmas Day. \nMeanwhile, the highest ever amount of electricity generated by wind was on 13 February this year.\nFintan Slye, director at National Grid ESO, said: \"This latest record is another example of how the grid continues to transform at an astonishing rate as we move away from fossil fuel generation and harness the growth of renewable power sources.\n\"It's an exciting time, and the progress we're seeing with these records underlines the significant strides we're taking towards our ambition of being able to operate the system carbon free by 2025.\"\nThe record comes ahead of COP26, a UN international climate change summit, due to be held in Glasgow this November.\nKate Blagojevic, head of climate at Greenpeace UK, praised the progress on taking fossil fuels out of the energy mix, but added that it was \"no time for the UK government to rest on its laurels\".\n\"Carbon emissions from our homes, farms and roads remain stubbornly high, and only a major government intervention can unblock the impasse,\" she said.\n\"As the Glasgow climate summit looms closer, ministers really need to up their game on tackling UK carbon emissions right across the board.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Carmarthen,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has begun the rollout of its third coronavirus vaccine, the Moderna jab, in Wales.\nUnpaid carer Elle Taylor was the first to receive the vaccine and described feeling \"very excited and happy\". \nIn England, small business minister Paul Scully said the vaccine would be rolled out \"in the next few days\". \nUnder-30s in the UK are to be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine because of concerns about a link between it and rare blood clots.\nIt comes after a review by the drugs regulator Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) which found, by the end of March, 79 people in the UK suffered rare blood clots after vaccination - 19 of whom died.\nThe side-effects are however, extremely rare and the vaccine's effectiveness was proven, the MHRA said.\nEuropean regulators have also concluded that \"unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects\" of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\"The reported combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is very rare, and the overall benefits of the vaccine in preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects,\" the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said.\nThe Welsh government said it was \"considering the details\" of the announcement, but did not \"envisage a delay to the roll-out of our vaccine programme in Wales\".\nMiss Taylor, from Ammanford, received the first Moderna jab at the Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen.\nSpeaking afterwards the 24-year-old, who works at a further education college, said: \"I'm very excited and very happy.\n\"I'm an unpaid carer for my grandmother so it is very important to me that I get it, so I can care for her properly and safely.\n\"My grandmother has had her first dose and she is going for her second dose on Saturday.\"\nMiss Taylor said she only found out on Tuesday evening that she was to be the first in the UK to receive the jab by Moderna, an American company.\nBeverley Gower, from Kidwelly, who also received the jab, said she \"didn't feel it\".\nThe 49-year-old, who is also an unpaid carer so gets priority for the vaccine like Miss Taylor, added: \"This is a way forward, isn't it? A way back to normality.\"\nJohn Sanders, from Carmarthenshire, was the fifth person to receive the jab. \nHe said: \"It's massively important. I'm a carer for my disabled son who's now 22. He's had brain cancer and various chemotherapies and he's got immune problems as well, so it's obviously important for us.\"\nThe UK is committed to buying 17 million doses of Moderna, the third of seven vaccines developed in the UK or around the world that it has put in orders for.\nIt has not been confirmed when the rest of the UK will start using the jab, but Scotland received its first batch on Monday. \nLike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs which are already in use, the Moderna jab is given in two doses, several weeks apart.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said he was delighted its UK rollout was starting. \n\"The UK government has secured vaccines on behalf of the entire nation and the vaccination programme has shown our country working together at its best,\" he said.\nWales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said a third vaccine for use in Wales \"significantly adds\" to the nation's defences against Covid-19.\nAcross the whole of the UK, more than 31.6 million people have now had a first dose of a Covid vaccine - while 5.4 million have been fully vaccinated.\nIn Wales, more than 1.49 million people have had a first dose, while more than 469,000 people have had both doses.\nBut the UK's Covid vaccine supplies are set to be delayed by \"up to four weeks\" in April and Wales expects to have 250,000 fewer Oxford-AstraZeneca doses.\nMr Scully told Sky News the vaccination programme remained on track to cover all adults in England by the end of July. \nOn Tuesday, the trial of the Oxford vaccine on children stopped giving out jabs as a precaution.\nThe Moderna vaccine is a two-dose jab given at an interval of between four and 12 weeks.\nLike Pfizer's, it is an RNA vaccine and works by injecting part of the virus's genetic code into the body, where it enters cells and tells them to create antigens.\nThese antigens are recognised by the immune system and prepare it to fight coronavirus.\nNo actual virus is needed to create an mRNA vaccine, meaning the rate at which it can be produced is accelerated.\nIt also only requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer.\nTrial results suggested efficacy against the disease was 94.1%, and vaccine efficacy against severe Covid-19 was 100%.\nMore than 30,000 people in the US took part in the trial, from a wide range of age groups and ethnic backgrounds.\nThe government has bought 17 million doses - enough to vaccinate about 8.5 million people.\nScotland is due to receive more than one million of the UK's order, and the doses will arrive over a period of months.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon cautioned that the supply does not mean the vaccine programme will be accelerated.\nModerna said the vaccine was generally well-tolerated, with no serious safety concerns identified.\nEvents after the first dose included injection-site pain, and after the second dose fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, other pain and redness at the injection site.\nBut these were generally short-lived.\nRos Jervis, director of public health for Hywel Dda University Health Board, said the Moderna vaccine would be used alongside the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab in the rollout to communities in Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire.\n\"We are incredibly lucky to have a third vaccine in Wales, with a long shelf life and the ability to be easily transported, to help deliver the vaccination programme to small clinics across our rural communities,\" she said.\nDarren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health boards, told BBC Radio Wales the Moderna rollout would help the country make up for a reduction in Oxford-AstraZeneca supplies in April. \nMr Gething said every vaccine given in Wales was \"a small victory\" against the virus and people should go for their jab when invited.\nA Welsh Conservatives spokesman said the UK government's vaccination strategy had been \"fully vindicated\". \nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"We need to know what this milestone now means for further easing of restrictions.\"\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said the third vaccine came as \"welcome news\", adding the priority should be to vaccinate everyone \"as quickly and safely as possible\".

      "text": "For most people currently being offered the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  \nBut the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recommended that - because of an \"extremely small\" number of cases of blood clots in some who have had the jab - people under 30 should be offered other vaccines. \nEveryone's choice is different - weighing up the risk of potential side effects against the chance of contracting coronavirus and perhaps becoming seriously ill, or even dying. \nWe don't know enough to be able to plug the data into a calculator and get a simple, exact answer tailored to you. \nBut here's the best information we currently have on the possible risks and benefits.\nThe events are so rare, we need to start off with a huge number of people to make sense of them. \nSo, let's take a figure of 10 million imaginary people.  \nRegulators are continuously combing through the details of the rare clots that have occurred to work out how many might be caused by vaccination. \nAssuming the worst - that they all are - we can do some ballpark calculations to get a sense of the risks. \nBased on the figures announced on Wednesday by the UK medicines regulator, if 10 million imaginary people were given the AZ vaccine you might expect to see 40 of these clots - with about 10 clots having fatal consequences.  \nTen deaths out of 10 million people vaccinated is a one-in-a-million chance. \nThat's roughly the same risk as being murdered in the next month or - if you get in a car and drive for 250 miles - the risk of you dying in a road accident on that journey.\nRoughly 40 men and 100 women in our imaginary group of 10 million might expect to have one of these clots in any given year without vaccination, with more seen in younger people.\nThat's about 12 a month - so seeing a larger number in just a few weeks after vaccination is part of the picture of higher risk.\nOne review of this condition says that about three-quarters of those people would go on to make a good recovery, but a small number, say one or two people, might die within a month of the clot.\nThe European medicines regulator has said that by mid-March, they might have expected to see between one and two cases of this clot in people under 50 given the vaccine, but they had seen 12 - about nine times higher than they would expect.\nThese clots happen more often to pregnant women or people taking female hormones.  \nIn general, if you're on the pill the risk is about six times higher than if you're not.\nSo the risks of having a clot for those taking a contraceptive pill seem, at first glance, to be in a similar ballpark to the risks potentially linked to the AZ vaccine, but we can't know for sure with the data we have. \nTo be really sure, we would need to compare them directly in a single study. \nAnd whether or not you take a medicine depends on the benefits, as well as the risk.\nIf you delayed vaccinations for our 10 million people by a week, about 16,000 might catch coronavirus, based on current levels of the virus. \nIf they were all older adults, say 60-year-olds, maybe 1,000 would end up in hospital and 300 of them might be expected to die, far more than the 10 deaths from clots after vaccination that we mentioned earlier. \nBut for younger adults the risks of hospitalisation or death are considerably lower. \nGiven the same number of infected 40-year-olds, 16 might be expected to die. And the number of expected fatalities would be even lower for people in their 20s and 30s.\nSo for younger age groups the choice over whether to have the AZ vaccine is not as clear cut, especially when there are so many uncertainties in all these figures.\nBut death isn't the only issue. About a quarter of people who end up in intensive care with Covid have some form of clot resulting from the virus.\nAnd long Covid is more likely to affect 30-year-olds than 70-year-olds. On average, just over 2,000 of our group would still be dealing with Covid symptoms three months later, and more than half of them would be limited in their daily activities by those symptoms. \nWhile there's no simple number for everyone, for most people with a high risk of catching Covid or dying from Covid, the current data suggests very strongly \"your chances of remaining alive and well will go up if you take the vaccine and will go down if you don't\" as JCVI member Adam Finn explains.\nBut it does change for younger people.\nEngland's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty says: \"The closer you get to someone who's right down at 20, and otherwise blameless in their health, the more you have to think through these really very rare side effects - the risk/benefits might get closer to parity.\"\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article said that the annual incidence of CVT in the general population was 40 per 10,000,000 instead of 140 per 10,000,000."

      "tags": "Greenland,Arctic,Denmark,China,Mining,Greenland ice loss,Australia",
      "text": "Greenland's main opposition party has won an election which could have major consequences for international interests in the Arctic.\nThe left-wing Inuit Ataqatigiit, which opposes a mining project in southern Greenland, secured 37% of votes.\nIts leader said on Wednesday that the Kvanefjeld mine, home to major deposits of rare minerals, would not go ahead.\nThe social-democratic Siumut party came second, having been in power for all but four years since 1979.\nInuit Ataqatigiit, an indigenous party with a strong environmental focus, will now seek to form a government.\nGreenland is a vast autonomous arctic territory that belongs to Denmark. Although it has a population of just 56,000, the result of the election has been closely followed internationally.\nGreenland's economy relies on fishing and subsidies from the Danish government, but as a result of melting ice, mining opportunities are increasing. \nThe company that owns the site at Kvanefjeld, in the south of the country, says the mine has \"the potential to become the most significant western world producer of rare earths\", a group of 17 elements used to manufacture electronics and weapons.\nHowever, disagreement over the project led to the collapse of Greenland's government earlier this year, paving the way for Tuesday's snap election.\nMany locals had raised concerns about the potential for radioactive pollution and toxic waste in the farmland surrounding the proposed mine.\n\"The people have spoken,\" Inuit Ataqatigiit's leader M\u00fate Bourup Egede told Danish state broadcaster DR on Wednesday morning, adding that the project would be halted.\nThe head of the Siumut Party, Erik Jensen, told Denmark's TV 2 he believed the controversy surrounding the Kvanefjeld mine was \"one of the main reasons\" for its defeat, with 29% of the vote.\nThe party had supported the development, arguing that it would provide hundreds of jobs and generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually over several decades, which could lead to greater independence from Denmark. \nGreenland has hit the headlines several times in recent years, with then-President Donald Trump suggesting in 2019 that the US could buy the territory. \nDenmark quickly dismissed the idea as \"absurd\", but international interest in Greenland's future has continued.\nThe Kvanefjeld site is owned by an Australian company, Greenland Minerals, which is in turn backed by a Chinese company.\nChina already has mining deals with Greenland, while the US - which has a key Cold War-era air base at Thule - has offered millions in aid.\nDenmark has itself acknowledged the territory's importance: in 2019 it placed Greenland at the top of its national security agenda for the first time.\nAnd in March this year, one think tank concluded that the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand - known collectively as the Five Eyes - should focus on Greenland to reduce their dependency on China for key mineral supplies.\nMining isn't Greenland's only issue, however. \nThe territory is on the front line of climate change, with scientists reporting record ice loss last year. This in turn has significant implications for low-lying coastal areas around the world.\nBut it is the retreating ice that has both increased mining opportunities and raised the possibility of new shipping lanes through the Arctic, which could reduce global shipping times.\nThis changing reality has also increased focus on long-running territorial disputes, with Denmark, Russia and Canada all seeking sovereignty over a vast underwater mountain range near the North Pole known as Lomonosov Ridge. \nRussia, meanwhile, has been increasing its economic and military activities in the Arctic, where it has a long coastline, prompting concern from western governments."

      "text": "Mobile phones should be banned from schools because lockdown has affected children\u2019s \u201cdiscipline and order,\u201d the education secretary has warned.\nGavin Williamson told The Telegraph phones should not be \u201cused or seen during the school day\u201d, though he said schools should make their own policies.\nPhones can act as a \u201cbreeding ground\u201d for cyber-bullying and social media can damage mental health, he added.\n\"It\u2019s now time to put the screens away, especially mobile phones,\" he wrote.\n\u201cTechnology has been invaluable in keeping children learning during lockdowns and we support its use,\" he said.\n\u201cOutside the classroom, the use of mobile phones distracts from healthy exercise and good old-fashioned play. \n\u201cWorse, it acts as a breeding ground for cyber-bullying, and the inappropriate use of social media sites.\n\u201cWhile it is for every school to make its own policy, I firmly believe that mobile phones should not be used or seen during the school day, and will be backing head teachers who implement such policies.\u201d \nThe government will be consulting on how to help heads remove phones from schools, later this year, he added.\nThe vast majority of schools already have policies limiting the use of phones in lessons, according to data from Teacher Tapp, an app that conducts daily surveys of about 8,500 teachers.\nAccording to the app, about half of secondary schools and most primary schools do not allow phones to be used at break or lunchtime either.\n\u201cThe real issue flagged by secondary teachers is that rules and sanctions are inconsistently applied, and it isn't always clear whose responsibility it is to remove a phone, or if they are allowed to do so,\u201d Laura McInerney, co-founder of Teacher Tapp, said. \n\u201cHow the education secretary will change that problem isn't immediately clear.\"\nSchools have the power to ban phones from being taken on to the premises.\nBut government policy is that it is the responsibility of head teachers to determine whether this is appropriate.\nA ban has previously been backed by Nick Gibb, minister for school standards, Matt Hancock, former culture secretary and current health secretary, and Amanda Spielman, chief inspector of Ofsted.\nBut no laws have been made to enforce it in the UK.\nIn France, the law prevents children from using their phones inside school grounds. \nAnd, earlier this year, China\u2019s Ministry of Education announced that pupils would not be allowed to bring mobiles to school without written parental consent. \nMica-May Smith, from Bright Futures Education, an education training company, said a blanket ban was a bad idea \"as children may still bring them into school and hide them\".\nInstead, there should be a \"collaborative approach with rules in place\" including designated times and areas for use, she said.\n\"It is about bringing trust and preparing them for the adult world,\" she added.\nPhones should be incorporated into lessons as a \"fundamental part of the curriculum\", said Susan Wessels, deputy head of Framlingham College in Suffolk.\n\"Schools are designed to prepare students for the real world,\" she added. \"We must encourage pupils to use their phones constructively.\"\nBut half of parents support a ban on phones, a survey by price comparison site uSwitch last year suggested.\nShile Ismaila, a parenting blogger at African Mommy says banning phones would \"avoid distractions and helps kids focus on work\".\n\"Children spent more time than usual on their phones during the pandemic,\" she added.\n\"This was the main way to stay connected to peers which has more or less turned into an addiction now.\"\nMr Williamson also wrote about the need for discipline and structure as children return to schools.\n\u201cAlthough remote learning was a tremendous success in terms of enabling children to carry on with their lessons from home, the lack of regular structure and discipline will inevitably have had an effect on their behaviour,\u201d he said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "A trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine on children has stopped giving out jabs while the UK's medicines regulator investigates a possible link with rare blood clots in adults.\nProf Andrew Pollard from the University of Oxford told the BBC there were no safety concerns with the trial itself, but its scientists were waiting for further information.\nAround 300 volunteers signed up.\nEarlier, PM Boris Johnson said people should get their jab when invited.\nMore than 31.6 million people in the UK have had a first vaccine dose and a total of 5.4 million people have received a second dose.\nTwo vaccines - developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNtech - are being used in the UK, while a third - from Moderna - has been approved.\nThe trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on children, which started in February, is assessing whether the jab produces a strong immune response in those aged between six and 17.\nIts suspension comes after a European Medicines Agency (EMA) official, speaking in a personal capacity, said there appeared to be a link with the jab and rare blood clots.\nConfirming that the trial on children was being paused, Prof Pollard said: \"Whilst there are no safety concerns in the paediatric clinical trial, we await additional information from the MHRA on its review of rare cases of thrombosis/thrombocytopaenia that have been reported in adults, before giving any further vaccinations in the trial.\"\nParticipants are advised to continue to attend all scheduled visits and can contact the trial sites if they have any questions.\nUpdates from the EMA and the UK's regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), are expected in the coming days.\nThe EMA said its safety committee had \"not yet reached a conclusion and the review is currently ongoing\".\nThe MHRA says the benefits of the jab continue to outweigh any risk.\nAll medicines, from vaccines to paracetamol, have the potential to cause severe side effects.\nThe seasonal flu jab has around a one-in-a-million chance of causing the nerve disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome, for example.\nThe key question is whether the risks are worth the benefits.\nEven if the vaccine was the cause, and this is still not proven, the numbers suggest around one death in every 2.5 million people vaccinated in the UK.\nFor everyone over the age of 75 infected there is one death per eight Covid infections.\nFor those in their 40s it is one death per 1,000.\nSo on the face of it, the risk-benefit ratio is clearly in favour of vaccination - if you assume you are going to be infected at some point.\nBut what is needed now is more information about who has been suffering from these rare blood clots. How old are they? Do they have any underlying health conditions that could explain what happened?\nThis will help narrow down the scale of any potential risks.\nAn update from the UK regulator - as well as the European one - is expected in the coming days.\nDuring a visit to the AstraZeneca manufacturing plant in Macclesfield, Cheshire, earlier on Tuesday, Mr Johnson defended its vaccine.\n\"On the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, the best thing people should do is look at what the MHRA say, our independent regulator - that's why we have them, that's why they are independent,\" said Mr Johnson, who has received the first dose of the vaccine himself.\n\"Their advice to people is to keep going out there, get your jab, get your second jab.\"\nThe prime minister added: \"The best thing of all is to vaccinate our population, get everybody out getting the jab, that's the key thing and that's what I would advocate, number one.\"\nThe MHRA is investigating reports of a very rare and specific type of blood clot in the brain, known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), occurring together with low levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia) following vaccination.\nA number of countries have suspended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab among younger people, including in Germany, which has paused it for people aged below 60, and Canada, where the jab is not being given to those under 55.\nIn total, the UK has secured 457 million Covid vaccine doses, of which 100 million are from AstraZeneca. Vaccines from Moderna will be deployed in the UK \"around the third week of April\", Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi has said.\nThe MHRA has said it identified 30 cases of rare blood clot events out of 18.1 million doses of the jab administered up to and including 24 March. There have been seven deaths among the 30 cases.\nBut the regulator's chief executive Dr June Raine said: \"People should continue to get their vaccine when invited to do so.\n\"Our thorough and detailed review is ongoing into reports of very rare and specific types of blood clots with low platelets [the cells involved in clotting] following the Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca.\n\"No decision has yet been made on any regulatory action.\"\nOne of the members of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - which advises the government on the jab rollout - told the BBC's Newsnight that the issue was being taken seriously and \"we do need to get to the bottom of this\".\nProfessor Adam Finn, who was speaking in a personal capacity, said the trial of the jab on children was paused as a \"precautionary measure\" while they wait for clearer information, rather than because any problems had occurred.\nAsked if his opinion on the vaccine had changed in the last fortnight, Prof Finn cited thromboses being associated with low platelet count and a lack of associated cases with the Pfizer vaccine as being of particular concern.\n\"So those two things do raise the serious possibility that this could be a causal link and certainly means we need to take it very seriously and understand it more clearly,\" he said.\n\"I think personally it's surprising that we haven't seen any cases with Pfizer if it's simply uncausal so that's one of the reasons we're concerned about this.\" \nThere have been a further 2,379 coronavirus cases in the UK and another 20 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, according to the latest government figures."

      "text": "People diagnosed with Covid-19 in the previous six months were more likely to develop depression, dementia, psychosis and stroke, researchers have found.\nA third of those with a previous Covid infection went on to develop or have a relapse of a psychological or neurological condition. \nBut those admitted to hospital or in intensive care had an even higher risk.\nThe study authors pointed to both the effects of stress, and the virus having a direct impact on the brain.\nUK scientists looked at the electronic medical records of more than half a million patients in the US, and their chances of developing one of 14 common psychological or neurological conditions, including:\nAnxiety and mood disorders were the most common diagnosis among those with Covid, and these were more likely to be down to the stress of the experience of being very ill or taken to hospital, the researchers explained.\nConditions like stroke and dementia were more likely to be down to the biological impacts of the virus itself, or of the body's reaction to infection in general.  \nCovid-19 was not associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a risk from flu).\nThe study, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, was observational. So the researchers couldn't say whether Covid had caused any of the diagnoses - and some people would have had a stroke or depression in the next six months regardless.   \nBut by comparing a group of people who had had Covid-19 with two groups - with flu and with other respiratory infections respectively - the researchers at the University of Oxford concluded Covid was associated with more subsequent brain conditions than other respiratory illnesses.\nThe participants were matched by age, sex, ethnicity and health conditions, to make them as comparable as possible.\nSufferers were 16% more likely to develop a psychological or neurological disorder after Covid than after other respiratory infections, and 44% more likely than people recovering from flu. \nOn top of this, the more severely ill with Covid the patient had been, the more likely they were to receive a subsequent mental health or brain disorder diagnosis\nMood, anxiety or psychotic disorders affected 24% of all patients but this rose to 25% in those admitted to hospital, 28% in people who were in intensive care and 36% in people who experienced delirium while ill. \nStrokes affected 2% of all Covid patients, rising to 7% of those admitted to ICU and 9% of those who had delirium. \nAnd dementia was diagnosed in 0.7% of all Covid patients, but 5% of those who'd experienced delirium as a symptom.\nDr Sara Imarisio, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"Previous studies have highlighted that people with dementia are at higher risk of developing severe Covid-19. This new study investigates whether this relationship may also hold in the other direction.\n\"The study doesn't focus on the cause of this relationship and it is important that researchers get to the bottom of what underlies these findings.\"\nThere is evidence the virus does enter the brain and cause direct damage, neurology professor Masud Husain at the University of Oxford, explained.\nIt can have other indirect effects, for example by affecting blood clotting which can lead to strokes. And the general inflammation which happens in the body as it responds to infection can affect the brain.\nFor just over a third of people developing one or more of these conditions, it was their first diagnosis.\nBut even where it was a recurrence of a pre-existing problem, researchers said this did not rule out the possibility that Covid had caused the episode of illness.\nProf Dame Til Wykes, at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, said: \"The study confirms our suspicions that a Covid-19 diagnosis is not just related to respiratory symptoms, it is also related to psychiatric and neurological problems.\n\"Looking over six months after diagnosis has demonstrated that the \"after-effects\" can appear much later than expected - something that is no surprise to those suffering from Long Covid.\n\"Although as expected, the outcomes are more serious in those admitted to hospital, the study does point out that serious effects are also evident in those who had not been admitted to hospital.\""

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nUnder-30s will be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine. That's after a review by the UK's drugs regulator, the MHRA, found that by the end of March, 79 people in the UK had had rare blood clots following vaccination - and 19 of them died. The MHRA said this wasn't proof the jab caused the clots, but the link was getting firmer. Meanwhile, the EU's medicines regulator the EMA said unusual blood clots should be listed as a very rare side effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine, but the benefits outweighed the risks.\nThe head of one of the world's largest manufacturers of coronavirus vaccines, based in India, has said its production capacity is \"very stressed\". Adar Poonawalla, the head of the Serum Institute of India (SII), said in an interview on Indian television that it was \"still short of being able to supply to every Indian\" and that it was \"prioritising\" the country's needs.\nThe transport secretary has given driving lessons the green light in England and Wales from next week, with tests resuming on 22 April. Those looking for lessons in Scotland will have to wait until 26 April though, with tests restarting there on 6 May at the earliest. All lessons and tests have been cancelled in Northern Ireland.\nJamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan, has said the investment bank is expected to need just 60 seats per 100 people in offices in the coming years, as some staff take up part-time work from home on a permanent basis. Mr Dimon said he expected \"many\" staff to return to office locations full time, with \"some\" working under a hybrid model.\nA kayaker thought to have breached Covid rules by travelling from England to camp at Loch Lomond has had to be rescued after getting stuck on an island without a paddle.

      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is \"deeply concerned\" about scenes of violence in Northern Ireland. \nPolice were attacked, petrol bombs thrown and a bus set on fire in another night of disorder in Belfast. \n\"The way to resolve differences is through dialogue, not violence or criminality,\" he said. \nThe disturbances took place on both sides of an interface in the loyalist Shankill and nationalist Springfield Road areas of the city on Wednesday.\nForty-one police officers were injured in disturbances in parts of Northern Ireland over the Easter period, involving children as young as 13.\nThe BBC's Ireland correspondent Emma Vardy said crowds of a few hundred on each side threw petrol bombs in both directions on Wednesday night.\nThe disruption took place close to where a number of loyalist protesters had earlier gathered. \nPolice confirmed a vehicle was set alight at the junction of Lanark Way and the Shankill Road in the west of the city.\nOur correspondent said the arrival of a line of police cars interrupted the attacks over the peace wall.\nNorthern Ireland's power-sharing Executive will meet on Thursday to be briefed about what Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill denounced as \"the violence and street disorder which is causing huge distress in local communities\".\n\"Those involved in violence, criminal damage, manipulation of our young people and attacks on the police must stop,\" said Sinn F\u00e9in's vice-president.\nPolice also confirmed they had received a report of an assault on a press photographer.\nThe Police Federation for Northern Ireland said the violence could \"set our society back years\".\nCalling for the ongoing street disorder to stop, PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said he was \"open to dialogue with anyone who is willing to work with me to resolve the issues facing our community\". \nAddressing the rioters, he tweeted: \"Violence is not the answer.\"\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster condemned what she called \"vandalism and attempted murder\" and said it did \"not represent unionism or loyalism\". \nShe said the actions \"only serve to take the focus off the real law breakers in Sinn F\u00e9in\", and her thoughts were with the driver of the hijacked bus. \nJustice Minister Naomi Long of the Alliance Party said \"these are 'real law breakers', burning buses, terrorising passengers and attacking police.\n\"Let's focus on that and getting this stopped before someone loses their life.\"\nUlster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said the violence was \"unacceptable and unjustified\". \nTaoiseach (Irish PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin tweeted that he \"utterly condemned\" the unrest, adding: \"Now is the time for the two governments and leaders on all sides to work together to defuse tensions and restore calm.\"\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the scenes were \"very disturbing\" and that \"attacks on police, journalists and citizens must be condemned by all\".  \n\"There are peaceful, democratic and legal channels to address all issues and concerns. Calm and positive leadership needed from all,\" he said. \nThe attack on the press photographer, Kevin Scott from the Belfast Telegraph, took place on Cupar Way.\nMr Scott told BBC News NI: \"I cover everything as fairly and impartially as possible, working at both sides of the community covering both the positive and the not so positive,\" he said. \n\"I won't be deterred from covering stories that are important and note-worthy.\" \nNI Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said the hijacking and attack on a bus was \"sickening\".\n\"Those responsible for this and ongoing attacks on the PSNI need to stop,\" she tweeted.\nA number of Belfast services, including the Glider buses, have been suspended.\nIn total, 10 arrests have been made across Northern Ireland during disorder over the past week. \nThe Easter disturbances have been blamed on loyalist frustrations over a Public Prosecution Service decision not to prosecute people who attended the large-scale funeral of republican Bobby Storey in June 2020, as well as concerns about the NI Protocol in the Brexit deal.\nThe leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party, Ulster Unionist Party, Traditional Unionist Voice and Progressive Unionist Party have said the position of Chief Constable Simon Byrne is untenable over the PSNI's handling of the funeral.\nThat event was attended by a number of senior Sinn F\u00e9in politicians, including the deputy first minister."

      "tags": "Pensioners,Department for Work & Pensions,Personal finance,Women,Gender pay gap",
      "text": "Women on \u00a31-a-week state pensions could be owed tens of thousands of pounds, the BBC has learned.\nUntil recently, Carole Davies, 76, from Merstham in Surrey, was told she was entitled to less than \u00a31 a week.\nBut Mrs Davies, who retired in 2003, had been underpaid, not knowing she was actually eligible to receive a married woman's pension. \nEarlier this year, she discovered she was owed \u00a361,000 and entitled to \u00a382.45 per week. \nMrs Davies, a stay-at-home mum who worked in an administrative role for only a short period of time, had built up almost no entitlement to a state pension in her own right, as she had not built up enough National Insurance (NI) contributions.\n\"When I retired in 2003, my state pension was so low - 40p a week - I was told that it would be paid once a year,\" she told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Despite my husband Michael questioning this after he retired in 2005, we were told I wasn't due anything more.\"\nBut after watching a TV programme about pensions in November, she decided to contact the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) again, convinced she should be getting more. \n\"It's been pretty horrendous really and it just took so long. They just didn't seem to want to know and it was an uphill battle.\n\"In a letter I told them: 'I think you are waiting for me to die before you give me any money', and we still didn't hear anything back for weeks and weeks.\"\nWhen she finally heard how much she was owed, she said: \"I was totally, utterly stunned. I couldn't believe it.\n\"They should have written to everyone and told them what they were entitled to, but nobody did, so we didn't have a clue.\n\"It'll make a huge difference to our lives. My husband is 80 and I'm nearly 77. We should have had it earlier, it's so disgraceful what they've done.\"\nThe pension system is highly complex and many are unaware of the special rules for married women.\nIn March, documents revealed in the Budget showed an estimated 200,000 pensioners could be collectively owed up to \u00a33bn after the under-payment of state pensions for decades. \nA review, involving a team of more than 100 civil servants, is taking place to trace all the women who have been affected by systemic failures to automatically award pension pay rises, stretching back to 1992. The process could take up to five years.\nMs Davies is among 5,000 women entitled to potentially huge refunds, many of whom will not be captured by the DWP's search, due to a rule change in 2008.\nFormer pensions minister and partner at Lane Clark and Peacock LLP, Steve Webb, first highlighted the problem and the scale of the underpayments.\nHe told the BBC that under a little-known rule, the women who qualify for this concession are those who are getting a tiny amount of what is known as \"graduated retirement benefit\" (GRB) under the old state pension system, which ran until 1975.\nThe average amount they are receiving is around \u00a31.24 per week, but this is enough to qualify for a married woman's pension. They can backdate their claims to their husband's 65th birthday and could be in line for tens of thousands of pounds.  \n\"It is incredible that there are thousands of women getting such tiny pensions, but even more incredible that many could potentially be entitled to tens of thousands in back payments,\" said Mr Webb.\n\"It is as if they are sitting on unclaimed winning lottery tickets. It is very important that women on these very small pensions make contact with the DWP as soon as possible to see if they could be entitled to a windfall\".\nUnlike in other cases, this boosted payment is not automatic and women have to claim for it. That means many women know nothing about it and have missed out on this increase for years. \nA DWP spokesperson told the BBC: \"The action we are taking now will correct the historical underpayments that have been made by successive governments and anyone impacted will be contacted by us to ensure they receive all that they are owed.\"\nOver the years, the pension system has gone through many changes. \nWhen the state pension for all was first set up after the Second World War, men were often the main income earners. \nChildcare responsibilities meant some women didn't work for as many years.  \nUntil 2016, these women were therefore given a proportion of their husband's state pension - they could claim a 60% basic state pension, based on their partner's record of contributions.\nSince March 2008, they should have automatically got that increased payment - but a DWP error meant for thousands, that didn't happen. \nOver 1.3 million adults of pension age live in poverty - that is more than one in 10 of our elderly population struggling with debt, according to the poverty charity Turn2us. \n\"This money is going to make such a meaningful and positive difference to the finances of women affected,\" said Anna Stevenson, a welfare benefit expert at Turn2us. \n\"It is going to mean not having to worry about where the next meal comes and paying off those bills that have been looming large.\" \nShe added that it was vital that the DWP \"not let anyone slip through the net\". \n\"It is worrying that they plan to take five years to reimburse everyone. It is vital people get their money as soon as possible,\" she said. "

      "tags": "Bradford,Leeds Bradford International Airport,Leeds,Yeadon",
      "text": "A \u00a3150m proposal to redevelop Leeds Bradford Airport has been delayed to allow Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick more time to consider it.\nPlans to demolish existing buildings and build a new terminal were approved by Leeds City Council in February.\nBut that decision was referred to the government after objectors said it would contribute to climate change.\nThe government said it needed time to allow for \"proper consideration\" of requests for the plan to be called in.\nA date for a final decision has not been set, but the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has put in place an order which prevents Leeds City Council from granting planning permission without special authorisation.\nLeeds Bradford Airport said the new terminal was not an expansion as it could already expand passenger numbers with its existing facilities.\nIt added that the replacement building would be a more efficient and sustainable development helping it to achieve its carbon net-zero goals by 2023.\nA spokesman for Leeds Bradford Airport said: \"We acknowledge the deadline extension and hope the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government will uphold Leeds City Council's approval for our replacement terminal, which will deliver thousands of new jobs and support the region's economy.\"\nThe airport estimates the project will support 12,650 permanent jobs across the Leeds City Region, as well as creating 850 construction-related jobs.\nThe site handles about four million passengers annually and has already been granted permission to increase that to seven million over a 10-year-period.\nIn July 2020, a group of climate scientists warned the expanded airport's greenhouse gas emissions would be higher than those allowed for the whole of Leeds in 10 years' time.\nEnvironmental campaigners Greenpeace said the delay over a final decision on the redevelopment plans was a sign the government was \"starting to clock the catastrophic impacts of this proposed expansion\".\nRebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK's head of politics, said: \"But we're just months away from hosting critical global climate talks, and this climate-wrecking mega project is clearly incompatible with our plans to cut emissions, so why only delay the decision and not just call it in now?\"\nMeanwhile, in a tweet, the Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport, said: \"No airport anywhere should expand. Delaying this decision is good news.\"\nMr Jenrick's decision to - in effect - kick this local issue into the long grass has national significance because seven other airports as well as Leeds Bradford also want to expand their operations. They'll all be less optimistic now.\nTo be clear, the Leeds plan isn't dead. But it doesn't bode well for the airport that Mr Jenrick says he needs more time to decide whether to kill it or not.\nHis note to the airport didn't spell out his reasoning, but it's reasonable to assume Mr Jenrick wanted to avoid another bruising like the one he suffered recently after tacitly approving a plan for a coal mine in Cumbria. \nHe was forced into a U-turn on that issue.\nSo when will we get a final ruling? The government won't say, but my guess is we'll have to wait for the government's transport decarbonisation strategy due in the coming months that will show how all emissions from transport can be reduced.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "\"Women ask if I need help and offer an arm to direct me, men have taken the opposite arm and groped me.\"\nAngharad Paget-Jones, 27, is severely visually impaired and said some men have taken advantage of her under the guise of being helpful. \nONS figures from 2018 show disabled women were almost twice as likely to have experienced any sexual assault than non-disabled women.\nMs Paget-Jones said better education was needed to stop this happening.\nMs Paget-Jones, from Port Talbot, said she had been grabbed in public multiple times while out with her guide dog Tudor, which has left her \"feeling scared\".\nShe recalled one incident when she could hear a group of boys saying, \"you could just grab her, she can't see you anyway\", which led her to divert into a nearby shop for safety. \n\"Disabled women aren't valued. We're just seen as vulnerable, but we're not. It's society that makes us vulnerable,\" said Ms Paget-Jones.\nShe wants better education about how people with disabilities are targeted and better support for those who do report issues, as she said there had been times when she was not taken seriously.\n\"I reported an incident to a security officer in a well-known train station in London and he just told me my dress shouldn't have been so low cut.\"\nIn order to raise awareness Angharad has been using the hashtag #JustAskDontGrab on social media.\nThe hashtag and campaign, which encourages people to ask people with disabilities whether they actually need help, was started by visually impaired activist and campaigner Dr Amy Kavanagh in 2018. \nAngharad said the response to her tweets had been positive, however \"you always get bad with good\" and \"some men have taken offence\". \nOne man told her, \"if you don't want help, we'll just let you die\", she said.\nAmy-Claire Davies, 26, from Swansea, said she had had similar experiences.\nShe is a palliative care patient and has seizures from epilepsy along with severe chronic pain.\n\"I was in a nightclub with some friends in a manual wheelchair and a guy kept coming over and trying to interact with me. I very clearly kept saying 'no, go away',\" she said.\n\"He waited until my friends moved away. He knew I couldn't go anywhere. He came over and stuck his hand down my shirt.\"\nMiss Davies also said she had experienced being cat-called and shouted at in the street when she has been with a female carer, but not when she is with a male carer, and being disabled can encourage men to act inappropriately.\n\"When you have a mobility aid or something that people can see that makes you look more disabled, I think there are some people who will see you as more vulnerable and will take advantage of that,\" she said.\nShe added that men have a \"very different experience\" of being out in public even if they also have disabilities.\n\"A male friend of mine said after a night out why didn't I just wheel home in my chair rather than get a taxi.\n\"It was then that it kind of blew my mind of just how different an experience he has to me, I would never go out at night alone. \n\"We need to listen to the voices of women in Wales to tackle this problem.\"\nIn the three years ending March 2018, disabled women were almost twice as likely to have experienced any sexual assault in the last year (5.7%) than non-disabled women (3%).\nCharlotte Archibald, from Welsh Women's Aid, said research by the charity showed those who are disabled have a higher chance of being targeted and it was \"really important harassment and abuse is talked about in order to change these incidents\".\nShe said: \"We found that women in Wales with a disability are more likely to experience more frequent sexual harassment than non-disabled women.\n\"I think it's important that we understand that no woman experiences sexual harassment in the same way and that these experiences are often intertwined with other forms of abuse and discrimination.\"\nAfter hearing the experiences of Angharad and Amy-Claire, Ms Archibald said: \"I think it's horrible to hear that's the experience of these women, but sadly it's not also unexpected.\n\"The experiences of sexual harassment are very different for women who have a disability.\n\"They don't often have the mechanisms to remove themselves from those situations that another woman might have, and that's often overlooked.\"\nShe said that in order to make a difference, \"It's important that we really listen to the voices of disabled women in Wales and listen to their experiences and make sure that we're taking all of that on board and using that as a way to improve safety for women and Wales\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nA third Covid-19 vaccine will be rolled out in the UK later. The Moderna vaccine follows the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs, which are already widely in use. Seventeen million doses were ordered by the government and Wales will become the first nation to administer the two-dose vaccine in Carmarthenshire later today. Wales Health Minister Vaughan Gething says a third vaccine \"significantly adds\" to defences against Covid-19. \"Every vaccine given to someone in Wales is a small victory against the virus,\" he says. Scotland has received its first Moderna batch but not confirmed a rollout date. Neither has England, but yesterday the UK government's vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the Moderna vaccine would be deployed \"around the third week of April\". \nBrazil has recorded more than 4,000 Covid-related deaths in 24 hours for the first time, as a more contagious variant fuels a surge in cases. Hospitals are overcrowded, with people dying as they wait for treatment in some cities, and the health system is on the brink of collapse in many areas. The country's total death toll is now almost 337,000, second only to the US. But President Jair Bolsonaro continues to oppose any lockdown measures to curb the outbreak. He argues that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the virus itself, and has tried to revert some of the restrictions imposed by local authorities in the courts.\nCovid-19 raises the risk of depression, dementia, psychosis and stroke, a study finds. A third of those with a previous Covid infection went on to develop or have a relapse of a psychological or neurological condition but those admitted to hospital or in intensive care had an even higher risk. This is likely to be down to both the effects of stress, and the virus having a direct impact on the brain. UK scientists looked at the electronic medical records from the previous six months of more than half a million patients in the US, and their chances of developing one of 14 common psychological or neurological conditions. \nSchool staff have been giving clothing, food and furnishings to families that have been struggling financially in the coronavirus pandemic, teachers say. Some pupils have gone to school without winter coats, while others have been worried about having enough to eat, a National Education Union poll suggests. The Department for Education says it has invested \u00a32bn to help pupils in England in the wake of the pandemic.\nThe US is facing shortages of tomato ketchup after the coronavirus pandemic led to a surge in demand for sachets of the popular condiment. Heinz, the most widely sold brand of ketchup, says the rise in demand had been \"driven by... accelerated delivery and take-out trends\". The packs often accompany delivery orders and have effectively replaced the bottles kept on restaurant tables. The company says it has stepped up production.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "tags": "Companies,Deliveroo,Takeaway food,Gig economy",
      "text": "Deliveroo shares have edged up on their first fully open day of trading on the London Stock Exchange.\nShares rose more than2% to 286p at 12:00 on Wednesday, when 70,000 retail investors were allowed to trade.\nThey are still well below the 390p paid as the shares dived on their debut last week amid big investors' concerns over workers' rights and profits.\nHundreds of Deliveroo riders are expected to go on strike on Wednesday as they call for higher pay.\nDeliveroo said it was organised by a small \"union [that] does not represent the vast majority of riders\". \nThe firm employs 50,000 riders, but only 400 are expected to take part in the strike. They are calling for riders to be paid the living wage after accounting for costs such as fuel, as well as an end to unpaid waiting times.\nDeliveroo said its own survey data showed 90% of riders were happy with firm.\nThe food delivery firm's share sale marked London's biggest stock market launch for a decade, but the sharp fall seen saw it dubbed \"the worst IPO [initial public offering] in the history of London\".\nSmaller investors, known as retail investors, got their first chance to trade their shares on Wednesday as what is described as \"unconditional trading\" began.\nDespite small gains on Wednesday, the company's share price is still far below its 390p float price on its debut when big investors and Deliveroo customers could buy or sell shares. The company had initially hoped for a share price of up to 460p.\nDeliveroo, which has not yet made a profit, had to accept a lower price, saying it had chosen to \"price responsibly\" and sell its shares at the bottom of its planned price range due to \"volatile\" market conditions.\nInvestment bank Goldman Sachs, which was an adviser to Deliveroo and was responsible for stabilising the share price, had to buy about \u00a375m worth of Deliveroo shares to support the share price in the first few days, according to the Financial Times.\nAn IPO is one way for private companies to raise cash. An initial public offering sees shares offered to major investors, including pension and insurance companies, as well, sometimes, as private small investors. \nThey let the company know what they are prepared to pay for the shares, in conjunction with investment banks and other professional advisers hired by a company.\nThe shares then launch on a stock market. Deliveroo shares were only tradeable over the first week by major investors who had bought large chunks. Full trading, allowing anyone to buy and sell, began a week later. Trading on a stock market allows the price to be set freely in the open market by supply and demand.\nThe value of the shares, multiplied by how many there are, gives the market value of the company.\nSome of the UK's biggest investment fund managers, such as Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, charity fund manager CCLA, Legal and General Investment Management and M&G said they would not buy shares in Deliveroo, citing concerns, including over the working conditions of its riders.\nAnalyst Susannah Streeter at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown said that retail investors don't appear to share the same worries.\nShe said a surge of interest from smaller investors \"will be some comfort for Deliveroo customers who were encouraged to buy a slice of the company but appeared to have thrown the dice on a disastrous debut. \n\"They were locked out of selling their shares for a week, while the company's initial valuation fell sharply. Now they finally have a 'get out of jail' card, but it seems for now that many have kept it in their back pocket, waiting it out for prices to stabilise.\"\nNeil Wilson, chief market analyst of Markets.com, warned that the strike action by hundreds of UK riders due to start on Wednesday \"underlines the regulatory risk attached to the stock\".\nAbout 400 of the food couriers in five towns and cities are also expected to stage socially-distanced protests over pay and conditions.\n\"I'm going on strike for my basic rights and those of all the other riders struggling to get by and support families on Deliveroo poverty pay,\" said Greg Howard, a Deliveroo rider and the chair of the IWGB's couriers and logistics branch.\nHe said: \"I've seen conditions decline for years and then working through lockdown I contracted Covid-19 and got very little support from Deliveroo.\"\nBut Husain, a driver from Nottingham, told the Deliveroo survey: \"Deliveroo let you work whenever it suits you plus customers are so nice and respectful compared to other platforms. App is really easy to use and understand and shows you when to make good money.\"\nDeliveroo said it had surveyed 8,500 riders on Tuesday, and found 89% were happy with the company and flexibility it offers.\nA spokesperson said the IWGB union did \"not represent the vast majority of riders who tell us they value the total flexibility they enjoy while working with Deliveroo alongside the ability to earn over \u00a313 an hour. \n\"We are proud that rider satisfaction is at an all-time high and that thousands of people are applying to be Deliveroo riders each and every week. Riders are at the heart of our business and today we are beginning a new consultation with riders about how we should invest our new \u00a350m community fund.\" "

      "text": "England and Wales' contact tracing app will soon ask users to share details of venues they have checked in to, if they test positive for the coronavirus.\nThe update to the NHS Covid-19 app will be deployed ahead of shops reopening in both nations on 12 April, as well as outdoor hospitality in England.\nThe authorities will be able to use the information to tell other visitors if they need to be tested for the virus.\nBut the system has been designed to protect users' anonymity.\n\"The app has been designed with user privacy in mind, so it tracks the virus not people, and uses the latest in data security technology to protect privacy,\" said a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care.\nUntil now, the QR barcode-scanning facility only came into use if local authorities themselves flagged a location as being a virus hotspot by other means. \nThis would then trigger a process whereby each phone could check if it had been at one of the affected venues on the dates concerned, and send the owner an alert.\nBut the facility has rarely been used, despite more than 106 million check-ins.\nIn March, Sky News reported that \"capacity issues at a local level\" were blamed for this, with overburdened health protection teams unclear about what they were supposed to do.\nThe decision to automate the system via users' own actions could help address this.\nPeople might have reservations about disclosing where they have been and when.\nTo address this, the Department of Health has said a \"privacy-protecting\" approach is being taken.\nThe app will only share venue history data if users opt in. \nAnd rather than any names or other personal details being disclosed, the software will simply inform the system when an infected user had visited the locations.\nDepending on the thresholds set - for example how many infected users visited the same place on the same day - other app users can then be told to either monitor their symptoms or immediately get a test, whether they feel ill or not. \nIt is not intended that the check-in tool be used alone to force others to self-isolate.\n\"People shouldn't be worried about this as effectively they aren't being asked where they were, but rather where an unidentified person testing positive with Covid was,\" commented Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert from the University of Surrey.\nFurther details will be revealed in a forthcoming revision to the app's data protection impact assessment (DPIA) document.\nPrivacy advocates have, however, raised concerns about a parallel system being run in Scotland.\nUsers there are being asked to use a new app - Check In Scotland - to register at venues.\nIt is separate to the Protect Scotland contact-tracing app, and thus not bound to the same privacy-preserving measures demanded by Google and Apple, which provide some of the technology involved.\nCheck In Scotland uploads the name, email address and mobile phone number of each user to a \"secure\" centralised database along with the time of their visit to each venue.\nThe justification given is two-fold:\nUsers are told the data should only be used to try to combat the virus.\nBut the DPIA acknowledges that the information could, in theory, be disclosed for other purposes if demanded via a court order or ministerial direction.\nSome experts are concerned this leaves the door open to it being \"misused\".\n\"The concern is that this infrastructure, once in place, is unlikely to go away because the coronavirus will be with us for a long time,\" said Prof Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights at University College London."

      "title": "Covid: Under-30s offered alternative to Oxford-AstraZeneca jab",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Young people,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Under-30s in the UK are to be offered an alternative Covid vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab due to the evidence linking it to rare blood clots.\nThe recommendation comes after a review by the UK drugs regulator found that by the end of March 79 people had suffered rare blood clots after vaccination - 19 of whom had died.\nThe regulator said this was not proof the jab had caused the clots.\nBut it said the link was getting firmer.\nThe review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found: \nMeanwhile, the EU's medicines regulator says unusual blood clots should be listed as a possible very rare side effect of the AstraZeneca jab, but that the benefits outweighed the risks. Some European countries have restricted the vaccine's use.\nThe World Health Organization said the link between the vaccine and blood clots was \"plausible\" but not confirmed, adding that the clotting incidents were \"very rare\" among nearly 200 million people who have received the jab worldwide.\nNo treatment or vaccine is risk free. The key question is whether it does more good than harm.\nWednesday's update once again demonstrates the AstraZeneca vaccine does - even if you assume it's causing these clots, which has not been proven yet.\nThe risk of dying from one of them following vaccination is incredibly small - about one in a million.\nBy contrast, Covid kills one in eight people who are infected over the age of 75, and one in 1,000 infected in their 40s among those who develop symptoms.\nIt is less clear cut for those under 30, who are much less likely to die of Covid - although the AstraZeneca vaccine still presents more benefit than risk.\nHowever, other vaccines may be an even better bet.\nThe risk might look worrying, but it is actually very low, and usually we don't think about things just in terms of risk.\nFor example, travelling 250 miles in a car also carries with it a one-in-a-million chance of dying in an accident. How many think about that when they get behind the wheel?\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK's review confirmed that the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is \"safe, effective and the benefits far outweigh the risks for the vast majority of adults\". \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the AstraZeneca vaccine had \"already saved thousands of lives\" and the new advice should ensure people of all ages \"continue to have full confidence in vaccines\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer also urged people to \"trust in our doctors and scientists\" and said he was looking forward to receiving his second AstraZeneca dose.\nAstraZeneca said both the MHRA and the EMA reviews reaffirmed that the benefits of the vaccine \"continue to far outweigh the risks\". \nThe UK reported a further 45 deaths from Covid-19 and another 2,763 confirmed cases on Wednesday. Vaccinations remained low after the Easter weekend, with 186,793 second doses administered and 85,227 first doses.\nJune Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said the side-effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine were \"extremely rare\" - and more work was going to identify if the vaccine was definitely causing the clots. \n\"The balance of benefits and known risks is still very favourable for the majority of people,\" she said.\nBut she said for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\". \nShe added: \"The public's safety is at the forefront of our minds.\"\nDr Raine said there was a \"reasonably plausible\" link between the vaccine and the blood clots.\nThe review prompted the UK government's vaccine advisory group, the JCVI, to recommend that people aged 18 to 29 be offered an alternative vaccine where available.\nProfessor Lim Wei Shen, of the JCVI, said the move was being made \"out of the utmost caution rather than because we have any serious safety concerns\".\nProf Sir Munir Pirmohamed, chairman of the Commission on Human Medicines, said the risks had to be weighed against the consequences of Covid-19, which also causes clotting.\nHe said 7.8% of coronavirus patients suffer blood clots on the lungs, while 11.2% will suffer deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs.\nPeople who have had their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine should still get their second dose, the MHRA said. Only those who suffered one of these rare blood clots after the first dose should not get vaccinated, it added.\nPregnant women and people with blood disorders that leave them at risk of clotting should discuss the benefits and risks of vaccination with their doctor before going for a jab.\nAnyone who suffers symptoms such as a persistent headache, blurred vision or confusion for four days or more after vaccination or who experience unusual skin bruising, shortness of breath or chest pain are being asked to seek medical advice.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, described the move as a \"course correction\" - and said it was normal in medicine to change preferences in this way.\nHe also said the impact on the government's promise to offer all adults a jab by the end of July should be \"zero or negligible\" as long as the expected supplies of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines - the other two Covid vaccines in use in the UK - arrived as expected in the coming months."

      "text": "Driving lessons can restart in England and Wales on 12 April, the transport secretary has confirmed.\nGrant Shapps said driving tests will resume 10 days later on 22 April.\nThe Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will offer more tests and examiners, including at weekends and on bank holidays, \"so as many learners can take a test with all necessary safety measures in place\", Mr Shapps said.\nTests and lessons are currently suspended because of lockdown rules.\nIn Scotland, lessons will resume later on 26 April, with tests restarting on 6 May at the earliest. \nIn Northern Ireland, all driving lessons and tests have been cancelled as part of its current lockdown, which began on 26 December.\nAlong with car driving lessons, lorry and minibus lessons and driving theory tests can also resume from 12 April in England and Wales.\nDriving tests for motorcycles, lorries and cars with trailers can also take place from 12 April. All tests can now be booked online.\nThe pandemic has caused disruption for many people learning to drive, with lessons and tests cancelled across the UK.\nSome 2.97 million people in Britain aged 16-25 hold a full driving licence, down from 3.32 million people in March 2020.\nIt's the smallest total since at least November 2012, according to analysis of Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) records by the PA news agency.\nAmelia Sully initially had her driving test booked for November 2020. She moved that to February but then that got cancelled, and she's had to reschedule her test for June.\nDriving lessons with her parents have been \"stop-start\" due to the stay-at-home rules during lockdown.\n\"It's definitely frustrating. I've been a learner driver for over a year since I started on my 17th birthday,\" the 18-year-old from Oxfordshire tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\nHaving a car would have been helpful in cutting down her commute to sixth form from 45 to 15 minutes.\n\"It would be great to drive to friends' houses and go out, rather than having to rely on parents to take me to the nearest bus stop,\" she adds.\nAs she starts university in September, Amelia is worried if she doesn't pass in June, she'll have to wait even longer before trying again.\n\"I've had friends who have booked and they were moved to September. So if I had to book another one, you're looking at the end of the year.\"\nCovid safety measures include that learners and instructors should wear face coverings in lessons and tests, unless there is a good reason for them not to, the DVSA says.\nPeople doing a test in their own car should clean it beforehand, wiping down the dashboard and car controls.\nAt least one window on each side of the car must be open.\nThe return of driving lessons on Monday coincides with the next phase of England's lockdown easing - which will see people also returning to gyms, pub gardens and non-essential shops. \nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "tags": "Music",
      "text": "Record label Young Turks, which is home to Mercury Prize winners The xx and Sampha, has changed its name to avoid links with the mass killings of Armenians during World War One.\nBoss Caius Pawson said he named the label after a Rod Stewart song that evoked \"the solidarity of youth\".\nHowever, he said they had since learned how the name was a source of \"hurt and confusion\" for many people.\nThe Young Turk regime ruled the Ottoman Empire from 1908 and during the war.\nArmenia says 1.5 million people were killed in 1915-16 in an effort to wipe out the ethnic group. They regard it as genocide, and many historians and governments agree the killings were orchestrated.\nTurkey accepts that atrocities were committed but rejects the term genocide, estimating that 300,000 died. It argues there was no systematic attempt to destroy the Christian Armenian people and says many innocent Muslim Turks also died in the turmoil of war.\nPawson, whose label is also home to FKA Twigs, said it would now simply be called Young.\n\"Through ongoing conversations and messages that have developed our own knowledge around the subject, it's become apparent that the name is a source of hurt and confusion for people,\" he said.\n\"We loved the name for what it meant to us, but in retrospect should have listened more carefully to other voices and acted more quickly.\n\"We have always tried to affect positive change and knowing what we do now, it's only right that we change our name\".\nPawson added that the label, part of the Beggars Group, had also made a donation to the UK-based Armenian Institute \"in memory of those who were killed and those who survived.\"\nHis label has also released music by Kamasi Washington, Sbtrkt and Jack Penate."

      "text": "School staff have been giving clothing, food and furnishings to families that have been struggling financially in the coronavirus pandemic, teachers say.\nSome pupils have gone to school without winter coats, while others have been worried about having enough to eat, a National Education Union poll suggests.\nThe findings come as the NEU begins its annual conference on Wednesday.\nThe Department for Education says it has invested \u00a32bn to help pupils in England in the wake of the pandemic.\nThe NEU surveyed 10,696 members in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in March and concluded that schools and colleges had been a \"lifeline\" to many disadvantaged students during the past year.\nAsked about the poverty they had witnessed, one union member said: \"We have children that aren't clothed properly, without coats in winter, or have holes in shoes, and my school's inclusion team are excellent at working with the families to get them the support they need quickly and efficiently.\n\"We also have a stock of spare clothes that on occasion we can give to families.\"\nAnother NEU member said: \"I called home during the first lockdown and spoke to an older sibling who was panicking because the free school meals vouchers email hadn't arrived. \n\"It was the evening before a bank holiday weekend and there was no food in the house - I will never forget the panic in that girl's voice.\"\nAnother responded: \"We have had pupils and their families move into hostels during the pandemic when they were evicted.\n\"They were re-housed - but literally were given a house. No furniture, oven, fridge, washing machine, no carpets. Nothing. We rallied as a school and furnished two homes.\"\nDr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: \"It is now beyond doubt that child poverty is on the rise. The effects can last a lifetime, and young people have one chance in education.\n\"There is no doubt, too, that schools and colleges have been going beyond the call of duty for them during this past year, as they always do.\n\"The government, by contrast, spent much of 2020 voicing warm words about its concern for the disadvantaged, including when mounting arguments for the wider opening of schools and colleges in September and January.\"\nYet it had \"persistently failed to deliver for the young people in poverty\", Dr Bousted said.  \nThe NEU survey also asked members about plans to help pupils catch up on lost learning over the past year.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has made \u00a31.7bn of \"catch-up\" funding available in England to help children who have faced disruption from school and college closures during the pandemic.\nAs part of the recovery package, summer schools will be introduced this year for pupils who need it most, and tutoring schemes will be expanded.\nBut only one in five (21%) of NEU members surveyed thought tuition programmes were an important mechanism for supporting recovery, according to the teaching union poll.\nOnly 2% thought lengthening the school day or school term were important ways of supporting pupils who have missed in-person learning.\nMore than four in five (82%) said schools and colleges should be given the flexibility to decide what is important for pupils' learning and well-being.\nAround two in three teachers believe pupils should be supported through sport and exercise (68%) and increased creative and practical learning (66%).\nAsked about the benefits that they feel have emerged from the pandemic and what should be retained, more than a third of union members (37%) appreciated the greater levels of communication they had experienced with families by telephone and video link, while 57% said online parents' evenings had been a positive step.\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: \"We have already invested \u00a31.7bn in ambitious catch-up plans, with the majority of this targeted towards those most in need, while giving schools the flexibility of funding to use as they believe best to support their pupils. \n\"We are working with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure all pupils have the chance to recover from the impact of the pandemic - and we have appointed Sir Kevan Collins as Education Recovery Commissioner to specifically oversee these issues.\""

      "text": "Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong citizens expected to move to the UK under a new visa scheme will be helped to access housing, schools and jobs, the communities secretary has said.\nAround 27,000 applications have been made for visas brought in after Beijing imposed a national security law in the former British colony.\nThe visas give Hong Kong citizens the right to live in the UK for five years.\nRobert Jenrick told the BBC ministers wanted to provide \"necessary\" help.\n\"If they struggle, then we're here to support them,\" he said.\n\"That means local councils being there to provide them with housing, with the benefit system standing behind them, with all the support the state can offer to make sure that no-one gets into difficult times,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, one of Hong Kong's leading pro-democracy activists, Nathan Law, has been granted asylum by the UK. \nMr Law said the Home Office had accepted he was \"exposed to severe political persecution\" if he returned to Hong Kong.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK has a \"proud history of providing protection to those who need it\".\nSince 31 January, Hong Kong residents have been able to come to the UK for up to five years and apply for permanent residency.\nThe UK introduced the British National (Overseas), or BNO, visa after China passed a wide-ranging new security law for Hong Kong which makes it easier to punish protesters and reduces the city's autonomy.\nThe UK says the law is an erosion of freedoms and rights.\nGovernment sources said school places for the new arrivals, many of whom will have young families, were \"a pressure to be acknowledged\".\nIf the number of applications for the visas continues to rise at the same rate, they will far outstrip the Home Office's prediction of 154,000 arrivals in the first year of the scheme.\nMr Jenrick said he expected the new arrivals to make a \"real and important contribution\" to the UK - and that many had qualifications in teaching, medicine or engineering.\nBut community groups have previously raised concerns that BNO visa holders will need help to find jobs and housing. \nJabez Lam, the manager of one group, Hackney Chinese Community Services, said he thought around 7,000 people had arrived already.\nMany have booked into hotels or Airbnbs while they look for rented accommodation, he said.\n\"We believe as the lockdown eases that rate will accelerate,\" said Mr Lam.\nHis charity has already raised concerns with the government about school admissions and the right to obtain tenancies.\nIt also urged police to step up action against UK-based supporters of the Chinese government who might target Hong Kongers.  \nSimon Cheng, the chairman of another charity, Hong Kongers in Britain, said the UK government should also offer to help people who had taken part in protests against Beijing but who were not eligible for BNO visas.\nHe said: \"The BNO visa scheme is rather a life-boat scheme for rescuing people out of tyranny, and some of those may need actual help for resettlement, and to have a launch pad to contribute more to the UK economy and for sure, UK democracy.\"  \nAlthough the BNO visa states holders have no recourse to public funds in the UK, the government says those who become destitute may be offered assistance to access social housing and other benefits.\nThere will be 12 virtual \"welcome hubs\" in the nations and English regions to provide access to housing, education and employment. \nTeaching material about the UK's historical links with Hong Kong will be given to schools."
