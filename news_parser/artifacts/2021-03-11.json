      "tags": "Brain,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scientists from UK Biobank have embarked on a major study to determine Covid-19's long-term health impacts.\nUK Biobank is a biomedical database with medical images, genetic data and health information on 500,000 people.\nAbout 1,500 people who have had Covid will be scanned again to check how organs are affected by infection.\nIts chief scientist, Prof Naomi Allen, said it was the only study able to compare patient data before and after they have had Covid.\nProf Allen added: \"We knew at the beginning of the pandemic that Covid-19 was largely a respiratory illness. And now what we also know is that it seems to affect other parts of the body as well - the heart, the liver, the kidneys, and even the brain.\n\u201cSo researchers will be able to investigate the direct effects of coronavirus infection on changes in both the structure and the function of these organs.\u201d\nThe study will look at people with asymptomatic Covid, and others who had severe disease.\nBrain scans will also be carried out to try to aid understanding of long Covid.\n\u201cIt will enable researchers to investigate whether the effects of the virus on different organs of the body vary between how severe your infection was in the first place,\u201d explains Prof Allen.\nDetailed scans of 1,500 Biobank members who have not been infected will also be recorded.\n'Very proud of taking part'\nBrian Shepherd, 71, from Gateshead, is one of those taking part. \nIn November he spent five days in hospital after catching Covid.\n\u201cThe worst thing was when I got in the ambulance, with my wife standing on the pavement, and you think 'will I ever see her again?'.\"\nBut after five days of treatment, Brian was allowed home. He has recovered well, but still has some symptoms.\nHe hopes his scans - and those of the other Biobank volunteers - will help us to learn more about the after-effects of the disease.\n\u201cWe're all very proud of taking part in it, and feel that our little bit can help somewhere along the line for the rest of the world.\u201d\nScience is still in the early stages of understanding the long-term effects of Covid. \nResearch has already started to chart its impact. Scientists have discovered scarring on the lungs, inflammation and muscle damage of the heart, and kidney injuries.\nThe virus can also affect the brain, and some long Covid sufferers have said they are experiencing \u201cbrain fog\u201d - problems with memory and concentration, dizziness and depression.\nThe hope is the study could pinpoint some of the neurological changes that may have taken place.\nProf Paul Matthews, a neuroscientist from Imperial College London, said: \u201cThe brain scans can tell us more general things about the brain structure. Whether there's evidence for inflammation in the brain that may be persisting, and whether there's been damage enough to to actually kill nerve cells in the brain that may cause some shrinkage.\u201d\nThese scans will be repeated over the coming years - and made available to researchers all around the world.\nThe team says our understanding of the health legacy of Covid is just beginning.\nFollow @BBCMorelle on Twitter"

      "text": "Mexico's lower house has approved a bill that would legalise the recreational use of cannabis. \nIt will now go to the Senate for a final vote, which President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador's party is confident will pass. \nThis would make Mexico one of the world's largest regulated markets for cannabis.\nMexico has struggled with a bloody war against powerful drug cartels, with violence killing thousands yearly.  \nLawmakers voted in favour of the bill by 316 votes to 129. It had already been approved in the Senate in November but another vote is needed following some alterations by the lower house. \nThe legislation would let users with a permit carry up to 28g and grow as many as eight plants at home for personal use. At present, it is illegal to carry more than five grams. \nIt would also allow for other licences for the cultivation, transformation, research and export or import of cannabis, Reuters news agency reports. \nMr L\u00f3pez Obrador has argued that the bill could help tackle the country's powerful drug cartels. \nOne lawmaker from his Morena party told AFP news agency that the law would help to achieve peace. \nHowever critics have argued that the bill could make marijuana more accessible to children. Others have questioned why Mexicans would be able to buy as much alcohol as they like, yet be liable for prosecution if they grow more than eight cannabis plants. \nShould the bill be approved, Mexico would become the third country in the world, after Uruguay and Canada, to legalise cannabis for recreational use nationwide.\nA number of foreign cannabis-growing companies from Canada and California are said to be interested in tapping into the market opportunity presented by the legislation.

      "tags": "Kemi Badenoch,LGBT",
      "text": "Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch should \"consider her position\", a former member of the government's LGBT+ advisory panel has said.\nJayne Ozanne quit the panel, along with two other advisers, claiming delays in banning conversion therapy.\nShe told the BBC Ms Badenoch did not understand the LGBT+ community and should stand aside for someone who \"had more heart for the work\".\nThe government vowed to produce a plan to \"end\" conversion therapy \"shortly\".\nCampaigners want legislation banning the controversial practice, which aims to change sexual orientation or gender identity.\nDowning Street said it was considering \"both legislative and non-legislative options\" to \"bring an end to\" it. \nBut, asked if that meant it could end up with measures short of a ban, a spokesman refused to go further.\nIn July last year, the prime minister said the practice was \"absolutely abhorrent\" and said plans to ban it would be brought forward.\nIn a debate in Parliament on Monday, Ms Badenoch said conversion therapy had \"no place in a civilised society\", but added that \"robust\" laws were already in place to deal with the most troubling examples, involving violence and sexual assault.\nShe said the government did not \"intend to stop those who wish to seek spiritual counselling as they explore their sexual orientation.\"\nBut she added: \"There will also be cases where a line is crossed, where someone is actively seeking to change another's sexual orientation.\"\n\"The government will be exercising great care when considering what constitutes conversion therapy, what does not and therefore how the government should intervene,\" Ms Badenoch said.\nMs Ozanne told the BBC she thought it had been an \"appalling speech\" and that she was \"increasingly concerned about what seems to be anti-LGBT rhetoric\" from the government.\nShe said she did not believe that Ms Badenoch and Liz Truss - who is also an equalities minister - \"had the best interests of the LGBTQ community\" in their minds, adding: \"I don't think they understand us.\"\n\"I do think there are others more suited to this role who have more time to engage, and more heart for the work\", she said.\nA government spokesperson said: \"Earlier this week the minister set out the government's desire to end conversion therapy, making it clear that the practice has no place in a civilised society. We are working to bring forward plans to do so shortly.\"\nThere have been rumblings for a while about a growing unease among some panel members which are now playing out in a very public way.\nThe advisory group was first set up under Theresa May but hasn't met for some time - I'm told at least six months.\nAnd now we've heard claims that, even when it did meet, panellists didn't necessarily feel listened to.\nIf the group does appear increasingly defunct (and we'll have to see what happens) it may be seen, by some, as symbolic of a fading commitment to LGBT+ equality under this administration.\nMinisters would reject that and, during a debate on Monday, Kemi Badenoch said the government had a \"proud record\" of championing equal opportunity.\nBut it was her response overall that seems to have sparked these resignations.\nAmong concerns was her refusal to commit to a legislative \"ban\" on so-called conversion therapy, promising instead only to \"end\" the practice.\nThe equalities minister described the legal landscape as \"complex\". But it's an awkward one for Boris Johnson who did, last summer, use the word \"ban\" during a TV interview.\nWhen she resigned from her advisory role on Monday, Jayne Ozanne accused ministers of creating a \"hostile environment\" for LGBT+ people.\nTwo others who then also quit the panel, James Morton, and Ellen Murray, said they also had concerns about the government's approach to conversion therapy and trans rights.\nLabour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government \"has a blind\" spot in the issue.\n\"The PM needs to address what is obviously a problem in his government,\" he said at his party's local election campaign launch.\nAsked if he would ban conversion therapy if he were prime minister, Sir Keir replied: \"Yes, absolutely.\"\nThe LGBT Advisory Council was set up in 2019, with the term of current panel members set to end on 31 March."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,Dominic Raab,Charles Michel,Coronavirus vaccines,Brexit",
      "text": "Post-Brexit checks on some EU goods coming into Great Britain have been delayed by six months in order to give businesses more time to prepare. \nThe government said the new timetable would help firms recovering in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe need for health certificates on imports such as meat and milk will be pushed back from next month to October.\nAnd in-person inspections on such animal products due from July will now begin in January 2022.\nIt is the second time that the timetable for these checks, originally due after the post-Brexit transition ended in January 2021, has been put back.\nThe European Union has been implementing full checks on goods sent from the UK since the start of this year. \nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the disruption caused by the pandemic had \"lasted longer and has been deeper than we anticipated\".\nIn a statement outlining the changes, he insisted the government had been \"confident of being ready on time\" for the checks to take effect. \nBut he added: \"We have listened to businesses who have made a strong case that they need more time to prepare.\"\nUnder the revised timetable:\nThe British Retail Consortium, which represents everything from major supermarkets to fast food chains and online businesses, said it would have been \"foolhardy\" not to delay checks given the current state of border infrastructure and IT systems. \nIts director of food Andrew Opie said the new timetable had come \"in the nick of time,\" with many border posts \"little more than a hole in the ground\".\nHe added that pushing ahead without a delay \"might otherwise have seen empty shelves for some products\".\nHe urged the government not to \"rest on its laurels,\" and use the next six month to \"establish and communicate the new systems\" with businesses. \nLabour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Jack Dromey said the government's \"chopping and changing\" of rules \"smacks of ill-preparedness and incompetence\".\n\"They have had years to prepare for this but can't stop missing their own deadlines,\" he added.\n\"The government need to pull their sleeves up, listen to businesses who have been desperately coming forward with practical solutions, and get this sorted.\"\nThis extension is not ideal, but it does mean that supermarket shelves, for example, should be kept relatively well-stocked during the recovery from the pandemic. \nIt is far from clear that all port infrastructure would have been ready to cope with these import arrangements. \nIt is theoretically possible that other countries exporting to the UK would argue these grace periods violate key world trade principles on offering the same access to all countries.\nIn practice, in the middle of a pandemic, it seems unlikely that a few months' continuation of favourable import arrangements for EU firms would really lead to a significant backlash. \nBritish exporters that are facing non-tariff barriers in trade with the EU and even with Northern Ireland, might, however, express concern about the impact of EU competitors having ongoing free access to the UK market. \nEffectively there has been a post-Brexit transition period - but only for EU firms exporting into the UK.\nThe latest delay comes amid a row over the UK's decision to postpone a separate set of border checks on GB goods arriving in Northern Ireland.\nUnder the UK's withdrawal deal, Northern Ireland is following the EU's rules on goods in order to avoid border posts with the Irish Republic. \nBut that has required a new set of checks on goods going between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \nThe UK has unilaterally pushed back the full implementation of some of these checks, after disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries.\nThe UK has insisted the move is lawful and justified - but the EU has threatened a legal challenge. \nEarlier, the EU's diplomatic representative in the UK called for a reset in relations, amid rising tensions over borders and other issues. \nJoao Vale de Alemeida said there was a need to \"change the mindset\" and \"give up on trying score points on the disputes of the past\".

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nCancer patients are much less protected against Covid-19 than other people after one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, a study suggests. However their immune response was greatly boosted by a second jab after three weeks, as recommended before the government extended the gap to 12 weeks to give some protection to greater numbers more quickly. Senior study author Dr Sheeba Irshad, from King's College London, says the \"really worrying\" findings should prompt an urgent review, although Cancer Research UK says the study is yet to be reviewed and patients should continue to follow GPs' advice.\nThe Northern Ireland Executive meets later to discuss when all children should return to school. Education Minister Peter Weir wants all pupils in Northern Ireland back in classrooms by 12 April, and is recommending all remaining primary school pupils who have yet to return go back on 22 March. Department of Health advisers previously warned against a full return of schools.\nShop owners say they are being \"treated like children\" with a lack of detail about when non-essential retailers in Wales can reopen. Ministers will meet on Friday for a lockdown review. But Lucy Hywel, secretary of the Y Fenni Business Community in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, tells 5 live: \"We're days away from possibly opening and we have no idea whether we're going to, or not.\" The Welsh government says it cannot provide as much predictability as it would like.\nYoung people have had to cope with anxiety over schoolwork, on top of limits on their social lives and contact with friends. One group from a range of organisations in Northern Ireland told Stormont's Education Committee about the pandemic's impact on their mental health.\nDid you know some people were practically immune to Covid-19? John Hollis didn\u2019t realise he\u2019d been infected but later discovered he\u2019s one of the rare people who has \u201csuper antibodies\u201d. Scientists hope studying people like John can teach them how to make better vaccines and treatments.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nFind out which areas are being mass-tested, and why.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's much-anticipated interview with Oprah Winfrey has aired in the US and the UK - with the couple sharing their side of the story about life in the Royal Family.\nThe couple spoke about their relationships with other royals, racism and how their mental health suffered.\nMeghan spoke with Oprah for most of the interview, before being joined by Prince Harry.\nOne of the biggest allegations from the interview was that there were \"several conversations\" within the Royal Family about how dark Meghan and Harry's baby might be.\n\"In those months when I was pregnant [there were] concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,\" said Meghan.\nShe said the conversations were with Harry, who relayed them to her. Both she and Harry refused to say which royal said it. \n\"That conversation, I am never going to share,\" said Harry. \"At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked.\"\nHarry also said that it hurt him that his family never spoke out about the \"colonial undertones\" of news headlines and articles.\nOne story that circulated in the newspapers a few years ago was that the Duchess of Cambridge was left in tears by Meghan in the run-up to the wedding in a row over flower girl dresses.\nBut Meghan told Oprah the reverse was true. \n\"A few days before the wedding [Kate] was upset about the flower girl dresses and it made me cry,\" Meghan said. She said Kate later apologised and brought flowers and a note to make amends. \n\"I'm not sharing that piece about Kate to be disparaging about her,\" Meghan said. She said Kate was \"a good person\" and hoped that she would have wanted the false stories corrected.\nMeghan spoke about how lonely she felt after joining the Royal Family and the loss of her freedom. \"When I joined that family, that was the last time until we came here that I saw my passport, my driver's licence, my keys, all that gets turned over,\" she said.\nShe said her mental health got so bad that she \"didn't want to be alive any more\".\n\"I went to the institution and I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help, said I had never felt that way before and need to go somewhere, and I was told that I couldn't, that it wouldn't be good for the institution.\"\nShe said she went to \"one of the most senior people\" within the institution and then to the palace human resources department. \"Nothing was ever done,\" she added.\nPrincess Diana's name came up many times throughout the interview - with similarities drawn between their experiences of being in the Royal Family.\n\"I didn't even know who to turn to,\" said Meghan, of the time when she was struggling. \"One of the people I reached out to who's continued to be a friend and confidante was one of my husband's mom's best friends.\n\"Because it's like who else could understand what it's actually like on the inside?\"\nOprah asked Harry about his relationships with his family and especially with his father, the Prince of Wales, and brother, the Duke of Cambridge. \nAt one point after stepping back as senior royals, Harry said Charles \"stopped taking my calls\".\n\"I feel really let down because he's been through something similar, he knows what pain feels like and Archie's his grandson.\n\"But at the same time, of course I will always love him but there's a lot of hurt that's happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship.\"\nOn William, Harry said he loved him to bits and they have been through hell together. \"But we were on different paths.\"\nHarry said he has a \"really good\" relationship with his grandmother and he has spoken to her more in the past year - including video calls with Archie - than he has for many years.\n\"She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be.\"\nMeghan also praised the Queen and said she gave her some beautiful jewellery for the couple's first joint engagement together as well as sharing a blanket with her to keep warm while travelling together.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, Harry said his family \"literally cut me off financially\".\nHe said the Netflix and Spotify deals that he and Meghan have struck to make shows and podcasts were never part of the plan but \"I had to afford security for us\".\n\"But I've got what my mum left me and without that we wouldn't have been able to do this.\"\nThe couple reveal that, after they were cut off, American billionaire and media mogul Tyler Perry provided Harry and Meghan with a home and security last year when they moved from Canada to southern California.\nMeghan said that the evening after she told Harry that she was feeling suicidal, they had to attend an official event at the Royal Albert Hall.\nMeghan spoke about a photo that has haunted her because of what it reminded her of.\nShe said a friend had commented how great the couple looked but she added: \"That picture, if you zoom in, what I see is how tightly his knuckles are gripped around mine,\" she told Oprah, as she became emotional. \n\"We are smiling and doing our job but we're both just trying to hold on. \"Every time those lights went down in that royal box, I was just weeping.\"\nTalking about the first time she met the Queen, Meghan said she was surprised to learn she had to curtsy. \nShe said she thought it was just \"part of the fanfare\" and didn't happen inside the Royal Family\nShe described having to quickly practise curtsying before an impromptu lunch with the Queen. \"I said: 'It's your grandmother,\" said Meghan. \"He said: 'It's the Queen.'\" \nMeghan added that she hadn't done any research on the family before joining - and insisted she had never looked up her husband online while they were dating.\nMillions of people watched Harry and Meghan tie the knot at Windsor Castle in 2018. That ceremony was when they were legally married - but the couple revealed they also exchanged vows in front of the Archbishop of Canterbury three days before.\nMeghan said: \"We called the archbishop and we just said, 'look, this thing, this spectacle is for the world but we want our union between us... just the two of us in our backyard'.\"\nHarry spoke about Archie, and the joy he gets from taking him out on bike rides. The interview included a clip of the toddler playing on the beach with his parents.\nThe couple joked that his favourite word for the past few weeks has been \"hydrate\", and Harry said whenever anyone leaves the house, Archie tells them \"drive safe\".\nThe couple confirm they're expecting a baby girl in the summer.\nHarry said it was \"amazing\", adding: \"What more can you ask for?\" - but said they would be done after baby number two arrives.\nTowards the end of the interview, Oprah asked if Meghan had got her happy ending with Prince Harry after all. \"Greater than any fairytale that you've ever read,\" she said."

      "tags": "Bradford,Brazil,South Gloucestershire Council,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Four further cases of the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil have been identified in England, bringing the total in the UK to 10.\nThree cases of the P.1 variant are in South Gloucestershire and are said to be close or household contacts of the two existing cases in the area.\nThe other new case was identified in Bradford.\nScientists previously said the variant appears more contagious and there were concerns over its response to vaccines.\nBut Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said last week it was hoped that vaccines would have a strong impact on reducing hospitalisations and deaths in cases of the new variant.\nThe new Bradford case tested positive for Covid-19 in late February after travelling back from Brazil via Paris on 14 February. \nSubsequent genomic sequencing identified the case as the P.1 variant, Public Health England said in a statement. \nThousands of positive Covid cases, from all across the UK, are sent for this further sequencing every week as scientists aim to identify any variants of the virus. \nThe new South Gloucestershire cases were uncovered when people were offered testing in response to the initial cases found in the area last month - and those who tested positive had their results sent on for further analysis.\nSpecialist contact tracing teams are working to identify any further contacts and additional testing has been in place since the initial cases were identified.\nContact-tracers have advised close contacts of the individual in Bradford to isolate and get a test.\nThere are now seven cases of the P.1 variant in England and three in Scotland, all of which have links to travel or to a previously confirmed case that has travelled to Brazil.\nIt was always known more cases of the P.1 Brazil variant were coming.\nWhen it was confirmed 11 days ago the variant was here, it was known two household members of the original South Gloucestershire cases had tested positive for Covid.\nThe results of the genomic sequencing to check which variant they had was not yet complete, but the expectation was it would be P.1.\nWhere does this leave us? A quarter of all Covid cases are being checked for variants and all the indications are that they are not spreading.\nThe new P.1 cases brings the total to 10, while there have been just over 300 cases of the South African variant and another 113 cases where the UK virus has acquired the E484 mutation which allows it to escape some of the immune response.\nThere will be more variants out there that have not been detected, but given that overall week-on-week Covid infection levels are lower we can be confident the variant is not taking hold.\nMonitoring this though is crucial to help the UK decide if vaccines updates are needed ahead of next winter.\nSeparately, Public Health England said a new variant identified in the UK was designated a \"variant under investigation\" on 4 March. It is not known where this variant first emerged.*\nIt said the variant - known as VUI-202103/01 - contains the spike mutations E484K and N501Y, both usually associated with so-called \"variants of concern\". \nBut it added that \"it does not feature specific deletions that would lead to a designation as a [variant of concern]\".\nNo additional cases have yet been found.\nIn other developments, rough sleepers and other homeless people in England will be prioritised to receive a coronavirus vaccine, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. \nIt comes after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said people who are homeless or sleeping rough were likely to have underlying health conditions and should be offered jabs alongside those in priority group six - people aged 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality.\nThey should also be offered the vaccine without the need for an NHS number or GP registration, the JCVI added.\nMeanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases in the UK has risen compared with recent days, after a further 6,753 cases were reported, according to the latest data.\nAnother 181 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have also been recorded.\nAs of 10 March, some 23,053,716 people had received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 1,351,515 had received a second dose.\nNews that the Brazil variant had been found in the UK was released in February. Three cases were initially found in England, and separately three in Scotland.\nThe three cases in Scotland were all oil workers who were returning to their families from Brazil, via Paris and London. \nIn England, two of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire who tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February.\nThe third case in England - now confirmed to be in Croydon - prompted intensive tracing efforts in the region as the identity of the person was initially unknown as he or she failed to register their test properly. \nBut that person was found at the end of last week and it was confirmed that he or she had  \"stayed at home\" and there was no sign of any onward transmission.\nUnder current Covid restrictions, holiday travel is not allowed in the UK or abroad. Anyone travelling abroad has to fill in a \"Declaration to Travel\" form, stating a valid reason for leaving the country, such as education or work, and journeys within England are only allowed for limited reasons.\nThere are also travel bans on 33 countries \"where the risk of a new variant is greatest\", including Brazil and other South American nations. \nHowever, the ban on travellers from South America came into effect on 15 February, after one case of the Brazilian variant had already been detected in the UK. The latest Bradford case is also a person known to have travelled from Brazil via Paris just before that change came in.\n*This story has now been updated to reflect new information on UK variants on the Public Health England website. PHE previously reported two cases of the VUI-202103/01 variant had been found in the south-east of England in individuals who had recently been in Antigua. PHE now says: \"Despite the travel history of these cases there is no scientific evidence to determine where this variant first emerged.\""

      "text": "The UK urgently needs new legislation to restrict foreign influence over its government and institutions, according to ex-MI6 officer Christopher Steele.\nMr Steele, who compiled a dossier on former US President Donald Trump's ties to Moscow, told the BBC that Russia and China were the greatest concerns.\nHe called for those working on behalf of foreign countries to be registered, like they are in the US and Australia.\nThe Home Office says such a scheme will be part of forthcoming legislation.\nMr Steele told the BBC: \"The word is out that that we're a bit of a soft touch - that we don't have regulators with teeth and we don't have legislation which is up to date and fit for purpose.\" \nThe former spy was behind the so-called Trump-Russia dossier, which was released in 2017 and alleged that there had been collusion between Moscow and Mr Trump's 2016 election campaign.\nIts claims sparked controversy and lawsuits and Mr Steele remained unwilling to discuss it in detail with the BBC.\nBut he did warn that the UK was in a worse position than the US when it came to foreign influence on public life.\nHe said the US, unlike the UK, had the tools in the form of legislation to go after those secretly working on behalf of foreign nations. He pointed specifically to its Foreign Agent Registration Act, which has been the model for recent Australian legislation. \n\"We are way behind our allies,\" he said.\nThe threat comes not from traditional espionage - undercover agents stealing secrets from governments - but from people who wield influence to serve the agenda of foreign governments without being open about it.\n\"There's a lack of transparency in Britain about the way in which foreign actors, and particularly those emanating from authoritarian states, are exerting influence over our policies,\" Mr Steele said.\nRussia's goals included lobbying to keep Russian individuals off sanctions lists and disguising who was behind particular businesses, he added.\nHe argued that China's influence was more \"diffuse\" and concentrated in areas like academia. Mr Steele said there was a risk that if the UK became dependent on money from China in these areas, it would be less likely to criticise Beijing's behaviour. \nSome parts of the economy have become over dependent on foreign money, Mr Steele said, and professionals in the UK needed to be more diligent about knowing who their clients were.\nLast summer, a report from the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) on Russian activity in the UK called for new powers to counter the influence - which the government has said it is looking at.\nMr Steele argued that individuals working on behalf of foreign states should be required to register.\n\"When you talk about foreign agents in this instance you are not talking about people who are committing treason or selling secrets to the Russians or the Chinese. You are talking about their agents, in the sense of people who are pursuing their agenda in the UK for money,\" he said.\nThis included PR companies, lobbyists, law firms and even, Steele acknowledged, private intelligence companies like his own if they carried out work on behalf of foreign governments.\nHe said the intention was not to ban lobbying on behalf of foreign governments - which can be legitimate -  but to make it \"transparent and accountable\".\nConservative MP Bob Seely issued a report last month for the Henry Jackson Society think tank calling for a Foreign Lobbying Act which would require foreign agents and their proxies to register. \nMr Steele, who said he had briefed MPs on the issues, said there needed to be criminal sanctions for failing to register - otherwise there would be a risk that any fine would be factored in as a cost of doing business.\nThe new Australian law, passed in 2018 amid concerns over Chinese influence, includes penalties of six months to five years in prison for failing to register or providing misleading information.\nMr Steele also thinks the definition of foreign agents needs to be broadly drawn to capture influence in areas like academia and the media - although he believes government and politics remain the top targets. \n\"Politics is the ultimate goal of the authoritarian states we're talking about and their influence operations, because ultimately it's governments that make decisions about legislation and it's governments that make decisions about imposing sanctions,\" he said.\nThe risk of not taking action, Mr Steele believes, is that influence will grow to the point where it prevents sanctions being imposed on Russia and China.\nThe former intelligence officer questioned why the ISC's recommendations had not yet been implemented. \n\"I think it's very urgent and I'm surprised, in a way, that the more hasn't been done about it, since the ISC report came out,\" he said.\nMr Steele said he was worried that a post-Brexit drive for investment would make it harder to clamp down on such activities, with risks for the integrity of the institutions. \n\"Eventually, in the long term, you will lose out because people will realise that your country has been compromised,\" he added.\nThe Home Office said the government would introduce a foreign agent registration scheme \"as part of forthcoming legislation to counter hostile activity by states\". \n\"This follows consideration of similar laws in like-minded countries including the US and Australia,\" the statement added."

      "text": "Vigils highlighting women's safety on the streets are being organised following the disappearance of Sarah Everard in south London.\nReclaim These Streets events are planned across the UK on Saturday, and in Clapham, where she was last seen.\nOrganisers said it was \"wrong that the response to violence against women requires women to behave differently\".\nThousands of women are sharing online their anxieties and anger about staying safe when alone in public places.\nFollowing the arrest of a police officer on suspicion of Ms Everard's kidnap and murder, the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick said: \"I know Londoners will want to know that it is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets.\n\"But I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public - particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing - will be worried and may well be feeling scared.\"\nOrganisers of Saturday afternoon's vigil on Clapham Common said local police had \"told women not to go out at night this week\", but they say \"women are not the problem\".\n\"This is a vigil for Sarah, but also for all women who feel unsafe, who go missing from our streets and who face violence every day.\"\nVigils are planned for other cities and towns on Saturday, including Cardiff, Liverpool and St Andrews.\nThe disappearance has prompted discussion on social media about the precautions women feel they have to take when they go out on their own.\nHelena Wadia told BBC Radio 5 Live said she wrote about her experience on Twitter to highlight how common it is for women to feel unsafe.\nShe said: \"The first time I was catcalled I think I was about 12 years old. I have been self-policing since then, we moderate everything.\n\"Our clothing, our drinking, we get taxis where maybe we can't afford it, we hold keys between our fingers, we don't wear headphones when we're jogging, we stick to well-lit areas. It's exhausting.\"\nAnother tweet asking women if they have ever faked phone calls, changed route, or even run in fear after feeling threatened by men in public spaces has been liked more than 120,000 times.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said the concerns shared by women \"are so powerful because each and every woman can relate\". \n\"Every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence,\" she added.\nMaya Tutton, who created the Our Streets Now anti-harassment campaign, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she first experienced harassment in public at the age of 12.\n\"What these incidents make you do is\u2026 that they make you fear going outside and they make you feel that you are not an equal citizen to your male counterparts and that you don't have those fundamental human rights to go about your everyday life without living in fear,\" the 22-year-old said.\n\"We're so at the end of our tether with violence against women and girls never being a priority and never being an issue that we put money and resources into tackling.\"\nMs Tutton added: \"By not putting the emphasis on the perpetrator and on really tackling that culture, what we're doing is we're not getting to the root of the problem - we are being forced to change our behaviour.\"\nLabour MP Jess Phillips, the shadow domestic violence minister, said there should not be a message to women \"where we're told what to do or what we have to do\".\n\"The reality is that for most women they have had some sort of experience that they feel frightened of,\" she told the Today programme.\n\"Women aren't weak because of a fault in their personality, women are weak because of men's violence.\"\nAs part of an International Women's Day debate in the House of Commons on Thursday, she read out the names of 118 women who have died since this date last year - where a man had been charged or convicted as the primary perpetrator.\nIt took more than four minutes for her to do so. \nShe told MPs there was currently no government study into the patterns every year of women who are killed. \"Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives - dead women is just one of those things.\"\nBut, she added: \"Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common. Dead women do count.\"\nMs Phillips concluded saying that the name of Sarah Everard, not included on the list, \"rings out across all of our media\". \"Let's pray every day and work every day so that nobody's name ends up on this list again,\" she said. \nJulie Bindel, a campaigner on women's issues since the 1970s, said: \"The message from wider society and from all police officers during these many operations on violence against women should be a message for men. \n\"Only men can stop male violence.\"\nShe praised a tweet from one man, Stuart Edwards, who asked if there were steps men could take to reduce women's anxiety.\nMarian FitzGerald, a visiting professor of criminology at the University of Kent, said while women's fear was real, statistics showed women were less likely to be murdered than men.\nShe said Ms Everard's disappearance \"shouldn't make women any more fearful than they already were\".\n\"Yes, the fear is real and it is always heightened when something like this is in the news. That doesn't mean to say that the risk has changed,\" she said.\n\"It hasn't changed much over many years. Women account for about a third of all murders. Men are far more likely to be murdered. \n\"Men are far more likely to be murdered by someone they don't know. Men are far more likely to be murdered in public places.\"\nAsked about young women who have said they should not have to be fearful, Ms FitzGerald said: \"In terms of the risk that we face, I know that the current situation is frightening... the reason why we remember these cases is because they are so rare and we should hold on to that.\"\nIn 2019-20, 71% of female murder victims were killed at home compared to 36% of male murder victims. Around one in 10 of female murder victims were killed on the streets. \nThe World Health Organization reported this week that one in three women across the world have been subjected to physical or sexual violence in their lifetimes."

      "title": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe needs mental health treatment, charity says",
      "text": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman held in Iran since 2016, needs urgent treatment for her mental health, according to a medical report sent by a charity to the UK government.\nThe charity worker faces a new court hearing in Tehran on Sunday, a week after her ankle tag was removed. \nThe report says she is suffering from major depression and PTSD. \nDespite her sentence coming to an end, she is still waiting to return to the UK to be reunited with her family.\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison in 2016 for membership of organisations working against the Iranian government, allegations which she has always denied. \nPrior to the recent removal of the ankle tag, the dual national had been under house arrest in Tehran since being released from jail last March. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has called for her permanent release so she can return home to her husband and young daughter in the UK. \nThe report - commissioned by the human rights charity Redress - says she was interrogated for hours, often blindfolded, while in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence. \nThe Redress report was based on a medical evaluation carried out virtually by doctors while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was under house arrest towards the end of last year. It was completed last month and sent to the government on Thursday. \nNeither Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her husband Richard has felt able to read the report in full, but both feel that it is important to have her ordeal documented, giving the charity the go-ahead to share the details with the BBC.\nIn the medical evaluation, she also told doctors she suffered hair loss, had to listen to her female guard talking loudly to her child while separated from her own daughter, and developed OCD around washing. \nAccording to the report, her post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and obsessive stress disorder are due to \"extremely stressful, traumatising experiences in the prisons of Iran\" and the uncertainty about her fate - and warns things could worsen without her being treated and reunited with her family in the UK. \nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, was arrested in April 2016 while travelling to visit her parents in Iran with her British-born daughter, Gabriella, who is now six years old.\nWhilst in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence, she was interrogated - often blindfolded - for eight to nine hours a day, she told the doctors who examined her online.  \n\"The interrogations were traumatising,\" she is quoted as saying in the report. \"They were threatening to send my child away, told me my husband was a spy, that he had already left me, that he was lying to me, that he worked for the British intelligence service.  \n\"They said he was unfaithful, they said he was not an accountant and that he had always been lying to me. They told me I had been fired from my job.\"\nShe says she was in a tiny cell - a 1.5 to 2-metre square - during solitary confinement. It had no window, made her feel claustrophobic and she could not tell the difference between night and day.\n\"The light was left on all the time there was only a dirty mat on the floor with a thin blanket to sleep on,\" she says. \"There were times I could not breathe.\"\nShe was only allowed one sanitary pad a month during this time. \nMr Ratcliffe says of his wife's documented experiences: \"This is mental torture. It's a really horrific experience. And it's cumulative. And it builds up. And of course, most of it has been hidden away. \n\"She didn't talk about it a lot when she came out. I don't talk to the media about some of the stuff. But I think it's important to put it on the record. It's important that our government takes responsibility for protecting people.\"\nThe two doctors carrying out the evaluation were told that, while in prison, she developed OCD centred around cleaning rituals.  \nMr Ratcliffe spoke to the BBC of his wife's \"need to try and control what you can, leading to a sort of obsessive control about certain things and having certain routines to cope with the other things you can't control - all the things that are completely out of your hands\". \nHe adds: \"And of course, Nazanin's entire life is out of her hands.\"\nHer interrogators tried to pressure her into co-operating with them, in exchange for clemency, she told the doctors.\n\"I said that I could not do, that I said I needed so much psychological help that I was not even sure I could work for myself, let alone work for my captors,\" she reported.\nShe told the doctors that one of her female guards would talk loudly to her child just outside her cell, while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was separated from her own daughter. \n\"It was unbearable,\" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe told the medics. \"I dreaded her shifts as I knew she would do that to torture me.\"\nIn July 2018, she spent a week in a psychiatric hospital, accompanied by prison guards and chained to the bed by both her feet and hands. \nHer incarceration took a significant physical toll on her health as well, the report finds. At one point, in jail, her hair was falling out and she was too weak to climb up to the top bunk in the women's ward where she was held for most of her imprisonment.\nThe report details the continuing guilt and anguish she feels and says she has tried to put a brave face on her ordeal and hide her symptoms from her parents, with whom she now lives. \n\"She knows that her suffering traumatises her parents and that her post-traumatic symptoms, like irritation and anger, harm her parents' psychological health,\" the report says. \n\"She also knows that her absence might create serious traumatic problems in her daughter who is being forced to grow up without the presence of her caring mother. Her imprisonment is a huge burden on her marital relationship. As her husband is struggling to gain her freedom, these efforts also keep him in a constant state of stress and suffering instead of continuing the ordinary life of a parent and a husband.\"\nDr Michele Heisler, medical director of Physicians for Human Rights, is one of the doctors who conducted the evaluation for the Independent Forensic Expert Group.  \nShe described Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe as a \"remarkably resilient woman\" who was \"trying to keep hope, trying to be strong\" during her evaluation. \nBut she said: \"Her current situation continues the psychological torture. Although she has finished five years of being imprisoned, she faces ongoing threat and uncertainty.\"\nShe may have spared her parents the details, but Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe reported to the doctors that she felt constant sadness, had suicidal thoughts, and suffered other manifestations of extreme anxiety - including trembling, tingling, and hot and cold sweats.\nConcern that lumps in her breasts could be cancerous have contributed to her anxiety. And she also has continuing neurological and muscular-skeleton problems, as a result of prolonged confinement, according to the report.\nThe doctors say it is \"possible that the positions in which she was handcuffed for extended periods led to nerve and joint injury\" in her right hand.\nAnd even once she is safely home in the UK with her family, the report makes clear that there will be a long road to recovery.  \nShe will need medication as well as psychotherapy and treatment for her physical symptoms.\n\"Nazanin's healing can be only provided in the UK in the presence of her family after reunification,\" it concludes. \"In order to recover, she needs to be in a safe and non-threatening environment.\"\nBut it's not clear whether Sunday's court hearing will be used to block her return to the UK.\n\"The threat of a second trial remains very real,\" says Rupert Skilbeck of Redress, which acts as her and her husband's legal representative.  \n\"This report is evidence of the severe suffering that Nazanin has experienced in Iran due to the mistreatment suffered and the cruelty of a legal process that has never followed the rule of law, making it impossible for Nazanin to know when she will be reunited with her family.\"\nHer treatment, Redress says, clearly amounts to torture.\nIn a statement, the Foreign Office said: \"Iran continues to put Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe through a cruel and intolerable ordeal. Nazanin must be allowed to return permanently to her family in the UK and we will continue to do all we can to achieve this.\""

      "tags": "Germany,Nazism",
      "text": "A court in Germany has declared a 96-year-old former Nazi camp guard unfit to stand trial but ruled that he should pay his own legal fees.\nThe man, named as Harry S, was accused of complicity in the murder of several hundred people at Stutthof Camp.\nThe court in Wuppertal said there was a \"high degree of probability\" he was guilty of the crimes.\nHis is one of three recent cases related to the Stutthof camp, which was located in then Nazi-occupied Poland.\nBruno Dey, 93, was handed a two-year suspended prison sentence last July after being found guilty of complicity in the murder of more than 5,000 prisoners.\nIn February, 95-year-old Irmgard F - who was a secretary at Stutthof - became one of the few women to be charged with aiding and abetting Nazi-era mass murder.\nHarry S was a guard at Stutthof between June 1944 and May 1945.\nHe is alleged to have overseen the transportation of nearly 600 prisoners to the gas chambers at Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in September 1944.\nHe was charged with aiding and abetting in their murder in 2017.\nStutthof also had gas chambers and was notorious for the atrocious conditions in which some 100,000 inmates were kept. Many died of disease and starvation, while others were gassed, shot or given lethal injections.\nThe victims included many Jews as well as non-Jewish Poles and captured Soviet soldiers.\nThe west German court said in a statement on Wednesday that \"due to his physical condition,\" Harry S \"was no longer able to reasonably represent his interest in and outside of the trial\".\nBut it went on to say that, as a guard at the camp, he would have overseen the transports and \"recognised the scope and dimension of the mass murder committed\" there.\nAs there was a \"a high degree of probability\" of his guilt, Harry S should pay his own expenses, the court ruled. It is not known how much the costs are, or whether the defendant will appeal.\nStutthof was officially designated a concentration camp in 1942. It was the first such camp built outside German borders in the war and the last to be liberated, by the Soviet army on 9 May 1945.\nMore than 65,000 people are thought to have died in the camp. Guards began using gas chambers there in June 1944.\nGermany has been pursuing former Nazi camp workers since a landmark ruling in 2011 that convicted a former guard, John Demjanjuk, as an accessory to mass murder. He died pending an appeal, but the verdict set a legal precedent.\nPreviously, courts had required evidence of former SS guards' direct involvement in atrocities."

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,London Heathrow Airport,Air travel",
      "text": "Heathrow Airport regularly sees queues of three hours and sometimes six hours at border control, according to Emma Gilthorpe, its chief operating officer. \nEarlier this month, passengers complained of waiting up to seven hours, which one said was \"inhumane\".\nBut Border Force said many passengers were arriving without having bought mandatory Covid testing packages.\nThe enforcement body added that people should only be travelling for limited reasons.\nSeparately, hundreds of Heathrow passport control are set to take industrial action.\nUnions representing Border Force officials said the delays were partly caused by Covid restrictions requiring immigration officials to work in a bubble of 10.\nThey said this prevented more staff being deployed if the border was particularly busy.\nBut Nick Jariwalla, director of Border Force at Heathrow, said: \"We are in a global health pandemic - it is illegal to go on holiday and people should only be travelling for very limited reasons. \n\"Unfortunately, a large number of passengers are continuing to arrive without having purchased their mandatory testing packages for the second and eighth days of quarantine in the UK. \n\"This causes delays as passengers may receive a fine or be subject to other enforcement action.\"\nMr Jariwalla said all arriving passengers had to purchase the testing package before leaving the airport. \n\"We make absolutely no apologies for this,\" he added. \"Every essential check stops the spread of coronavirus in the UK.\n\"These people should not have been allowed to travel without their testing packages and we are following up with regulators and carriers to ensure the law is enforced.\"\nSpeaking to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Ms Gilthorpe said that pre-Covid, the queues for EU arrivals were supposed to be 25 minutes, and 45 minutes for non-EU arrivals. \nWhile she said she expected the length of waiting to go up during the pandemic, Ms Gilthorpe said the levels the airport was currently seeing were \"unacceptable\". \nWhile Ms Gilthorpe said the measures in place for quarantine hotels were running relatively smoothly, with a small number of passengers, she said the same could not be said for the border. \n\"We are seeing significant pressure on the border and we are seeing very long queues, and that is a worry,\" she said. \nAlthough Ms Gilthorpe said she knew additional resources had been introduced, the issues were caused by \"the level of complexity of the processes and the way resource is being deployed\". \nInternational arrivals must now provide proof of a negative Covid test taken 72 hours before departure to England and a passenger locator form which contains details of either a purchased hotel quarantine stay, or two test kits for at home quarantine. \nShe told the committee: \"It is deeply frustrating as the operator of the airport when you have a queue full of people and you only have two desks open.\n\"It is rare to see all the desks manned and we have to find our way to how we make that happen so we can get that flow.\"\nHeathrow's self-service e-gates at passport control are currently closed. \nAirport rivals\nMs Gilthorpe said she hoped that by the summer, the gates would also be able to scan passenger locator forms and pre-departure testing results, but that had not yet been integrated into the system.\nThe Heathrow executive also warned that if the long queues continued after international travel is permitted. it could risk the country's economic resurgence. \n\"Heathrow is Britain's hub airport, it is the front door. We have to get our economy moving and we have to make sure we are capable of receiving people,\" she said.\n\"If you have a poor experience at the border, there's a risk you won't come back again. That traffic will go to Charles De Gaulle [airport in Paris], it will go to Frankfurt and we will miss out on that economic resurgence,\" she said.\nThe queue delays come as staff in the PCS union served notice of industrial action over rosters they describe as \"unworkable\".\nThis will involve a month of action short of a strike by hundreds of staff, including working to rule and an overtime ban.\nThe roster changes include ending the ability of staff to swap and request certain shifts, the union said.\nIn February, staff voted for strike action over the changes, the union said."

      "text": "A boy who suffered life-changing burns in a caravan fire that killed his brother, three, is attempting to climb the equivalent of Everest at home.\nZac Harvey died in the blaze last January, during a sleepover with his father near Tregaron, Ceredigion.\nHis brother Harley, then aged four, was not expected to survive his injuries - but 14 months on has made a nearly full recovery. \nThe cause of the fire is unknown but not being treated as suspicious.\nThe boys' father, Shaun, also required hospital treatment and the family is awaiting an inquest. \nThe morning after the fire, the boys' mother Erin, who was still at home a few miles away and unaware what had happened, woke to a series of missed calls and messages.\nShe was told Harley had been transported by air ambulance to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children for immediate surgery, but that three-year-old Zac was still in the caravan in Ffair Rhos.\n\"The police came then, and even though I knew what they were going to say about Zac, when they said it, everything came crashing,\" she said.\nAfter being told the devastating news, Erin made the three-and-a-half-hour journey to Bristol to be at her son's bedside.\nHarley remained in a critical condition in an induced coma, with bandages protecting the wounds all over his body. The prognosis was not good.\n\"They [the medical team] sat us down and said prepare for the worst and for Harley not to make it\u2026 but nothing could prepare us for when we entered that room,\" said Erin. \"It was a big shock\u2026 it was quite hard.\"\nIncredibly, the small boy beat the odds with his recovery. Just three weeks later he took his first steps to the amazement of family and hospital staff.\nA further three weeks and Harley was home, just before the coronavirus pandemic saw the country go into lockdown. \nBeing confined to home brought back memories of the son Erin had lost.\n\"When I came home from hospital, that's when it really hit because everything was so quiet,\" she said.\nLiving in rural mid Wales during the pandemic has meant Harley has not had the outpatient physiotherapy treatment he needed for his left hand and arm.\nHis future recovery will continue in Swansea's Morriston Hospital, so Harley, now aged five, and his older brother Alex have decided to raise money for local charity Welsh Dragon Burns Club.\nTheir aim over 12 weeks is to climb the equivalent of the 29,031ft (8,848m) to the summit of Mount Everest, which they calculate to be about 44,000 steps. \n\"Originally we wanted to walk up Snowdon but... doing that on stairs wasn't enough of a challenge, so we went for Everest,\" said Erin.\n\"Harley and Alex have been so great, especially Harley. His positivity and energy has helped us all get through it, especially me.\n\"Every day there'll be something that reminds me of Zac and I'll get emotional. But I have the kids to help pick me back up and get on with it for them.\""

      "text": "So, now we know what a laser sounds like on another world.\nThe US space agency's Perseverance rover has deployed its SuperCam instrument on Mars for the first time.\nThis high-intensity light probe can identify rocks at a distance. It's a technique that was also employed by Nasa's previous rover, Curiosity. \nBut Perseverance has some enhancements, including a microphone that allows us to actually hear the laser at work.\nThis isn't just some nice-to-have feature, a gimmick for PR purposes, but provides extra information that is useful to scientists.\nThe sound of the laser hitting rocks reveals knowledge such as the hardness of the targets being investigated.\n\"If we tap on a surface that is hard, we will not hear the same sound as when we fire on a surface that is soft,\" explained Naomi Murdoch, from the National Higher French Institute of Aeronautics and Space, in Toulouse. \n\"Take for example chalk and marble. These two materials have an identical chemical composition (calcium carbonate), but very different physical properties.\" \nIn a media briefing on Wednesday, Dr Murdoch played three different sounds recorded by the SuperCam microphone. One was of the general sound of Mars, the second was of some wind gusts, and the third was the staccato pops from the laser in action.\nPerseverance landed in Mars' Jezero Crater on 18 February to search for evidence of past life. The deep bowl is regarded as an excellent location for such a quest because it almost certainly held a lake billions of years ago; and where there's been water, perhaps there's been life, too.\nThe SuperCam instrument was developed in a partnership between French and American research teams.\nIts first rock target selected for study was dubbed \"M\u00e1az\", which means Mars in the Navajo language spoken by Native Americans in the southwestern United States.\nM\u00e1az was found, to no-one's real surprise, to be basaltic in nature. Basalt is very common on Mars.\nIt's a rock that contains a lot of magnesium and iron, and is the sort of thing that forms from rapidly cooled lava. \n\"We don't know yet if this rock itself is igneous, ie volcanic, or perhaps if it is a sedimentary rock made up of igneous grains that were washed down river into Jezero lake and cemented together,\" said SuperCam principal investigator Roger Wiens, from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.\n\"We'll have to use more of our techniques and study the surrounding area to understand those details some more.\"\nPerseverance has spent most of its first three weeks on Mars going through post-landing checks. It has, though, started driving in a north-easterly direction.\nAn immediate goal is a helicopter experiment. The rover brought a small chopper with it from Earth.\nThe vehicle is looking for a suitable stretch of terrain where the 2kg device, called Ingenuity, can be put safely on the ground. At present, the aircraft is slung beneath Perseverance's belly."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nIt's approaching two weeks since the UK identified its first cases of the Covid variant first found in Brazil. Now four more cases have been spotted in England, taking the total to 10. Three of the cases are in South Gloucestershire and are said to be close or household contacts of two existing cases, while one case is a person in Bradford who returned from Brazil last month. There are concerns this variant - called P.1 - spreads more easily and may respond less well to vaccines, but experts are working to adapt them. There's more on the Brazil variant here.\nAlthough the government warned yesterday it was too early to book a foreign holiday, there's some promising news for people hoping to travel across the Channel this summer. France is easing its rules on travel to and from seven countries outside the EU, including the UK. It put the restrictions in place in January to try to stop the UK variant, but that variant is now circulating widely there. All passengers to France will still need to show proof of a negative Covid test.\nDenmark and Norway have both temporarily suspended use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine after officials received reports of fatal or life-threatening blood clots in a small number of people. AstraZeneca says the safety of its vaccine has been studied extensively, and both the EU and UK drugs regulators say there is no evidence of a link between the vaccine and the clots. The number of cases in vaccinated people was no higher than in the general population, the EU regulator adds. Our health editor Michelle Roberts says it \"may sound worrying, but it is not yet known if there is any connection between the two things\".\nNew figures released today show the Covid surge in January has had a negative impact on NHS waiting times in England for other types of treatment. Less than half the expected number of operations were done, pushing the waiting list to a record-high of 4.6 million, the NHS England stats show. More than 300,000 of those people have been waiting more than a year for treatment - compared to 1,600 before the pandemic began. Behind today's statistics are people in considerable pain and \"waiting in limbo\" the Royal College of Surgeons of England said.\n\"It's a bit depressing really,\" says Matt Williams from Buckinghamshire. He's one of three graduates who have described their difficulties finding work since leaving university at the height of the pandemic. Jamie Morris, 22, an unemployed graduate from Henley-on-Thames in South Oxfordshire filmed the report for the BBC as figures showed that 1.74 million people in the UK were unemployed.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "text": "Wales is on a \"knife edge\" and easing restrictions too quickly could lead to the \"exponential growth\" of Covid-19, a government scientific adviser has said.\nCases could be kept low if alert level three restrictions are in place until June and schools reopen gradually, a report to the Welsh Government advises.\nThe Welsh government is expected to announce a \"stay local\" rule on Friday.\nBut First Minister Mark Drakeford told the i newspaper he did not see life returning to normal in 2021.\nHe said Boris Johnson's wish to fully lift restrictions by 21 June was \"fanciful\" and warned another wave is \"inevitable\".\nThe report by the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (Tac) is based on modelling by scientists at Swansea University.\nA rush to return to school, combined with a faster easing of restrictions, could lead to a larger third wave of cases, according to the report, which was published last month but made public on Thursday.\nThe TAC has said all the modelling and conclusions still apply.\nThe co-chairwoman of the TAC, Fliss Bennee, said it was a crucial moment in the course of the pandemic.\n\"We are sitting at a knife edge, where if we start to unlock too fast then we will be in a period of exponential growth that could bring us easily back to the sort of levels of hospitalisations and deaths we saw in January,\" she said.\nOn Wednesday, UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty warned against easing lockdown too quickly.\nThe modelling is neither a prediction nor a forecast, but suggests the likely impact on infections, serious illness and death of the greater mixing allowed by the easing of restrictions.\nIn its report, TAC warns there remain \"uncertainties\" around the impact of school reopening on transmission, the population's adherence to social distancing and other precautions, as well as the impact of vaccines on transmission. \nThe report adds: \"As the vaccine rollout continues, the horizon looks more positive in terms of expecting lower numbers of Covid-19 deaths than have been observed in November 2020 - January 2021.\" \nLooking specifically at schools, the report says the gradual return of students should not lead to another wave of cases, hospitalisations or deaths as long as adherence with other restrictions remains high.\nBut if adherence wanes \"there may be a resurgence of the virus around May-June time, especially if the new variant adds around an initial 0.6 to the R number\", the report says.\nR is the rate at which the virus spreads, and an R value above one indicates the epidemic is growing.\nThe report also warns against relying on vaccines alone to end the pandemic.\nIt says: \"Vaccines are not 100% effective so not all at-risk groups are protected, even with full coverage.\n\"The modelled ratio of deaths to cases in May 2021 is around one quarter of the ratio in January 2021.\"\nThe scientists say that the results of the modelling \"may reinforce the need to be cautious with loosening restrictions and monitor outcomes over time, if a further wave of cases, hospitalisations and deaths is to be avoided\".\nIn a most likely scenario - assuming the new Kent virus variant is dominant, the vaccine is 75% effective and there is a cautious move out of lockdown - this could lead to 57,866 more Covid cases and about 800 deaths.\nBut a worst-case scenario - with a quick move out of lockdown, a bigger impact from the new variant and low adherence to the rules - could mean more than 194,000 further cases and almost 3,500 more deaths.\nBut even here, the vaccine would help mitigate what would otherwise be a worse third wave.\nThe scientific advisers say there is still some uncertainty about the effectiveness of the vaccine in how it may slow transmission.\nThere is also the issue that about a quarter of hospital admissions with Covid still involve people under 60 years old, so they are stressing that everyone still has a part to play in keeping to basic rules, especially before all adults have had the vaccine.\nThere is hope people now understand more about the virus, and scientists have noted how people were cautious in how they behaved after the end of the firebreak last November.\nMs Benee said when scientific advisers looked at the models, they told politicians they should unlock \"really slowly and really carefully\".\nShe added: \"If we go cautiously, if we are able to keep transmission low enough, then there's no reason why we won't be able to avoid having a third wave during the summer entirely.\"\nThe case rate in Wales as a whole was, for a period in December, one of the highest in the world. But it has been falling since the week before Christmas.\nFor more than a month, Wales has had the lowest case rate of the UK nations and is at its lowest level since 18 September.\nAt 43.9% it is below the \"trigger\" figure of 50 cases per 100,000, normally used as the guide for bringing in restrictions.\nThe youngest children have already returned to school in Wales, with all other primary school pupils due to go back on Monday.\nSecondary schools will be able to welcome pupils in years 7, 8 and 9 for \"check-in\" sessions before they are due back fully from mid-April.\nExercise rules were eased on 20 February to allow four people from a maximum of two households to meet outdoors for exercise.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford previously said chief medical officer Frank Atherton had told him he believed a third wave was being \"baked into what will happen during this year\"."

      "text": "Cancer patients are much less protected against Covid-19 than other people after one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the first real-world study in this area suggests.\nWith a 12-week wait for the second dose this could leave them vulnerable, says the King's College London and Francis Crick Institute research team.\nAn early second dose appeared to boost cancer patients' protection.\nCancer charities are calling for the vaccine strategy to be reviewed.\nBut Cancer Research UK said the small study had not yet been reviewed by other scientists and people undergoing cancer treatment should continue to follow the advice of their doctors. \nThe government said it was focused on \"saving lives\" and the antibody response \"was only part of the protection provided by the vaccine\".\n\"The independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises government on vaccine use and prioritisation, regularly reviews data and evidence on vaccine efficacy and effectiveness,\" it said.\nAbout 1.2 million people at very high risk of being seriously ill with Covid-19 were prioritised for a first vaccine dose in the first phase of the UK rollout, which includes people with specific cancers.\nThe UK government decided to extend the gap between first and second jabs from three to 12 weeks in late December to give more people some protection as soon as possible.\nDr Sheeba Irshad, oncologist and senior study author from King's College London, said the findings were \"really worrying\" and recommended an urgent review of the timing of doses for people in clinically extremely vulnerable groups. \n\"Until then, it is important that cancer patients continue to observe all public health measures in place such as social distancing and shielding when attending hospitals, even after vaccination,\" she said.\nThe study, not yet published or peer-reviewed, recruited 205 people, including 151 with solid cancers, such as lung, breast and bowel, or blood cancers.\nThe researchers tested volunteers for antibodies and T-cells in their blood, which signals that the immune system can protect against illness from the virus in the future.\nThree weeks after one dose of the Pfizer jab, an antibody response was found in:\nFollowing a second dose three weeks after the first, which some cancer patients received, there was a sharp rise in their antibody response against the coronavirus, to 95%.\nBut among those who had to wait longer for their second dose, there was no real improvement in protection.\nFive weeks after the first dose, an antibody response was detected in:\nIn trials of the Pfizer vaccine, two doses were given three weeks apart and although a longer gap between doses works for healthy individuals, the researchers say cancer patients do not respond in the same way.\n\"One size does not fit all,\" said Dr Irshad.\n\"Cancer treatments have profound effects on the immune system and cancer patients' immune mechanisms are inferior.\n\"We need to be concerned about other vaccines for this population too - they do need a second dose quickly.\"\nDr Irshad also said leaving people unprotected for many weeks could give new variants the space to emerge and allow the virus to spread among family members caring for patients.\nThere are around 370,000 new cases of cancer in the UK every year, with up to three million people living with the disease. \nPeople with compromised immune systems were not included in clinical trials of the vaccine, although previous studies suggested vaccines may not work as well in this specific group.\nCancer Research UK said the small study was \"interesting\" but there could still be limitations with the results.\nMartin Ledwick, the charity's head information nurse, said: \"We know that this information could be worrying, but anyone undergoing cancer treatment should continue to follow the advice of their doctors, and we encourage all who can to take up the vaccine.\"\nBreast Cancer Now has called on the UK's vaccine committee, the JCVI, to \"urgently review the evidence presented in this study and consider adapting its strategy\" to give people with cancer both doses within three weeks.\nBlood Cancer UK echoed this call, saying more research was needed urgently so that people don't \"face a future of shielding indefinitely, not knowing whether they are protected\". They added that blood cancer patients should still definitely have the vaccine.\nProf Stephen Evans, professor of pharmaco-epidemiology, from London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: \"These data will undoubtedly need to be examined by JCVI, but the evidence that harm has been caused to patients with cancer by delaying a second dose has not yet been demonstrated conclusively. \n\"Full follow-up of those who get vaccinated with a delayed second dose will be very important.\"\nThe study will continue to follow cancer patients after their vaccinations for up to six months."

      "text": "Traditionally the Palace protects the family by drawing a curtain between the public, formal stuff and the personal stuff; its refusal to comment on the personal is a strategic interpretation of the family's maxim - \"never explain, never complain\".\nThe public/personal divide has always been an artifice. Royals get married in front of tens of millions of people, have state funerals, release photos on birthdays and anniversaries, exchange insights into their lives in return for easy-going and generous coverage.\nBut the divide, however often disregarded, remains the guiding principle of the family's formal relationship with the outside world. Now the contradictions that spring from the mix of personal and public are playing out.\nSome key allegations are about the personal behaviour and comments of members of the Royal Family and how, through collective neglect and perhaps some malicious intent, they left Harry and Meghan no choice but to leave.\nOther statements painted a terrible portrait of unfeeling staff and courtiers. The entire institution was portrayed as if nothing had been learnt from the days of Diana - Prince Harry and Prince William's late mother.\nThe duchess is a formidable communicator and has proved herself a very bad woman to pick a fight with. A newly-liberated Harry spoke with almost-eloquence. \nMeghan dealt some of the heaviest blows. What is the Palace to say about the accusation that an unnamed member of the family made a comment - more than one by the sounds of things - about the skin colour of the couple's child-to-be? The mind boggles.\nBut alongside the personal pain and anger rippling through the duchess's testimony, there came from Harry condemnation of the institution - the suggestion that it was incapable of change, incapable of love, incapable of understanding.\nThe contradictions of the Palace, and of the monarchy, are exactly that which makes it so special, so strange, so interesting and so difficult to work within - the merging of personal and public roles, the accretion of tradition, the mix of public accountability, ceaseless media interest and the need to remain relevant.\nHarry's suggestion that his family too - his father Prince Charles, his brother Prince William - are \"trapped\" in their world, and that he felt \"compassion\" for them, was a velvet-covered knife into the heart of the modern monarchy.  \nRoyal life is conducted from within a gilded cage; the players are not meant to rattle the bars from the outside. \nThese are the contradictions Harry walked away (or, in his words, stepped back) from. He was uncomfortable with them before he was married. And when he saw his wife suffering as a result of his being \"trapped\" in royal life, he found a way out with her.\nThere are also the contradictions that lie behind many of the decisions that they both spoke out about and are clearly very unhappy about.\nIt is public money that pays for security. It is tradition that dictates who gets what title. There is no HR department for working royals because it is a family affair. What you do in front of the cameras matters because it reflects on the institution as a whole. \nThis meshing of personal and public is unique. It is what being a modern royal is all about. And inside it is often a hugely uncomfortable place to be. Harry knew that. Presumably he warned Meghan. But that warning wasn't enough. \nHarry and Meghan's experience suggests that the contradictions are too great. Maybe their interview will act as a catalyst for change. But the Crown has been around for a very long time, and change does not come easily to a body in which the past plays such an outsize role."

      "text": "Uber and rival app Lyft plan to share with each other the names of US drivers they ban from their platforms because of \"serious\" safety incidents, such as sexual assault.\nThe two firms said the programme, to be managed by a background check company, was aimed at improving industry safety.\nThey said other US firms could opt to participate.\nBoth Uber and Lyft have faced scrutiny and legal action over their handling of sexual assault and other safety issues.\nThey have responded to the criticism by introducing measures such as recurring background checks and new features, such as emergency buttons in their apps.\nThe new programme, which is only active in the US, will also allow the two firms to share information about drivers involved in certain serious incidents such as rape and non-consensual kissing, as well as non-sexual physical assaults.\nScott Berkowitz, president and founder of the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, said the effort meant \"perpetrators will no longer be able to hide or escape accountability by simply switching ridesharing platforms\".\n\"By putting aside competition, they are placing users first and building a safer rideshare community for all,\" he said in the announcement shared by the companies on Thursday.\nLawyer Kristen Barton of Estey & Bomberger, which represents women who have sued the ridesharing companies for inadequate protections from sexual violence, called the programme a \"step in the right direction\".\nBut she cautioned that the database's usefulness would be limited by its focus on drivers that the companies have banned.\n\"There's no guarantee that when a report against a driver is lodged that that is being followed up on and resulting in deactivation by the companies,\" she said, adding that only a small number of people who are assaulted even report the incident.\n\"While it is a good start, it's just not going to capture enough information to stop assaults from occurring,\" she said.\nIn 2019, Uber said it had received nearly 6,000 reports of sexual assault in the US in the previous two years. It said problems arose in a tiny fraction of the 2.3 billion rides during that time.\nIt later clashed with state regulators in California, who wanted access to the reports, ultimately leading to a fine.\nLyft has delayed publication of a similar report, citing the privacy disagreement. The company is also facing lawsuits from dozens of women in the US, who say they were harmed after the firm failed to protect passengers from its drivers.\nLyft is active in the US and Canada. Uber, which operates in 71 countries around the world, said the data-sharing initiative was limited to the US, with no plans to expand at this time. \nThe firm has faced concerns over its handling of safety incidents outside the US as well.\nIn the UK, Uber had its London licence suspended, in part because of safety concerns. However, in September last year, Westminster Magistrates' Court ruled the firm could continue operating, saying it had improved its record despite \"historical failings\"."

      "title": "Covid stimulus: Biden signs $1.9tn relief bill into law",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has signed a $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) economic relief bill that aims to help Americans impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic into law.\nThe bill includes $1,400 payments, an extension of jobless benefits, and a child tax credit that is expect to lift millions out of poverty. \nMr Biden said the relief package will rebuild \"the backbone of this country\".\nThe spending bill, one of the largest in US history, passed Congress without a single Republican supporter. \nMr Biden is due to give a primetime address later on Thursday to tout the bill's provisions. He and other Democrats will also hold a signing ceremony at the White House on Friday.\nThis sixth Covid-19 relief bill is a major legislative win for Mr Biden.\nThe package has been broadly popular among Americans.\nA March Pew Research Center poll found that 70% of US adults surveyed expressed support for the bill, including 41% of Republicans.\nUnemployment skyrocketed over the last year, with a current rate of 6.2%, according to the US Labor Department.\nMr Biden had originally planned the bill signing for Friday, but it was pushed up in his schedule \"because Congress enroled the bill more quickly than we anticipated,\" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a tweet.\nJoe Biden was originally expected to sign the ambitiously named \"American Recovery Plan Act\" at the White House on Friday. Instead the final step in enacting the president's first significant piece of legislation was moved up to Thursday afternoon.\nAn official ceremony is still planned for Friday, but the scheduling change reveals an administration anxious to get busy selling the American people on the benefits of this massive and multifaceted piece of government spending.\nThis - and Biden's address to the nation Thursday night - are the opening gun of a two-week public-relations blitz, including presidential travel, to highlight the legislation. It shouldn't be too hard a sell, as opinion polls indicate widespread support for the law even among Republican voters.\nWhat Biden and the Democrats don't want is a repeat of the 2009 Great Recession relief bill passed under President Barack Obama. Many in the party believe that Democrats did not claim enough credit for the law's benefits - and that voters had forgotten about their efforts when they cast their ballots in the 2010 congressional mid-term elections (and roundly voted Democrats out of office).\nBiden, as vice-president, had a front-row seat for that debacle. His actions as president suggest he hasn't forgotten it.\nThe act includes one-off direct payments worth $1,400 to be sent off to most Americans.\nIt extends weekly jobless benefit payments of $300 until September.\nIt also allocates $350bn to state and local governments, some $130bn to school reopening, $49bn for expanded Covid-19 testing and research, as well as $14bn for vaccine distribution.\nA proposal to raise the national minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour became a sticking point in the Senate and did not make it into the final version of the bill.\nWhite House officials say that direct payments, the third payments of the pandemic, will begin before the end of March.\nPrevious cheques were sent out by tax officials within one to two weeks of the bills' passage.\nIndividuals earning up to $75,000 will receive a $1,400 payment.\nTax officials at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) use tax statements to determine the exact size of each person's payment. For that reason they have urged Americans to quickly file their tax returns, which are due 15 April.\nStimulus cheques sent out by Mr Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, included the former president's personal signature.\nBut Mrs Psaki said Mr Biden's signature will not be on these payments.\nCurrently, American couples are able to apply for a $2,000 per child under the Child Tax Credit, a 24-year old government programme. \nThis law increases the tax break to $3,000 for every child age 6 to 17. Children under the age of 6 will receive a $3,600 benefit.\nMore than 4 million children - more than half of the total - could be lifted out of poverty, according to analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \nIt also extends access to lower income families, even those that pay nothing in taxes, by making the credit refundable.\nThe programme is temporary, and will expire after one year.\nBefore signing the bill in the White House Oval Office, Mr Biden said the bill is about \"rebuilding the backbone of this country and giving people in this nation, working people, middle class folks, the people that built the country a fighting chance. \n\"That's what the essence of it is.\"\nHe promised that he would have \"a lot more to say about that tonight and the next couple of days\".\nMr Biden will deliver his first primetime address to the American public on Thursday night.\nThe speech comes on the 50th day of his presidency.\nIt will be the third time this year that he has marked a moment in the coronavirus pandemic, which has left more than 529,000 people dead and over 29 million infected.\nPreviewing his remarks on Wednesday, Mr Biden said he would be laying out \"the next phase,\" of the US Covid-response.\n\"There is light at the end of this dark tunnel of the past year. But we cannot let our guard down now or assume the victory is inevitable,\" he said.\n\"Together, we're going get through this pandemic and usher in a healthier and more hopeful future.\"\nOn Thursday, the White House announced that Mr Biden and Vice-president Kamala Harris will travel to Atlanta, Georgia next Friday as part of the \"Help is Here tour to amplify the American Rescue Plan\".

      "text": "The newly-appointed editor of Teen Vogue has apologised for \"racist and homophobic\" tweets she wrote in 2011.\nStaff at the magazine signed a letter in protest at the hiring of Alexi McCammond, now 27, over the comments.\nThe letter said it rejected her sentiments at this \"moment of historically high anti-Asian violence\".\n\"I'm sorry to have used such hurtful and inexcusable language,\" McCammond tweeted on Wednesday.\n\"I've apologised for my past racist and homophobic tweets and will reiterate that there's no excuse for perpetuating those awful stereotypes in any way,\" she added. \nA series of attacks on Asian-Americans have been reported in recent weeks, with many people saying they fear further violence.\nMcCammond also made headlines last month when her partner, TJ Ducklo, resigned from the White House communications team after threatening a journalist.\n\"I will destroy you,\" Ducklo said to a reporter when she tried to investigate the couple's relationship before it was public.\nMcCammond apologised for her tweets in 2019, calling them \"deeply insensitive\". But after her appointment at Teen Vogue last week, the posts resurfaced, leading to a backlash. They  were published on Instagram on Monday by journalist Diane Tsui.\n\"Outdone by [an] Asian #whatsnew,\" read one of McCammond's earlier tweets.\n\"Give me a 2/10 on my chem [chemistry] problem, cross out all of my work and don't explain what I did wrong\u2026 thanks a lot stupid Asian T.A [teaching assistant] you're great,\" read another.\nReferencing the comments, Tsui wrote: \"Time and time again this shows that gatekeepers pay lip service to diversity. They don't believe anti-racism policies can and should include Asian Americans.\"\nTeen Vogue, which has a large following among teenagers and readers in their 20s, has built a reputation for explicit anti-racist and feminist journalism. \nIn one of its most famous pieces, it said in 2016 that US President Donald Trump was \"gaslighting America.\"\nStaff at the magazine said that McCammond's appointment threatened the outlet's core values.\n\"We've built our outlet's reputation as a voice for justice and change \u2014 we take immense pride in our work and in creating an inclusive environment,\" more than 20 staff wrote in a letter posted on Instagram on Tuesday.\n\"That's why we have written a letter to management at Cond\u00e9 Nast about the recent hire of Alexi McCammond as our new editor-in-chief in light of her past racist and homophobic tweets,\" they wrote.\nIn her apology, McCammond said the incident made her introduction to Teen Vogue \"awful\" but that she had dedicated her career to \"giving a voice to the voiceless\".\n\"The last thing I'd ever want is to make anyone - but especially our Asian brothers and sisters in particular - feel more invisible,\" she added.\nShe promised \"better days ahead\" for the magazine."

      "text": "LGBT+ campaigners have urged the government to \"make good\" the prime minister's promise to ban \"conversion therapy\" in England and Wales.\nIt comes as three advisers quit the government's LGBT+ advisory panel amid concern it is being too slow in bringing in legislation.\nMinisters have promised to \"work at pace\" to end conversion therapy.\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had a \"blind spot\" on the issue that the PM had to \"address\".\nConversion therapy involves treatments ranging from psychotherapy to religious teaching and discussion. \nCampaigners want a \"meaningful\" law against the practice, which aims to change sexual orientation or gender identity.\nAll forms of conversion therapy are already prohibited in Switzerland and parts of Australia and Boris Johnson pledged last summer to ban what he called an \"abhorrent\" practice in England and Wales.\nBut the government has not yet published the findings of a consultation on the issue which began in 2018.\nIn a debate in Parliament on Monday, equalities minister Kemi Badenoch said conversion therapy had \"no place in a civilised society\", but added that \"robust\" laws were already in place to deal with the most troubling examples, involving violence and sexual assault.\nAnd the government did not want to stop those who \"seek spiritual counselling as they explore their sexual orientation\", she said.\nBut LGBT+ groups and campaigners, including Stonewall, the LGBT Foundation and Trans Media Watch, say a ban on all forms of conversion therapy, not just the most distressing types, is needed.\nIn a letter to Ms Badenoch, they express \"deep concern\" over her comments, arguing they appeared to \"imply that you have been meeting with perpetrators of conversion therapy and those who want the practice to continue\".\nThe letter continues: \"This is very worrying and gives the impression that the government is more interested in appeasing the extreme fringes of religious people, despite the calls for a ban from senior religious leaders from across a wide range of faiths.\"\nTwo advisers quit the government's LGBT advisory panel on Wednesday, and a third resigned on Thursday.\nThere have been rumblings for a while about a growing unease amongst some panel members which are now playing out in a very public way. \nThe advisory group was first set up under Theresa May but hasn't met for some time - I'm told at least six months. \nAnd now we've heard claims that, even when it did meet, panellists didn't necessarily feel listened to. \nIf the group does appear increasingly defunct (and we'll have to see what happens) it may be seen, by some, as symbolic of a fading commitment to LGBT+ equality under this administration. \nMinisters would reject that and, during a debate on Monday, Kemi Badenoch said the government has a \"proud record\" of championing equal opportunity. \nBut it was her response overall that seems to have sparked these resignations. \nAmong concerns was her refusal to commit to a legislative \"ban\" of so-called conversion therapy, promising instead only to \"end\" the practice. \nThe equalities minister described the legal landscape as \"complex\". But it's an awkward one for Boris Johnson who did, last summer, use the word \"ban\" during a TV interview.\nJayne Ozanne, who resigned first, accused ministers of creating a \"hostile environment\" for LGBT+ people.\nShe said there had been \"a lack of engagement\", telling ITV News that both Ms Badenoch and minister for women and equalities Liz Truss were known among the LGBT+ community as \"the ministers for inequality\".\nAnother of those who quit the panel, James Morton, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"For the past 12 months I've been increasingly concerned about the direction of travel on trans rights.\"\nHe added that it felt \"really scary\" being a trans person \"in the UK at the moment\".\nAnd Ellen Murray said she had resigned \"due to the government's persistent and worsening hostility towards our community\".\n\"From conversion therapy to trans healthcare, to the shameful treatment of LGBT refugees, the government has acted in appalling faith,\" she added.\nLabour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government \"has a blind\" spot in the issue.\n\"The PM needs to address what is obviously a problem in his government and a pattern of behaviour he needs to address,\" he said at his party's local election campaign launch.\nAsked if he would ban conversion therapy if he were prime minister, Sir Keir said: \"yes, absolutely.\"\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government \"bows to nobody in terms of our pushing for LBTQ issues, LGBT rights and also rights of minorities\".\nOn Wednesday, a government spokesman said: \"We have repeatedly made clear that we will take action to end conversion therapy and we are working to bring forward plans to do so shortly.\"\nThe LGBT Advisory Council was set up in 2019, with the term of current panel members set to end on 31 March."

      "text": "Deputy First Minister John Swinney has survived a vote of no confidence at Holyrood after MSPs rejected the motion by 65 to 57.\nThe vote was tabled by the Tories after a row over the government providing its legal advice to an inquiry committee.\nThe motion was voted down after the Greens sided with the SNP to dismiss the move as a political stunt.\nMr Swinney had agreed to publish \"key\" papers from the government's legal battle with Alex Salmond.\nHowever, the committee said it was \"not reassured\" that it had been given access to all the material it had asked for.\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said the \"key legal advice the deputy first minister promised has not been provided\". Her party was backed by Labour and the Lib Dems.\nMr Swinney described the motion as \"entirely baseless\".\nThe row stems from the government's handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond, which it admitted had been unlawful after the former first minister launched a judicial review case at the Court of Session.\nA special parliamentary committee was set up to hold an inquiry into the affair. Members of the group asked for government legal advice relating to the case to be disclosed.\nMSPs - including the Greens - twice voted to underline this demand, but the government initially only provided access to a memo summarising some advice.\nAfter all opposition parties said they would back a vote of no confidence in Mr Swinney if the papers were not handed over, he relented and the government published a series of documents.\nHowever the committee said it was \"frustrated\" by how the process had played out and the Tories pushed ahead with the confidence vote.\nMs Davidson told MSPs that the committee had been \"hampered at every turn from receiving even basic information\".\nShe said the papers published contained \"damning revelations\", but argued that \"there still remain key omissions\".\nShe added: \"We know we won't win - the votes are there for the deputy first minister - but we believe it is important and right to put on record that this is no way for the government to treat this parliament.\"\nLabour's Jackie Baillie - a member of the inquiry committee - said it had been provided with \"partial information, delayed information and in some cases no information at all\".\nShe added: \"There is a pattern of behaviour here of obstruction, secrecy and contempt for the institution of this parliament.\"\nLib Dem MSP Alex-Cole Hamilton added that it was \"entirely due to the obstruction and sleight of hand employed by this administration that we have arrived at this point\".\nMr Swinney contended that the government had published the advice to counter \"outlandish allegations\" of conspiracy, and had provided everything the committee had asked for.\nHe said: \"We have taken the extraordinary and unprecedented step of publishing formal legal advice of the kind that no previous government in Scotland has done.\n\"On any fair interpretation of what the government has done, the Tories' pursuit of this motion today is now entirely baseless.\n\"With an election only weeks away, the reality is, I suspect, that they were always intent on pushing this motion to a vote regardless of what action the government has taken.\"\nHe was backed by Patrick Harvie, who said the inquiry had \"descended into political farce\".\nThe Green co-leader said the process had become \"shabby political theatre\", with opposition members chiefly interested in \"winning a political scalp\".\nThe vote is the second time in the past year Mr Swinney has survived a confidence motion, with the Greens also backing him in his post as education secretary in a row over exam results."

      "text": "Kate Winslet said it was \"incredible\" Banksy had chosen Reading Prison for his latest piece as she joined calls to turn the old jail into an arts venue.\nThe Oscar-winning actress is supporting a theatre group hoping to stop the site being knocked down for housing.\nBanksy confirmed he was behind the mural, with many believing it showed he backed moves for an art centre.\nWinslet, who grew up in Reading, promised to perform on opening night if the plans became a reality.\nBanksy's painting of an escaping prisoner - possibly resembling famous inmate Oscar Wilde - appeared last week.\nThe Ministry of Justice, which owns the site and previously described the artwork as \"graffiti\", said it was considering what to do with the piece.\nWinslet told the BBC she believed the \"incredible Banksy piece of wall art\" should remain and become part of the \"legacy\" of a new diverse cultural and arts hub.\nShe said: \"I just felt incredibly excited for Reading to have a Banksy.\n\"If Reading had a legacy space like that, to hand on to generation after generation, it could really be as valuable as some of those central London theatres.\"\nReading Borough Council will submit a new bid next week to purchase the site and transform it into an arts complex.\nThe sale to a developer of the Grade II-listed prison, where Wilde was held between 1895 and 1897, fell through in November.\nIt was immortalised in Wilde's poem Ballad of Reading Gaol during his stay, which reflected on the brutality of the Victorian penal system.\nTitanic star Winslet described her own experiences growing up in the town and how she learned how to act at drama clubs held in scout halls, church halls and school gyms \"because there was no real central space for creative communities to be built\".\nHowever, the star of Hollywood films, including The Reader and Revolutionary Road, believes it is harder for young people today because of \"unrealistic ideals\" that come about through social media.\nShe added: \"Yes, I come from a family of actors - but those actors were also dentists, Christmas tree sellers, tarmac layers, they were more often doing those jobs than they were acting because they found it hard making a living from acting.\"\nWinslet said she felt compelled to back the cause after being contacted by Toby Davies from the Reading-based Rabble Theatre, who has been leading the campaign.\n\"I really wanted to be able to lend my voice because it is very important to me. By joining forces in some way now hopefully... we might be able to do something wonderful,\" she added.\nWinslet also believes professional theatre companies \"would hire Reading Gaol as a creative space to bring their productions\". \n\"Shows will often start at those out-of-town venues and then maybe transfer into London,\" she explained.\n\"How exciting for something like that to begin in Reading, something that increases local employment and encourages people to join... it's a really fantastic opportunity.\"\nThe actress also pledged: \"I'll be there performing on the first night, I sign up to that now.\"\nMr Davies, who said he was thrilled by Winslet's support, added: \"It's an opportunity to represent Wilde and correct everything that was done to him and the opportunity to totally transform a significant part of England culturally to really make a massive difference.\" \nOther well-known actors have also thrown their weight behind the campaign, including Dame Judi Dench, Sir Kenneth Branagh, Natalie Dormer and Stephen Fry, who portrayed Irish playwright Wilde in the 1997 film Wilde.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

With slow supply, they said home sales can be quick.\nPhiddy Robertson of the Galbraith Group in Inverness, said: \"The market is starved of good quality property. \n\"Buyers are paying significant premiums to secure attractive coastal property and we are seeing more interest than ever from southern buyers looking for second homes.\"\nIn Edinburgh and Glasgow, surveyors found the market more patchy, noting that more flats are coming on the market as private landlords sell. \nIn the housing rental market, Scotland had the biggest drop in property availability of any part of the UK.  \nJohn Brown, a rental agent in Edinburgh, commented: \"The market is fragmented, with fewer enquiries and longer void periods between tenancies. \n\"It's clear landlords are looking to reduce portfolios. More legislation, and Energy Performance Certificate standards being enforced, add to costs. \n\"Students are registering for next year but trying to be uncommitted - that's the Covid effect\".\nIn Dumfries at the Savills agency, Carolyn Davies said renters are looking for demand for rural properties \"but broadband speeds now need to be established prior to letting\"."

      "text": "Hundreds of UK companies have been compromised as part of a global campaign linked to Chinese hackers.\nCyber-security firm Eset said more than 500 email servers in the UK may have been hacked, and many companies are not aware they are victims of the attack.\nIt comes as governments around the world warn organisations to secure their systems.\nBut some experts fear it may be too late, as at least 10 hacking teams are capitalising on the chaos.\nThe UK's National Cyber Security Centre has joined US authorities in issuing warnings about the hack, but says it is still assessing the situation for UK businesses.\nMeanwhile, the Norwegian cyber-authority is actively scanning for at-risk companies in the country and warning them directly.\nThe hacking campaign was first announced by Microsoft on 2 March and blamed on a Chinese government-backed hacking group called Hafnium.\nMicrosoft said the group was using four never-before-seen hacking techniques to infiltrate the email systems of US companies.\nThe attackers targeted the popular email system Microsoft Exchange Server, used by large corporations and public bodies across the world.\nMicrosoft released software updates for the so called \"zero-day\" exploits and urged customers to install them to protect themselves.\nHowever, the hacking has escalated from straightforward espionage to crisis levels, with some reports estimating tens of thousands of organisations could be affected.\nAccording to cyber-security researchers at Eset, as many as 10 different hacking groups are now actively using the zero-days exploits to target companies in 115 different countries. \nCyber-researchers at FireEye also confirmed they had detected multiple groups, likely to be based in China, using the exploit in different waves.\n\"As always, it is complex but it is very likely that Hafnium gifted these 'zero days' to government-sanctioned groups to actively use the flaws once they were rumbled,\" Jake Moore at Eset said.\n\"The race is now on for all of those affected to patch immediately and then painstakingly check for any recent compromises and make sure no webshells are installed on the servers.\"\nA webshell is a piece of computer code that can act like a backdoor into a computer network. \nOnce installed, hackers have a foothold in a network and can either steal or spy on email messages, or use the access to launch more crippling cyber-attacks.\nGlobally, Eset says it has detected the backdoors on 5,000 separate servers - and more than 500 of them are in the UK.\nCyber-security responders are racing to find out which companies have been hacked, and remove the webshells to kick the hackers out of their systems.\nCyberGuard Technologies says it is dealing with 42 separate cases where hackers have installed webshells, with the number rising by the hour.\nThe companies range from financial institutions, manufacturing and retail.\nSean Tickle, head of CyberGuard, said: \"It's widespread and very much a case of hackers hosing their attacks at as many targets as they can before companies can secure their systems.\n\"It only takes someone to alter this approach to drop a more malicious malware package and we're going to see some real hurt for the companies that fall behind. \n\"There's already rumblings that these shells are being used, and I think we're going to see mass ransomware attacks happen as a second wave of this.\""

      "text": "Pupils in pre-schools, nurseries and primary one to primary three in NI who were due to revert to remote learning from 22 March will be allowed to remain in class, the executive has agreed.\nMinisters backed a proposal from Education Minister Peter Weir to scrap the original plan.\nThat date will see post-primary pupils in years 12 to 14 return to classrooms.\nHowever no decision has been taken yet on when all other pupils should to return to school.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said the full return of pupils to schools would be discussed at the executive's first formal review of the regulations on Tuesday 16 March.\n\"I would have liked to have moved further in relation to other cohorts but the Covid taskforce is looking at this in a strategic way and we'll make announcements next week,\" she told a news conference.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir had proposed that students in primaries four to seven should return on 22 March, with all other post-primary students returning after the Easter break on 12 April, subject to health advice.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir said he had wanted to move further but recognised he would not have had consensus from all other executive parties.\n\"I ideally want to bring all ministers with me on this issue,\" he told the BBC's Evening Extra programme.\n\"I will not rest until we reach a point that we have all pupils back in school... but how quickly we do that remains to be seen.\"\nHe also said officials were continuing work on how testing might be rolled out across schools in Northern Ireland.\nSome testing kits will arrive with the Education Authority on Friday and there will be a programme to roll that out for older pupils, primarily in years 12 to 14 in post-primaries, he added.\nDeputy First Minister Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised schools, students and parents needed \"notice\" about the return to school and that she hoped the executive could provide dates on Tuesday.\n\"We have made progress today and we did say this would be a staged and phased approach,\" she added.\nBoth ministers said their priority was ensuring the return of all pupils to schools as quickly as possible.\nIt is understood the executive was advised by health officials that the decision to \"prioritise and accelerate face-to-face learning must be supported by the retention of other existing restrictions at least until after the Easter holidays\".\nOn Thursday nine more Covid-19-related deaths and another 223 cases of the virus were recorded in Northern Ireland.\nThere were 10 deaths recorded in the Republic of Ireland, with 592 confirmed new cases of the virus.\nMs O'Neill said the more transmissible Kent variant of coronavirus is now thought to account for about 80% of all cases in Northern Ireland.\n\"Where people are having more contact the epidemic will grow faster than it has done previously, and this is something we all need to be cognisant of as we gradually ease out of restrictions,\" she added.\nThe transmission rate of the virus - or R-number - for the community in Northern Ireland is \"consistently below one\", said the first minister.\nShe said she hoped that the drop in figures meant that the executive would be able to make more announcements next week about easing other restrictions.\nMs O'Neill said there would be \"no major shifts\" before Easter but that the executive wanted to allow people time to plan for the coming weeks and months.\nMrs Foster also said she recognised that people were facing into a second year with many being unable to spend Mother's Day with their loved ones.\n\"Many of us will be relying on cards and phone calls to carry out our love and appreciation,\" she said.\nShe also urged anyone wanting to celebrate Mother's Day or St Patrick's Day to do so with their own household.\nMs O'Neill said Northern Ireland was \"on the cusp of brighter days\" but warned that going to parties or gathering in groups posed a \"serious risk to a fragile situation\".\nMeanwhile, Stormont ministers have also agreed additional funding to support businesses and jobs during the pandemic.\nFinance Minister Conor Murphy had proposed extending rates relief for another 12 months for almost 30,000 businesses, in a package worth \u00a3230m.\nHis plan means that for the second year running businesses in the following sectors will not pay any rates:\nThe executive also announced a Covid-19 support scheme for travel agents experiencing difficulties as a result of the pandemic, worth \u00a31.175m.\nIt includes a flat payment of \u00a310,000 to travel agency businesses operating from commercial premises or a \u00a33,500 payment to self-employed travel agents working from home.\nThe scheme will open next Friday for a limited time until 26 March."

      "text": "People in England who are homeless or sleeping rough will be prioritised for Covid vaccines, alongside those aged 16 to 65 with underlying conditions that put them at increased risk. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the strategy would save more lives among those most at risk in society. \nThe move came following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nTwo in every five adults have now received at least one vaccine.\nThe JCVI's advice has been shared with experts leading vaccination programmes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nNadhim Zahawi, minister for Covid vaccine deployment, said this was a very challenging period for people who were homeless. \nHe added: \"We know those experiencing rough sleeping or homelessness are not always able to access healthcare routinely, and therefore can often have a range of health issues which can leave them at an increased risk of this virus.\n\"Following the recommendation by the JCVI, local teams will now be able to prioritise this group for vaccination alongside priority group 6 and make sure fewer people fall seriously ill or die from Covid-19.\"\nIn a letter to the health secretary, experts from the JCVI said people experiencing homelessness had a higher risk of poor outcomes from Covid-19 and high rates of other undiagnosed illnesses. \nThe team added: \"Due to current restrictions, many thousands of people who experience rough sleeping have been accommodated in emergency accommodation. \n\"This provides a unique opportunity to in-reach vaccination to a population that is otherwise often unable to access basic healthcare.\"\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick said that during the pandemic, the government had helped provide accommodation for 37,000 people at risk of rough sleeping. \nJon Sparkes, of the homeless charity Crisis, welcomed the move and said the government should ensure local areas had adequate resources.\nHe added: \"But make no mistake, the vaccine will not make homelessness safe. \n\"Whether it is living on the streets, or in cars and sheds, or constantly moving between friends' sofas, homelessness is extremely damaging to both your physical and mental health. \n\"We desperately need a plan to ensure everyone has a safe and secure home.\" "

      "text": "All of Scotland's 32 local authorities have frozen council tax rates at last year's levels.\nThe Scottish government offered councils incentives in return for not raising the cost of the bills.\nGlasgow and Stirling were the last authorities to consider council tax levels when they set their 2021/22 budgets on Thursday.\nOther councils had been through that process since last month, with all agreeing to a freeze.\nLocal authorities are to receive a cash equivalent of a 3% council tax increase in return for not putting up levels.\nThe move forms part of the Scottish government's spending plans for the coming year, which Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said were aimed at striking a balance between raising revenue to pay for public services and helping Scotland recover from the Covid pandemic.\nMs Forbes said she was pleased the freeze had been agreed by all the councils.\nShe said: \"With people facing unprecedented challenges and extra pressures, now is a time to work together to provide stability and certainty.\n\"I am pleased that councils have taken advantage of this additional support and have protected household finances. This will make a real difference to people across Scotland.\"\nPoints to note: Band D is highlighted above as the average council tax bill for householders in Scotland. The Band D figures do not include water and sewerage charges. Therefore, the final household bill will be bigger.\nIt will come as a relief to the Scottish government when they are finally able to confirm that council tax bills will not rise anywhere in Scotland this year.\nThe SNP believes it will be a popular measure at a time when some families are facing financial pressures because of the pandemic.\nSo it will be a relief for the government - but no real surprise.\nIf any council were to decide to put up the council tax, the rise would need to be significant to be worthwhile. This is because they would have lost out on some government funding if they put up bills.\nThe Scottish government will be hopeful that a new council tax freeze proves as popular with the public as they think the first one did.  \nBetween 2007 and 2017 the basic council tax rate didn't rise anywhere in Scotland. Since then councils have been able to put it up within agreed limits, though it's worth noting that some still opted for lower rises and even freezes.\nThe basic argument between some in local government and Holyrood is not over whether voters will welcome another freeze - most accept they will. The argument is over whether councils have enough money overall and if they are too dependent on government cash.\nMost council income either comes directly from the government or, like council tax, is heavily influenced by it.\nCouncils had already been given extra government money to cope with the pandemic but have also lost income - sports centres have been closed, facilities cannot be hired out and they have lost income from car parking.\nThe underlying issue is whether the council tax itself is fit for purpose and whether councils should have a broader range of ways to raise finances.\nFourteen years ago when the SNP first took control of Holyrood, a council tax freeze was meant to be a temporary measure while a way to replace the council tax was found. \nFinding an alternative or finding palatable ways of giving councils more financial independence from central government is easier said than done."

Mackenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has also signed up to the pledge and gave away more than $4bn of her fortune in just four months last year.\nThe fifth member of the exclusive cohort is LVMH's Bernard Arnault and his family.\nFacebook co-founder Mark Zuckerburg has just slipped out of the exclusive ranks, according to the Forbes real-time billionaires list.\nMr Buffett's net worth comes almost entirely from owning about one-sixth of Berkshire Hathaway, a roughly $600bn company.\nIts share price is up 15% this year, surpassing $400,000 a share. The investment firm had been struggling in recent years to find deals to spark its growth given its sheer size.\nThe Omaha-based company is a major shareholder in Apple and other tech stocks that have seen their values surge during the pandemic.\nBerkshire Hathaway was a failing textile company before Mr Buffett took control of it 1965.

      "text": "MSPs have passed Scotland's controversial new hate crime law.\nThe legislation consolidates existing law and extends protection for vulnerable groups with a new offence of \"stirring up hatred\".\nIt was passed by 82 votes to 32 a day later than expected, after MSPs ran out of time on Wednesday while debating a raft of amendments.\nOpponents of the bill said they still have concerns about a possible chilling of free speech.\nThere were four abstentions.\nJustice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: \"I am delighted Holyrood has backed this powerful legislation that is fitting for the Scotland we live in.\n \"Parliament has sent a strong and clear message to victims, perpetrators, communities and to wider society that offences motivated by prejudice will be treated seriously and will not be tolerated.\"\nThe Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Bill was first introduced last April in response to an independent review of Scotland's hate crime laws by Lord Bracadale, but has sparked fierce debate.\nUnder the bill, offences are considered \"aggravated\" - which could influence sentencing - if they involve prejudice on the basis of age, disability, race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or variations in sex characteristics (sometimes described as \"intersex\" physical or biological characteristics).\nIt also creates new offences of \"stirring up hatred\" - which previously applied only to race - and abolishes the offence of blasphemy which has not been prosecuted in Scotland for more than 175 years.\nAn earlier draft of the bill was criticised by the Law Society of Scotland for having a perceived low threshold for prosecution.\nA number of groups including religious and cultural groups, writers, journalists, campaigners and police raised concerns about its impact on free expression.\nThe Scottish government responded by modifying the wording and strengthening freedom of expression provisions.\nThe changes meant \"stirring up hatred\" would only be considered an offence if it was intentional.\nOn Wednesday, two amendments designed to further strengthen the protection of free speech were passed unanimously by MSPs.\nDuring the final debate on Thursday, Humza Yousaf argued that those provisions were strong enough to prevent criminalisation.\nHe said: \"To those who think they may accidentally somehow fall foul of the law... because they believe sex is immutable, or they believe an adult man cannot become a female or they campaign for the rights of Palestinians... or those that proselytise that same-sex relationships are sinful, none of these people would fall foul of the stirring up of hatred offence for solely stating their belief - even if they did so in a robust manner.\n\"Why? Because solely stating any belief, which I accept may be offensive to some, is not breaching the criminal threshold.\n\"This bill makes clear that we are listening to the victims of hate crime.\"\nIt was described in a heated five-hour debate as \"the most controversial\" piece of legislation ever considered by the Scottish Parliament.\nFrom its troubled beginnings, the Hate Crime Bill has been altered significantly. Changes were made during cross-party efforts in what some MSPs described as \"Holyrood at its best\".\nYet even with that scrutiny, concerns remain. Offences can now be committed even in private, an abandonment of an earlier \"dwelling defence\" in race hate law. \nEven with the Scottish government's insistence that the bar for prosecution is high, there are those who still believe this is an example of interference in private and family life. Why should any government, they ask, decide what can and can't be said in the privacy of one's home?\nWhat is the difference, though, if one intends to encourage others into action against a vulnerable section of the community, whether that encouragement is in public or in private? That's the position of the Scottish government.\nAnd then there is the issue of sex. Some - including Labour's Johann Lamont - say the bill should have done more to protect women. She referred to the violence and abuse women suffer at the hands of men.\nThis debate goes to the heart of how individuals identify themselves and asks how the authorities might permit them to discuss their place in society. MSPs have found themselves trying to strike a delicate balance between freedom of expression and freedom from persecution. Have they succeeded? Opinions vary.\nSo, having said all that, what does all this actually mean for you? Well, it depends on who YOU are and - crucially - how you're defined by this new law.\nHowever, Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Liam Kerr said there was \"inherent ambiguity\" in the language of the legislation.\nHe claimed it did not strike the right \"balance\" between free expression and protection from hate.\nAnother amendment from MSP Johann Lamont that would have included women as a protected group under the legislation was defeated.\nThe government has instead set a working group to look at whether misogynistic abuse should be a separate crime.\nThis group, led by QC Baroness Helena Kennedy, is due to report within a year.\nScottish Labour's Neil Bibby agreed with Ms Lamont that the legislation was \"flawed\" because sex was not included as a protected characteristic.\nHowever he said we \"ultimately have to recognise this bill will give protection to minorities\".\nHe said: \"It makes sense that we should seek to consolidate, modernise and reform Scotland's hate crime laws. We need this bill because hate crime has become more widespread. Society has become more polarised and divided.\"\nLiberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur also said he thought it was \"anomalous\" to leave out sex as a protected characteristic.\nHe said his concerns had \"not wholly disappeared\" but he had been \"persuaded on balance\" to vote for the bill.\nMSP John Finnie from the Greens dismissed suggestions from opponents that family dinners could be \"ruined by a flurry of arrests\" if people made controversial comments.\nHe said: \"The bill, like others, is about balance, and I think the balance between the freedom of expression and the right to private life has been struck by this bill, and countless organisations agree.\""

      "text": "Piers Morgan has said he stands by his criticism of the Duchess of Sussex as ITV's Good Morning Britain aired for the first time since his departure.\nMorgan left the show on Tuesday after saying he \"didn't believe a word\" Meghan said in her interview with Oprah Winfrey.\nOfcom is investigating his comments after receiving 41,000 complaints.\nIt is also being reported the duchess formally complained to ITV about Morgan's remarks.\nChris Ship, the royal editor of ITV News, tweeted: \"Meghan raised concerns about how Piers Morgan's words affect the issue of mental health and what it might do to others contemplating suicide.\" Neither those representing the Sussexes nor ITV have confirmed the complaint.\nMorgan was a divisive figure during his six years on Good Morning Britain. His departure came after he stormed off set when he was criticised by his colleague Alex Beresford, and after ITV chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall said she believed the duchess about her suicidal feelings.\nRanvir Singh, who was sitting in Morgan's chair on Wednesday, said: \"We don't call him Marmite for nothing.\" It is not yet known who will be his permanent replacement on GMB.\nIn a tweet as Wednesday's programme was beginning, Morgan said: \"On Monday, I said I didn't believe Meghan Markle in her Oprah interview. I've had time to reflect on this opinion, and I still don't.\"\nHe added: \"Freedom of speech is a hill I'm happy to die on. Thanks for all the love, and hate. I'm off to spend more time with my opinions.\" His message was accompanied by a photo of Winston Churchill with a quote about free speech.\nSpeaking outside his London home later, the presenter described his departure as \"amicable\", adding: \"I had a good chat with ITV and we agreed to disagree.\"\nHe explained: \"I believe in freedom of speech, I believe in the right to be allowed to have an opinion. If people want to believe Meghan Markle, that's entirely their right.\n\"I don't believe almost anything that comes out of her mouth and I think the damage she's done to the British monarchy and to the Queen at a time when Prince Philip is lying in hospital is enormous and frankly contemptible.\n\"If I have to fall on my sword for expressing an honestly held opinion about Meghan Markle and that diatribe of bilge that she came out with in that interview, so be it.\"\nBefore his departure on Tuesday, Morgan did concede that it was \"not for me to question if she felt suicidal\".\nOn Wednesday,he also said: \"I think it's fair to say, although the woke crowd will think that they've cancelled me, I think they will be rather disappointed when I re-emerge.\"\nHe added that his forthcoming absence from screens would be \"a temporary hibernation\", and that he was \"always in talks with people\" about offers of work.\nITV said the final episode of his Life Stories series, featuring Coleen Nolan, is still scheduled to be broadcast next week as planned.\nMorgan's long-time co-presenter began Wednesday's episode of the breakfast programme by informing viewers about Morgan's exit.\n\"Piers and I have disagreed on many things, and that dynamic was one of the things that viewers loved about the programme,\" she said. \"He is without doubt an outspoken, challenging, opinionated, disruptive broadcaster.\n\"He has many critics and he has many fans. You will know that I disagreed with him about Meghan's interview. He himself clarified his comments about her mental health on the show yesterday. There are many voices on GMB, and everyone has their say.\n\"But now, Piers has decided to leave the programme.

We need more, not fewer like that in media.\" She followed up with a message to him: \"We love you!\"\nBooker Prize-winning author Bernardine Evaristo said: \"His departure is a triumph for feminists everywhere.\"\nWelsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething described his comments as \"wholly unacceptable, incredibly unkind and exactly where we should not be in public debate and discourse\".\nThe Mail on Sunday's showbiz editor Katie Hind said Morgan's departure would have \"terrible ramifications for viewing figures\" of the ITV show, adding: \"Many, many watch for him.\"\nPiers Morgan's final edition of Good Morning Britain beat its rival BBC Breakfast in the ratings for the first time. Tuesday's edition of GMB was watched by 1.29 million people, according to overnight audience figures, compared with BBC Breakfast's 1.25 million.\nRanvir Singh, GMB's political editor, stood in on Wednesday and is among the frontrunners to fill his shoes permanently.\nOther possibilities include his holiday stand-ins Richard Madeley and Adil Ray; or existing GMB presenters like Ben Shephard, Charlotte Hawkins or Alex Beresford, who was praised by many for taking Morgan to task on Tuesday.\nThere have also been mentions for Jeremy Clarkson, who currently hosts ITV's Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?; Channel 5 and BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine; former Sky News breakfast host Eamonn Holmes; and Kay Burley, who is currently suspended from Sky.\nDuring Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah, which was broadcast in the UK on ITV, Meghan said her mental health became so bad she \"didn't want to be alive any more\" due to the loss of freedom she felt after joining the Royal Family.\nShe said she asked for help from the palace but did not receive any. \nThe duchess also said an unnamed family member had asked \"how dark\" their son Archie's skin might be, something the palace has said it has \"taken very seriously\". \nBut the morning after the interview aired in the US, Morgan said he did not believe a word the duchess had said.\nHe added: \"The fact that she's fired up this onslaught against our Royal Family I think is contemptible.\"\nA total of 41,015 complaints were made to media watchdog Ofcom by 14:00 GMT on Tuesday, the second highest number of complaints in Ofcom's 17-year history.\nMental health charity Mind, which is a partner with ITV on its Britain Get Talking campaign, also criticised Morgan, saying it was \"disappointed\" by the presenter's comments."

      "text": "A simple skin-swab test could be used to help diagnose the degenerative brain condition Parkinson's disease, UK scientists say. \nStudies with volunteers show it can quickly detect tell-tale compounds in sebum - the oily substance that protects the skin. \nPeople with Parkinson's can have higher than usual concentrations of these.\nResearchers discovered this after a woman amazed doctors with her ability to detect Parkinson's through smell. \nRetired nurse Joy Milne, 68, from Perth, noticed the \"musky\" smell on her husband, Les, years before his Parkinson's diagnosis.\nShe has been helping scientists at the University of Manchester explore the link. \nAnd a blinded test of her odour-detecting skills found she was 100% accurate.\nThe research team moved on to using a mass-spectrometry machine to detect the compounds.\nAnd they now have data from 500 people, showing the skin test can correctly distinguish those with Parkinson's more than eight out of every 10 times.\nInvestigator Prof Perdita Barran said: \"We believe that our results are an extremely encouraging step towards tests that could be used to help diagnose and monitor Parkinson's. \n\"Not only is the test quick, simple and painless but it should also be extremely cost-effective because it uses existing technology that is already widely available.\n\"We are now looking to take our findings forwards to refine the test to improve accuracy even further and to take steps towards making this a test that can be used in the NHS and to develop more precise diagnostics and better treatment for this debilitating condition.\"\nCurrently, there is no cure and no definitive test for Parkinson's.\nAnd diagnosis can take years. \nThe researchers are seeking funding to further develop their test, which they believe could also help track disease progression and measure whether treatments are having an impact, at the molecular level. \nTheir latest work, published in the journal Nature Communications, suggests progression of the disease comes with changes in the regulation of lipids in cells.\nDaxa Kalayci, 56, of Leicester, was misdiagnosed several times over four years before finally finding out she had Parkinson's in 2019. \n\"I was misdiagnosed with anxiety, stress-related tremors and told that my problems stemmed from going through the menopause,\" she said.\n\"Despite my diagnosis eventually being confirmed... a quick and simple diagnostic test for Parkinson's would have given me the chance to start my treatment earlier and enjoy life a lot more. \n\"But instead, I lost so many years not being able to pursue a career as a paramedic or go back to nursing.\n\"This test could be a game-changer for people living with Parkinson's and searching for answers, like I was.\""

      "text": "Scientists from UK Biobank have embarked on a major study to determine Covid-19's long-term health impacts.\nUK Biobank is a biomedical database with medical images, genetic data and health information on 500,000 people.\nAbout 1,500 people who have had Covid will be scanned again to check how organs are affected by infection.\nIts chief scientist, Prof Naomi Allen, said it was the only study able to compare patient data before and after they have had Covid.\nProf Allen added: \"We knew at the beginning of the pandemic that Covid-19 was largely a respiratory illness. And now what we also know is that it seems to affect other parts of the body as well - the heart, the liver, the kidneys, and even the brain.\n\u201cSo researchers will be able to investigate the direct effects of coronavirus infection on changes in both the structure and the function of these organs.\u201d\nThe study will look at people with asymptomatic Covid, and others who had severe disease.\nBrain scans will also be carried out to try to aid understanding of long Covid.\n\u201cIt will enable researchers to investigate whether the effects of the virus on different organs of the body vary between how severe your infection was in the first place,\u201d explains Prof Allen.\nDetailed scans of 1,500 Biobank members who have not been infected will also be recorded.\n'Very proud of taking part'\nBrian Shepherd, 71, from Gateshead, is one of those taking part. \nIn November he spent five days in hospital after catching Covid.\n\u201cThe worst thing was when I got in the ambulance, with my wife standing on the pavement, and you think 'will I ever see her again?'.\"\nBut after five days of treatment, Brian was allowed home. He has recovered well, but still has some symptoms.\nHe hopes his scans - and those of the other Biobank volunteers - will help us to learn more about the after-effects of the disease.\n\u201cWe're all very proud of taking part in it, and feel that our little bit can help somewhere along the line for the rest of the world.\u201d\nScience is still in the early stages of understanding the long-term effects of Covid. \nResearch has already started to chart its impact. Scientists have discovered scarring on the lungs, inflammation and muscle damage of the heart, and kidney injuries.\nThe virus can also affect the brain, and some long Covid sufferers have said they are experiencing \u201cbrain fog\u201d - problems with memory and concentration, dizziness and depression.\nThe hope is the study could pinpoint some of the neurological changes that may have taken place.\nProf Paul Matthews, a neuroscientist from Imperial College London, said: \u201cThe brain scans can tell us more general things about the brain structure. Whether there's evidence for inflammation in the brain that may be persisting, and whether there's been damage enough to to actually kill nerve cells in the brain that may cause some shrinkage.\u201d\nThese scans will be repeated over the coming years - and made available to researchers all around the world.\nThe team says our understanding of the health legacy of Covid is just beginning.\nFollow @BBCMorelle on Twitter"

      "text": "Post-Brexit checks on some EU goods coming into Great Britain have been delayed by six months in order to give businesses more time to prepare. \nThe government said the new timetable would help firms recovering in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe need for health certificates on imports such as meat and milk will be pushed back from next month to October.\nAnd in-person inspections on such animal products due from July will now begin in January 2022.\nIt is the second time that the timetable for these checks, originally due after the post-Brexit transition ended in January 2021, has been put back.\nThe European Union has been implementing full checks on goods sent from the UK since the start of this year. \nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the disruption caused by the pandemic had \"lasted longer and has been deeper than we anticipated\".\nIn a statement outlining the changes, he insisted the government had been \"confident of being ready on time\" for the checks to take effect. \nBut he added: \"We have listened to businesses who have made a strong case that they need more time to prepare.\"\nUnder the revised timetable:\nThe British Retail Consortium, which represents everything from major supermarkets to fast food chains and online businesses, said it would have been \"foolhardy\" not to delay checks given the current state of border infrastructure and IT systems. \nIts director of food Andrew Opie said the new timetable had come \"in the nick of time,\" with many border posts \"little more than a hole in the ground\".\nHe added that pushing ahead without a delay \"might otherwise have seen empty shelves for some products\".\nHe urged the government not to \"rest on its laurels,\" and use the next six month to \"establish and communicate the new systems\" with businesses. \nLabour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Jack Dromey said the government's \"chopping and changing\" of rules \"smacks of ill-preparedness and incompetence\".\n\"They have had years to prepare for this but can't stop missing their own deadlines,\" he added.\n\"The government need to pull their sleeves up, listen to businesses who have been desperately coming forward with practical solutions, and get this sorted.\"\nThis extension is not ideal, but it does mean that supermarket shelves, for example, should be kept relatively well-stocked during the recovery from the pandemic. \nIt is far from clear that all port infrastructure would have been ready to cope with these import arrangements. \nIt is theoretically possible that other countries exporting to the UK would argue these grace periods violate key world trade principles on offering the same access to all countries.\nIn practice, in the middle of a pandemic, it seems unlikely that a few months' continuation of favourable import arrangements for EU firms would really lead to a significant backlash. \nBritish exporters that are facing non-tariff barriers in trade with the EU and even with Northern Ireland, might, however, express concern about the impact of EU competitors having ongoing free access to the UK market. \nEffectively there has been a post-Brexit transition period - but only for EU firms exporting into the UK.\nThe latest delay comes amid a row over the UK's decision to postpone a separate set of border checks on GB goods arriving in Northern Ireland.\nUnder the UK's withdrawal deal, Northern Ireland is following the EU's rules on goods in order to avoid border posts with the Irish Republic. \nBut that has required a new set of checks on goods going between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \nThe UK has unilaterally pushed back the full implementation of some of these checks, after disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries.\nThe UK has insisted the move is lawful and justified - but the EU has threatened a legal challenge. \nEarlier, the EU's diplomatic representative in the UK called for a reset in relations, amid rising tensions over borders and other issues. \nJoao Vale de Alemeida said there was a need to \"change the mindset\" and \"give up on trying score points on the disputes of the past\".

It's being budgeted for and now it's being taken away.\n\"He shakes his head - his MPs voted for it. So why, after everything the NHS has done for us, is he now breaking promise after promise?\"\nMr Johnson replied: \"He voted against the document in question to crown the absurdity of his point.\"\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called on Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to \"get the prime minister to return to the House and correct the record\".\nMr Ashworth said: \"The prime minister has twice, from that dispatch box, said that the Labour opposition voted against the NHS Funding Bill and the 2.1% increase for NHS staff. This is not the case.\"\nSir Lindsay said Mr Ashworth's intervention was not something he would rule on but added \"it is certainly a point of clarification - that part has been achieved\".\nWriting on Twitter later, Mr Ashworth said that Mr Johnson had \"lied at PMQs\" and repeated Labour's demand for a vote in Parliament on the 1% offer.\nHe has written to the PM to ask him to \"correct the record\", telling him: \"At all times in the debate, Labour attempted to secure a greater financial settlement for the NHS in order to improve patient care.\" \nLabour says the proposed 1% rise amounts to a pay cut, when inflation has been taken into account.\nMr Johnson says it is all the country can afford at the present time, and NHS workers are set for a rise amid a public sector pay freeze, to reflect the \"massive debt\" owed to them by the nation.\nThe PM says he will make a final decision on pay when an independent review reports back in May.\nBoris Johnson told MPs Sir Keir Starmer voted against the 2019 long-term plan for the NHS, after the Labour leader referred to it.\nThat is not correct - there were no votes on the NHS Funding Bill 2019-20 during its main stages through parliament.\nSir Keir had referred to the plan, saying that it committed the government to a 2.1% pay rise for the NHS.\nThe government has now recommended that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase this year.\nOn Tuesday, the head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens told a committee of MPs that the plan had indeed assumed a 2.1% rise.\nBut he also said \"things have changed\" since then and that it should now be up to the pay-review body.\nThe prime minister's press secretary Allegra Stratton was asked more than 20 questions about the row at briefing for Westminster journalists.\nShe indicated that he would neither apologise nor correct the record.\n\"The key thing is that this was dealt with swiftly and the Speaker - who has enormous respect and authority in Parliament - regards it as a point of clarification and it has now been dealt with,\" she told reporters.\nAsked if Mr Johnson had a problem with facts, Ms Stratton said: \"No, he doesn't. The Speaker addressed this as a point of clarification and it has been dealt with today.\"\nThe ministerial code states that it is of \"paramount importance that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity\".\nMs Stratton said Mr Johnson \"absolutely agrees\" with the ministerial code and \"in this instance the system worked\" because the Speaker had responded to Mr Ashworth."

We love to count data of our own popularity. However, we don't currently count dead women.\"\nShe said there was no government study done into data on victims of domestic abuse who are killed, die by suicide or die suddenly.\n\"Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives,\" she added.\n\"Dead women is just one of those things. Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common.\"\nListening to Ms Phillips read out the list of victims, the Labour MP, Rosie Duffield, said it was \"impossible not to be overcome as those names echo round the chamber\". \nShe said: \"Every year we bring tissues, we prepare ourselves mentally as well as we can\" to list to the \"horrific list\" but pandemic or not, she said, \"women are tired having to pre-empt possible violence and risk assess every action\".\nSNP deputy leader at Westminster Kirsten Oswald told how she feels walking alone in the dark:  \"I will not change my behaviour, but do feel scared sometimes\", she said.\n\"I cross the road, I have my keys in my hand, I think about where the street lights are, where the dark alleys are.\" \n\"I'm aware and vigilant, because, like all women, I have to be.\"\nThe Conservative MP, Sir Bernard Jenkin, said things would only change when there were greater societal changes and \"more women in the room\" in positions of authority. \n\"Despite everything that's been achieved for women's rights,\" he said the debate proved \"this is not a job that has been done, it is still very much a job to do\". \nAs vigils highlighting women's safety are being organised following the disappearance of Sarah Everard, more than 200 women have signed an open letter to the government calling for a \"firm commitment\" to tackle male violence.\nThe letter, which has been signed by Labour MP Harriet Harman, charity workers and campaigners, says \"women are still at risk doing the most simple of things\". \n\"Something has to change - and it cannot be women, the victims in this, to be responsible for leading that charge.\"\nDomestic abuse charities have warned that calls to their helplines have \"gone through the roof\" since the lockdown began.\nMore than 40,000 calls and contacts were made to the National Domestic Abuse Helpline in the first three months of the lockdown in 2020. \nUnder the government's Domestic Abuse Bill, councils in England will get an extra \u00a36m to provide support and safe accommodation for abuse survivors and their families.\nThe additional money comes on top of a \u00a310m emergency fund given to councils to help domestic abuse survivors during the pandemic.

      "text": "The market for homes has slowed further with lockdown, and more in Scotland than other parts of the UK.\nThe Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) is reporting that interest from potential buyers was down in February.\nThe number of properties being put on the market was also down, for the fourth consecutive month. \nMore surveyors reported prices rising than falling. \nRICS expects the easing of Covid restrictions in coming months to bring more activity back.\nUnlike last spring, the housing market has remained open in Scotland during lockdown in 2021, but with distancing restrictions.\nScotland had the weakest figures for new buyer inquiries of any nation or region in the UK. \nThe only region that was weaker for selling instructions was Yorkshire, and the only part of the UK with weaker price growth was London.\nIn the monthly RICS report, comments from agents noted some pockets of activity.  \nIn rural Scotland - from Elgin, Fraserburgh, the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway - agents noted strong demand for properties. With slow supply, they said home sales can be quick.\nPhiddy Robertson of the Galbraith Group in Inverness, said: \"The market is starved of good quality property. \n\"Buyers are paying significant premiums to secure attractive coastal property and we are seeing more interest than ever from southern buyers looking for second homes.\"\nIn Edinburgh and Glasgow, surveyors found the market more patchy, noting that more flats are coming on the market as private landlords sell. \nIn the housing rental market, Scotland had the biggest drop in property availability of any part of the UK.  \nJohn Brown, a rental agent in Edinburgh, commented: \"The market is fragmented, with fewer enquiries and longer void periods between tenancies. \n\"It's clear landlords are looking to reduce portfolios. More legislation, and Energy Performance Certificate standards being enforced, add to costs. \n\"Students are registering for next year but trying to be uncommitted - that's the Covid effect\".\nIn Dumfries at the Savills agency, Carolyn Davies said renters are looking for demand for rural properties \"but broadband speeds now need to be established prior to letting\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Jair Bolsonaro,Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva,Brazil,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Brazil has exceeded 2,000 Covid-related deaths in a single day for the first time, as infection rates soar.\nThe country has the second highest death toll in the world, behind the US. Experts warn the transmission rate is made worse by more contagious variants.\nOn Wednesday, former leader Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva hit out at President Jair Bolsonaro's \"stupid\" decisions. \nMr Bolsonaro has downplayed the threat from the virus. Earlier this week he told people to \"stop whining\". \nOn Wednesday, the country recorded 79,876 new cases, the third highest number in a single day. The total number of Covid-related deaths reached 270,656, according to Johns Hopkins University in the US.  \nIt means Brazil has a rate of 128 deaths per 100,000 population - 11th highest amongst 20 of the worst affected countries in the world. The highest rates are in the Czech Republic with 208 deaths per 100,000 people and the UK with 188 deaths per 100,000 people, Johns Hopkin's figures suggest. \nMargareth Dalcolmo, a doctor and researcher at Fiocruz described the situation as \"the worst moment of the pandemic in Brazil\". \nAcross Brazil, intensive care units (ICU) are at more than 80% capacity, according to Fiocruz. And in 15 state capitals, ICUs are at more than 90% capacity, including in Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo. \nReports say the capital Brasilia has now reached full ICU capacity, while two cities - Porto Alegre and Campo Grande - have exceeded capacity.\nIn its report, Fiocruz warned that the figures point to the \"overload and even collapse of health systems\". \nBrazilian epidemiologist Dr Pedro Hallal told the BBC World Service's Outside Source programme: \"If we do not start vaccinating the population here very soon, it will become a massive tragedy.\"\nDr Hallal, who works in Rio Grande do Sul, also said that people felt \"abandoned by the federal government\". \n\"It took a long time for the politicians to act,\" 40-year-old Adilson Menezes told AFP news agency outside a hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo. \"We are paying for it, the poor people,\" Mr Menezes said referring to the state of near collapse of Brazil's public healthcare system.\nBrazil is facing its biggest crisis since the pandemic began - but still, it feels like people are trying to ignore it. \nTake S\u00e3o Paulo for example; while non-essential shops have had to close these past few weeks, there's no \"lockdown\" to speak of - no restrictions on whom people meet and schools have remained largely open (albeit with lower capacity). \nPeople here are making their own decisions about how to stay safe, and there certainly isn't that fear like we saw this time a year ago, where the whole world was shutting down, so Brazilians did the same. \nA year on, and even amid dire statistics that are set to carry on rising, Jair Bolsonaro's narrative has been bought by many - a mistrust of the Chinese CoronaVac vaccine, a railing against closing restaurants and businesses - all the while, scientists are increasingly calling for more national leadership to stop the entire health system from collapsing in the coming weeks. \nA surge in cases in recent days has been attributed to the spread of a highly contagious variant of the virus - named P1 - which is thought to have originated in the Amazon city of Manaus.\nPreliminary data suggests the P1 variant could be up to twice as transmittable as the original version of the virus. \nIt also suggests that the new variant could evade immunity built up by having had the original version of Covid. The chance of reinfection is put at between 25% and 60%.\nScientists are concerned that Brazil has almost become a \"natural laboratory\" - where people can see what happens when coronavirus goes relatively unchecked.\nSome warn the country is now a breeding ground for new variants of the virus, unhindered by effective social distancing and fuelled by vaccine shortages.\nThat's because the longer a virus circulates in a country, the more chances it has to mutate - in this case giving rise to P1.\nGlobal experts are calling for a plan - including rapid vaccination, lockdowns, and strict social distancing measures - to get the situation under control.\nThe worry is that the P1 variant is a looming threat over the progress made in the region and the wider world.\nCurrent vaccines are, on the whole, still effective against the variant but may be less so than against the earlier versions of the virus they were designed to fight.\nStudies are ongoing but experts will get their most robust understanding of how well these vaccines work against P1 as they continue to monitor people who have been vaccinated in the real world.\nScientists are confident that, if necessary, vaccines can be tweaked fairly quickly to work against new variants.\nLast week, the Fiocruz Institute said P1 was just one of several \"variants of concern\" that have become dominant in six of eight states studied by the Rio-based organisation.\nThe director of the Pan American Health Organization, Carissa Etienne, said the the situation in Brazil \"provides a sober reminder of the threat of resurgence: areas hit hard by the virus in the past are still vulnerable to infection today\".\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro has belittled the risks posed by the virus from the start of the pandemic. He has also opposed quarantine measures taken at a regional level, arguing that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the virus itself.\nHis stance has come in for severe criticism both internationally and in Brazil itself.\nMr Bolsonaro's former ally turned political rival, Jo\u00e3o Doria, has called the the president \"a crazy guy\". \nOn Wednesday, former President Lula, in his first speech since corruption convictions against him were annulled, told people not to follow \"stupid\" decisions by Mr Bolsonaro and to \"get vaccinated\". Lula said \"a lot of deaths could have been avoided\". \nResponding to Lula's scathing remarks, Mr Bolsonaro said his government had done enough to fight the disease."

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex,Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor",
      "text": "In her interview with Oprah Winfrey, Meghan Duchess of Sussex said that when she was pregnant, there were conversations about her future child's status, including what title he or she should receive. \n\"They were saying they didn't want him to be a prince or princess, not knowing what the gender would be, which would be different from protocol,\" she said.\nThe rules about who gets to be a prince and also be referred to as his royal highness (HRH) come from a letter patent issued by King George V in November 1917.\nLetters patent are legal instruments which may take the form of an open letter from the monarch. They may be used for royal declarations or the granting of titles such as peerages.\nIn the 1917 letter, George V declared that the great-grandchildren of the monarch would no longer be princes or princesses, except for the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales.\nIn our current situation, that means that Prince George, the eldest son of Prince William, automatically became a prince, but not Archie, even though they are both great-grandsons of the Queen.\nUnder this protocol, Prince George's siblings - Charlotte and Louis - would not have received the title either.\nBut in December 2012, the Queen also issued a letter patent which said that all of Prince William's children would be entitled to be princes or princesses and get the HRH title. \nAlso, being a prince or princess only goes through the male line, which means that the children of Princess Anne did not get those titles despite being the Queen's grandchildren.\nAccording to the 1917 letter, Archie is entitled to become a prince - but not yet. \nThe children of Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, would have to wait until Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, became king, at which point they would be the grandchildren of the monarch and hence entitled to be princes or princesses.\nThat is why Prince Andrew's daughters - Beatrice and Eugenie - were princesses from birth, for example.\nThe Duchess of Sussex was clearly aware of the protocol.\nShe referred in the interview to a \"George V or George VI convention\" that would mean her son Archie would become a prince \"when Harry's dad becomes king\".\nBut she went on to say that she had been told when she was pregnant that \"they want to change the convention for Archie\" so he would not become a prince. \nShe did not give any more details about this and Buckingham Palace has not commented on her claims.\n\"I saw that Meghan mentioned that there were plans to narrow eligibility and I imagine that this is a reference to the Prince of Wales's stated view that the size of the royal family needs to be reduced,\" said Bob Morris from the Constitution Unit at UCL.\n\"However, he has not so far as I know given details of how it should be accomplished.\""

We must work fast to find all the answers to this horrifying crime,\" he added.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said she was \"deeply saddened by the developments\", adding that \"every woman should feel safe to walk our streets without fear of harassment or violence\".\nMs Everard, a marketing executive, was last seen in doorbell video footage walking alone down a main road near Clapham at 21:30 GMT, with police saying it was unclear if she reached her home in Brixton.\nThe former Durham University student, who is originally from York, had been wearing a green rain jacket, navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern, and turquoise and orange trainers. \nIn a televised statement on Wednesday, Dame Cressida Dick confirmed officers searching an area near Ashford had \"found, very sadly, what appears to be human remains\".\nThe Met Police commissioner said specialist officers had updated Ms Everard's family on the investigation.\nDame Cressida continued: \"Sarah's disappearance in these awful and wicked circumstances is every family's worst nightmare.\n\"I know Londoners will want to know that it is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets.\n\"But I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public - particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing - will be worried and may well be feeling scared.\"\nDame Cressida said the arrest of a serving Met Police officer on suspicion of murder had \"sent waves of shock and anger through the public and through the whole of the Met\".\n\"I speak on behalf of all my colleagues in the Met when I say we are utterly appalled at this dreadful news,\" she added. \"Our job is to patrol the streets and to protect people.\"\nThe arrested officer was responsible for uniformed patrolling of diplomatic premises - including Downing Street and the Palace of Westminster, as well as foreign embassies in London.\nHe was off duty at the time of Ms Everard's disappearance.\nA woman in her 30s was also arrested in Kent on Tuesday evening on suspicion of assisting an offender.\nThe case has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) because it involves a police officer.\nA spokesman said it had been decided that the Met Police would investigate any potential conduct issues linked to the kidnap and murder allegations itself.\nThe IOPC is currently assessing whether any further measures should be taken in relation to the actions of police after Ms Everard was reported missing.\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel."

      "text": "The Duke of Cambridge has said the royals are \"very much not a racist family\" in his first comments after accusations by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in a TV interview.\nPrince William also said he had not yet spoken to his brother but would do so.\nMeghan and Prince Harry said a royal had expressed concern over \"how dark\" their son Archie's skin might be.\nBuckingham Palace previously said the claim was \"concerning\" but it would be addressed privately.\nIn a statement, the Palace said \"recollections may vary\" but that the Sussexes would \"always be much loved family members\".\nDuring a visit to a school in Stratford, east London, on Thursday, Prince William was asked by a reporter: \"Is the Royal Family a racist family, sir?\"\nThe duke replied: \"We're very much not a racist family.\"\nAsked whether he had spoken to Prince Harry since the Oprah interview, Prince William said: \"No, I haven't spoken to him yet but I will do.\"\nPrince William's visit is not the first appearance by a senior royal since the interview aired - the Prince of Wales carried out an engagement earlier this week. \nDespite Prince William's team making clear to reporters he wouldn't be answering questions, he must have known they might come. One wonders if he had planned to engage or whether the answers were impromptu. \nWilliam will be well aware that anything he utters will be headline news.\nThe first question alluded to the rift between the two brothers. In the Oprah interview, Prince Harry said their relationship  is \"space\" at the moment but that \"time heals all things hopefully\". \nWe don't know when they last spoke but we do now know that William does intend to speak to him.\nAs for the second and more direct question - \"Is the royal family a racist family, sir?\" - William could have ignored it. But, despite the Queen's statement saying the race issue would be dealt with privately, the prince clearly felt he had to push back on what has become a very public and damaging allegation. \nRemaining silent, he felt, was not the best option.\nIn the TV interview, Meghan told Oprah there were \"concerns and conversations about how dark [Archie's] skin might be when he was born\".\nBoth Prince Harry and Meghan refused to say who made the comment - but Harry later clarified to Oprah that it was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh.\nDuring the interview Harry also said it hurt him that his family never spoke out about the \"colonial undertones\" of news headlines and articles.\nAnd asked by Oprah if the couple left the UK because of racism from the tabloid media, Harry replied: \"It was a large part of it.\"\nIn the interview, Harry also spoke about his relationship with his family - especially with his father, the Prince of Wales, and brother Prince William.\nAt one point after stepping back as senior royals, Harry said Charles \"stopped taking my calls\".\nAnd of William, Harry said: \"The relationship is 'space' at the moment. And time heals all things, hopefully.\"\nBuckingham Palace issued a response to the interview earlier this week following crisis meetings involving senior royals.\nFigures from US TV network CBS suggest that nearly 50 million people around the world have watched Oprah's interview with the couple.\nThe fallout from the interview has also seen broadcaster Piers Morgan leave his role as host of Good Morning Britain, after his comments about Meghan attracted 41,000 complaints.\nMeanwhile, the head of the Society of Editors - an industry body for the UK press - resigned after a row over its reaction to Harry's comments about the tabloid media."

      "text": "The race issues raised by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their interview with Oprah Winfrey are \"concerning\" and \"taken very seriously\", Buckingham Palace has said.\nIn a statement, the Palace said \"recollections may vary\" but the matters would be addressed privately.\nMeghan told Oprah that Harry had been asked by an unnamed family member \"how dark\" their son Archie's skin might be.\nThe Palace said the Sussexes would \"always be much loved family members\".\nThe response from Buckingham Palace came after crisis meetings involving senior royals. \nThe Palace had been under growing pressure to respond to the interview in which Meghan - the first mixed-race member of the modern Royal Family - said that before their son Archie was born, questions had been asked about his skin colour.\nPrince Harry later clarified to Oprah that the comments were not made by either the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh.\nFigures from US TV network CBS suggest that nearly 50 million people around the world have watched Oprah's interview with the couple.\nIn other developments, Piers Morgan has stood by the comments that led to his departure from ITV's Good Morning Britain show - including that he did not \"believe a word\" of what Meghan said in the interview.\nIt is reported a formal complaint by the duchess has been lodged with ITV but neither representatives for the Sussexes nor ITV have confirmed this.\nChris Ship, the royal editor of ITV News, said in a tweet that it was believed Meghan had raised concerns about how Morgan's words \"affect the issue of mental health and what it might do to others contemplating suicide\".\nThe statement from the Palace, which came a day and a half after the interview was first broadcast in the US, said: \"The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan. \n\"The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. Whilst some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.\n\"Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.\"\nIt is understood the royals wanted to carefully consider their response and to give the British public an opportunity to watch the interview first, when it was broadcast on Monday evening.\nThey are said to consider this a family matter and to believe they should be given the opportunity to discuss the issues privately.\nDowning Street has confirmed Prime Minister Boris Johnson has watched the interview, but his official spokesman declined to comment on the Palace's statement.\nAlthough likely, it was never absolutely certain that the Queen would issue a statement following the interview given by her grandson and his wife.\nThe risk was that any response would add to the \"royals in crisis\" narrative which is playing out across front pages and TV screens across the globe.\nBut having had time to discuss the claims made by Harry and Meghan, four short sentences convey the message from the Palace that this is a private family matter and the specific allegations will not be publicly addressed.\nThe tone is conciliatory, with reference to the Sussexes as much loved family members. There is a gentle challenge in the line \"whilst some recollections may vary\", but also an assurance that concerns will be taken seriously.\nAnd we can be sure that - at least as far as the UK-based royals are concerned - any bridge-building will be done in private. \nMeanwhile, the board of the Society of Editors has said it will \"work towards being part of the solution\" after coming under fire for its initial reaction to Meghan and Harry's interview.\nIt previously said it was \"not acceptable\" for the couple to make claims of racism in the press \"without providing any supporting evidence\".\nBut in a new statement the organisation said its earlier comments did not address that \"there is a lot of work to be done in the media to improve diversity and inclusion\".\n\"We will reflect on the reaction our statement prompted and work towards being part of the solution,\" it added.\nIt comes as MPs could push for a House of Commons debate to discuss possible actions following the media's \"hounding\" of Meghan.\nLabour's Holly Lynch, who co-ordinated a letter from female MPs in support of Meghan in 2019, has questioned the way the press is regulated. \n\"How long do you continue to let that fail before you have to recognise it has failed and say 'what next?'\" she said.\nDuring a visit in London earlier, Prince Charles did not respond when he was asked if he had seen the interview, in which the Sussexes addressed deeply personal topics of racism, mental health, the media and other members of the Royal Family.\nThe UK broadcast on Monday night was watched by an average of 11.1 million people.\nIn it, the duchess said there had been times when she \"didn't want to be alive any more\" because she found royal life so difficult. She said she asked for help from the Palace but received none.\nOne of Meghan's close friends said she had been \"worried, terrified, sad\" to see the duchess's mental health problems.\nActress Janina Gavankar also told ITV's This Morning: \"The family and the staff were well aware of the extent of it, and though their 'recollections may vary', ours don't, because we lived through it with them.\"\nGavankar, who watched the TV show air with both Meghan and Harry, added the couple were \"feeling free\" since the broadcast.\nMeghan told Oprah that conversations about how dark Archie's skin might be when he was born took place \"in tandem\" with discussions about why he would not be given a royal title and police protection.\nUnder rules in place since 1917, the couple's children would not automatically become princes or princesses - unless the Queen was to intervene."

      "text": "All of Scotland's 32 local authorities have frozen council tax rates at last year's levels.\nThe Scottish government offered councils incentives in return for not raising the cost of the bills.\nGlasgow and Stirling were the last authorities to consider council tax levels when they set their 2021/22 budgets on Thursday.\nOther councils had been through that process since last month, with all agreeing to a freeze.\nLocal authorities are to receive a cash equivalent of a 3% council tax increase in return for not putting up levels.\nThe move forms part of the Scottish government's spending plans for the coming year, which Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said were aimed at striking a balance between raising revenue to pay for public services and helping Scotland recover from the Covid pandemic.\nMs Forbes said she was pleased the freeze had been agreed by all the councils.\nShe said: \"With people facing unprecedented challenges and extra pressures, now is a time to work together to provide stability and certainty.\n\"I am pleased that councils have taken advantage of this additional support and have protected household finances. This will make a real difference to people across Scotland.\"\nPoints to note: Band D is highlighted above as the average council tax bill for householders in Scotland. The Band D figures do not include water and sewerage charges. Therefore, the final household bill will be bigger.\nIt will come as a relief to the Scottish government when they are finally able to confirm that council tax bills will not rise anywhere in Scotland this year.\nThe SNP believes it will be a popular measure at a time when some families are facing financial pressures because of the pandemic.\nSo it will be a relief for the government - but no real surprise.\nIf any council were to decide to put up the council tax, the rise would need to be significant to be worthwhile. This is because they would have lost out on some government funding if they put up bills.\nThe Scottish government will be hopeful that a new council tax freeze proves as popular with the public as they think the first one did.  \nBetween 2007 and 2017 the basic council tax rate didn't rise anywhere in Scotland. Since then councils have been able to put it up within agreed limits, though it's worth noting that some still opted for lower rises and even freezes.\nThe basic argument between some in local government and Holyrood is not over whether voters will welcome another freeze - most accept they will. The argument is over whether councils have enough money overall and if they are too dependent on government cash.\nMost council income either comes directly from the government or, like council tax, is heavily influenced by it.\nCouncils had already been given extra government money to cope with the pandemic but have also lost income - sports centres have been closed, facilities cannot be hired out and they have lost income from car parking.\nThe underlying issue is whether the council tax itself is fit for purpose and whether councils should have a broader range of ways to raise finances.\nFourteen years ago when the SNP first took control of Holyrood, a council tax freeze was meant to be a temporary measure while a way to replace the council tax was found. \nFinding an alternative or finding palatable ways of giving councils more financial independence from central government is easier said than done."

      "text": "Women \"will be worried and may well be feeling scared\" after the disappearance of Sarah Everard, the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick has said.\nOn social media, in WhatsApp groups and in Zoom calls across the country, women have been talking about the case of the 33-year-old, who went missing in Clapham, south London, on 3 March.\nA Met police officer continues to be questioned on suspicion of murder and kidnap after human remains were found during the search for her.\nSome women are sharing their anger, frustration and fear online - reflecting each others' experiences of walking alone on the streets.\n\"I learned from a very young age that I would have to change my behaviour in order to keep myself safe,\" Grace Jessup tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\"We're seeing a lot of women coming out and saying, 'we're tired of this, we're sick of this'. \n\"We're also kind of sick of the fact that this is a shock to men. \n\"This has been my reality, since I was about 14 years old, walking down the road in a school uniform and being harassed by passers-by.\" \nGrace says she never goes out without telling a friend to text her when they get home, or vice versa.\n\"If you don't, they'll follow up with you, and they'll make sure that you're safe. Because we have learned nobody is going to protect us.\"\nGrace used to live in Clapham, close to where Sarah Everard was last seen.\n\"She could have been me, she could have been any of my friends,\" she says.\nShe plans to go to a vigil planned on Saturday at Clapham Common.\n\"For me, it's not only a vigil, it's a space for us to just come together. This has hurt us, as young women.\n\"So I think it's important for us to gather, to acknowledge how that feels for us. And obviously, as a result pay tribute to her.\"\nDaisy Edwards lives five minutes' walk from the last place Sarah Everard was seen. She moved to the area a few months ago and also plans to go to the vigil on Saturday.\nShe saw the missing person posters around the streets last week.\n\"I'm really shocked at myself actually, how I didn't initially see the missing posters and take it seriously. I think maybe I've been desensitised to it.\"\nDaisy says she's used to taking precautions if walking somewhere alone, especially at night.\n\"If I feel that someone's following me I turn around and look at their face, or maybe stop to take a phone call - I've faked phone calls before.\"\nSome men are asking on social media what they can do to help women feel safe if they're walking alone.\nMost of the replies centre around giving women space on the street if you walk behind them or past them.\nBut some people are also very keen to point out that it's a tiny minority of men who are attackers - using the hashtag #NotAllMen.\n\"The issue with the argument is that women can't win,\" says Daisy.\n\"They want women to not treat all men as potential attackers, but then we also are asked to keep ourselves safe. \n\"Keeping ourselves safe means that we have to see everyone as potential attackers, because if we were to say, 'OK, not all men, we will treat everyone as innocent until proven guilty', that's when these things happen. \n\"And that's when people say, she should have been more careful. \n\"So it's really tough, because I think it's an attitude that's really built into society.\"\nShy can remember a few instances when she has felt scared walking in public on her own.\nTwo days ago, for example, on a lunchtime walk.\n\"I went past a couple of guys and I had my headphones on.\n\"I heard them make comments and I heard them say something like, 'oi, come over here.' I just ignored it carried on walking.\n\"And they said it again: 'Come over here, hey, I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you.'\n\"That is wrong. Because if you're trying to get someone's attention, and she's not acknowledging you, she's ignoring you. You need to back off.\n\"If this had happened during the evening with headphones in, would someone say to me, 'oh, you shouldn't have your headphones in'? Or that I shouldn't have gone down that road?\"\n\"I want to make something very clear, I'm not saying every man is the problem. I do not think that at all,\" says Shy.\nBut, she says, she's already started making precautions for when she can go out more as lockdown restrictions ease.\n\"I was on the phone to my friend this morning. And we were already googling different apps that we can put on our phone in case of emergencies. We've got an agreement where we will be on the phone to each other anyway.\"\nShy lives in Birmingham and says the case of Sarah Everard has resonated across the country.\n\"I travel for work, so I go all over the country pretty much. I don't think it's a London issue. I don't think it's a Birmingham issue. I think it's an overall issue.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "tags": "Robert Jenrick,Alok Sharma,Cumbria County Council,Tim Farron,COP26,Whitehaven",
      "text": "A public inquiry has been announced into plans for the first new deep coal mine in the UK for decades.\nThe government had previously decided not to intervene in the project near Whitehaven in Cumbria, which was in the hands of local officials.\nBut ministers have taken control because of \"increased\" controversy.\nGreen campaigners say the mine will increase carbon emissions and send the wrong signal in the run-up to a UK-hosted climate conference in October.\nThe Woodhouse Colliery would extract coking coal for the steel industry from the seabed off St Bees, with a processing plant at Kells, in Whitehaven.\nCumbria County Council councillors, who have been assessing the project since 2017, gave it the go-ahead last March - but have since decided to review the application.\nLast month it was reported that the government's climate tsar, Alok Sharma, was apoplectic the plans for the coal mine had not been stopped.\nMr Sharma, who is in charge of preparations for the COP26 UN climate conference, has faced calls to resign over the issue.\nHe told MPs only last month that the mine was a \"local issue\" and would be decided by the council. \nBut the government has now decided to \"call in\" the application, meaning Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick will get the final say over it.\nIn a letter to Cumbria County Council, Mr Jenrick said the application had raised issues of \"more than local importance\".\nHe added the reversal had also been prompted by new advice on carbon emissions from government climate advisers published in December. \nHowever, a public inquiry will first be held by independent planners at the Planning Inspectorate. The inquiry process could take a number of months. \nAsked on Friday whether the government backed the mine or not, Boris Johnson said he couldn't get involved as it was now a \"qausi-judicial planning decision\".\nMP Trudy Harrison, whose Copeland constituency would include the mine, is a ministerial aide to the prime minister and has described opponents of the mine as being in \"cloud cuckoo land\".\nMs Harrison has yet to comment on the decision to hold an inquiry, but the Tory MP for nearby Workington, Mark Jenkinson, called the decision a \"capitulation to climate alarmists\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Cumbria, he said the \"screeching U-turn\" could open a \"Pandora's box\" over how the UK's contribution to climate change is measured.\nHe added there was \"nothing on the horizon\" to replace coking coal in the process for making steel, a sector that is due to play an important role in the UK's \"green recovery\".\nThe government could still decide to approve the mine, but given the amount of anger it's caused that seems unlikely - at least until after the UN climate conference. \nLocal Conservatives strongly supported the scheme and the employment it would bring. \nBut the government's climate advisers, along with a crowd of green groups, warned it would increase carbon emissions when the UK's committed to cutting them.\nWhat's more, it would harm Britain's international reputation before the UN conference, they said.\nOne of the world's leading climate scientists, the American James Hansen, warned Boris Johnson risked humiliation over the mine. \nThe US climate envoy John Kerry warned against it on Monday. And yesterday Alok Sharma was again rebuked by MPs over the plan.\nIt was too much pressure. \nProf Rebecca Willis and Prof Mike Berners-Lee from Lancaster University say the mine would produce 8.4m tonnes of CO2 per year, equivalent to the emissions from more than a million households.\nSupporters of the mine say that by producing coal to be used in Europe, the mine will reduce emissions from shipping coal from Australia or the USA.\nBut the mine proposal comes at a time when the government wants every sector of the UK economy to reduce CO2 emissions - not find new sources of carbon.  \nLabour's shadow environment secretary Ed Miliband said the government should \"block\" the mine and \"provide alternative jobs in the green industries of the future\".\n\"We owe people a long-term secure employment situation, the mine isn't the answer,\" he told reporters. \nHe added that whilst there was a \"current need\" for coking coal in steelmaking, \"all experts say over time the industry's going to need to move towards hydrogen as the answer\".\nLib Dem Tim Farron, MP for nearby Westmoreland and Lonsdale, said: \"In the year that Britain hosts COP26, it is blindingly obviously that we won't be taken seriously on the world stage with this coal mine hanging round our neck.\"\nHe added: \"I hope this public inquiry leads to these plans finally being axed, and the government instead looks at bringing well-paid, long-term, green jobs to Cumbria.\""

      "text": "Police investigating the disappearance of Sarah Everard are searching a home and woodland in Kent following the arrest of a serving Met officer.\nThe 33-year-old was last seen in Clapham, south London, on 3 March.\nThe policeman and a woman were arrested at a house in Kent on Tuesday. Searches are being carried out at a building in Deal as well as on land near Ashford.\nThe Met said it was \"shocking and deeply disturbing\" that the arrested man was a serving officer.\nMs Everard's family have been kept updated, the force added.\nA tent has been erected outside a house in Deal and a car was earlier seen being taken away from the property.\nOfficers have also been carrying out searches on land near to Great Chart Golf and Leisure in Ashford.\nRetired farmer Derek Batt, 72, of nearby Fridd Farm, said officers visited his property late on Tuesday.\nHe said: \"They said they were investigating a missing person. I said 'is it Sarah that I have seen on TV?' and she (the officer) said 'yes'.\"\nMr Batt said he had not seen any suspicious activity in the area.\nIn a statement, the Met Police said the man and the woman had both been taken into custody at a London police station. \nAssistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said the arrests were \"a serious and significant development\". \n\"We will continue to work with all speed on this investigation but the fact that the arrested man is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing.\"\nDuring a later statement, he added the officer \"was not on duty at the time\" when Ms Everard went missing and would only confirm he had been arrested \"in connection\" with her disappearance.\nHe also would not say if the officer was known to the 33-year-old.\nWhen asked by reporters if police believed she was still alive, Mr Ephgrave replied: \"We are searching as hard as we can to find Sarah, so we really hope that is the case.\n\"As a father myself of four young women I can only imagine the anguish that Sarah's family are feeling at this very very difficult time.\"\nThe arrested woman has been held on suspicion of assisting an offender, the force has confirmed.\nOn Tuesday, officers searching for Ms Everard had put up a cordon outside a block of flats in Clapham near to where she was last seen on Poynders Road and sniffer dogs have been used to search the nearby Oaklands Estate and gardens. \nOfficers were also seen searching drains along the street where Ms Everard was last seen.\nThe Met said officers had visited 750 homes in the area as part of the investigation and the force had received more than 120 phone calls from the public.\nFriends and relatives have issued appeals on social media to help find the marketing manager, who vanished on her walk home to Brixton after leaving a friend's flat in Leathwaite Road in Battersea at about 21:00 GMT.\nHer family has said it is out of character for her to disappear.\nMs Everard, who is originally from York and attended Durham University, was last seen wearing a green rain jacket, navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern, and turquoise and orange trainers. She is thought to have been wearing green earphones and a white beanie hat.\nShe is believed to have walked through Clapham Common towards her home - a journey that should have taken her about 50 minutes.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were \"with Sarah and her friends and family\".\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel."

      "tags": "Companies,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Waitrose,Retailing,Shopping,John Lewis",
      "text": "Retail giant John Lewis has warned of further \"painful\" store closures after the pandemic saw it report its first ever annual loss.\nThe group swung to a loss of \u00a3517m for the year to January, against profits of \u00a3146m the previous year.\nThe retailer said it \"does not expect\" all of its department stores to reopen once lockdown restrictions ease.\nIt has previously been reported the chain was considering closing up to eight more stores to try to cut costs.\nAny further closures would be in addition to eight already announced in 2020.\nThe firm, which has 42 John Lewis shops, said talks with landlords are ongoing and it will make a final decision about the \"small number\" of shops to close at the end of March. \nThe rise in internet shopping, accelerated by various lockdown measures during the pandemic, has forced John Lewis to rethink how many stores it needs.\nIt said that before last March, every \u00a36 in \u00a310 spent on its websites was driven by its shops. That figure is now just \u00a33 in \u00a310.\nChairman Sharon White told the BBC that the decision to close stores was \"painful\" but necessary due to a \"decade of changes in shopping habits in one year\".\n\"There is no getting away from the fact that some areas can no longer profitably sustain a John Lewis store,\" she added.\n\"Regrettably, we do not expect to reopen all our John Lewis shops at the end of lockdown, which will also have implications for our supply chain.\"\nShe said John Lewis would do everything it could \"to lessen the impact\", but she added: \"We want to ensure our stores reflect how customers want to shop - 'right space, right place'.\" \nSharon White landed in the driving seat just weeks before the pandemic and swiftly had to make some tough decisions - closing stores, slashing jobs and cutting costs. She also had to tell partners that for the first time in more than 50 years they wouldn't receive their much cherished annual bonus. \nThese past 12 months have clearly focused minds on how many big department stores it needs.  \nDespite lockdown restrictions, John Lewis sales were flat last year. In other words, it managed to transfer all those lost sales from the High Street to online. Its website business was already strong and it predicts 70% of sales will be online from 2025.  \nBut another raft of store closures is a real blow for the towns they're based in. Some will think it's going too far - that there could be an opportunity for it to add sales, given that so many of its rivals have either beaten a retreat or disappeared altogether. \nJohn Lewis went on a big expansion spree back in 2007, almost doubling the number of stores in its portfolio. As sad as it is, it's now set to rein those numbers in.\nJohn Lewis' hefty annual loss was mainly due to the write-down in the value of its stores because of the shift to online shopping, as well as restructuring and redundancy costs.\nThe group announced last July it was closing John Lewis stores in Birmingham, Croydon, Watford, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth, as well as the smaller hubs at St Pancras station and Heathrow, with the loss of 1,300 jobs.\nIn September, John Lewis also announced it was scrapping its staff bonus for the first time since 1953.\nThe partnership, which also runs Waitrose supermarkets, is now targeting savings of \u00a3300m a year by 2022.\nDavid Cartmell took great pride in working at the John Lewis store in Birmingham until it closed last year and he was made redundant.\nHe says the news of further store closures on Thursday came as \"little surprise\".\n\"I always knew the original eight store closures, including my branch were just the tip of the iceberg,\" the former stock manager says.\nOne of the groups' big problems, David says, is its past expansion strategy: \"We were trying to make the chain as common as Debenhams.\"\nAs overheads including bills, rents, salaries and bonuses mounted, he says the group became a \"victim\" of its own previous marker of success.\n\"We were trying to use an old business model to keep up our biggest competitors such as Amazon in a digital age.\"\nNow, he feels \"absolutely sorry\" for the workers waiting to hear the fate of their own stores.\nIn addition to closing some John Lewis stores, the group is trialling running dedicated John Lewis shopping areas in some Waitrose supermarkets.\nWaitrose benefitted from a jump in demand for online deliveries as people sought to minimise trips to the supermarket. John Lewis said the Waitrose website was taking about 240,000 orders a week, and now \"stands as a \u00a31bn sales business\".\nThe increased demand for groceries, however, did not offset the problems at the group's department stores.\nAs a result, John Lewis confirmed that it would not return the business rates relief it has received from government during the Covid crisis. \nIt said it had claimed \u00a3190m in combined rates relief and support under the furlough scheme, and that it would claim business rates relief between April and June. \nIt said the holiday from the tax levied on non-domestic properties had helped it avoid \"a more severe restructuring of the partnership, which would have put more jobs at risk at a time when the High Street is already under pressure\". \n\"We are not out of the crisis yet and the economic environment remains extremely uncertain,\" it added.\nGrocers such as Morrisons, Tesco and Asda said in December that they would return more than \u00a31.7bn in rates relief. This came after supermarkets, whose sales have boomed in the crisis, were criticised for taking government help while paying dividends to shareholders."

      "text": "The Covid surge in January hit key services including cancer and routine surgery, NHS England figures show.\nLess than half the expected number of operations were done, pushing the waiting list to a record-high of 4.6m.\nMore than 300,000 of those have been waiting more than a year for treatment - compared to 1,600 before the pandemic began.\nSurgeons described it as a dire situation which would take a long time to turnaround.\nTim Mitchell, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: \"Behind today's statistics are people waiting in limbo. \n\"Many will be in considerable pain, others will have restricted mobility and be at risk of isolation and loneliness.  \n\"Dealing with this daunting backlog will take time, and also sustained investment in the NHS,\" he said.\nSimilar problems are also being seen in Scotland where 39,000 people have been waiting over a year for treatment.\nThe NHS Confederation has warned the true picture could be much worse with nearly 6 million fewer referrals made by GPs in England for routine treatments, which includes operations such as knee and hip replacements, last year, suggested there was an additional hidden backlog.\nThe organisation, which represents hospitals, said it was likely people have not sought help or found it difficult to access services during the pandemic.\nThe numbers starting treatment for cancer and being referred for urgent check-ups returned to pre-pandemic levels in the autumn.\nBut the data for January showed a dip in numbers for the first time since the first wave - just under 23,000 people started treatment, compared to nearly 27,500 in January 2020.\nMichelle Mitchell, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said: \"While it's positive that urgent referrals did not plummet as they did in the first wave, these January figures show that the pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on cancer patients.\" \nNHS England said given the scale of Covid admissions seen in January, some disruption had been unavoidable.\nMedical director Prof Stephen Powis said: \"Admitting more than 100,000 Covid patients to hospital in a single month inevitably had a knock-on effect on some non-urgent care.\n\"However, thanks to the hard work of NHS staff and the innovations in treatment and care developed over the course of the pandemic, hospitals treated more than one million people with other conditions in January, at the peak of the winter wave, nearly twice as many as they did last April.\n\"That is a testament to the skill, dedication and commitment nurses, doctors, therapists and countless other staff showed in the most challenging period in NHS history.\""

      "text": "Boris Johnson has demanded the \"immediate release\" of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran on spying charges, in a phone call with Iran's president.\nThe PM said her \"continued confinement remains completely unacceptable\" and that she must be allowed to return to her family in the UK.\nShe had her ankle tag removed on Sunday at the end of her five-year sentence.\nBut she faces a new court case against her - scheduled for next Sunday.  \nThe charity worker had been under house arrest in Tehran since being moved from jail last March. She has always denied the charges against her.\nA Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister spoke to Iranian president Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday afternoon, and raised the case of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other British-Iranian dual nationals detained in Iran \"and demanded their immediate release\".\nThe spokesman added: \"He said that while the removal of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's ankle monitor was welcome, her continued confinement remains completely unacceptable and she must be allowed to return to her family in the UK.\"\nMr Johnson, while stressing that the UK remains committed to making the Iran nuclear deal a success, also demanded that Iran cease all of its nuclear activity which breaches the deal, the spokesman said.\n\"He stressed the importance of Iran seizing the opportunity presented by the United States' willingness to return to the deal if Iran comes back into compliance,\" he said.\n\"The prime minister underlined the need for Iran to cease wider destabilising activity and be a positive force in the Gulf region.\"\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, had been out of prison since last spring due to the coronavirus pandemic but had been confined to her parents' house. \nShe was arrested in April 2016 while travelling to visit her parents in Iran with her young British-born daughter, Gabriella, who is now six years old.\nThe dual national was sentenced to five years in prison over allegations of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government, which she denies.\nSpeaking after her ankle tag was removed, her husband Richard Ratcliffe said it was \"a mixed day for us\" and \"Nazanin is genuinely happy\" to be free of her electronic bracelet.\n\"I'm a bit more guarded - it feels to me like they have made one blockage just as they have removed another, and we very clearly remain in the middle of this government game of chess,\" he said.\nAs of Sunday, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had not had her British passport returned to her, according to Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP for the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency in London where her family live.\nMs Siddiq told the BBC: \"She does have to go back to court and we don't know what awaits her there.\n\"Nazanin is quite worried because there was talk of another case being put against her which may of course mean another sentence, and we don't know how long for.\"\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sentence has included eight months of solitary confinement, blindfolded interrogations and hunger strikes to press for medical treatment.\nPrior to her arrest, she lived in London with her husband and child.\nIn November, she was taken to court on fresh charges of spreading propaganda against the Iranian regime.\nHer family and the UK government have always maintained her innocence and she has been given diplomatic protection by the Foreign Office - meaning the case is treated as a formal, legal dispute between Britain and Iran.\nMr Ratcliffe believes his wife and other dual nationals are being held hostage because Iran wants the UK to pay a decades-old debt over an arms deal that was never fulfilled."

      "text": "The executive director of an industry body for the UK press has resigned after a row over its reaction to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's comments about racism in the media.\nIan Murray said he would step down from his role at the Society of Editors so it could \"rebuild its reputation\".\nPrince Harry said some British tabloids were \"racist\" and \"bigoted\".\nThe Society of Editors initially denied that and said such an \"attack\" was \"not acceptable\" without providing evidence.\nAnnouncing his resignation on Wednesday, Mr Murray said: \"Since the statement was issued the SoE has been heavily criticised.\n\"While I do not agree that the society's statement was in any way intended to defend racism, I accept it could have been much clearer in its condemnation of bigotry and has clearly caused upset.\n\"As executive director I lead the society and as such must take the blame and so I have decided it is best for the board and membership that I step aside so that the organisation can start to rebuild its reputation.\"\nHe added that the original statement was \"not intended to gloss over the fact the media industry in the UK does have work to do on inclusivity and diversity\".\nIt comes after ITV presenter Charlene White pulled out as host of an awards ceremony staged by the Society of Editors - the British Press Awards - saying the organisation should find \"someone whose views align with yours\" to replace her.\nIn the duke and duchess' recent interview with Oprah Winfrey, Prince Harry was asked if the couple left the UK because of racism.\nHe said that was a \"large part\" of why he and his wife had left the UK.\nThe duke recalled a conversation he had had at a charity fundraiser in which he was told that the UK is \"very bigoted\", and he said he replied: \"The UK is not bigoted, the UK press is bigoted, specifically the tabloids.\"\nHe added: \"But unfortunately if the source of information is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society.\"\nThe Society of Editors, which represents almost 400 members of the media, put out a robust defence in response.\n\"The UK media is not bigoted and will not be swayed from its vital role holding the rich and powerful to account following the attack on the press by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex,\" it said.\nAfter criticism, however, it put out a further statement on Wednesday to say its initial comments \"did not reflect what we all know: that there is a lot of work to be done in the media to improve diversity and inclusion\".\nThe editors of the Guardian and HuffPost UK had both said they did not agree with the society's position.\nAlison Gow, president of the Society of Editors, said: \"I would like to thank Ian for his tireless work on behalf of the society; he has led campaigns for journalists' rights and freedoms and worked hard behind the scenes when it appeared legislation might threaten those.\n\"The society is committed to representing all journalists and upholding journalism;  I am clear on what our mission must be, and we will strive as an organisation to listen and hear everyone's views, and be strong advocates and allies for all those we represent.\" "

      "text": "A serving Met police officer has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the disappearance of Sarah Everard.\nMs Everard, 33, was last seen a week ago in Clapham, south London, on her way home from a friend's house.\nThe suspect, in his 40s, is an officer with the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, the Met said.\nA woman, in her 30s, is also in custody after being arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.\nThe Met said Ms Everard had not yet been found.\nHer cousin, Tom Everard, said the family want to \"focus on the facts as they emerge\".\n\"I want to encourage people to come forward with anything they might have, and to continue supporting the police investigation,\" the 36-year-old added.\n\"We have to believe Sarah will still be found and brought back safely.\"\nOfficers are currently searching locations in London and Kent including a property in Deal and an area of woodland near Ashford.\nThe arrested officer, who was initially held on suspicion of kidnap, is also being questioned about a separate allegation of indecent exposure.\nHe was responsible for uniformed patrolling of diplomatic premises - including Downing Street, the Palace of Westminster, as well as foreign embassies in London.\nHe was off duty at the time of his arrest. \nSince last Wednesday, officers have visited more than 750 homes in the Clapham area and have received more than 120 phone calls from the public, the Met said.\nMarketing executive Ms Everard vanished on 3 March and was last captured on a doorbell camera walking alone along the A205 Poynders Road towards Tulse Hill at about 21:30 GMT.\nMs Everard's family previously said it was out of character for her to disappear.\nShe is thought to have walked through Clapham Common towards her house in Brixton - a journey which should have taken about 50 minutes.\nSpeaking after the arrest on Tuesday, Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said: \"The fact that the man who has been arrested is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing.\"\nMs Everard, who is originally from York and attended Durham University, was last seen wearing a green rain jacket, navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern, and turquoise and orange trainers. She is thought to have been wearing green earphones and a white beanie hat.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were with Ms Everard and her friends and family.\nAfter the arrest the Met referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).\nThe IOPC said a mandatory referral was made in relation to the Met's actions after Ms Everard was reported missing.\nBBC London's Home Affairs correspondent Katharine Carpenter\nThis morning Mr Ephgrave described the arrest of a serving Met Police officer as both shocking and disturbing.\nThat officer has now been further arrested on suspicion of murder. \nIt's unusual for such a senior officer to give a statement at this stage of an investigation and perhaps reflects the horror felt within the force - a profession where colleagues often describe themselves as family. \nWe have now learnt the arrested officer is in his 40s and works in the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command where his primary role was to patrol diplomatic premises. \nUnderstandably, Sarah's disappearance has made some people in and around Clapham nervous for their own safety.\nSocial media users have said the arrest of a police officer has heightened anxiety.\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: \"All women and girls should be able to feel safe on the streets of London at all times.\n\"I know how shocked and worried Londoners are by Sarah's disappearance and the developments in the case.\"\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel."

      "title": "Covid: Four more cases of Brazil variant found in England",
      "tags": "Bradford,Brazil,South Gloucestershire Council,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Four further cases of the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil have been identified in England, bringing the total in the UK to 10.\nThree cases of the P.1 variant are in South Gloucestershire and are said to be close or household contacts of the two existing cases in the area.\nThe other new case was identified in Bradford.\nScientists previously said the variant appears more contagious and there were concerns over its response to vaccines.\nBut Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said last week it was hoped that vaccines would have a strong impact on reducing hospitalisations and deaths in cases of the new variant.\nThe new Bradford case tested positive for Covid-19 in late February after travelling back from Brazil via Paris on 14 February. \nSubsequent genomic sequencing identified the case as the P.1 variant, Public Health England said in a statement. \nThousands of positive Covid cases, from all across the UK, are sent for this further sequencing every week as scientists aim to identify any variants of the virus. \nThe new South Gloucestershire cases were uncovered when people were offered testing in response to the initial cases found in the area last month - and those who tested positive had their results sent on for further analysis.\nSpecialist contact tracing teams are working to identify any further contacts and additional testing has been in place since the initial cases were identified.\nContact-tracers have advised close contacts of the individual in Bradford to isolate and get a test.\nThere are now seven cases of the P.1 variant in England and three in Scotland, all of which have links to travel or to a previously confirmed case that has travelled to Brazil.\nIt was always known more cases of the P.1 Brazil variant were coming.\nWhen it was confirmed 11 days ago the variant was here, it was known two household members of the original South Gloucestershire cases had tested positive for Covid.\nThe results of the genomic sequencing to check which variant they had was not yet complete, but the expectation was it would be P.1.\nWhere does this leave us? A quarter of all Covid cases are being checked for variants and all the indications are that they are not spreading.\nThe new P.1 cases brings the total to 10, while there have been just over 300 cases of the South African variant and another 113 cases where the UK virus has acquired the E484 mutation which allows it to escape some of the immune response.\nThere will be more variants out there that have not been detected, but given that overall week-on-week Covid infection levels are lower we can be confident the variant is not taking hold.\nMonitoring this though is crucial to help the UK decide if vaccines updates are needed ahead of next winter.\nSeparately, Public Health England said a new variant identified in the UK was designated a \"variant under investigation\" on 4 March. It is not known where this variant first emerged.*\nIt said the variant - known as VUI-202103/01 - contains the spike mutations E484K and N501Y, both usually associated with so-called \"variants of concern\". \nBut it added that \"it does not feature specific deletions that would lead to a designation as a [variant of concern]\".\nNo additional cases have yet been found.\nIn other developments, rough sleepers and other homeless people in England will be prioritised to receive a coronavirus vaccine, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. \nIt comes after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said people who are homeless or sleeping rough were likely to have underlying health conditions and should be offered jabs alongside those in priority group six - people aged 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality.\nThey should also be offered the vaccine without the need for an NHS number or GP registration, the JCVI added.\nMeanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases in the UK has risen compared with recent days, after a further 6,753 cases were reported, according to the latest data.\nAnother 181 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have also been recorded.\nAs of 10 March, some 23,053,716 people had received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 1,351,515 had received a second dose.\nNews that the Brazil variant had been found in the UK was released in February. Three cases were initially found in England, and separately three in Scotland.\nThe three cases in Scotland were all oil workers who were returning to their families from Brazil, via Paris and London. \nIn England, two of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire who tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February.\nThe third case in England - now confirmed to be in Croydon - prompted intensive tracing efforts in the region as the identity of the person was initially unknown as he or she failed to register their test properly. \nBut that person was found at the end of last week and it was confirmed that he or she had  \"stayed at home\" and there was no sign of any onward transmission.\nUnder current Covid restrictions, holiday travel is not allowed in the UK or abroad. Anyone travelling abroad has to fill in a \"Declaration to Travel\" form, stating a valid reason for leaving the country, such as education or work, and journeys within England are only allowed for limited reasons.\nThere are also travel bans on 33 countries \"where the risk of a new variant is greatest\", including Brazil and other South American nations. \nHowever, the ban on travellers from South America came into effect on 15 February, after one case of the Brazilian variant had already been detected in the UK. The latest Bradford case is also a person known to have travelled from Brazil via Paris just before that change came in.\n*This story has now been updated to reflect new information on UK variants on the Public Health England website. PHE previously reported two cases of the VUI-202103/01 variant had been found in the south-east of England in individuals who had recently been in Antigua. PHE now says: \"Despite the travel history of these cases there is no scientific evidence to determine where this variant first emerged.\""

      "text": "Pupils in pre-schools, nurseries and primary one to primary three in NI who were due to revert to remote learning from 22 March will be allowed to remain in class, the executive has agreed.\nMinisters backed a proposal from Education Minister Peter Weir to scrap the original plan.\nThat date will see post-primary pupils in years 12 to 14 return to classrooms.\nHowever no decision has been taken yet on when all other pupils should to return to school.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said the full return of pupils to schools would be discussed at the executive's first formal review of the regulations on Tuesday 16 March.\n\"I would have liked to have moved further in relation to other cohorts but the Covid taskforce is looking at this in a strategic way and we'll make announcements next week,\" she told a news conference.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir had proposed that students in primaries four to seven should return on 22 March, with all other post-primary students returning after the Easter break on 12 April, subject to health advice.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir said he had wanted to move further but recognised he would not have had consensus from all other executive parties.\n\"I ideally want to bring all ministers with me on this issue,\" he told the BBC's Evening Extra programme.\n\"I will not rest until we reach a point that we have all pupils back in school... but how quickly we do that remains to be seen.\"\nHe also said officials were continuing work on how testing might be rolled out across schools in Northern Ireland.\nSome testing kits will arrive with the Education Authority on Friday and there will be a programme to roll that out for older pupils, primarily in years 12 to 14 in post-primaries, he added.\nDeputy First Minister Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised schools, students and parents needed \"notice\" about the return to school and that she hoped the executive could provide dates on Tuesday.\n\"We have made progress today and we did say this would be a staged and phased approach,\" she added.\nBoth ministers said their priority was ensuring the return of all pupils to schools as quickly as possible.\nIt is understood the executive was advised by health officials that the decision to \"prioritise and accelerate face-to-face learning must be supported by the retention of other existing restrictions at least until after the Easter holidays\".\nOn Thursday nine more Covid-19-related deaths and another 223 cases of the virus were recorded in Northern Ireland.\nThere were 10 deaths recorded in the Republic of Ireland, with 592 confirmed new cases of the virus.\nMs O'Neill said the more transmissible Kent variant of coronavirus is now thought to account for about 80% of all cases in Northern Ireland.\n\"Where people are having more contact the epidemic will grow faster than it has done previously, and this is something we all need to be cognisant of as we gradually ease out of restrictions,\" she added.\nThe transmission rate of the virus - or R-number - for the community in Northern Ireland is \"consistently below one\", said the first minister.\nShe said she hoped that the drop in figures meant that the executive would be able to make more announcements next week about easing other restrictions.\nMs O'Neill said there would be \"no major shifts\" before Easter but that the executive wanted to allow people time to plan for the coming weeks and months.\nMrs Foster also said she recognised that people were facing into a second year with many being unable to spend Mother's Day with their loved ones.\n\"Many of us will be relying on cards and phone calls to carry out our love and appreciation,\" she said.\nShe also urged anyone wanting to celebrate Mother's Day or St Patrick's Day to do so with their own household.\nMs O'Neill said Northern Ireland was \"on the cusp of brighter days\" but warned that going to parties or gathering in groups posed a \"serious risk to a fragile situation\".\nMeanwhile, Stormont ministers have also agreed additional funding to support businesses and jobs during the pandemic.\nFinance Minister Conor Murphy had proposed extending rates relief for another 12 months for almost 30,000 businesses, in a package worth \u00a3230m.\nHis plan means that for the second year running businesses in the following sectors will not pay any rates:\nThe executive also announced a Covid-19 support scheme for travel agents experiencing difficulties as a result of the pandemic, worth \u00a31.175m.\nIt includes a flat payment of \u00a310,000 to travel agency businesses operating from commercial premises or a \u00a33,500 payment to self-employed travel agents working from home.\nThe scheme will open next Friday for a limited time until 26 March."

      "text": "Parents are emailing teachers to lobby for higher GCSE and A-level grades, warn head teachers - with teachers' grades replacing exams this summer.\nRichard Sheriff, president of the ASCL heads' union, warned of parents with \"pointy elbows and lawyer friends\".\nHe suggested it was particularly schools in affluent areas where parents would try to sway teachers.\nMr Sheriff said it \"really worries me\" that this pressure could widen the social divide in exam results.\nGeoff Barton, the heads' union's general secretary, gave an example of a teacher who had been emailed by parents over the high grades needed for their daughter's ambition to become a doctor.\n\"We have to protect individual teachers,\" said Mr Barton.\nThis summer's GCSE and A-level exams have been cancelled in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and instead teachers will submit grades for pupils, based on evidence such as coursework, essays and assessments set by exam boards.\nMr Barton said that \"raises the spectre\" of parents trying to intervene on behalf of their children.\nHe urged schools to remind parents that exam boards would issue results - and not teachers - and that the boards would carry out spot checks on how grades were being decided.\nHe criticised the idea that the pupils' grades would be a \"negotiation\".\nThis should not be about parents who \"shout the loudest to get their child the furthest\", said Mr Sheriff, an executive head teacher in Harrogate, North Yorkshire.\nSimon Lebus, acting chief exam regulator, this week warned the Education Select Committee that parents could make teachers feel \"uncomfortable\" with an \"intrusive interest\" over exam grades.\nThere have also been concerns about grade inflation, if teachers are too generous in their grade estimations.\nSpeaking ahead of ASCL's annual conference, being held online, the head teachers' leaders also raised concerns about the risks of Covid being spread by young people meeting and mixing outside of school.\nMr Sheriff said schools \"only have control over a small part of the day\" - and that outside school, young people seem to \"have taken licence\" to start socialising.\n\"Young people, particularly teenagers, are gathering, they're meeting in each other's homes,\" said the North Yorkshire head.\nThere were warnings too about confusions over the rules of Covid testing - but head teachers said so far there seemed to be low numbers of positive cases being reported from the mass testing running in secondary schools this week.\nBut there had been isolated cases of pupils being sent home - including a third of one year group who had been in contact with a pupil who had tested positive.\nThis week millions of pupils have returned to school in England, and some younger children in Northern Ireland, and the heads reported \"very high levels of attendance\".

      "title": "Hong Kong: China approves 'patriotic' plan to control elections",
      "tags": "China,Hong Kong national security law,Hong Kong",
      "text": "China's legislature has approved a resolution to overhaul Hong Kong's electoral system - its latest move to tighten control over the city.\nThe \"patriots governing Hong Kong\" resolution was passed at the National People's Congress (NPC) on Thursday. \nIt will reduce democratic representation and allow a pro-Beijing panel to vet and elect candidates.\nThe former British colony was handed back to China in 1997 under a model called \"one country, two systems\".\nUnder the deal, which gave the territory freedoms not available in mainland China, Hong Kong also had its own mini-constitution and an elected parliament.\nThe latest Chinese move follows a series of measures that have tightened Beijing's grip on Hong Kong, including the passing of a national security law and a crackdown on activists and opposition politicians.\nDetailed legislation will now be drafted and could be enacted in Hong Kong within the next few months.\nThe UK says it will \"hollow out the space for democratic debate\" in Hong Kong.\nOther critics say they will effectively wipe out any remaining opposition.\nAlmost 24 years after China took back control of Hong Kong from Britain, this was the moment it remade the free-wheeling, sometimes unruly territory's political system in its own image. The symbolism couldn't have been starker. Seated in the Great Hall of the People, 2,895 delegates voted in favour of the changes, none against. Whether the one abstention was a miscue on the electronic voting buttons, or a lone act of defiance, we'll never know. \nThere have been other milestones in recent years at which observers have pronounced the death of Hong Kong. The national security law, for example, has all but wiped out the ability to express dissent on the streets. \nOnce again, China is arguing that this reform - with its political loyalty test for candidates - is necessary to ensure stability. But critics will argue it abolishes another fundamental underpinning of the city's special freedoms - the ability to channel dissent through the political process itself.\nThe pro-democracy protests, although sometimes violent, were accompanied by mass popular support with as many as two million taking peacefully to the streets. In late 2019, the democrats won a landslide in Hong Kong's local elections, the city's only truly democratic ballot. That may have spooked Beijing more than barricades and petrol bombs. But is its victory now complete? \"It is very sad,\" the former Democratic Party chairperson Emily Lau told me. \"But I insist this doesn't mean the game is over for Hong Kong because the fight will go on.\"\nHong Kong's parliament - or Legislative Council (LegCo) - helps to make Hong Kong's laws.\nIt is made up of 70 seats - but only about half are directly voted for by the public. In recent years, some of the seats have been filled by pro-democracy figures.\nThe other half has mostly been filled by smaller groups representing special interests such as business, banking and trade, sectors which are historically pro-Beijing.\nThe proposed new law will give Hong Kong's heavily pro-Beijing electoral vetting committee the power to vet all LegCo candidates and elect many of its members.\nHong Kong's leader Carrie Lam says she and Hong Kong's government \"firmly support\" the move.\n\"What they're really referring to [when they say 'patriot'] is that they will pick the people that they like, someone who is one of them,\" one resident told BBC Chinese.\n\"Basically, it's a step backwards, becoming more and more like the mainland,\" he said.\nBut another resident, identified as Ms Ho, said she supported the law.\n\"Hong Kong has already returned [to China]. So under this situation, the Chinese government's law should be the framework for our [patriot law],\" she said. \nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the dilution of elections in Hong Kong would further undermine trust in China.\nHowever, the Chinese embassy in London's charg\u00e9 d'affaires Yang Xiaoguang told the BBC that the UK and China had a \"different definition\" of democracy.\nAsked about possible UK sanctions against Chinese individuals over Hong Kong and other issues, Mr Yang said China would \"safeguard our interests at any cost\".\nEarlier, the US condemned China's \"continuing assault on democratic institutions in Hong Kong\".\nHong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called \"one country, two systems\" principle.\nThis is supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has.\nBut fears that this model was being eroded led to huge pro-democracy protests in 2019.\nSome protests turned violent and last year, the NPC passed a controversial national security law, which effectively reduces Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators.\nBeijing said the law would target \"sedition\" and bring stability.\nSince the law has been enacted in June, around 100 people have been arrested, including China critic and media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who was denied bail and is in detention awaiting trial."

      "text": "A restaurant chain which asked furloughed staff to loan it 10% of their wages, amid claims of potential sackings, has paid the money back. \nTomahawk Steakhouse asked 500 workers to lend some of their pay to cover pension and national insurance contributions. All the workers agreed.\nThe firm denied the claim staff might lose their jobs, but said all staff had got their money back plus 20% extra.\nThe GMB union said the return of the cash was a \"massive win\" for workers. \nIn a letter to staff seen by the BBC, Tomahawk, which has restaurants in York, Middlesbrough, Beverley, Newcastle, Durham and Hoxton, east London, said it had a \"short-term cash flow issue and it requires your help and support\".\nAt the time of the company's request the GMB claimed staff who refused were told their \"suitability for the role will have to be reviewed\".\nStaff agreed to the request. Tomahawk says that money has now been returned with the 20% addition.\nA spokeswoman for Tomahawk said: \"As part of the voluntary agreement signed by all of our staff, we promised that any monies loaned would be returned as soon as we were financially able. \n\"Following the budget announcement last week, we are delighted to have been able to swiftly honour that promise this week. \n\"All staff have now received the loaned amount, along with an additional 20%, as a thank you for supporting the business at this critical time.\"\nGMB regional secretary Neil Derrick said: \"This was always an outrageous exploitation of both the furlough scheme and low paid, young workers. \n\"The cash should never have been taken in the first place as no employee can afford a further reduction in their take home pay - especially when it's to cover their employer's own obligations.  \n\"Tomahawk's bullying behaviour was rightly condemned across the board.

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,London Heathrow Airport,Air travel",
      "text": "Heathrow Airport regularly sees queues of three hours and sometimes six hours at border control, according to Emma Gilthorpe, its chief operating officer. \nEarlier this month, passengers complained of waiting up to seven hours, which one said was \"inhumane\".\nBut Border Force said many passengers were arriving without having bought mandatory Covid testing packages.\nThe enforcement body added that people should only be travelling for limited reasons.\nSeparately, hundreds of Heathrow passport control are set to take industrial action.\nUnions representing Border Force officials said the delays were partly caused by Covid restrictions requiring immigration officials to work in a bubble of 10.\nThey said this prevented more staff being deployed if the border was particularly busy.\nBut Nick Jariwalla, director of Border Force at Heathrow, said: \"We are in a global health pandemic - it is illegal to go on holiday and people should only be travelling for very limited reasons. \n\"Unfortunately, a large number of passengers are continuing to arrive without having purchased their mandatory testing packages for the second and eighth days of quarantine in the UK. \n\"This causes delays as passengers may receive a fine or be subject to other enforcement action.\"\nMr Jariwalla said all arriving passengers had to purchase the testing package before leaving the airport. \n\"We make absolutely no apologies for this,\" he added. \"Every essential check stops the spread of coronavirus in the UK.\n\"These people should not have been allowed to travel without their testing packages and we are following up with regulators and carriers to ensure the law is enforced.\"\nSpeaking to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Ms Gilthorpe said that pre-Covid, the queues for EU arrivals were supposed to be 25 minutes, and 45 minutes for non-EU arrivals. \nWhile she said she expected the length of waiting to go up during the pandemic, Ms Gilthorpe said the levels the airport was currently seeing were \"unacceptable\". \nWhile Ms Gilthorpe said the measures in place for quarantine hotels were running relatively smoothly, with a small number of passengers, she said the same could not be said for the border. \n\"We are seeing significant pressure on the border and we are seeing very long queues, and that is a worry,\" she said. \nAlthough Ms Gilthorpe said she knew additional resources had been introduced, the issues were caused by \"the level of complexity of the processes and the way resource is being deployed\". \nInternational arrivals must now provide proof of a negative Covid test taken 72 hours before departure to England and a passenger locator form which contains details of either a purchased hotel quarantine stay, or two test kits for at home quarantine. \nShe told the committee: \"It is deeply frustrating as the operator of the airport when you have a queue full of people and you only have two desks open.\n\"It is rare to see all the desks manned and we have to find our way to how we make that happen so we can get that flow.\"\nHeathrow's self-service e-gates at passport control are currently closed. \nAirport rivals\nMs Gilthorpe said she hoped that by the summer, the gates would also be able to scan passenger locator forms and pre-departure testing results, but that had not yet been integrated into the system.\nThe Heathrow executive also warned that if the long queues continued after international travel is permitted. it could risk the country's economic resurgence. \n\"Heathrow is Britain's hub airport, it is the front door. We have to get our economy moving and we have to make sure we are capable of receiving people,\" she said.\n\"If you have a poor experience at the border, there's a risk you won't come back again. That traffic will go to Charles De Gaulle [airport in Paris], it will go to Frankfurt and we will miss out on that economic resurgence,\" she said.\nThe queue delays come as staff in the PCS union served notice of industrial action over rosters they describe as \"unworkable\".\nThis will involve a month of action short of a strike by hundreds of staff, including working to rule and an overtime ban.\nThe roster changes include ending the ability of staff to swap and request certain shifts, the union said.\nIn February, staff voted for strike action over the changes, the union said."

      "tags": "Companies,Online shopping,Retailing,Shopping,Marks & Spencer",
      "text": "M&S will start selling clothes from 11 rival brands on its website this spring in a bid to boost its online sales.\nMarks said the move to sell items from Hobbs, Joules, Phase Eight and White Stuff from March was part of its ongoing \"transformation programme\".\nAn M&S spokesman said the move came as part of plans to \"turbocharge online growth\".\nLast year, M&S posted its first loss in its 94 years as a publicly-listed company as Covid hit shop sales.\nOnline clothing and homeware sales were up 34% according to its latest interim results, as losses across the business reached \u00a387.6m in the six months to 26 September.\nThe High Street stalwart is in the middle of a wide-reaching transformation programme, which last year saw 7,000 job cuts across stores and management.\nOther brands set to be marketed on the M&S website online from spring include the menswear brand Jack & Jones and lingerie firm Sloggi.\nThey will appear alongside other M&S items, while its own 'Classics' and 'Limited' ranges are being cut.\nThe firm had already been experimenting with selling other brands on its website, such as womenswear retailer Nobody's Child, which was the first to launch last autumn.\nExecutives hope new labels will draw in customers that might not typically shop with M&S, as well as offering existing customers something new.\nNeil Harrison, director of brands at M&S, said: \"The exciting mix will offer our 22 million customers products we already know they love and introduce them to some new brands.\"\nThis is a big shake-up for M&S fashion. \nNew tie-ups have been coming thick and fast these last few months giving customers more choice. Up until last year, M&S only stocked clothing from its own collections. \nNow it's branching out with other brands to complement its own offer - and it's a sensible move. So too is pruning its own, sometimes confusing, fashion ranges. \nThis pandemic has wreaked havoc for retail but it's also creating opportunities. \nTake Next, a business which already had lots of third-party brands on its website pre-pandemic. On Wednesday, it took a stake in Reiss, which will allow the chain to use Next's online infrastructure. \nBoohoo and Asos have also been snapping up High Street brands, like Karen Millen and Topshop, as they try to attract a broader range of shoppers. \nThere's been quite a battle for brands this last year and M&S clearly thinks that it's now taking a big, strategic, step in the right direction. \nAlthough M&S said that there could also be \"future opportunities\" in UK stores for some brands, its key focus in recent months has been on overhauling its website amid rising competition from fast fashion firms such as Asos and Boohoo.\nThe retailer recently announced that it will launch 46 new websites in overseas markets from Iceland to Uzbekistan in order to grow its online business.\nIn January it also confirmed that it had bought the Jaeger fashion brand, but not its scores of shops and concessions.\nSteve Rowe, chief executive of M&S, has previously said his goal is to deliver long-term transformation and build a brand that is more digital \"in a world that will never be the same again\"."

But he remains in hospital in a stable condition. \nEmergency crews were called to Baglan Street at about midday to reports of a stabbing, and a cordon was erected around the Blue Sky takeaway.\nOfficers later confirmed a 16-year-old girl had died and her family paid tribute to \"a very gentle soul\".\nScores of floral tributes were left at the takeaway restaurant as the community mourned her death."

      "tags": "Austria,Denmark,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "There is no indication that the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is linked to an increased risk of blood clots, the EU's medicines regulator says.\nIt said the number of cases in vaccinated people was no higher than in the general population.\nThe statement came after a number of countries, including Denmark and Norway, suspended the use of the jab.\nThe suspension followed reports that a small number of people had developed clots after receiving the vaccine.\nThere were also reports that a 50-year-old man had died in Italy after developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a dose of the jab.\n\"There is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine,\" the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Thursday.\n\"The vaccine's benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing,\" it added.\nIt said there had been 30 cases of \"thromboembolic events\" among the five million Europeans who have received the jab.\nAstraZeneca said the drug's safety had been studied extensively in clinical trials. \"Regulators have clear and stringent efficacy and safety standards for the approval of any new medicine,\" a spokesperson said.\nIn the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there was no evidence the vaccine had caused problems, and people should still go and get vaccinated when asked to do so. \"Blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. More than 11 million doses of the Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine have now been administered across the UK,\" said Phil Bryan of the MHRA.\nThe decision to temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca's jab has come as a setback for a European vaccination campaign that has stuttered into life, partly due to delays in delivery of the drug. \nHowever, there was a positive development on Thursday as the EMA approved the single-shot Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine. \"More safe and effective vaccines are coming to the market,\" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted, although some reports suggest that J&J vaccine shipments may not arrive until April. \nIt comes on the same day a study revealed that the US Novax vaccine is 96% effective in preventing the original strain of covid and 86% effective against the English strain. Novavax is hoping to file for approval in the UK during the second quarter of 2021, AFP news agency reports. \nDenmark, Norway and Iceland have temporarily suspended the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Italy and Austria, meanwhile, have stopped using certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure.\nThe suspensions in Italy and Austria involve different batches of the vaccine.\nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg have also suspended the use of the same batch as Austria. Romania has suspended use of 4,200 doses from the same batch of vaccines as Italy. \nIn an earlier statement, the EMA said Denmark's decision was a \"precautionary measure [taken] while a full investigation is ongoing into reports of blood clots in people who received the vaccine, including one case in Denmark where a person died\".\nItaly's medicines body said its decision was \"precautionary\", adding that no link had been established between the vaccine and subsequent \"serious adverse events\".\nTwo Italians are reported to have died after receiving the vaccine, and an unnamed source told Reuters news agency that their deaths are what prompted the temporary suspension.\nAustria, meanwhile, took its decision after a woman died 10 days after vaccination because of \"severe blood coagulation problems\". The Austrian doses were part of a batch of one million doses, identified as ABV5300, that was sent to 17 European countries.\nThe EMA said its safety committee was reviewing the Austrian case but made clear that there was \"no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions\".\nNo details of the Danish death have been given, but health officials said they were pausing use of the vaccine for 14 days in what Health Minister Magnus Heunicke called a \"precautionary measure\". Although no link had been established, he said \"we must respond in a timely and careful manner\" until a conclusion was reached.\nNorway's public health institute said it would follow the Danish move to halt all use of the vaccine until the Danish cases were investigated. \"We are waiting for more information to see if there is a link between the vaccine and this blood clot case,\" said Geir Bukholm of the National Institute of Health. \nIceland was also suspending use of the vaccine, the chief epidemiologist told public broadcaster Ruv, to \"err on the side of caution\".\nLater on Thursday, France and Germany said they would continue to use the AstraZeneca jab. \"The benefits... are higher than the risks,\" French Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said.\nOfficials say they have received reports of fatal or life-threatening blood clots in a small number of people who had recently received a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. That may sound worrying, but it is not yet known if there is any connection between the two things. \nA full investigation into batch quality is ongoing, but a defect is considered unlikely. \nOverall, 30 cases of thromboembolic events have been reported among the five million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the European Economic Area.\nAny approved treatment, including vaccines, carries a risk of some side effects for some people, but most are usually mild and severe ones are rare. \nIt's also worth noting that blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. They are believed to cause symptoms in around one in every thousand people in the UK every year."

      "text": "Understanding how magic tricks work could help to protect people from manipulation by politicians and marketing, say researchers.\nA study from Goldsmiths, University of London, says the psychology used by magicians to deceive audiences can also be used to influence consumer choices.\nMagic tricks use \"powerful tools\" to control behaviour, say the researchers.\nThe psychologists looked at how tricks create an \"illusion of choice\", when the audience has no real control.\nThe research - Mind control trick: magicians' forcing and free will, by psychologists Alice Pailhes and Gustav Kuhn - examines how magicians control their audiences' decisions - and how this can be applied to other areas.\n\"A lot of these magic principles show that you can very easily manipulate and influence decisions that people make - and even though they feel free to have made that decision, the magician has pretty much full control,\" says Dr Kuhn.\nHe says in the same way that someone might be directed to choose the \"right\" card in a magic trick, so, too, we can be \"nudged\" towards buying products in the supermarket.\nThe study, published in Trends in Cognitive Science, identifies different psychological tools used by magicians.\nAt its most simple it can be recognising that people tend to behave in similar ways - so the researchers say that if people are asked to pick one of four cards laid in front of them, 60% of right-handed people will pick the one that is third from the left.\nThis \"position force\" can be used to push customers towards certain products, depending on where they have been placed.\n\"Mental priming\" uses a repeated series of visual and verbal cues to steer an audience in a trick - and researchers found that many people could not explain why they had picked the same \"random\" number or card.\nThere is also the so-called \"equivoke\" used by magicians - where the audience believes they are making independent decisions during a trick, while in reality nothing they do has \"any impact on the outcome\".\n\"Regardless of the spectator's choice, the sequences result in the same outcome. The equivoke is highly effective in providing an illusory sense of control,\" says the study.\nAn example of this would be a card trick in which someone is invited to cut a pack of cards, with a series of stages of cutting and putting cards back on top - the \"vast majority\" fail to realise they have no impact on the target card.\nDr Kuhn says the magician's \"illusion of choice\", playing on the need to feel in control, can be applied elsewhere - to consumer decisions, online entertainment or political debates.\n\"It really deals with one of the most fundamental concepts in humanity - do we genuinely have free will?\n\"We feel we need it, but this experience of free will might actually be an illusion - and it's an illusion that magicians often manipulate,\" says the psychologist.\nDr Kuhn, part of the Magic Lab research team, says there is growing interest in understanding how magicians' \"forcing techniques\" can be used to influence behaviour.\nHe sees politicians increasingly drawing on the tactic of \"misdirection\", where a magician draws the audience's attention in one direction, with something noisy or spectacular, while the real moves are being made out of sight.\n\"Even if you know you're being misdirected, the problem is these principles are just incredibly effective and they still have an impact,\" says Dr Kuhn.\nUsing techniques from magic to \"modify behaviour\" can bring positive benefits, says co-author Alice Pailhes.\n\"They might provide new ways of encouraging better decisions in health and wellbeing,\" she says, such as steering people towards healthier food.\n\"But covert control and modification of people's thoughts raises serious ethical issues, too.\" \nAnd she warns of \"unwanted influences, such as political propaganda\".\n\"We believe that understanding magicians' forcing techniques is a valuable tool to raise awareness about the ease by which our choices can be manipulated,\" says the psychologist."

      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Belarus,Travel,Rotterdam,Eurovision Song Contest,Lithuania,Singing,San Marino,Self-isolation,Italy,Netherlands,Coronavirus pandemic,Music",
      "text": "James Newman has released Embers as the song he's taking to represent the UK in this year's Eurovision Song Contest.\nHe describes the brassy, dance track as a \"banger\", and says he wanted to create something \"full of positivity\".\nAfter the cancellation of Eurovision in 2020, singer-songwriter James has been given a second chance to take part. \nIt's due to take place 18-22 May in the Dutch city of Rotterdam, with most countries expected to release their entries by this weekend (13 -14 March).\nJames says he wanted to write something \"fun and upbeat\" to mark his return to the competition.\n\"Embers is about those sparks that don't die out,\" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"When we were writing this, it felt like I wanted to show everyone that we were coming back together.\n\"It's about having that connection and something reigniting. It's about us emerging from this rubbish time we've been having. It fits with the idea that Eurovision is coming back.\"\nHe says he was proud of 2020's entry My Last Breath - a ballad - but it was written in a pre-pandemic climate, so he wanted to write something more positive. \n\"Eurovision is a celebration of music and Embers fits in that vibe. Hopefully people like it.\"\nThe video's out and James is already in rehearsal mode, working with dancers and choreographers to create the performance which he'll take to the Rotterdam stage. \n\"It's weird and cool,\" said my 10-year-old, walking into the room as I played to Embers for the first time. \"I like it\".\nHe's got a point. Like Newman's previous Eurovision entry, Embers is a likeable, catchy song that does a good job of dragging the UK away from the dreary nonsense we've been sending to Europe over the last decade.\nBut is it going to win? Probably not. \nThere are more adventurous and quirky songs already in the running. And Iceland's Daoi Freyr, who scored a genuine international hit with Think About Things last year, is already a favourite for the title - despite the fact his song won't be unveiled until 13 March.\nThat said, Newman's lyrics, about rising from the flames, will strike a chord as Europe emerges from lockdown; while the music is assiduously based on recent dance hits by Joel Corry and Jax Jones - all chunky house pianos and cheesy synth riffs.\nBut that's also it's downfall: Embers sounds like the sort of record made by someone who's studied prevailing trends, rather than making new discoveries of their own.\nAs pop-punk whirlwind Yungblud recently told Music Week Magazine: \"If you're looking at what's current now, you're late.\" Maybe we should send him next year, instead?\nThe song's already getting a lot of love on social.\nThe aim is to have all 40 acts performing on stage in the Netherlands and organisers have various scenarios in place to ensure Eurovision happens, whatever's happening with the global pandemic.\nThey've published guidance on the measures they expect to be introduced, including social distancing, recommended quarantine times and limiting the audience in Rotterdam's Ahoy! arena. \nLast week, Eurovision's executive supervisor Martin Osterdahl told the BBC it was \"necessary\" for participants to travel to Rotterdam.\nBut contestants will also produce a \"live-on-tape\" performance ahead of the competition, with the videos to be used if artists are unable to travel due to the pandemic, or forced to quarantine at the venue.\nEurovision commentators, including Graham Norton, are expected to attend and use ventilated booths. \nItalian singer Senhit is back to represent the tiny country of San Marino and has enlisted -  *checks notes* - Flo Rida for her song, Adrenalina.\nThe rapper is no stranger to a pop feature (Olly Murs, The Saturdays, Alexandra Burke) but we're not entirely sure he's even been to San Marino before. \nAt this stage it's unlikely he'll appear on the stage on Rotterdam and it's unclear how he'll be represented. Here's hoping for a hologram. \nKey lyrics: Flo Rida - \"Step in the party 'cause she nodding to my body like hot coals. Gasoline kerosene stop drop roll. I can't blame it on the stove. 911 when she coming down the pole.\"\nDuring the year of a global pandemic, the spotlight's shone on Belarus in a very different way. \nThe country has seen mass protests against long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko, following an election which was widely thought to have been rigged. \nBelarus' entry is by a band who seem supportive of their leader but their inclusion in the contest is already proving controversial. \nEurovision bosses have told the Belarussian broadcaster BTRC that in its current form the song, Ya Nauchu Tebya (I'll Teach You), \"is currently not eligible to compete.\" \nEurovision adds: \"The song puts the non-political nature of the contest in question.\" \nTo this day, Ireland remains the most successful Eurovision country of all time, with seven wins.\nRecent results haven't hit the heights of the multiple wins in the 1990s. However, Jedward were responsible for Ireland's highest-placed finish of the last decade, coming 8th in 2011. \nAfter being selected for 2020, Lesley Roy is another singer coming back for the contest and she says her entry Maps was written \"specifically for Eurovision.\"\n\"It's heartfelt, it's uplifting and I hope people love it,\" she told independent.ie.\nKey lyric: \"My soul is a map, my heart is a compass, I am the road.\"\nWith their eccentricity and wonky dancing, The Roop were one of last year's most eye-catching band - and they've stepped it up a notch for 2021.\nThe trio are back with the natural follow-up to On Fire, with Discoteque sounding like Hot Chip's Lithuanian cousins. \nThey didn't have an easy ride though and still had to go through a national selection show to be picked, choosing a yellow and purple colour scheme this year.\nThe Roop say there's \"not a single person who cannot dance.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "text": "Australians will be able to buy half-price flights to a dozen domestic holiday spots under a new scheme to boost tourism, the government has said.\nThe list of subsidised destinations includes the Gold Coast, Cairns, the Whitsundays, Alice Springs and Broome.\nThe government said the A$1.2bn (\u00a3670m; $930m) scheme aims to revive the local tourism sector amid the pandemic.\nThat industry has been hardest hit by border closures and travel restrictions since early last year.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said the package of 800,000 cheaper airfares - to be offered between April and July - would encourage locals to visit other parts of the country. \nThe government's \"JobKeeper\" wage subsidy scheme is to finish at the end of March, but the tourism sector - usually reliant on international visitors - still required support, Mr Morrison said.\n\"To keep people in their jobs, we've got to put planes in the air, and we've got to put tourists on the ground,\" he told reporters at Sydney Airport on Thursday.\nBut the Labor opposition has argued the package is \"selective\" and mainly benefits airlines, pointing out there is no direct funding for tourism and hotel operators. \nAustralia began its vaccine rollout scheme last month and has reported zero locally acquired cases in the past fortnight.\nFor a year now, the nation has closed its borders to international arrivals barring returning nationals and some exempted cases.\nSince the pandemic began, Australia has reported about 29,000 cases and 909 deaths - numbers far lower than many other nations.\nDespite this success, many Australians have been reticent to make travel plans beyond their home state because of uncertainty over border closures.\nSmall outbreaks have often led to restrictions on movement, leaving people stranded or with interstate holidays cancelled.\nAirlines and travel representatives have largely welcomed the new subsidy scheme.\nHowever some have questioned the destinations chosen, given some are already big tourism drawcards. \nLabor has also noted the majority of them lie in seats with many swinging voters. Australia could see a general election called as early as this year.\nOpposition leader Anthony Albanese  argued it was typical of the Australian government to focus on the \"electoral map\" rather than \"which areas needs support most\".\nOthers online criticised the government for funding local holidays while tens and thousands of Australians remain stranded overseas."

      "text": "Two UK internet providers have been helping the Home Office and National Crime Agency track the websites visited by customers.\nA trial of new powers granted by the controversial Investigatory Powers Act of 2016 has been going on for months.\nIt involves the internet providers creating internet connection records (ICRs), which can be used to show which websites a person visited and when.\nDigital rights campaigners have raised privacy concerns.\n\"It's needles in haystacks, and this is collecting the entire haystack,\" said Heather Burns, policy manager with the Open Rights Group.\n\"We should have the right to not have every single click of what we do online hoovered up into a surveillance net on the assumption that there might be criminal activity taking place.\"\nThe Home Office said the trial was small in scale and in its early stages.\nIt is exploring what kind of data could be retrieved under the law and how useful - or not - it might be, it said.\nBut due to the nature of the trial, its exact workings are shrouded in secrecy, and it is not clear how many internet records are being collected for testing purposes, or to whom they belong.\nThe test's existence was first reported by Wired.\nThe power to spy on the websites people visit comes from the Investigatory Powers Act, which critics call a \"snoopers' charter\" due to widespread concerns about its scope.\nThe act gives the secretary of state the power, with a judge's approval, to order internet providers to keep their records for up to a year. The definition is so broad that critics believe all ISPs will simply be issued with such orders to cover all their customers.\nThose records can include which websites a customer visits, when, and how much data they download, as well as the relevant IP (internet protocol) addresses - but not what pages or exactly what content they read on those sites.\nBut that so-called \"metadata\" can still reveal a lot about a person's habits - from what political sites they visit to their use of pornography. There are, however, restrictions on who can access the ICRs and for what reasons.\nThe trial involves the two UK internet providers, which have not been named, the Home Office, and the National Crime Agency.\nThe internet providers themselves are prevented from saying if they are involved, as the law bans \"disclosing\" the existence of a data retention notice to anyone else.\nThe trial's existence was never formally announced or publicised, but was instead contained in two short paragraphs in a 168-page annual report from the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (Ipco), published in December. \nA spokeswoman for Ipco said the trial was continuing, and \"regular reviews\" were being carried out to make sure the data collection was \"necessary and proportionate\".\n\"Once a full assessment of the trial has been carried out, a decision will be made on whether there is a case for national rollout,\" she said.\nBut Ms Burns said the level of secrecy involved was a cause for concern.\n\"Yes, they're ticking the boxes about the oversight and the judicial approval every way they can,\" she said.\n\"But there's still an aspect of transparency which is crucially missing here.\"\nShe said questions remained around the scope of the law, which had been a key concern for critics as it was being debated in Parliament.\nThe Ipco report's brief reference to the trial revealed that it began in July 2019, when a judge approved a \"retention notice\" on a telecoms company. Another was granted in October that year, for a different telecoms company.\nBoth are, it said, for \"testing purposes only\" - so it is not clear whether they are linked to criminal suspects.\nThe National Crime Agency said it uses what it calls \"data exploitation\" to tackle crime. \n\"We are supporting the Home-Office-sponsored trial of internet connection record capability to determine the technical, operational, legal and policy considerations associated with delivery of this capability,\" it said in a statement."

An MP from her party denied the allegation.\nMeanwhile a UN human rights investigator accused the military of committing \"crimes against humanity.\"\nThomas Andrews told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva that Myanmar was currently being \"controlled by a murderous, illegal regime\" which was likely perpetrating \"widespread\" and \"systematic\" killings, torture and persecution.\nHis claims were supported by the rights group Amnesty, which accused the military of going on a \"killing spree\".\nMr Andrew also called for sanctions on junta leaders and on the military-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, which is set to reach $1bn in revenue this year. The US has already announced sanctions on 10 coup leaders, including Myanmar's acting president, and three companies.\nAt least seven more people were killed by security forces on Thursday, taking the total death toll to more than 70. Witnesses said some protesters had been shot in the head.\nSix of those deaths took place in the central town of Myaing. \n\"We protested peacefully,\" a health worker there told Reuters news agency. \"I couldn't believe they did it.\"\nA further death took place in the city of Yangon's North Dagon district, where 25-year-old Chit Min Thu died after being shot in the head.\n\"No-one will be in peace until this situation ends. They were so cruel with my son,\" his mother Hnin Malar Aung told AFP news agency.\nMeanwhile, a senior official said the military had been \"exercising utmost restraint\" and accused the protesters of violent behaviour.\nThe accusation that she accepted $600,000 in cash and 11kg of gold was made by a former chief minister of Yangon, Phyo Mien Thein, who said he had given her the payments, junta spokesman Brig Gen Zaw Min Tun said. The anti-corruption committee was investigating, he added.\nBut it was denied by an MP from the dissolved parliament representing Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party. \n\"It is no longer uncommon to see slander against politicians and efforts to crush the party while innocent young people are killed in public,\" Aye Ma Ma Myo told Reuters. \nGen Zaw Min Tun also accused President Win Myint and several cabinet ministers of corruption. \nMs Suu Kyi's NLD won a landslide victory in the polls last year, but the military now claims the election was fraudulent.\nIndependent international observers have disputed the military's claim - saying no irregularities were observed.\nMs Suu Kyi has been held for the past five weeks at an undisclosed location and faces several charges including causing \"fear and alarm\", illegally possessing radio equipment, and breaking Covid-19 restrictions.\nThe illegal payments charge levelled on Thursday was the most serious so far. The value of the gold the military alleges she illegally accepted is roughly \u00a3450,000.\nMyanmar has been gripped by street protests since the military seized control and detained Ms Suu Kyi. Her image has been held aloft by the protesters.\nThe UN, US and a host of other countries have condemned the killing of civilians in the crackdown against anti-coup protesters in Myanmar, and called on the authorities to exercise restraint. \nThe US has announced sanctions on coup leaders, while steps are also being taken to block access by the military to $1bn of government funds held in the US.\nThe military has dismissed criticism of its actions, instead blaming Ms Suu Kyi for the violence."

      "text": "President Joe Biden's $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) relief bill to help Americans deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has cleared its final hurdle in Congress.\nThe House of Representatives approved the massive economic aid plan 220-211 on Wednesday along partisan lines, with no Republicans voting in favour.\nHaving already passed through the Senate, the relief package now heads to Mr Biden's desk to be signed into law.\nThis sixth Covid-19 relief bill is a major legislative win for Mr Biden.\nThe bill passed with all but one House Democrat voting in favour.\nWhite House spokesperson Jen Psaki said the president will sign the bill into law on Friday.\nThe bill \"is about giving the backbone of this nation - the essential workers, the working people who built this country, the people who keep this country going - a fighting chance\" Mr Biden said.\nHe later vowed to share any surplus Covid-19 vaccines globally after ensuring that Americans are immunised. \"If we have a surplus, we're going to share it with the rest of the world,\" he said.\nThe final bill includes one-off direct payments worth $1,400 to be sent off to most Americans.\nIt extends weekly jobless benefit payments of $300 until September.\nIt also allocates $350bn to state and local governments, some $130bn to school reopening, $49bn for expanded Covid-19 testing and research, as well as $14bn for vaccine distribution.\nA proposal to raise the national minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour became a sticking point in the Senate and did not make it into the final version of the bill.\nThe package has been broadly popular among Americans.\nA March Pew Research Center poll found that 70% of US adults surveyed expressed support for the bill, including 41% of Republicans.\nDemocrats - who control both chambers of Congress by narrow margins - largely stuck together and managed to retain most of what was initially proposed.\nWhen announcing the so-called American Rescue Plan in January, Mr Biden said the government needed to \"go big\" in order to boost the flagging economy.\nAmerica's worst public health crisis in a century has left more than 527,000 people dead and over 29 million infected.\nUnemployment skyrocketed over the last year, with a current rate of 6.2%, according to the US Labor Department.\nRepublicans in Congress objected to the bill's price tag.\nThey have called for various elements of the package to be smaller and more targeted, including suggesting stimulus cheques should not go to people who have not lost income in the past year.\n\"House Democrats have abandoned any pretence of unity,\" House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said on the floor ahead of the vote.\n\"After five relief bills, it is on track to be the first passed by strictly party lines.\"\nHe noted it was the most expensive single bill in US history.\nJoe Biden just notched his first legislative victory. Now that the $1.9tn Covid relief bill has cleared Congress, the new administration will have a firehose of money to fight the economic and social consequences of the pandemic.\nHow effectively and efficiently Biden's team distributes that aid will go a long way toward determining the success of its first term. \nIf the record amounts of spending boost the economy - without overheating it - the president could reap the political benefits of a revitalised nation. And because Democrats enacted the legislation with no help from Republicans, it may also prove to be an effective cudgel in upcoming elections.\nThe unilateral nature of the law's passage, however, comes at a cost. Republicans are now dug in to their partisan trenches, and Biden's lofty inaugural rhetoric of a new era of co-operation seems a distant memory.\nBecause of procedural maneuvres, Democrats were able to pass Biden's Covid bill with a simple majority. Future legislative priorities will almost certainly require some Republican support.\nThis massive relief package, which provides record amounts of support for low-income families, is a significant accomplishment. Democrats have a lot of work to do if they want any more such wins."
