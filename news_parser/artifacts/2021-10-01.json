      "title": "Fuel supply: RAC says things improving in many areas",
      "tags": "UK economy,Fuel,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "The RAC motoring group has said the fuel shortage problem continues to ease, although many areas of the UK are still suffering supply issues.\nSmaller fuel stations were still facing major supply issues as drivers fill up for the weekend, the RAC said.\nEarlier, BP said problems at its stations caused by a shortage of HGV drivers was starting to improve.\nIt comes as one of the big fuel delivery firms, Hoyer Petrolog, confirmed it was training army drivers.\nThe RAC said that on Thursday its patrol vehicles dealt with nearly five times the number of out-of-fuel breakdowns than was typical. However, that was down on the 13-times it dealt with on Monday.\nMr Williams said: While the fuel delivery situation continues to improve in many areas, that's sadly not the case right across the country.\n\"Those drivers that rely on independent forecourts, especially where there aren't any supermarkets selling fuel, may still be struggling to fill up.\"\nBP was the first company to warn it had to close some petrol stations due to a shortage of drivers, which has worsened due to Covid and Brexit. But the company said on Friday the situation was \"stabilising\".\nA big fuel delivery supplier to BP forecourts and other outlets, Hoyer, confirmed to the BBC it was training army drivers over the last two days.\nHoyer, which delivers to about 25% of the UK's petrol stations, was not able to confirm how many army personnel were being trained nor when they would start work. However, the army drivers will use a mix of Hoyer and military vehicles to make deliveries, the company said.\nThe UK has been grappling with a fuel crisis that has caused huge queues outside some petrol stations, and forced customers to drive round multiple sites in search of supplies.\nBP said the situation had started to improve over the last few days, adding it was \"working flat out\" to keep sites across the country supplied. \nWhile the government and retailers say there is enough fuel at UK refineries, a shortage of drivers has slowed the transport of fuel to petrol stations.\nThe haulage industry says an existing shortage of lorry drivers has been made worse by a number of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, low wages and poor working conditions.\nSpeaking on the BBC's Today programme, policing minister Kit Malthouse said: \"My latest briefing is that the situation is stabilising, that we are seeing more forecourts with a greater supply of fuel and hopefully that, as demand and supply come better into balance over the next few days, week or so, that we will see a return to normality.\"\nHe added that if the situation started to deteriorate again, Prime Minister Boris Johnson would review matters.\nHowever, Labour leader Kier Starmer said it was time for \"emergency action\" as the \"chaos\" looked set to continue.\nHe said: \"We're going to see this driver shortage problem coming back again in different sectors. \n\"By the government's own admission, their scheme won't be up and running for weeks with the first HGV drivers not on the roads until November. This simply isn't good enough.\"\nHe called for the use of the military to get petrol to areas of the country in most need, and for fuel stations with supplies to extend opening hours for NHS shift staff and other key workers.\n\"Normally a tanker would last three to four days, but now it's selling out in 12 hours,\" says Danyal Shoaib, who runs a petrol station near Leatherhead, in Surrey. In the last week he says they've run dry three times.\n\"I think social media has played a massive part. As soon as anyone sees a tanker, they stick it online and the queues develop all the way down the road,\" he says.\nMr Shoaib says he's been surprised by the abuse he and his colleagues have faced from \"a significant minority\" of customers. \n\"A man tried to bypass the queue and when I politely asked him to join the end, he tried to drive his car into me to get me to move,\" he says. After he asked the man to calm down, he was then subjected to abusive language including \"quite obscene racial slurs\", he adds. \nDespite this, Mr Shoaib says they've had \"loads of lovely messages\" thanking them, and seen huge relief on people's faces when they can fill up. \nAt his petrol station, he says demand remains high: \"What we're saying to people is, if you can, please be reasonable. If you can make do with half a tank or three quarters of a tank, please do that.\"\nThe BBC understands that demand at supermarkets Asda and Morrisons is also easing, continuing a trend seen throughout the week.\nA Morrisons spokesperson said: \"It is a rapidly moving situation and we are working hard with our suppliers to ensure we can continue to keep our pumps open and serve our customers.\"\nSainsbury's, which has more than 300 sites in total, said that it was still experiencing high demand for fuel. \n\"We're working closely with our supplier to maintain supply and all our sites continue to receive fuel,\" a spokesperson said.\nTesco added: \"We have good availability of fuel, and we're working really hard to ensure regular deliveries to our petrol filling stations across the UK every day.\"\nThe firm operates 500 petrol stations, with another 200 managed by Esso with a Tesco Express store on-site.\nAn Esso spokesman told the BBC that a number of its Tesco Alliance sites were affected.\n\"The picture is constantly changing, but the situation at the 200 Esso Tesco Alliance sites is stabilising and continues to improve in terms of fuel availability,\" they said.\nLike a car running low on petrol, the situation at the pumps seems to have slowed and possibly stalled. \nFuel demand is still far from normal and the picture is very patchy. \nWhile there are hopeful noises from some areas of the industry that fuel is getting through, those who are selling it are still seeing queues, particularly in London and the south east. \nThe situation is not as bad as last weekend, but it still isn't over. The messaging could be tricky for the government. Tell everyone the crisis is solved before it dies down, and ministers risk losing the public's trust. \nThe question now is what will reassure the public to go back to normal buying? \nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 petrol stations\nIt said on Friday there had been little change for its members who are independent fuel retailers. \nIts survey of 1,100 sites across the UK found that 26% had neither petrol nor diesel in stock, down slightly from 27% on Thursday.\nGordon Balmer, its executive director, said: \"Whilst the situation is similar to recent days, there are signs it is improving, but far too slowly. \n\"Independents, which total 65% of the entire network, are not receiving enough deliveries of fuel compared with other sectors.\"\nMr Balmer said he believed queues were likely until independent retailers started getting more frequent deliveries.\nIn an attempt to limit disruption, the government has confirmed that 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers can receive temporary UK visas, with the scheme ending on Christmas Eve.\nA temporary relaxation on drivers' hours has also been extended until 31 October. This allows the daily driving limit to be increased from nine hours to 10 hours up to four times in a week. \nA government spokesperson said it had taken \"immediate action\" to increase the supply of HGV drivers and relieve the pressure on petrol stations.\n\"We recognise the challenges facing industry and streamlined the testing process in July to boost the number of drivers,\" they said, adding that it was important people continued to buy fuel as normal."

      "title": "Energy price cap: Millions of households face higher gas and electricity bills",
      "tags": "Money,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,UK economy",
      "text": "A squeeze on household finances will become more acute as a new, higher energy price cap takes effect.\nThose on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, will see bills go up by \u00a3139 to  \u00a31,277 a year, but the more energy a household uses, the higher their bill will be.\nPrepayment meter customers with average energy use will see a \u00a3153 increase.\nThe cap has come under the spotlight owing to the crisis among suppliers, which has seen nine firms fold.\nThe cap limits how much providers can raise prices. Even so, the current increase is the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019.\nIt represents a 12% rise in energy prices at a time of the year when, charities point out, people are about to use more heating and lighting during colder, darker days. It also coincides with other price rises hitting family budgets and the withdrawal of Covid support schemes, although the government has promised to continue financial help for the poorest households.\nAbout 15 million households in England, Wales and Scotland are affected by the changes.  \nThe cap does not apply in Northern Ireland where prices are overseen by a regulator.\nThe regulator Ofgem sets a price cap for domestic energy twice a year. The latest level kicked in on 1 October.\nIt is a cap on the price of energy and charges that suppliers can levy. A household's total bill is still determined by how much gas and electricity is used. \nThe latest change means:\nHouseholds on fixed tariffs will be unaffected, but those coming to the end of a contract are automatically moved to a default tariff set at the new level. In the past customers have been able to shop around for cheaper deals, but currently, they won't find anything cheaper, due to the high price of gas.\nAdam Scorer, from fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said: \"The massive devastating increases in energy prices will drive over 500,000 more households into fuel poverty, leaving them unable to heat or power their homes.\"\nDebbie Wright is about to move into her first flat, but said rising energy bills, as well as lower benefits payments, were detracting from the excitement of her potential independence.\n\"It's scary - you can't afford to live day by day,\" she said. \n\"Where is the extra money coming from?\"\nShe was taking part in a life skills class run by charity Christians Against Poverty. All of those in the class used prepayment meters and were in receipt of food parcels.\n\"We are seeing all sorts of people in debt,\" said life skills manager Shirley Bowen.\n\"There have always been people that struggle to manage their finances and I don't think that will ever change. As soon as there is any expense that they don't expect, it knocks them off and they have to cry out for help. \n\"It is just going to spiral. It is obvious that there will be people who do not put the heating on this winter. Whether or not they will be able to cook for their kids, it will just be sandwiches and cereal, we will have to just wait and see.\"\nUsually, the introduction of more expensive energy bills is accompanied with advice to consumers on standard tariffs to switch to a cheaper deal.\nThe current crisis in the sector means that, this time, there is no availability of better offers. A tariff set at the price cap limit is the most competitive available.\nInstead, residents are being encouraged to save money by looking at the energy efficiency of their homes. The Energy Saving Trust said that the price rise could be more than outstripped by changes to our homes and habits.\nMr Scorer, from National Energy Action, said: \"We can't lose sight of the long-term solution to reduce the energy waste in our homes. We have some of the least efficient housing in Europe. \n\"This has left the UK more exposed to the current soaring gas price than many other countries and we are wasting billions of pounds each year as heat escapes through leaky roofs, floors and ceilings.\"\nThe new cap was decided in August and is designed to reflect the unavoidable costs faced by energy suppliers.\nThis came slightly ahead of a massive jump in wholesale gas prices which has led to the collapse of nine suppliers in recent weeks. They have been unable to keep to the price promises they made to their customers, and were uninsured against the increasing costs.\nAvro Energy, for example, confirmed on Friday that it had fallen into administration. Its customers will be transferred to Octopus Energy, while its 103 staff will be kept on for at least the short-term to help with the change.\nThe tariffs that will be charged for the 1.7 million customers moving to new suppliers after their previous provider collapsed are being set at the same level as the new price cap. \nSenior executives of bigger suppliers have argued that the price cap is making the situation worse. They say they are shouldering billions of pounds in additional costs by providing customers with energy that costs more to buy than they are allowed to sell it for under the retail price cap.\nEmma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, told the BBC's Today programme: \"It costs around \u00a3600 to take on a new customer at the moment because of the astonishing price of gas in the market and that's the main issue.\"\nShe added that more energy suppliers were expected to fail given the current \"volatile\" gas market.\nFirms have criticised Ofgem, claiming that it should have known many smaller suppliers would not be resilient in the face of gas price rises.\nJonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, rejected the criticism, saying that nobody could have predicted the huge rise in the cost of wholesale gas.\nHe accepted that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills in the future.\nOfgem will decide the level of the next price cap - which analysts predict to be considerably higher - in February, before it takes effect at the start of April.\nA spokeswoman for the regulator said: \"We are doing all we can to make sure consumers, especially people in vulnerable circumstances, do not pay more than is absolutely necessary this winter.\n\"Higher energy costs are never welcome news to anyone and the timing and size of this increase will be particularly difficult for many families still struggling with the impact of the pandemic. Anyone struggling to pay their energy bills should get in touch with their supplier to access the help that is available.\"\nHave you been told that your energy bills will increase?

      "tags": "Human rights,Metropolitan Police Service,Nottingham,Undercover police",
      "text": "An activist who was deceived into a relationship with an undercover police officer has won a tribunal case for breaches of her human rights.\nKate Wilson met Mark Kennedy while he was posing as an environmental campaigner in Nottingham in 2003.\nIt later emerged Mr Kennedy had sexual relationships with as many as 10 other women during his deployment.\nThe tribunal said the case revealed \"disturbing and lamentable failings at the most fundamental levels\".\nEarlier this year the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) at the Royal Courts of Justice heard Mr Kennedy had been sent to infiltrate the Sumac Centre in Nottingham in 2003.\nShortly after arriving Mr Kennedy, calling himself Mark Stone, started a relationship with Ms Wilson which lasted for two years before an amicable split when she moved to Spain.\nIn 2010, she learned his real name and that he was actually a married police officer.\nMs Wilson's legal action against the Met and the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) cited breaches of her right to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, her right to privacy and right to freedom of expression.\nThe Met and NPCC accepted Mr Kennedy's actions amounted to a breach of those rights but had denied other officers, apart from Mr Kennedy and his cover officer, knew or suspected that Ms Wilson was in a sexual relationship with the officer.\nHowever, Ms Wilson argued there was \"widespread indifference, or express or tacit encouragement\" for undercover officers to begin intimate relationships while they were deployed.\nIn a ruling, the IPT found the Met's claims that undercover officers (UCOs) knew sexual relationships were banned were \"materially undermined by the sheer frequency with which [Kennedy] (and other UCOs) did conduct sexual relationships without either questions being asked or action being taken by senior officers\".\n\"We are driven to the conclusion that either senior officers were quite extraordinarily naive, totally unquestioning or chose to turn a blind eye to conduct which was, certainly in the case of [Kennedy], useful to the operation,\" the tribunal added.\nThe IPT also found the Met and NPCC's failure to guard against the risk of UCOs entering into sexual relationships with women amounted to unlawful discrimination against women.\nThe tribunal concluded: \"This is not just a case about a renegade police officer who took advantage of his undercover deployment to indulge his sexual proclivities, serious though this aspect of the case unquestionably is.\n\"Our findings that the authorisations under [the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000] were fatally flawed and the undercover operation could not be justified as 'necessary in a democratic society' ... reveal disturbing and lamentable failings at the most fundamental levels.\"\nIn a statement, Ms Wilson said: \"The events in my case happened years ago, however the failure of the police to protect women from sexual predators within their own ranks, and police attempts to criminalise protesters, are both still very live issues today.\n\"We need to tackle the misogyny and institutional sexism of the police, and there needs to be a fundamental rethink of the powers they are given for the policing of demonstrations and the surveillance of those who take part.\"\nA statement from the Met and NPCC said: \"We accept and recognise the gravity of all of the breaches of Ms Wilson's human rights as found by the tribunal, and the Met and NPCC unreservedly apologise to Ms Wilson for the damage caused, and the hurt she has suffered from the deployment of these undercover officers.\"\nIt said the force reiterate previous apologies made to Ms Wilson in 2015 and 2017, adding: \"As those apologies made clear, the Met and NPCC acknowledge that the sexual relationship was wrong, it was an abuse of police power and violated Ms Wilson's human rights.\n\"It caused Ms Wilson significant trauma, and demonstrated failures in the way Kennedy was supervised and managed.\"\nThe statement added the Met accepted the panel's findings and \"are carefully considering the detail of the judgment to see whether any further learning can be taken to add to the changes already implemented since 2010, to the training, supervision and legal oversight of UCOs\".\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nFrom today, you'll need to show proof you've had two vaccine doses if you want to go to a nightclub in Scotland. But people are reporting problems with the NHS Scotland Covid Status app, which only became available to download on Thursday evening, with some being told it can't find a match for the data they enter. The Scottish government says the problems are \"likely to be caused by extremely high initial traffic\", adding: \"We advise people whose data is not found to try again a couple of hours later.\"\nCharities say a hike in energy prices will hit households hard at a time when Covid support such as the \u00a320 Universal Credit uplift and the furlough scheme are ending. Typical default domestic energy bills will rise by \u00a3139 a year, with prepayment meter customers paying an extra \u00a3153, after regulator Ofgem raised the energy price cap for England, Scotland and Wales. The government has announced \u00a3500m in grants to help UK families struggling with the cost of living.\nForty diagnostic clinics equipped to carry out X-rays, breast screening, ultrasounds and CT and MRI scans will be set up in community venues in England to help tackle the backlog built up during the pandemic. By March, staff at venues including a Barnsley shopping centre, Brighton's Amex Stadium and a Poole department store will be carrying out checks on cancer patients and scans to see if people need surgery for things such as knee and hip replacements, ministers say.\nLockdown affected people in different ways and, for some, it has had catastrophic consequences. As BBC Radio Wales discovers, many people turned to alcohol to help them through a stressful time. But, with referrals to drink and drug support services down, there are fears many people have not come forward to get the help they need.\nIt's a policy that's been praised for helping to suppress Covid but it's also kept many families apart from their loved ones. Under Australia's pandemic response policies, only citizens and those with exemptions have been able to enter, while most Australians have been unable to leave. But now there's hope for people desperate to visit folks down under, with the country set to reopen its borders to fully vaccinated travellers from November.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nIf you face being made redundant following the end of the furlough scheme, you can find out about your rights to notice, payment and benefits.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

They say they are shouldering billions of pounds in additional costs by providing customers with energy that costs more to buy than they are allowed to sell it for under the retail price cap.\nEmma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, told the BBC's Today programme: \"It costs around \u00a3600 to take on a new customer at the moment because of the astonishing price of gas in the market and that's the main issue.\"\nShe added that more energy suppliers were expected to fail given the current \"volatile\" gas market.\nFirms have criticised Ofgem, claiming that it should have known many smaller suppliers would not be resilient in the face of gas price rises.\nJonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, rejected the criticism, saying that nobody could have predicted the huge rise in the cost of wholesale gas.\nHe accepted that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills in the future.\nOfgem will decide the level of the next price cap - which analysts predict to be considerably higher - in February, before it takes effect at the start of April.\nA spokeswoman for the regulator said: \"We are doing all we can to make sure consumers, especially people in vulnerable circumstances, do not pay more than is absolutely necessary this winter.\n\"Higher energy costs are never welcome news to anyone and the timing and size of this increase will be particularly difficult for many families still struggling with the impact of the pandemic. Anyone struggling to pay their energy bills should get in touch with their supplier to access the help that is available.\"\nHave you been told that your energy bills will increase?

      "title": "Sarah Everard: How Wayne Couzens planned her murder",
      "tags": "Policing,Violence against women,Sarah Everard murder",
      "text": "Met Police officer Wayne Couzens has been sentenced to a whole-life term for the murder of Sarah Everard, in a case that sparked national outrage and calls for more action to tackle violence against women. \nCouzens admitted the kidnap, rape and murder of the 33-year-old marketing executive when he appeared in court several months ago.\nBut it was only during his sentencing that the full details of his crimes emerged. \nMs Everard was walking home from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, at about 21:30 BST on 3 March when she was abducted. \nCouzens' choice of victim was random, but the attack was planned. \nIn his sentencing remarks, Lord Justice Fulford said there had been \"significant planning and premeditation\" by Couzens.\nThe police officer had \"long planned to carry out a violent sexual assault on a yet-to-be-selected victim\" who he intended to coerce into his custody, noted the judge. \nCouzens spent at least a month travelling to London from Deal, Kent, where he lived, to research how best to carry out his crimes. \nSeveral days before the attack, he booked a hire car, which he would use for the abduction, as well as a roll of self-adhesive film advertised as a carpet protector on Amazon.\nAfter finishing a 12-hour shift at the US embassy that morning, Couzens, a parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer, went out \"hunting\" for a lone, young woman to kidnap and rape, the prosecution said.\nThe court heard how Couzens used the knowledge he had gained from working on Covid patrols in January and his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card to trick his victim under the guise of a fake arrest for breaching coronavirus guidelines. \nThe 48-year-old, who had been a police officer since 2002, handcuffed her before bundling her into the car and driving away. \nThe abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car - but they believed they had seen an undercover police officer carrying out a legitimate arrest, so did not intervene. \nThe whole kidnapping took less than five minutes.\nCouzens then drove to Dover in Kent, where he transferred Ms Everard to his own car, before travelling to a remote rural area nearby. \nIt was there that he raped and murdered his victim - strangling her with his police belt. \nBy 02:31 Couzens had left the scene and was spotted at a service station buying drinks. \nHe visited the site where Ms Everard's body was dumped twice, leaving just before dawn. \nThe next day, as the search for her escalated, Couzens bought petrol, which he used to burn her body inside a fridge. \nHe also purchased two green rubble bags, which he used to dump the remains in a pond near an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, Ashford. \nA week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream, just metres from land owned by Couzens.\nMeanwhile, Couzens returned to normal life, carrying out mundane activities like calling a vet about his dog. \nDays later, he even took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods where he had burnt his victim's body. \nHowever, on the 8 March, the day he was due to return to work, he reported in sick. \nThe following day he was arrested at his home in Deal.\nIn a brief police interview, he told a false story about being threatened by an Eastern European gang, claiming they had demanded he deliver \"another girl\" after he had underpaid a prostitute a few weeks before. He then claimed he kidnapped Ms Everard, drove out of London and handed her over to three men in a van in a layby in Kent, while she was alive and uninjured.\nBut after Ms Everard's body was discovered in a pond just 130 metres from land owned by Couzens, he was charged. \nCouzens has since been sacked by the Met, but the force is still facing questions over whether chances were missed to prevent his predatory behaviour. \nAfter Ms Everard's murder, the police watchdog announced it was probing alleged failures by the Met to investigate two indecent exposure incidents linked to Couzens in February. \nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct is also investigating alleged failures by Kent Police to investigate a flashing incident linked to Couzens in 2015. \nCouzens transferred to the Met in 2018, from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, where he had worked since 2011. \nTwo years later he began working for the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command as an authorised firearms officer at diplomatic premises around central London.\nIn July, appearing by video link from Belmarsh high security jail, Couzens pleaded guilty to murder at the Old Bailey. \nOn Wednesday he appeared in court again - this time in person - for a two-day sentencing hearing. \nThere, he faced Ms Everard's mother, father and sister, who described to the court the torment of losing their loved one in such horrendous circumstances. \nHer father, Jeremy, demanded that Couzens looked at him as he told the murderer he could never forgive him for taking away his daughter. \nHer mother, Susan, said she was \"tormented\" at the thought of what her \"precious little girl\" had endured. \n\"I go through the sequence of events. I wonder when she realised she was in mortal danger,\" she told the court. \n\"Burning her body was the final insult. It meant we could never again see her sweet face and never say goodbye.\n\"Our lives will never be the same. We should be a family of five, but now we are four. Her death leaves a yawning chasm in our lives that cannot be filled.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "One in every 20 children of secondary school age in England is infected with coronavirus, according to the latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics.\nThis is the highest reported rate for this age group - or any other - since the pandemic began.\nChildren's risk from the virus is very low, and serious illness is rare.\nA single vaccine dose is now being offered to all 12 to 17-year-olds in schools across the UK.\nThat followed a decision by the UK's four chief medical officers that a Covid vaccine for this age group would help keep children in school and benefit the poorest families.\nPreviously, only teenagers with health conditions which put them at increased risk of being seriously ill with Covid were offered two doses, as well as children living in the same house as people who are very vulnerable to the virus.\nThe ONS data covers the week up to 25 September, and estimates a steep rise in infections in children aged 11-15 over the last few weeks, with nearly 5% now testing positive - up from 2.8% the week before.\nInfections in younger primary-age children have been increasing, but much less sharply, with 2.6% testing positive.\nInfections in young adults have now decreased to around 1% affected, and in older adult groups infection levels remain even lower.\nProf Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics, at The Open University, said the infection rates in 11 to 15-year-olds were \"extraordinarily high\", adding that the fall in infections in young adults, who have now been vaccinated in large numbers, was \"pleasing\".  \nAround 1.2% of the UK population - or one in 80 people - is likely to be infected, the ONS says, which is little changed from the previous week.\nThe percentage of people testing positive went up in England and Wales, decreased in Scotland and stayed roughly the same in Northern Ireland.\nThe ONS estimates are based on tests carried out on a random sample of the population, whether they had symptoms or not.\nGovernment data on cases of coronavirus in England - which are more recent and cover those coming forward for tests and getting a positive result - shows a similar spike in 10 to 14-year-olds.\nMeera Chand, from Public Health England, said: \"Case rates remain high across the country, especially among young people.\n\"Wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, avoid mixing with others if you feel unwell and get a PCR test straight away if you have any Covid-19 symptoms.\"\nShe added that the best way to protect against Covid was to get the vaccine.\nOther viruses are also circulating and affecting children. In the summer, there was a jump in RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) in the under-4s and, in recent weeks, cases of the common cold have risen sharply in the under-14s, PHE data shows.\nNow that more than 80% of over-16s in the UK are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, and booster doses are being offered to the most vulnerable, deaths and serious illness are expected to stay at low levels.\nBut there are concerns about what this winter will bring, with flu and other viruses making a comeback.\nAnd there has been criticism that the rollout of one vaccine dose to 12 to 15-year-olds took too long to happen, after the UK's vaccine committee asked for additional advice on the wider benefits of vaccination.\nThis delay meant children had returned to school for the autumn term before any decision was made.\nSix per cent of 12 to 16-year-olds have now had one vaccine dose in England while, in Scotland, the figure is 14%."

      "tags": "France",
      "text": "For decades the crimes of a notorious serial killer have haunted the Paris crime squad.\nBut now a former military police officer is said to have confessed to being the murderer known as Le Gr\u00eal\u00e9 - the pockmarked man - before his death.\nNamed locally as Fran\u00e7ois V\u00e9rove, his DNA has been matched to several crime scenes linked to Le Gr\u00eal\u00e9.\nHis murders and rapes shocked Paris between 1986 and 1994 but until now were never solved.\nAmong the shocking crimes attributed to him was the murder of 11-year-old C\u00e9cile Bloch. She was reported missing after failing to show up to school in Paris in 1986.\n\"We won't ever know all the crimes Le Gr\u00eal\u00e9 committed,\" said Didier Saban, a lawyer representing the families. \nV\u00e9rove is linked to four murders and six rapes but Mr Saban said there were undoubtedly more, and his death had left many families without answers.\nA picture of Le Gr\u00eal\u00e9 has hung for decades on the walls of the criminal brigade of the Paris judicial police.\nThis cold case was finally cracked when an investigating magistrate recently decided to send letters to 750 gendarmes (military police) stationed in the Paris region at the time.\nThe 59-year-old man found dead had been a gendarme before becoming a police officer and later retiring, He was summoned by police on 24 September to give a DNA sample five days later. His wife reported him missing on 27 September.\nHis body was discovered in a rented flat in Grau-du-Roi on the Mediterranean coast, along with a suicide note. Prosecutors says his DNA matched evidence found at several crime scenes. \nThe contents of the letter have not been confirmed but French reports say he confessed to experiencing \"previous impulses\" while saying he had since \"got himself together\". He apparently admitted murders without detailing the victims or circumstances.\nLe Gr\u00eal\u00e9's nickname dates back to evidence given at the time of C\u00e9cile Bloch's murder.\nThe victim's half-brother, Luc Richard, was among residents who recalled seeing a man with an acne-scarred face on the day of the crime in their apartment building in the 19th district of northern Paris.\nBloch's body was later found under a piece of old carpet in the basement. Officials said she had been raped, strangled and stabbed, and the case sent shockwaves across France.\nHer brother, who helped police draw a sketch of the suspect, remembered sharing a lift with the man, who seemed \"very sure of himself\".\n\"He said something to me like, 'Have a very, very good day,'\" he recalled in an interview with the Sud Ouest newspaper in 2015.  Mr Richard has previously spoken about how the case has haunted him, saying he has lived with a \"great feeling of injustice\".\nDNA evidence linked Ms Bloch's killer to other murders and rapes.\nThis included the 1987 killing of 38-year-old Gilles Politi and his German au pair Irmgard M\u00fcller.\nLocal reports say he was linked to the 1994 murder of 19-year-old Karine Leroy, who was found dead on the edge of a wood more than a month after disappearing while on her way to school.\nIn rapes committed against a 26-year-old German woman and two girls, aged 14 and 11, the suspect is reported to have identified himself as a policeman.\n\"We had this conviction that he was either an officer or a gendarme, both from the violence he used against his victims and the tactics he adopted,\" the lawyer representing the victims told France Info TV. Sometimes he would even present his card with the French tricolor on it.\nMr Saban believed the killer had done all he could to ensure his DNA was not left at crime scenes. But now his identity has been revealed he wants unsolved crimes to be reopened in which DNA techniques were never used."

I do think it should be part of our baseload.\n\"So that's why yes, of course, we're looking at Wylfa as well as lots of other projects.\"\nHe said the cost of energy can be held down \"if we make the big long-term investments that we need to do now in clean power generation\".\nA representative of Bechtel has said Anglesey is regarded as the best site in the UK to build a large-scale nuclear power station.\nWylfa is currently the site of a decommissioned power station, the last part of which was switched off in 2015.\nPlans for a new \u00a313bn nuclear power plant failed after backers Hitachi failed to come to an agreement with the UK government over how it would be subsidised.\nReports suggested the company was offered a \"strike price\" - a price on energy that ministers would guarantee to the builders of the project - of around \u00a375 per megawatt hour.\nThe nuclear plant was intended to have a generating capacity of 2,900 megawatts (MW) and have a 60-year operational life.\nMr Johnson spoke ahead of the Conservative party conference, which begins in Manchester on Sunday.\nDefending the decision to scrap the \u00a320 universal credit uplift, he told BBC Wales he did not believe it would be right to subsidise low wages.\nHe said a \u00a3500m hardship fund was being set up - with \u00a325m going to the Welsh government, which can spend the cash how it wants.\nThere are 275,000 universal credit claimants in Wales.\nMr Johnson continued: \"What I don't think would be right would be to subsidise low wages when companies are paying their workers more.\n\"That is the right way forward for the UK economy.\"\nSee the full interview on Politics Wales, on BBC Two Wales, at 10:00 BST on Sunday, and afterwards on BBC iPlayer."

      "text": "A Yorkshire farmer has killed hundreds of piglets because labour shortages in local abattoirs mean adult pigs are not being killed fast enough.\nThe resulting backlog means there is less space left on farms for younger pigs, which are cheaper and easier to kill.\nThe farmer had been \"destroyed by it\", according to a friend. \n\"He had to kill perfectly healthy, viable piglets,\" she told BBC News.\nAccording to the National Pig Association (NPA), this may well not be the only case of farmers killing healthy livestock as mature pigs have continued to \"back up\" on farms. \nThe labour shortages are being blamed on Brexit and the Covid pandemic.\nHauliers and poultry workers to get temporary visas\nTurkey farmers warn of shortage due to Brexit\nBefore that, about 80% of staff in two major processing centres in Hull came from Eastern Europe, according to the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA). \nNick Allen, from the BMPA, said the workforce in large abattoirs would normally be 10-15% above average ahead of Christmas, but instead it is 15% down. Because centres are unable to process pigs at the usual rate, live animals are mounting up on farms and some farmers were \"quietly starting to cull\", he said.\nOnce a pig gets too big, its butchered processed carcass will no longer fit into supermarket packets so retailers do not want to buy it from farmers. \n\"The main barrier is labour, with the change in the immigration policy.  We are struggling to get butchers in particular, and it limits how fast you can run the plant,\" Mr Allen added. \n\"We were offering higher wages, but with the job market at the moment, it's not worked. We do need access to some non-UK labour.\"\nSimilar labour shortages among lorry drivers and poultry workers led the government to introduce temporary visas to try to limit disruption in the run-up to Christmas, but this concession was not extended to the pig-meat industry.\nThe Yorkshire farmer's friend, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC: \"It's desperate. I've been producing for 26 years, and never faced the prospect of having to butcher pigs on my own farm before\".\nMeryl Ward who runs a family farm in Lincolnshire has 1,600 pigs that should already have gone to slaughter. \nShe has been farming for 35 years and says the current crisis is the worst she has encountered.\nA humane cull, which is being discussed, would see prime healthy pigs being \"rendered\" for cheap products like lard or pet food, and farmers are unlikely to be compensated for their losses.\nParallels are being drawn to the 2001 foot-and-mouth crisis, where pyres of cows burned across the countryside.\nShe added: \"Producers are in despair... we can't just waste this food. It's criminal.\" \nShe said temporary work visas were needed, like those recently issued for HGV drivers and poultry workers.\n\"It's such a massive national problem, it needs action and leadership from government.\n\"If they really care about farm animal welfare, if they really believe in UK animal production and the standards that we have are worth saving, we need some action,\" she urged.\nA Defra spokesperson said the government was \"keeping the market under close review\" and continuing to \"work closely with the sector to explore options to address the pressures\" that the industry was currently facing.\nThe National Pig Association is urging retailers to back British producers, rather than to buy imported produce.\nSupermarket chain Lidl described the backlogs as \"alleged\", adding it was \"committed to\" sourcing 100% of its fresh pork from British farmers.\nSainsbury's said all its fresh pork was British but that it \"may source bacon and continental meats from the EU to meet demand.\" \nTesco said it was \"working closely\" with suppliers to make sure supply chains were protected to \"provide availability\" for its shoppers. \nAldi said its \"core range\" of meat was \"100% British and Red Tractor assured.\" \nFollow Claire on Twitter"

      "tags": "Sarah Everard murder,Clapham,Deal,Brixton,Ashford",
      "text": "The family of Sarah Everard confronted her murderer in court and laid bare their loss and anguish. These are their victim impact statements in full.\nThe following accounts contain details which readers may find distressing.\nSarah is gone and I am broken-hearted. She was my precious little girl, our youngest child. The feeling of loss is so great it is visceral. And with the sorrow come waves of panic at not being able to see her again. I can never talk to her, never hold her again, and never more be a part of her life. We have kept her dressing gown - it still smells of her and I hug that instead of her.\nSarah died in horrendous circumstances. I am tormented at the thought of what she endured. I play it out in my mind. I go through the terrible sequence of events. I wonder when she realised she was in mortal danger; I wonder what her murderer said to her. When he strangled her, for how long was she conscious, knowing she would die? It is torture to think of it.\nSarah was handcuffed, unable to defend herself, and there was no one to rescue her. She spent her last hours on this earth with the very worst of humanity. She lost her life because Wayne Couzens wanted to satisfy his perverted desires. It is a ridiculous reason, it is nonsensical. How could he value a human life so cheaply? I cannot comprehend it. I am incandescent with rage at the thought of it.\nHe treated my daughter as if she was nothing and disposed of her as if she was rubbish.\nIf Sarah had died because of an illness, she would have been cared for. We could have looked after her and been with her. If she had died because of an accident, people would have tried to help - there would have been kindness. But there is no comfort to be had, there is no consoling thought in the way Sarah died. In her last hours she was faced with brutality and terror, alone with someone intent on doing her harm. The thought of it is unbearable. I am haunted by the horror of it.\nWhen Sarah went missing we suffered days of agony, not knowing where she was or what had happened to her. Then, when Sarah's burnt remains were found, we spent two terrible days waiting for tests to show how she had died, fearing she had been set alight before she was dead - the thought was appalling.\nBurning her body was the final insult, it meant we could never again see her sweet face and never say goodbye.\nOur lives will never be the same. We should be a family of five, but now we are four. Her death leaves a yawning chasm in our lives that cannot be filled.\nI yearn for her. I remember all the lovely things about her. She was caring, she was funny. She was clever, but she was good at practical things too. She was a beautiful dancer. She was a wonderful daughter. She was always there to listen, to advise, or simply to share with the minutiae of the day. And she was also a strongly principled young woman who knew right from wrong and who lived by those values. She was a good person. She had purpose to her life.\nMy outlook on life has changed since Sarah died. I am more cautious, I worry more about our other children. I crave the familiarity and security of home - the wider world has lost its appeal. It is too painful to contemplate a future without Sarah, so I just live in the here and now. I think of Sarah all the time, but the mornings and evenings are particularly painful. In the morning I wake up to the awful reality that Sarah is gone. In the evenings, at the time she was abducted, I let out a silent scream: Don't get in the car, Sarah. Don't believe him. Run!\nI am repulsed by the thought of Wayne Couzens and what he did to Sarah. I am outraged that he masqueraded as a policeman in order to get what he wanted.\nSarah wanted to get married and have children - now all that has gone. He took her life and stole her future and we will never have the joy of sharing that future with her. Each day dawns and I think Sarah should be here, leading her life and embracing new experiences. She had so many years ahead of her.\nI don't know how anyone could be so cruel as to take my daughter's life. What I do know is that Sarah will never be forgotten and is remembered with boundless love.\nI cling on to memories of Sarah, I hold them tight to keep them safe. The other night, I dreamt that Sarah appeared at home. In my dream I held her and could feel her physically. Jeremy was there, we were comforting her, saying: 'It's all right Sarah, it's all right'. I would give anything to hold her once more. I hope I dream that dream again.\nThere's a photograph of my beautiful daughter on the screen. She had a beautiful mind too. Mr Couzens, please, will you look at me? The impact of what you have done will never end. The horrendous murder of my daughter, Sarah, is in my mind all the time and will be for the rest of my life.\nA father wants to look after his children and fix everything, and you have deliberately and with premeditation stopped my ability to do that.\nSarah was handcuffed and unable to defend herself. This preys on my mind all the time.\nI can never forgive you for what you have done, for taking Sarah away from us.\nYou burnt our daughter's body \u2014 you further tortured us \u2014 so that we could not see her again. We did not know whether you had burnt her alive or dead. You stopped us seeing Sarah for one last time and stopped me from giving my daughter one last kiss goodbye.\nHer body fell apart when she was moved. Her brain and neck bones were removed for months by the pathologist and her body was difficult to preserve so we had to use the services of a specialist embalmer to enable a dignified burial.\nAll my family want is Sarah back with us. No punishment that you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us.\nYou murdered our daughter and forever broke the hearts of her mother, father, brother, sister, family and her friends.\nSarah had so much to look forward to and because of you this is now gone forever. She was saving to buy a house and looking forward to marriage and children. We were looking forward to having grandchildren. We loved being a part of Sarah's world and expected her to have a full and happy life.\nThe closest we can get to her now is to visit her grave every day\nYou treated Sarah as if she was nothing. Placed more emphasis on satisfying your sick disgusting perversions than on a life. Her life.\nYou disposed of my sister's body like it was rubbish. Fly-tipped her like she meant nothing. She meant everything. We couldn't even see her, she was so badly burnt. Her brain was removed from her skull to check for trauma and cause of death - I still don't know if they put her brain back in her head or whether it is lying next to her body in her coffin.\nShards of her kneecap were returned to us to be placed with her body - shards that you knocked when moving her burnt body from the fridge you had used to hide her and conceal the fire.\nWe are still missing her hyoid bone from her throat, which is being checked to see the force you used to strangle her, to determine how long she may have survived. We know it was broken. Her burnt body still had her necklace and one earring in her ear. The other had fallen from her ear because it had burnt off.\nYou hear from the police that it takes around two minutes to strangle someone, and around eight to ten seconds for them to lose consciousness.\nAt first there is a sense of relief at hearing that your sister might only have been aware of what was happening for eight to 10 seconds. But have you put your hands around your neck and tried pushing hard? Eight to 10 seconds now seems a long time.\nYou used your warrant card to trick my sister into your car. She sat in a car, handcuffed, for hours. What could she have thought she had done wrong? What lies did you tell her? When did she realise that she wasn't going to survive the night?\nI'm constantly replaying in my head - did you rape her, then kill her? Did you kill her while raping her? You get small nuggets of information and the thought process starts again. Your semen and blood were found in your car. So this suggests you raped her in the car. You find out you may have used a belt to strangle her. New horrendous images forming.\nYou stopped to get a Lucozade and water at a petrol station. Was she still alive at this point? Bound in your car? I am horrified by your ability to flit between what you did and normal, everyday actions. Your casual demeanour on CCTV was very upsetting and shocking to see.\nWe had to go to the flat and pack up Sarah's whole life - washing left hanging up, half-sewn outfits, deliveries waiting to be returned, packages waiting at the door ready to be opened.\nAll signs of a life waiting to be lived, chores to be done, ready for her to return and continue when she got home. But she never got home because a predator - you - was on the loose. Prowling the streets for hours looking for his prey.\nYou can't comprehend what you are being told when it happened because it is so horrific. Some sort of sick waking nightmare. You can't imagine anyone could do such a thing.\nYou are waiting to hear anything from the police. Every bit you get is different. You hear her body has been found. Then you find out she has been burnt. So badly burnt you can't see her. Can't see her again to say goodbye.\nThe first thought you have in your head after despair and shock is - was she dead before you burnt her? Imagine that even having to be a thought. You find out no soot was found in her lungs, which suggests she was burnt after you murdered her. Imagine being relieved to hear your sister was dead before she was burnt.\nI replay it continuously round in my head. What you may have said to her, what she may have said back, when she realised she was in grave danger and was not going to survive.\nHoping my sister was unconscious and drugged, but we know that was not the case - no drugs found in her body, no trauma to the head. Burst blood vessels in her brain from your strangulation, which meant she was conscious when you were doing these unfathomable things to her.\nMy only hope is that she was in a state of shock and that she wasn't aware of the disgusting things being done to her by a monster. When you forced yourself upon and raped her. When you put your hands around her neck and strangled her.\nIt disgusts me that you were the last person to touch her perfect body, and violate her in the way you did. The last person to see her alive and speak to her.\nHow scared she must have been. The last moments of her life not with loved ones, but frightened and fighting for her life. I hate to think of her being so scared and alone and that in her last moments she had no one with her. No kindness. I hate that I wasn't there to save her. To stop you. I find it hard to believe she is not just living her own life and sick at the thought that her last moments on this earth alive were so horrific.\nHow dare you take her from me? Take away her hopes and dreams. Her life. Children that will never be born. Generations that will never exist. Her future no longer exists. The future I was supposed to live with my sister no longer exists. You have ruined so many lives.\nSarah is the very best person, with so many people who love and cherish her. I want to speak to her and hug her and hear her laugh and go out for dinners and drinks and dancing.\nAll those conversations we can never have. There were so many things I wanted to share with her - trips abroad, being each other's bridesmaids, meeting her babies and being an auntie, growing old together and seeing who got the most wrinkles. We weren't even halfway through our journey and you took it all away.\nI feel like I live in a make-believe world, as if nothing is real. I have to pretend because the thought of not having Sarah forever is too hard to bear. A lifetime now seems a very long time.\nI should never have to write a eulogy for or bury my little sister. There is no punishment that you could receive that will ever compare to the pain you have caused us. We can never get Sarah back. The last moments of Sarah's life play on my mind constantly. I am so disgusted and appalled. It terrifies me that you have such disregard for a person's life. You have taken from me the most precious person. And I can never get her back."

      "tags": "Policing,Human rights,Sarah Everard murder",
      "text": "Women have been asking how they should react if they are stopped by a lone police officer.\nIt comes after Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens was jailed for using his police ID to kidnap, rape and murder 33-year-old Sarah Everard.\nThe laws are different in Scotland and Northern Ireland, so most of this information only applies to England and Wales. \nCampaigners stress the onus should not be on women to keep themselves safe. Instead, they say the focus should be on tackling violence against women and rebuilding trust in police. \nJess Phillips, shadow domestic violence and safeguarding minister, says \"it is not women who need advice\". She says she would have got into Wayne Couzens' car - \"almost anybody would\".\nBut if you are stopped by someone claiming to be an officer and something doesn't feel right, what can you do?\nFormer Met Police chief superintendent Parm Sandhu urges people to \"ask for help if you need it\". She says if you're stopped by someone who is alone, in plain clothes and an unmarked car, phone 999 to check who they are.\nIf you can't phone anyone, and you're scared, scream and draw attention to yourself, she says. If they ask you to get into their car, ask them to call for a marked police vehicle or insist they call another officer, she adds.\nCalling the police station they say they belong to, or 101 to check their warrant card and identity, is a good idea says Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street Chambers.\nHe also suggests calling a family member or friend (or lawyer if you know one) to let them know what is happening.\nThe Met Police says if you are alone with an officer and no others arrive, ask \"searching questions\", such as \"where are your colleagues?\".\nIf they have a radio, ask to hear the voice of the operator and ask them to verify you're with a genuine officer, it says.\nHowever, Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, says it is \"absurd\" for police to advise women to challenge officers - as this fails to recognise the power imbalance in the relationship. \nShe says this will be \"felt most by women from black, minority ethnic and migrant communities who commonly experience over-policing\". \nOfficers always carry identification and can be asked for proof.\nThis is usually a warrant card. These can differ from force to force but typically include the officer's photograph, name, identity number, the name of the force and a security hologram - although they won't necessarily have all of these. \nPolice in Brent, north-west London, shared an image of a Met Police warrant card back in 2018. \nA police community support officer (PCSO) must wear uniform when they stop and question you. \nPolice officers don't always wear uniforms. But they must show you their warrant card, especially if they are in plain clothes.\nIt would be highly unusual for a plain-clothes officer to be working alone, the College of Policing says. If they are, it is standard practice that they should call other officers who should arrive soon afterwards.\nAfter Couzens' sentencing, the Met Police said it would no longer deploy plain-clothes officers on their own - although there would be \"occasions\" when that was not possible.\nA police officer or PCSO can ask questions about who you are, where you are going and what you are doing.\nThis is under \"stop and account\" powers, according to human rights organisation Liberty.\nIn most cases you have the right to refuse to answer and can walk away and this can't be used as the sole reason to search or arrest you.\nHowever, Liberty advises that if officers have reason to believe you're involved in anti-social behaviour, you must give your name and address - as it is a criminal offence not to.\nPolice can also stop you under separate \"stop and search\" powers. These allow officers to search an individual if they have \"reasonable grounds\" to suspect you are carrying illegal drugs, a weapon, stolen property or something which could be used to commit a crime.\nTo arrest you, police need reasonable grounds to suspect you're involved in a crime for which your arrest is necessary. \nIf you're arrested, the officer must: \n\"If someone who says they are a police officer stops you, it can be difficult to know what to do,\" says Adam Wagner.\nIf you are being arrested on your own in a secluded location or at night, you could offer to give the officer your details and ask to attend a police station the next day instead, he suggests.\nOfficers on the streets now almost always have body-worn video cameras, which are used to capture evidence when attending incidents or arresting someone. \nThey act as a safeguard for both the person being stopped and the officer in the event of a dispute. \nOfficers are expected to intervene if they see someone committing an offence or there is another need to protect the public - even when off duty. \nAn officer can exercise most of their powers all the time - and as soon as they do so they are classed as being on duty. \nIf an officer is not wearing uniform they should show their warrant card when they stop and question you.

      "text": "A police boss who said women \"need to be streetwise\" about powers of arrest in the wake of the Sarah Everard case is being urged to resign.\nNorth Yorkshire commissioner Philip Allott sparked fury when he said Ms Everard \"never should have submitted\" to the arrest by her killer.\nA Met Police officer falsely arrested the 33-year-old in order to abduct, rape and murder her.\nLabour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for Mr Allott to quit.\nHe said: \"He should go. I can't think of a more inappropriate thing for a police and crime commissioner to say at any time, but at this time in particular. He should consider his position.\"\nMr Allott has apologised for his remarks and said he wanted to retract his comments.\nDuring the sentencing of Wayne Couzens at the Old Bailey, it emerged he tricked Ms Everard by falsely arresting her for a breach of coronavirus guidelines.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio York earlier, Conservative Mr Allott said women should be aware this was not an indictable offence - one considered serious enough to warrant a prison sentence or crown court hearing.\n\"So women, first of all, need to be streetwise about when they can be arrested and when they can't be arrested. She should never have been arrested and submitted to that,\" he said.\n\"Perhaps women need to consider in terms of the legal process, to just learn a bit about that legal process\".\nThe comments provoked an angry reaction on social media, prompting Mr Allott to reconsider.\nIn an apologetic tweet, he said he realised his remarks were \"insensitive and [I] wish to retract them in full\".\nMP for York Central Rachael Maskell added that Mr Allott's position was \"untenable\".\n\"Women are not feeling safe on our streets and it is for the police, including the police and crime commissioners to make sure we feel safer,\" she said.\nAmong those angered by Mr Allott's comments was campaigner Lucy Arnold, who organised a vigil outside York Minster following the death of Ms Everard, who was originally from York.\n\"I think frankly that was a horrifically offensive thing to say,\" she said.\n\"Does anyone really feel like they can stand up to a police officer? I am very confident I know my rights, I know the law, but no I wouldn't feel confident at all.\"\nThe Everyday Sexism account accused Mr Allott of \"openly blaming Sarah Everard for what happened to her\", and Scotland's First Minister said the comments were \"appalling\".\nNicola Sturgeon tweeted it was not \"up to women to fix this\".\n\"The problem is male violence, not women's 'failure' to find ever more inventive ways to protect ourselves against it. For change to happen, this needs to be accepted by everyone,\" she said.\nLegal commentator David Allen Green added: \"There is not a competent lawyer in the country that would have advised Sarah Everard to resist arrest by a police officer with a warrant card.\"\nIn his interview, Mr Allott was also critical of the Met Police's alleged failure to investigate two indecent exposure incidents linked to Couzens in February, describing it as a red flag for any force.\n\"A murderer typically commits seven crimes before going on to murder, that man we know committed at least two crimes,\" he said.\n\"The police knew, so what should have happened is that it should have been picked up straight away.\"\nThe police watchdog has launched an investigation into its handling of the exposure reports, and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has faced calls to resign.\nScotland Yard has advised people detained by a lone plain-clothes officer to ask \"searching questions\" and to speak to an operator on a police radio to determine if the officer is genuine.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Sexual violence,Spain,Pornography",
      "text": "A Spanish judge has shocked women's rights groups by dismissing a case that involved women being secretly filmed urinating in public and the videos then being posted on porn websites.\nRecordings of some 80 women and girls were made as they urinated in a side street because of a lack of facilities.\nThey were caught by hidden cameras at the A Maruxaina local festival in the north-western town of Cervo.\nIn many cases the footage showed close-ups of the women's genitals and faces.\nIt was uploaded to porn sites, some requiring payment to view. \nOn discovering this, many of those affected took legal action in 2020, calling for the recordings, whose author remains unknown, to be investigated on the grounds that their right to privacy had been violated.  \nA local judge, Pablo Mu\u00f1oz V\u00e1zquez, shelved the case, triggering an appeal led by the Women for Equality Burela (Bumei) association. \nThe same judge has now confirmed his initial decision not to proceed, on the grounds that because the videos were recorded in a public place they cannot be deemed criminal.  \nAccording to court documents, the judge also decided that there was \"no intention to violate the physical or moral resistance\" of the women affected.  \n\"I was just panicking,\" said Jenniffer, who was one of the women filmed during the local festival in 2019.  \nShe remembered when a friend told her that footage of her had been uploaded to a porn site. \"And then when I saw the video I was crying, I was really embarrassed, I didn't know really what to do.\"  \nLike many of those affected, Jenniffer sought therapy afterwards. But the latest judicial ruling has added to the pain.  \n\"It makes me feel so frustrated,\" she said. \"They are basically saying it is OK if someone records you on the street and then they post it on a porn site and they make money from it.\"  \nAna Garc\u00eda, of the Bumei association, warns that a precedent could be set by this case, giving those who make such recordings impunity.  \n\"Just because you're in a public space, that doesn't mean that filming intimate images and then distributing them is not a crime, because this is about fundamental rights,\" she said.  \nThe decision not to continue with the case has provoked protests and an online campaign under the hashtag #XustizaMaruxaina (Justice Maruxaina).  \nThe case has also entered the political arena, with Equality Minister Irene Montero speaking out. \nGender rights have been the subject of fierce debate between left and right in Spain in recent years and this is not the first time a judicial decision has drawn a backlash from women's groups.  \nIn 2018, a court in Pamplona sparked mass protests by deeming an assault on a young woman by five men, nicknamed La Manada (the Wolfpack), sexual abuse rather than rape. \nThe Supreme Court eventually overturned the verdict, finding the men guilty of rape and increasing their jail sentences from nine years to 15 years.  \nThe women affected by the A Maruxaina case are now appealing again, this time before the provincial court in Lugo, in the hope that the case will, finally, be investigated.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nIt's now been several weeks since children in England returned to school after the summer holidays - and the latest data suggests this has been accompanied by a steep rise in Covid infections among those aged 11 to 15. One in every 20 children of secondary school age in England is infected with the virus, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics, which cover the week to 25 September. This is the highest reported rate for this age group - or any other - since the pandemic began. A single vaccine dose is now being offered to all 12 to 17-year-olds across the UK to help keep children in school - although they are at very low risk of serious illness from the virus. \nThere have been promising results from a trial of a pill to treat severe Covid, with interim data suggesting the experimental drug - molnupiravir - cuts the risk of hospital admission by about half. US drug-maker Merck said its results were so positive that outside monitors had asked to stop the trial early and it would apply for emergency use authorisation for the drug in the US in the next two weeks. If authorised by regulators, molnupiravir would be the first oral antiviral medication for Covid-19.\nJD Wetherspoon has reported a record annual loss after lockdowns saw its pubs shut for 19 weeks. The chain posted a \u00a3154.7m loss in the year to 25 July, after a \u00a334.1 million loss the previous year. Wetherspoon's founder and chairman Tim Martin criticised the \"use of lockdowns and draconian restrictions\". But the company suggested there were signs of recovery since restrictions eased, although it is struggling to recruit staff in some areas. \nMore than 50 nations have missed the World Health Organization's target for 10% of their populations to be fully vaccinated against Covid by the end of September. Many are low-income countries, grappling with vaccine supply and health infrastructure issues. Most are in Africa, where the WHO says only 4.4% of people are fully vaccinated. That compares to nearly 66% in the UK, 62% in the EU and 55% in the US. Our Reality Team looks at the challenges of rolling out the vaccine worldwide here. \nA temporary reduction in VAT for hospitality businesses worst hit by the pandemic came to an end today. VAT - the tax paid when buying goods or services - was reduced from 20% to 5% in July 2020 but will now rise to 12.5%, before returning to pre-pandemic levels in April. Rebecca Willers, who runs Shepreth Wildlife Park in Cambridgeshire, says the VAT cut was a \"huge lifeline\" which enabled the venue to cut admission fees to encourage more visitors when it reopened in April. However, she says it will now \"have to bear the brunt\" of the increase, as she doesn't want to put off customers by upping prices over winter.

Over the following weeks of the show they decide whether to continue their relationships.\nIn a statement on Twitter on Thursday, E4 said: \"We're aware it's yesterday's episode of #MAFSUK playing out this evening and apologise. It's all down to our ongoing tech issues which we're working hard on.\"\nChannel 4, Channel 5, the BBC, Paramount Network and 4 Music were among those who were affected by the technical issues last weekend.\nRed Bee Media, which handles playout services and broadcasting technology for a number of channels, blamed an \"activation of the fire suppression systems\" at its broadcast centre in west London.\nThe Times later suggested the issue arose when smoke was detected and the fire suppression system sucked all the oxygen out of the room. That caused a \"sonic wave\" that shut down the transmission servers, the newspaper reported.\nChannel 4 said: \"We continue to experience disruption to our services due to technical issues. We're working hard to resume our normal services and appreciate your continued understanding.\""

      "text": "Daniel Craig's final James Bond film No Time To Die took between \u00a34.5m-\u00a35m on its first day in UK and Irish cinemas, producers have estimated.\nThe film was delayed several times by Covid and the industry is watching closely to see whether it can lift box office takings to pre-pandemic levels.\nThursday's takings are 13% higher than 2015's Spectre but 26% below 2012's Skyfall, Universal Pictures said.\nIt was also the UK's \"widest theatrical release of all time\", they added.\nUniversal said No Time to Die opened in 772 cinemas in the UK and Ireland on Thursday - 25 more than the previous record-holder, Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker, in 2019.\nFilm technology firm Gower Street Analytics predicted it will account for 92% of the total UK and Ireland box office takings in its opening week.\nMore than 30,000 people attended midnight screenings in the UK and Ireland, where the film sold 1.6 million advance tickets for the opening four days, the studio said. This exceeded Spectre's total advance bookings by more than 12% and was in line with Skyfall at the same time.\nScreen International's box office editor Charles Gant said the film's performance had been \"hard to predict\". But the early figures suggest it will be \"a must-see film that connects with all demographics\", which cinemas have lacked since they reopened, he told BBC News.\nGant described that as \"a massive relief for cinemas\", adding that it \"gets customers back into venues\", where they will see trailers and posters for winter releases like Dune, Eternals, West Side Story and Venom: Let There Be Carnage.\nNo Time To Die \"doesn't need to match Spectre and Skyfall\", which both made more than \u00a395m in total at UK and Irish box offices, he said.\n\"It just has to land in the Casino Royale (\u00a356m)/Quantum Of Solace (\u00a351m) lifetime ballpark - and there is now every sign that it will. If it does that, it points the way ahead for the cinema sector, and shows that, post-Covid, we can still have blockbuster hits.\"\nCraig's fifth and final Bond movie was directed by US film-maker Cary Joji Fukunaga and also stars Lea Seydoux, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. It is projected to make $90m (\u00a366.7m) worldwide during its opening weekend.\nMost critics praised the film, with many giving five-star reviews after its premiere at the Royal Albert Hall earlier this week. But some suggested the movie did not quite justify its 163-minute running time.\nAccording to a survey carried out by cinema chain Vue, No Time To Die is the new film release cinemagoers are most excited to see this year. Film fan Steve Williams, who saw the film in London, told the Press Association afterwards it was \"well worth the wait\". \nHe added it was \"definitely a good last film for Daniel Craig\", while another cinema-goer, Harry Wheeler, added: \"It was the best Bond film for a while. I haven't been to the cinema in more than a year and it was good to go back.\"\nThe film opened in South Korea on Wednesday and a day later in the UK, Ireland, Brazil, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. But US audiences must wait until 8 October."

      "text": "President Joe Biden has signed into law a temporary measure to keep the government funded until early December and avoid yet another federal shutdown.\nCongress narrowly passed the bill hours before funding lapsed, which would have forced federal museums, national parks and safety programmes to close.\nThe bill also includes money for hurricane relief and Afghan refugees.\nHowever a separate vote on President Biden's massive $1tn (\u00a3750bn) infrastructure bill was postponed.\nMr Biden, who signed the bill averting a shutdown with just hours to go, said its passage \"reminds us that bipartisan work is possible\".\nThe newly approved funding ensures that federal agencies do not need to close down on Friday and hundreds of thousands of government employees will not have to take unpaid leave.\nOf particular concern, given the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, was the potential hit that health services could take. A plan prepared by the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) found that it may have been forced to send up to 43% of its staff home in the event of a shutdown.\nOn Wednesday night, Republicans and Democrats in the Senate reached a deal to keep the government open until 3 December, through a temporary budget called a continuing resolution.\nThe measure passed the Senate by a vote of 65 to 35 on Thursday, with 15 Republicans voting to support it. In the House of Representatives, the lower chamber, it passed 254 to 175.\nIt comes amid a week jam-packed with other policy hurdles, particularly the delicate negotiations over President Biden's economic agenda.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi initially said she would move forward with a vote on the infrastructure bill late on Thursday - but it was postponed until at least Friday amid sharp differences between the progressive and centrist wings in the Democratic party. \nProgressives have been refusing to support the bill unless agreement is reached on separate, more wide-ranging legislation dealing with climate change and social welfare.\nParty leaders insisted that the postponement was a temporary setback.\nThe infrastructure bill would provide $550bn for roads, bridges, internet and other domestic priorities.\nCongress also faces another pressing deadline: the US government is set to hit its borrowing limit within weeks.\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said this week the US will reach its debt ceiling - the limit on how much the US government can borrow - by October 18.\nIt has prompted dire warnings of a catastrophic default on the national debt that could reverberate through the US and the global economy.\nRaising the debt limit will allow the US government to pay its existing obligations. Defaulting, though unlikely, could trigger an economic downturn and cause millions of Americans who rely on paycheques or aid from the federal government to go without.\nThe House, which is controlled by the Democrats, had already voted last week to pass a dual measure that would keep the government open and suspend the debt ceiling.\nBut Republicans in the Senate blocked the bill from advancing, citing the Biden administration's plans to pass trillions of dollars in new spending as a reason not to raise the debt ceiling."

      "text": "India has withdrawn a 10-day quarantine for UK nationals arriving in the country. \nBritish nationals travelling to India will have to undergo home quarantine for seven days and take Covid-19 tests.\nThis came days after UK eased similar travel restrictions for fully vaccinated Indians.\nThere have been tensions between the two countries over the Indian-made version of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nAccording to a release by the Indian government, earlier guidelines dated 17 February will now be applicable to all travellers arriving in the country from the United Kingdom. \nThe UK had earlier refused to recognise India's Covishield vaccine even though it is identical to the doses given to millions of Britons. \nSo, fully vaccinated Indian travellers had to isolate for 10 days and take Covid-19 tests - at their own expense - before they were allowed to leave quarantine. \nOfficials in the UK designated Covishield an approved jab last month after a major backlash in India against what many saw as a discriminatory rule. But it did not add India to the exempt-from-quarantine-list and the restrictions continued. \nThis led to more backlash from Delhi, which imposed a mandatory quarantine for British nationals arriving in India. Finally on 8 October, UK added India to the exempt-from-quarantine list, ending the mandatory self-isolation. \nCovishield is India's primary vaccine, with more than 720 million doses given out so far. It is the same as the AstraZeneca jab used in the UK vaccine rollout. "

      "tags": "Sarah Everard murder,Clapham,Deal,Ashford",
      "text": "A Met Police officer who murdered Sarah Everard after kidnapping her under the guise of an arrest has been sentenced to a whole-life prison term.\nWayne Couzens abducted the 33-year-old as she walked home from a friend's house in south London on 3 March.\nDuring the sentencing of Couzens, the judge said the case was \"devastating, tragic and wholly brutal\".\nMs Everard's family said they were relieved by the fact that Couzens would die in jail.\nAddressing reporters outside the Old Bailey following his sentencing, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said she recognised that a \"precious bond of trust\" had been damaged by Couzens, who had \"brought shame on the Met\". \nDescribing him as a \"coward\", she said his crimes were \"a gross betrayal of everything policing stands for\", adding: \"I am so sorry.\"\nAn ongoing Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) review of how Couzens became a Met officer has found that vetting procedures missed that two of his previous cars had been linked to allegations of indecent exposure.\nSpeaking to the London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee earlier on Thursday, two senior Met officers said they were not aware of rumours that Couzens was nicknamed \"the rapist\" by colleagues.\nHowever, HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Tom Winsor said the nickname was known by some officers. \nSir Tom, who in his role has responsibility for the inspection of police forces, told BBC Radio 4's the World at One: \"Yes, I did know that. And he also had allegedly a reputation in terms of drug abuse, extreme pornography and other offences of this kind.\"\nWhat Couzens' colleagues knew or suspected about him remains the subject of the IOPC investigation. \nWhen sentencing Couzens earlier on Thursday, Lord Justice Fulford described the circumstances of the kidnap, rape and murder as \"grotesque\", telling him he had \"betrayed\" his family. He said Ms Everard was \"an intelligent, resourceful, talented and much-loved young woman, still in the early years of her life\".\nThe judge told 48-year-old Couzens: \"Notwithstanding your guilty pleas, therefore, I have seen no evidence of genuine contrition on your part, as opposed to evident self-pity and attempts by you to avoid or minimise the proper consequences of what you have done.\"\nHe said the seriousness of the case was so \"exceptionally high\" that it warranted a whole-life order.  \n\"The misuse of a police officer's role such as occurred in this case in order to kidnap, rape and murder a lone victim is of equal seriousness as a murder for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause,\" he told the Old Bailey. \"All of these situations attack different aspects of the fundamental underpinnings of our democratic way of life.\" \nReacting to the sentencing, Ms Everard's family said they were pleased with the full-life term, adding that although \"nothing can make things better, nothing can bring Sarah back... knowing he will be imprisoned forever brings some relief.\n\"Sarah lost her life needlessly and cruelly and all the years of life she had yet to enjoy were stolen from her. Wayne Couzens held a position of trust as a police officer and we are outraged and sickened that he abused this trust in order to lure Sarah to her death. The world is a safer place with him imprisoned.\n\"It is almost seven months since Sarah died and the pain of losing her is overwhelming. We miss her all the time. We hold her safe in our hearts.\"\nLucy Manning, BBC special correspondent, from the Old Bailey:\nAs Wayne Couzens was told he would spend the rest of his life in prison, he kept his head down as he has throughout his time in the dock. He was shaking as he was sentenced.\nThe Everard family looked on. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick was in court to hear the sentence. Her officer a convicted murderer and rapist.\nMr Justice Fulford told Couzens his offences were \"warped, selfish and brutal\". The judge said Sarah \"was simply walking home\".\nAfter Couzens was sentenced, police officers who investigated the murder hugged the Everard family. But as her parents and sister said yesterday, all they want is Sarah back and no punishment will ever compare to the pain and torture Couzens had inflicted on them.\nLord Justice Fulford paid tribute to the dignity of Ms Everard's family, whose statements in court on Wednesday \"revealed the human impact\" of Couzens' offending, which he said \"was both sexual and homicidal\".\nThe judge added that Couzens had eroded public confidence in the police in England and Wales.\nIn a letter she wrote before Dame Cressida spoke to reporters, senior Labour MP Harriet Harman called on the Met Police commissioner to resign. Ms Harman said women's confidence in the police \"will have been shattered\" and it would be impossible for Dame Cressida to oversee the changes needed to rebuild trust. \nHome Secretary Priti Patel said there were \"serious questions\" for the Metropolitan Police regarding the Couzens case, adding that the force \"will be held to account\". \nShe described the crimes as \"sickening\" and said it was right that this \"monster\" had been given a whole-life sentence.\nWhen Parliament abolished the death penalty more than 50 years ago, it promised the British people that the worst of the very worst offenders would be locked up in jail for the rest of their lives. \nSince then a series of complex rules for judges has evolved in order for a \"whole-life order\" (WLO) to be imposed.\nThe law says a WLO should \"normally\" only be considered if an offender has murdered more than once, killed a police or prison officer, abducted and sadistically killed a child, or where the motive was ideological. \nWhile MPs did not envisage such a serious crime as this when they wrote the law, they said judges could impose a WLO in other unthinkable cases where the seriousness of the crime was exceptionally high. \nLord Justice Fulford concluded the misuse of a constable's role to deceive, kidnap, rape and murder Sarah Everard was as bad as terrorism. It was not only a crime of appalling and prolonged suffering for the victim, but it undermined trust in the police - part of the bedrock of a safe society. \nAnd that is why the law allowed the judge to order Couzens will never be released.\nThe Old Bailey sentencing hearing had been told how Couzens used his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card and handcuffs to abduct Ms Everard as she walked from Clapham to her Brixton home on the night of 3 March.\nThe firearms-trained parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer, who had clocked off from a 12-hour shift at the US Embassy that morning, drove to a secluded rural area near Dover where he raped Ms Everard.\nShe had been strangled with Couzens' police-issue belt by 02:30 GMT the following morning.\nCouzens, who was married with two children, then burned the marketing executive's body in a refrigerator in an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, near Ashford, before dumping the remains in a nearby pond.\nOn 9 March, he was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, after police connected him to the hire car he used to abduct Ms Everard. Her remains were found by police dogs the next day.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"sickened\" by the details that had emerged during sentencing.\n\"Our police are there to protect us - and I know that officers will share in our shock and devastation at the total betrayal of this duty. People must be able to walk on our streets without fear of harm and with full confidence that the police are there to keep them safe.\"\nJohn Apter, national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said Couzens was \"an absolute disgrace to the police service\" and he was \"ashamed he was ever a police officer\".\n\"I am proud to carry a warrant card, but this vile individual's abuse of that authority has cast a shadow on all those who work within policing. He has brought disgrace to our uniform.\n\"The way he took advantage of Sarah's trust makes me feel sick to the stomach.\""

It had lowered the prices of some items on its food menu and soft drinks as a result.\nA rise in VAT rates from 5% to 12.5% takes effect on Friday and has been criticised as \"badly timed\" for business.\n\"If the chancellor decides to make these VAT reductions permanent, the company intends to retain lower prices indefinitely,\" Wetherspoon said.\nJulie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said: \"JD Wetherspoon finally began recovering from the turmoil the pandemic and Covid restrictions had put it through, to be greeted with a supply chain hangover and staff shortages.\"\nShe pointed out that affordability had always been the brand's selling point, but that the chain might have to rethink that strategy as supply chain issues and rising costs hit.\n\"The board may need a strong drink to warm them up for another tough year ahead.\""

      "tags": "NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "An experimental drug for severe Covid cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half, interim clinical trial results suggest. \nThe tablet - molnupiravir - was given twice a day to patients recently diagnosed with the disease. \nUS drug-maker Merck said its results were so positive that outside monitors had asked to stop the trial early.\nIt said it would apply for emergency use authorisation for the drug in the US in the next two weeks.\nDr Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, said the results were \"very good news\", but urged caution until the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had reviewed the data.\nIf authorised by regulators, molnupiravir would be the first oral antiviral medication for Covid-19. \nThe pill, which was originally developed to treat influenza, is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus, preventing it from spreading in the body.\nAn analysis of 775 patients in the study found:\nThe data was published in a press release and has not yet been peer-reviewed. \nUnlike most Covid vaccines, which target the spike protein on the outside of the virus, the treatment works by targeting an enzyme the virus uses to make copies of itself. \nMerck, known by the name MSD in the UK, said that should make it equally effective against new variants of the virus as it evolves in the future. \nDaria Hazuda, Merck's vice-president of infectious disease discovery, told the BBC: \"An antiviral treatment for people who are not vaccinated, or who are less responsive to immunity from vaccines, is a very important tool in helping to end this pandemic.\" \nTrial results suggest molnupiravir needs to be taken early after symptoms develop to have an effect. An earlier study in patients who had already been hospitalised with severe Covid was halted after disappointing results.\nMerck is the first company to report trial results of a pill to treat Covid, but other companies are working on similar treatments. Its US rival Pfizer has recently started late-stage trials of two different antiviral tablets, while Swiss company Roche is working on a similar medication.\nMerck has said it expects to produce 10 million courses of molnupiravir by the end of 2021. The US government has already agreed to buy $1.2bn (\u00a3885m) worth of the drug if it receives approval from the regulatory body, the FDA. \nThe company said it is in ongoing discussion with other countries, including the UK, and has also agreed licensing deals with a number of generic manufacturers to supply the treatment to low and middle-income countries.\nProf Penny Ward, from King's College London, who was not involved in the trial, said: \"It is greatly hoped that the antiviral task force has, like the vaccines taskforce, pre-ordered courses of this medication.\n\"[This is] so that the UK can, at last, properly manage this condition by treating vaccine breakthrough disease, and relieve pressure on the NHS during the forthcoming winter.\"\nProf Peter Horby, an expert in infectious diseases at University of Oxford, said: \"A safe, affordable, and effective oral antiviral would be a huge advance in the fight against Covid. \n\"Molnupiravir has looked promising in the lab, but the real test was whether it shows benefit in patients. Many drugs fail at this point, so these interim results are very encouraging.\""

      "text": "\"In two days I would get through a litre of vodka and four bottles of wine. Easily.\n\"I knew it was wrong. I knew it was too much.\"\nBefore the pandemic Kathleen Edge from Newport, south Wales, had what she described as a healthy relationship with alcohol.\nLike many people she started to drink a bit more when the stress, strain and boredom of lockdown started to take hold. And that relationship turned sour.\n\"It got to the middle of December and my friend came over to bring a delivery up, and it had got to the point where I could not walk any more\u2026 if I wanted to get between the bed and the sofa it was virtually crawling,\" she says.\n\"And I knew something was wrong. I said to him 'please just take the booze away - it is killing me'.\n\"I probably owe him my life. He told me I looked dreadful and that he would not leave until I had got help. Until I had got an ambulance.\"\nIt was at this point the seriousness of the situation really started to hit.\n\"They had to carry me out. It was very humiliating,\" Kathleen says.\n\"And I'm thinking 'you've got yourself into this position, there is Covid going on and you're calling an ambulance and this is really selfish'. But I needed an ambulance.\"\nKathleen went to the new Grange University Hospital near Cwmbran where she says she was lucky to see the liver specialist the next day.\n\"He said to me 'I think you have something to tell me. You need to say it out loud'.\n\"And I looked at him and said 'I'm an alcoholic'. That was the first time I had said it out loud and it was very freeing.\"\nThere are fears there could be more people out there like Kathleen who have not yet come forward to get help.\nFigures from the Kaleidoscope Project, which works on drug and alcohol abuse, suggest an eight percentage point drop year-on-year in the number of people who have problems with alcohol being referred by doctors or other health professionals.\nIn the year to April 2021, 293 people were referred compared with 467 the year before. Self-referrals are down by more than four percentage points.\nSupport services are now waiting to see what happens - hoping for the best and prepared for the worst.\nRondine Molinaro from the Gwent Drug and Alcohol Service draws parallels between the pandemic and another cataclysmic event, which surprisingly, perhaps does give some hope.\n\"If you look at the example of American soldiers returning from the Vietnam War in the 1970s, all the drugs services in the US were set up for and prepared for these large cohorts of servicemen who had become addicted to opiates and heroin in Vietnam, continuing their dependency on their return,\" she said.\n\"But that did not happen. I think 20% of the American troops were addicted to heroin in Vietnam, but as soon as they came back and their environment changed and those stresses had disappeared only 1% of those soldiers continued with a heroin dependency.\n\"Hopefully that's the same pattern that we will see, but we are prepared and we are waiting to see what happens over the next 12 months.\"\nThe service has also noticed a subtle change in the type of person seeking support during the Covid crisis.\nRondine explained: \"We are definitely seeing more professional people coming in - they have jobs and they have incomes.\n\"Our alcohol liaison officer interviewed two gentlemen, who because of the pandemic had been put on furlough. They had income coming in, but no productive activity and no work to go to. \n\"They started to drink and became dependent on alcohol but did not know they were dependent on alcohol and actually ended up in A&E.\"\nThe Welsh government says it invests \u00a355m every year on substance misuse.\nIn 2020-21 a further \u00a34.8m was also made available to support the response to Covid.\nKathleen is now living with the long-term effects that alcohol has had on her body.\nThe damage to her liver caused severe swelling to her legs and she now has to walk with a stick.\nBut she says she is determined to seize her second chance.\n\"Alcohol is a great deceiver,\" she said.\n\"It is your best friend, it makes you feel fantastic, it makes you feel good, but it is almost as if alcoholism is grooming you and it can blow up in your face.\n\"It is all in my hands now. I make the decisions. I have been incredibly lucky. I want to get to the point where we do not talk about it any more. I don't drink and that's that.\"\nThe BBC Action Line has details of organisations that may be able to offer support for addiction\nListen live to Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales and BBC Sounds from 17:00 BST to 18:30"

      "text": "In the early days of the pandemic more than half of elderly hospital patients discharged to nearly 200 Scottish care homes had not been tested for Covid.\nData obtained by the BBC from Public Health Scotland (PHS) provides the clearest picture yet on which homes took in untested and positive patients.\nA lawyer acting for bereaved families at an upcoming inquiry called the data \"explosive evidence\".\nAamer Anwar claimed it was proof that people's lives had been put at risk.\nThe figures, which were released 11 months after BBC Scotland had asked for them, focus on hospital discharges between March and May 2020 - which was the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe PHS data, released under freedom of information laws, appears in this interactive dashboard and shows every hospital discharge by individual care home in Scotland.\nIt reveals what proportion of people discharged were untested or positive and what proportion of beds might have been occupied by discharged patients.\nAlthough the data cannot be used to link discharges to outbreaks or deaths in any given home, solicitor Mr Anwar believed it proved that lives had been put at risk.\nHe is acting on behalf of members of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice and told BBC Scotland: \"The data supports what many bereaved families have always suspected, that elderly patients were discharged without any regard for a duty of care owed to them, or to residents and care home staff.\n\"Many of the grieving families I represent describe what took place in our care homes as a massacre that could have been avoided, had a simple test taken place prior to discharge.\n\"The data makes for explosive evidence for a pending Scottish Covid-19 Public Inquiry.\"\nAt the start of the pandemic, thousands of elderly people who no longer needed to be in hospital were discharged into many of Scotland's 1,000 plus care homes.\nThis was at a time when the Scottish government was being advised that spare capacity was needed in wards to accommodate coronavirus cases. It was also before testing was commonplace.\nOnly on 21 April 2020 it became mandatory for hospital patients to have two negative Covid tests before being discharged, and for all new care home admissions to be isolated for 14 days.\nBetween 1 March and 21 April 2020 in Scotland, 82% of the 3,595 discharged patients were not tested.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon later called the way patients were discharged a \"mistake\". \nBut solicitor Anwar said: \"It's all very well to say with the benefit of hindsight a mistake was made, but we knew at the time elderly people were dying at a rapid rate.\nA recent PHS report concluded it \"cannot rule out\" a link between patients being discharged from hospital and Covid outbreaks in care homes.\nA Scottish government spokesman said the PHS analysis \"found care home size is very strongly related to outbreaks and concluded there was no clear statistical evidence that hospital discharges were associated with care home outbreaks.\"\nHe added: \"These latest figures do not change that conclusion. Decisions to discharge patients are not made by ministers, but health and social care professionals, alongside the patient and their family.\"\nScottish Conservative social care spokesman Craig Hoy said the figures showed that \"critical errors\" by the Scottish government meant it had \"completely failed to protect our elderly and vulnerable residents in care facilities, which has resulted in thousands of families grieving the loss of a loved one.\"\nThis interactive dashboard reveals for the first time the 843 homes into which each of the 5,198 patients was discharged to between 1 March and 31 May 2020.\nThe data also shows the 752 homes which took in untested patients between 1 March and 21 April 2020.\nAnd the figures reveal the 75 homes which took in at least one patient who had tested positive - and who had never received a negative test prior to discharge.\nThe data also revealed:\nAn Advinia spokesperson said: \"In the earliest days of the crisis, when, by comparison, little was known about the virus, particularly the asymptomatic nature of transmission, our care homes found themselves on the frontline.\"\nThey added that care was given in accordance to guidelines and all of its homes were are \"prepared as they could been at the time the pandemic started\".\nA statement from Barchester Healthcare said that given ongoing investigations by Police Scotland and the Crown Office it was not appropriate to comment on specific cases.\nIt added: \"The beginning of the pandemic was a very difficult time for everyone with so little known about the virus, testing, or airborne and asymptomatic transmission.\"\nOakminster Healthcare and Methodist Homes Association has been contacted for a comment.\nJo Barrie said there was a \"lot of pressure\" to get her mother into a care home.\nShe recalled: \"I was getting almost daily calls from a social worker just push, push, pushing all the time. They wanted her out of that hospital as soon as.\"\nNancy Lovering, was admitted to Perth Royal Infirmary in late February 2020 with a chest infection and after several weeks the 88-year-old was deemed well enough to be discharged.\nDue to her mother's Alzheimer's and increasing frailty, a social worker advised the family to start looking for care homes.\nThey initially thought they had time to find the right accommodation, but Jo was contacted by a senior social worker who told her she just needed to \"find somewhere that's got a space\". \"I ended that phone call in tears,\" she said.\nNancy was discharged into the Ancaster House Care Home in mid-March, but she did not take a test. Jo says that after a quarantine period of 14 days, and being symptom free, her mother was allowed into the residence's public areas. \nFour days later Jo says her family were emailed by the home to inform them that three residents had been diagnosed with coronavirus. Nancy then became ill and was admitted back into hospital where she died six days later from coronavirus.\nThe new data reveals that 13 people were discharged to Ancaster House between March and May 2020. At least one patient was untested, and at least one other was discharged, despite testing positive for coronavirus.\nJo said: \"I keep replaying back in my mind the day I dropped her off at the home. I feel as if I gave her a death sentence.\"\nShe says thousands of families still have unanswered questions.\nA statement by the home said: \"We would like to share our deepest sympathies with everyone who has lost a loved one to Covid-19 and send our condolences again to Nancy's family. Since the start of the pandemic, we have rigorously adhered to all guidance provided by the Scottish government, Health Protection Scotland and our local authority.\"\nNHS Tayside, the health board which covers Perth Royal Infirmary, from where Nancy was discharged, said that from early April 2020 patients leaving hospital and going into care homes were tested.\nA spokesperson added: \"The decision to transfer a patient from hospital to a care home is always based on clinical judgement and is undertaken in discussion with the family and a multi-disciplinary team which includes doctors, nurses and other health and care staff, including staff at the care home.\"\nThe Scottish government confirmed last month that Scotland was to hold a public inquiry into the handling of the Covid pandemic by the end of the year and would scrutinise decisions that were taken over the course of the crisis.\nThe Scottish inquiry will investigate \"events causing public concern\", including the high number of deaths in care homes, and will examine the explanations of the decisions that were taken and the causes of \"anything which may not have gone as expected\".\nMr Anwar said: \"We aim to hold to account those officials in hospitals who took the decision to discharge without tests, especially at a time when our hospitals were in complete shutdown, fearful of spreading the virus.\""

We are going to have to put prices up.\" \nChancellor Rishi Sunak said the 5% rate was designed to \"get the sectors moving and to protect jobs\". \nThe hospitality and tourism sectors have been hit hard by the pandemic, with many venues closed altogether during lockdowns, and then catering to limited numbers due to social distancing measures. Now staff shortages are preventing some making the most of the recovery.\nDavid Moore, the founder of Michelin-star restaurant Pied \u00e0 Terre, said he had already told one customer who had a \u00a395 voucher for a 10-course menu, that their meal would now cost \u00a3105.\nHe said the government \"could not have picked a worse time\" to implement the VAT increase, with his business having to cope with rising import, energy and staffing costs.\n\"It just does not feel like life is back to anywhere near like normal,\" he added. \n\"We just have so many price rises across the board. The utilities are horrendous. The VAT [rise] is not something I can absorb. Every single supplier has increased prices.\n\"It's not just vegetables, or just meat, everything is more expensive than it was two years ago.\"\nHis restaurant was also currently \"massively understaffed\" he said, sometimes meaning table numbers had to be reduced at peak times.\nFor Sue Whiston, finance and operations director at Kuula Poke, a Hawaiian restaurant in Birmingham, the VAT increase was \"premature\". She believes the 5% rate should have been extended for another six months.\nShe said shipping costs to source Kuula Poke's produce, from countries such as Japan, China and Thailand, had \"shot through the roof\".\n\"Mango is something that we buy in hundreds of kilograms at a time, (it) has suddenly overnight increased by 20%,\" she said. \"We have had problems with food availability.\n\"Only this week along our main Japanese wholesaler has turned around and said to us they can't make any deliveries to us this week because of the shortage of diesel fuel.\n\"So right now we are  in this perfect storm of inflationary pressure and VAT is about to go up.\nShe expects prices for diners to rise across the sector.\nRob Pitcher, the chief executive of Revolution, predicts there will be further price increases next spring when the VAT rate increases to 20%.\nThe boss of the bar chain, which has 66 venues and employs about 3,000 staff, said businesses could not afford to take on the extra cost, and so it would be passed on to the customer.\n\"The consumer is going to end up paying twice,\" he said.\nTrade bodies, including UK Hospitality, the British Beer and Pub Association, and Tourism Alliance have called on the government to make the 12.5% VAT rate permanent, rather than increasing the rate again in the spring, to safeguard the future of businesses and protect jobs.\nIn a joint statement, they said returning VAT back to 20% would have \"serious consequences\", with six in 10 businesses noting in a survey that it would \"likely lead to cutbacks and job losses\".\nKate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said keeping the VAT rate at 12.5% would be the \"most effective\" move by the government to \"secure a more rapid recovery and rebuild resilience faster\".\nBut a Treasury spokesman said the government had \"always been clear\" that lower VAT rates were a \"temporary measure to support businesses as they recover from the pandemic\".\n\"The hospitality sector has benefited from extensive support throughout the pandemic through our \u00a3400bn Plan for Jobs, with the furlough scheme, grants, tax cuts and deferrals,\" he added."

      "tags": "Companies,Media,United States",
      "text": "US media firm Ozy Media has announced that it is to close down amid a growing row over its business practices.\n\"It is.. with the heaviest of hearts that we must announce today that we are closing Ozy's doors\", the company said in a statement.\nIt follows reports that Ozy's chief operating officer deceived potential investors during a conference call and is now being investigated by the FBI. \nSome major advertisers subsequently cut ties with the firm. \nOzy's chairman Marc Lasry and ex-BBC journalist Katty Kay have also quit. \nIn another twist, Sharon Osborne, the wife of rock star Ozzy Osbourne, alleged the firm's chief executive, Carlos Watson, falsely claimed the couple had invested in the business. \nMr Watson made the claims in a TV interview with broadcaster CNBC in 2019 after settling a trademark dispute with the couple. \nMs Osbourne told CNBC on Thursday: \"This guy is the biggest shyster I have ever seen in my life.\"\nNeither Mr Watson nor Ozy Media has commented publicly on the claims. \nThese accusations are outrageous, almost unbelievable - part of a toxic culture of corporate behaviour that exists in parts of Silicon Valley. \nIt is common here to say your company is bigger, more innovative, more successful, more connected, than it really is.  It's seen as \"hustle\", or \"hype\". \nHowever, \"fake it till you make it\" - as it's sometimes referred to - has led to some of the biggest scandals in Silicon Valley history. \nTheranos' CEO and founder is currently on trial in San Jose - accused of a spectacular fraud involving blood testing. \nSelling a dream that will one day be realised is what most companies do. It's why we have computers and smartphones. But there are countless examples of companies going too far. \nSome of the things Ozy Media has been accused of are actually pretty common in Silicon Valley,\nOverstating how popular your content is a classic of the genre - something numerous companies have been accused of. \nBut there are other accusations here that are simply astonishing - that if true may well lead to legal action.\nIt's the kind of story that will deeply worry investors, who are in a constant battle to separate the frauds from the visionaries.\nOzy Media, which was launched in California in 2013, produces left-leaning podcasts, television series and events, and has won an Emmy for its work.\nLast weekend, the New York Times reported that its co-founder and chief operating officer, Samir Rao, impersonated a senior leader at YouTube during a conference call with Goldman Sachs in February. At that point the investment bank was considering making a $40m investment in the media company.\nMr Rao reportedly claimed that Ozy's videos were highly popular on YouTube.\nAccording to the Times, the investors realised something was wrong and did not go through with the deal. Mr Watson has since apologised and said Mr Rao was suffering a \"mental health crisis\" at the time.  \nYet amid growing scrutiny, Ozy this week said it had begun an internal investigation and Mr Rao had taken a leave of absence.\nOn Thursday, Mr Lasry, who owns the NBA basketball team the Milwaukee Bucks, stepped down after only three weeks as chairman.\nIn a statement he said: \"I believe that going forward Ozy requires experience in areas like crisis management and investigations, where I do not have particular expertise.\"\nHe added that he remains an investor in Ozy Media.\nThe same day, major advertisers were reported to be pulling their ad campaigns with Ozy.\nTarget, Goldman Sachs and AirBnB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Ford said \"We are pausing our advertising while Ozy Media addresses their current business challenges\" and US banking services firm Ally Financial said its relationship with Ozy was on hold \"in light of recent developments\". \nOn Wednesday, Ms Kay announced she had \"no choice\" but to cut ties, calling the New York Times' allegations \"deeply troubling\". The veteran broadcaster joined Ozy in June after more than three decades at the BBC. \nOn Friday, the Times published fresh claims about Ozy made by a former producer, Brad Bessey.\nMr Bessey, who was hired this summer to produce a talk show hosted by Carlos Watson, was reportedly told from the start it would appear in a prime time slot on the US cable network A&E. \nYet, he later found out A&E had rejected the show before it began taping, the Times said. Mr Bessey reportedly quit the firm, accusing Mr Watson and Mr Rao of playing \"a dangerous game with the truth\".\nIn the end \"The Carlos Watson Show\" show appeared on Ozy's own website and YouTube. \nThe BBC has contacted Ozy Media for comment."

      "tags": "Elizabeth Truss,Rishi Sunak,UK aid",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak is being accused of attempting to mount a \"stealth raid\" on Britain's foreign aid spending. \nDevelopment charities say the Treasury is hoping to use \"accounting tricks\" in this month's Spending Review to squeeze the aid budget by billions of pounds. \nThey fear new items will be designated as \"overseas development assistance\" in a way that would cut the amount spent directly on humanitarian aid. \nThe Treasury said it would continue to protect the world's poorest people.\nBut it would not speculate on future spending commitments ahead of a fiscal event.\nAny rebadging of overseas assistance would be seen by some as an attempt by Mr Sunak to seize further control of the aid budget while new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is finding her feet. \nBut Foreign Office sources said Ms Truss - as a former chief secretary - was familiar with how the Treasury worked and it would be wrong to suggest she was unaware of what was going on.\nThe government is already cutting aid spending by reducing the target of what must be allocated to overseas assistance from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%. \nThat means a reduction this year of about \u00a34bn, leaving the total amount being spent on aid at roughly \u00a310bn. \nThere are strict international rules about what counts as aid and charities fear the Treasury is looking at options that would effectively break the spirit of these rules.\nThey say officials want the cancellation of a multi-million-pound debt owed by Sudan to the UK to count as official aid, even though the money was effectively written off years ago. \nThey say the Treasury wants some foreign currency handouts from the International Monetary Fund - known as Special Drawing Rights - to count as aid. These complex financial mechanisms are designed to help developing countries cope with Covid. But even though the money comes from the IMF and not UK coffers, officials want 30% to count towards the 0.5% target.\nThe Treasury is also understood to want to designate the cost of giving Covid vaccines to developing countries as official aid. This could amount to as much as \u00a31bn. \nSome analysts say the Treasury is additionally considering switching large chunks of aid spending from so-called \"resource\" budgets to \"capital\" budgets, an accounting change that would make it harder for the Foreign Office to spend aid on what it wants. \nRanil Dissanayake, policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development think tank, said all these changes - if made together - could potentially reduce the FCDO's discretionary aid budget from \u00a38bn to as little as \u00a32bn.\n\"That would amount to a complete gutting of the UK's status as a major bilateral development presence, essentially depriving [the Foreign Secretary] of one of its most potent weapons almost immediately after she assumes the brief,\" he said. \"The UK's status as a serious bilateral donor would be under existential threat.\" \nHe added: \"Unless Liz Truss manages to stop the chancellor from bullying her department out of its spending power, the UK will become a near non-entity as a bilateral development actor as early as next year.\"\nOne source in the aid sector said: \"Rishi is trying to cut Liz Truss off at the knees before she's got her legs under the table.\"\nRomilly Greenhill, UK Director of ONE, the global campaign against poverty, said: \"It's incredibly worrying that UK aid looks set to be cut again, through accounting trickery by the Treasury. \n\"The chancellor looks set to count the sharing of surplus vaccine doses, a new injection of cost-free foreign exchange reserves and the cancellation of debts that haven't been repaid for decades as part of the aid budget. If these areas are included under the new 0.5% pledge, it will further squeeze funding to tackle poverty, conflict and climate, hurting people both in the UK and around the world. \nShe added: \"What's worse is that it's happening by stealth. The Treasury is combing the aid rules for loopholes and ambiguities to save money on technicalities. It will mean death by a thousand cuts for UK aid.\"\nAbigael Baldoumas, policy and advocacy manager at the international development network BOND, said: \"We are deeply concerned about a further assault on the aid budget. There is a real risk that the Treasury will use accounting tricks to reduce the amount of aid the Foreign Office can spend in ways that make a real difference to the lives of people living in poor and middle-income countries.\"\nShe added: \"Special drawing rights were issued to put more money in the hands of low and middle-income countries to tackle the devastating impact of the pandemic, not so that the Treasury could use them to replace of overseas development assistance.\nMeanwhile, Sarah Champion, International Development committee chair, said: \"The chancellor may think he's clever by playing these financial sleight of hand games, but it's not just the poorest in the world that suffer, it's the UK's international reputation.\"\nA Treasury spokeswoman said: \"We will continue to protect the world's poorest. The UK is one of the highest donors in the G7 and this year we will spend at least \u00a310bn on overseas aid. We do not speculate on future tax and spending commitments ahead of fiscal events.\" \nThe Treasury said the UK would continue to \"score\" overseas development assistance \"fully guided by and in accordance with\" the rules laid down by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. \nIt also emphasised the UK's aid spending was \"considerably more\" than the 29 countries on the OECD's development assistance committee."

He described the proposed figure of $3.5tn as \"fiscal insanity\". \nSenator Bernie Sanders, a leading liberal, tweeted on Friday that \"the fate of the planet\" rested on the $3.5tn bill.\n\"Without a strong reconciliation bill there will be no serious effort to cut carbon emissions and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel,\" he said. \nHe added: \"There can be no infrastructure bill without a strong reconciliation bill.\"\nMr Biden's party has the thinnest of majorities in both the House and Senate, and is eager to push through its signature policies before next year's congressional elections, when the Republicans will attempt to regain control.  \nOn Thursday Congress did pass a temporary measure to keep the federal government funded until early December.\nFederal museums, national parks and safety programmes would have had to close without the funding, which also includes hurricane relief and help for Afghan refugees."

      "tags": "Sarah Everard murder,Deal,Metropolitan Police Service,Brixton",
      "text": "The murder of Sarah Everard sparked a national outcry, spurring women to share their experiences of feeling unsafe on the streets. Many included a sense of the teller lining themselves up shoulder-to-shoulder with her: \"She was the same age as me\", \"I used to live near her\", \"I've walked the same route\".\nMs Everard didn't set herself up to be such an everywoman, a symbol of longstanding - and ongoing - violence against women. She had no choice in her name becoming a battle cry for change. \nThe private, excoriating grief of friends and family seems to have been subsumed by the wider - albeit important and valid - reactions of protest and polemic, marches and mass mourning. \nSarah Everard was a daughter, sister, friend and colleague. According to those in the know, she was dreadful at karaoke but \"brilliant\" at everything else. \nThere were just 38 minutes between the time this \"clever, articulate and caring\" woman left a friend's house and the last time she was seen. \nThe final image of her, captured by a bus camera, also showed a white Vauxhall Astra with its hazard lights on and both front doors open.\nThe car had been hired specifically for kidnapping a woman. It was returned to the rental company the following morning, having served its purpose.\nSarah Everard was dead.\nHer body was found a week later in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, where her killer owned a patch of land. \nA complete stranger, a police officer, had kidnapped, raped and murdered her.\nHe knew what he was doing, this man who killed her for his own gratuitous wants.\nOutwardly, he had what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary life. A responsible job. Wife and children. A house in Deal in Kent he shared with them.\nBut the 48-year-old officer's fa\u00e7ade hid the actions of a sexual predator who had been planning the crime - although not yet selecting his victim - in chilling detail. On 28 February, three days before he killed Ms Everard, he had been accused of indecent exposure in a branch of McDonald's. It wasn't the first time.\nThe very same day, he bought a roll of self-adhesive plastic described as \"carpet protector\" and booked the hire car he would use to abduct the marketing executive. He arranged for time off work.\nAfter he killed Ms Everard, he bought builders' bags, a tarpaulin and a cargo net, wiped his phone and concocted an implausible and time-wasting web of lies about his involvement in her disappearance.\nThat they won't have to sit through the grisly evidence and twisted lies of a trial must be scant relief to her loved ones.\nMs Everard should have had a brilliant future, a lot to look forward to. She had bounced back after a relationship breakup and was seeing someone new. She had just started a new job. \nShe, her boyfriend Josh Lowth and four others were planning a trip to Ibiza at the end of summer.\nOne of Ms Everard's friends said: \"What I loved about her was that she had depth. She wasn't a vapid, nice person. She had opinions, sarcasm and wanted things to be better. \n\"We could trust her to fight the good fight.\"\nMs Everard grew up in York, with an older brother and sister. Her father was a professor and her mother a charity worker.\nDescribed by her family as \"bright and beautiful\", \"kind and thoughtful\", \"caring and dependable\", she \"always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour. She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all\".\nRose Woollard has been a close friend of Ms Everard since university, and was one of the first to become alarmed. She contacted the BBC in an attempt to raise awareness before Ms Everard's disappearance had become an official police investigation.\nMs Woollard said: \"Sarah has always been an exceptional friend, dropping everything to be there to support her friends, whenever they need her.\n\"It was only recently that she was telling me the good news about her new role, which she was excited to start.\"\n\"She was sunshine and light, and made you feel warm and good and safe,\" said another friend. \"I feel angry about it as well, but my main anger is that it happened to her.\"\nA former colleague said: \"Sometimes you meet a person with a beautiful soul and it shines through. \n\"There is nothing anyone can say that will make things better for her family and loved ones. They must be in hell. I can only say that Sarah was a very special person and will be missed by so many.\"\nThe uproar over Ms Everard's death, and what she has come to represent, led one friend to say: \"I would like to just say who she was to me, as a person. \n\"Finding the right words is so hard. \n\"I can't sum her up in a few well-chosen words, nor express what she meant to me by sharing memories. I can only skim the surface now in the wake of the horror and the anger, and work through the rest alone in the weeks and months to follow.\n\"Sarah was open. Honest. Unflinching in her ability to listen and empathise. There are some people you know for a relatively short time, but whom you instantly strike up a close bond with due to your similarities - Sarah was one of these people. We shared a lot, and I was never in any doubt of her discretion or sincerity in her support and kindness. We laughed, we cried. We talked about the future. \n\"She should be here.\"\nA simple post on Facebook on 14 June said: \"Happy Birthday Sarah Everard. I miss you today, and every single day\".\nWhen she was taken, Ms Everard was less than a mile from her flat in Brixton. The killer had been cruising around for more than four hours before he saw her for the first time. Years of predatory behaviour, days of planning, hours of scouting, and mere minutes to trap his prey.\nThis was a decision he made. It was not a frenzied attack in which a person loses self-control. It was cool-headed and clinical. \nInvestigators are looking into the hypothesis he used his police ID card as a means to stop Ms Everard, under the guise of questioning her about Covid restrictions.\nAt any point he could have driven away. \nHe chose not to."

      "text": "Panic buying at petrol stations has led to some key workers struggling to get the fuel they need to travel to their work.\nThe surge in demand for fuel came after fears lorry driver shortages would hit supplies of petrol and diesel.\nDoctors and unions representing teachers and carers have called for key workers to get priority at the pumps.\nOne hospice in Oldham tweeted that it was in \"urgent need\" of petrol for its cars.\nRosemary Botting, who runs Karosel Care and Domestic Services in West Sussex, told the BBC that if two of her carers were still unable to find a station with fuel ahead of their next shift, they would be unable to tend to \"vulnerable\" service users.\nMs Botting said if the current crisis wasn't resolved by next week, then she envisaged her care company would be in breach of safeguarding guidelines to its 12 customers.\n\"We will be putting our service users at risk,\" she said. \"We would not be able to send a carer out to somebody.\"\nMs Botting said her staff helped people living in rural areas throughout west Sussex, which meant driving - and a tank full of fuel - was essential.\nOne of her carers was half an hour late to her first call in because of traffic caused by queues at petrol stations, she said, which meant her first patient, who cannot get out of bed unaided, remained there until she arrived.\n\"I have got to inform all the other service users that their carer is running half an hour late. We pride ourselves on being on time,\" she said.\n\"We got through Covid. Not a single user in our care contracted Covid. The reason I do this job is because I care. It's just a bit of a nightmare at the moment.\"\nColin McDonald, an orthopaedic registrar at a district general hospital in the East Midlands, told the BBC that if fuel supply issues continued, and he couldn't to travel to work, there could be delays to patient surgeries at the start of his shifts, which could then delay his fracture clinics in the afternoon. \n\"This could lead to cancellations,\" he said. \"If patients live far away from the clinic they may not be able to get in, staff may not be able to get in.\"\nMr McDonald said he had been worried about not being able to get fuel on Sunday, but managed to buy some petrol which had been kept aside for key workers at a petrol station on Monday.\n\"Seeing people fill up multiple jerry cans of fuel - I just don't understand what their mentality is,\" he said.\n\"I find it very difficult to comprehend. It appears very selfish... they are just looking after themselves and not really considering the needs of others and key workers.\"\nAndrew Wagstaff, a civil servant from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, left his home at 04:45 BST to hunt for fuel to make his 57-mile trip to work.\nAfter finding all petrol stations closed in his area, he finally got fuel at Watford Gap service station.\nHowever, he said prices had been hiked to 157.9p per litre for diesel, which described as \"ridiculous\".\n\"It cost me \u00a365 to fill up three quarters of a tank,\" he said. \"I do an essential job. It's frustrating that people - who are not essential workers - are just panicking for no reason.\"\nMost bus and coach services have not been affected by the fuel supply issues, according to the Confederation of Passenger Transport.\nMeanwhile, the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents 5,500 out of the UK's 8,000 filling stations,said there were \"early signs\" the crisis was \"ending, with more of our members reporting that they are now taking further deliveries of fuel\".\n\"Fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, although deliveries have been reduced due to the shortage of HGV drivers,\" said PRA executive director Gordon Balmer.\n\"We have conducted a survey of our members this morning and only 37% of forecourts have reported being out of fuel today. With regular restocks taking place, this percentage is likely to improve further over the next 24 hours\"."

      "text": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been sentenced to a year in prison for illegally funding his unsuccessful 2012 re-election campaign. \nThe 66-year-old was found guilty in a Paris court of spending tens of millions of euros more on his campaign than was permitted under the law.\nHe will not be jailed, however, and can serve his sentence at home with an electronic bracelet, the court ruled.\nMr Sarkozy, who denies any wrongdoing, described the ruling as an \"injustice\".\nHe said he would go \"right to the end\" to seek \"truth and justice\". His lawyer added that he would appeal the verdict. \nThis is Mr Sarkozy's second one-year prison term. In March, he became the first former president of France to receive a custodial sentence - for corruption and influence peddling - but remains free pending an appeal of that sentence. \nIn the latest trial, Mr Sarkozy was accused with 13 other defendants over their role in the so-called \"Bygmalion\" scandal.\nProsecutors said the former president's UMP party splurged nearly double the \u20ac22.5m (\u00a319.4m) cap on lavish campaign rallies and events, then tried to hide the costs by hiring a PR firm called Bygmalion to invoice the party, not the campaign.\nOn Thursday, the court in Paris ruled that though the former president may not have known the full details of the fraud, he must have seen that limits were breached and did nothing about it.\nIt is the latest legal challenge for Mr Sarkozy, who served a five-year term as president from 2007.\nIn 2012, he lost his re-election bid to socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Since then he has been targeted by several criminal investigations.\nEarlier this year he was given a suspended prison sentence for trying to bribe a judge in 2014."

      "text": "Europe's BepiColombo mission has returned its first pictures of Mercury, the Solar System's innermost planet. \nThe probe took the images shortly after it zipped over the little world at an altitude of just 200km (125 miles).\nControllers have planned a further five such flybys, each time using the gravitational tug of Mercury to help control the speed of the spacecraft.\nThe aim is for Bepi to be moving slow enough that eventually it can take up a stable orbit around the planet.\nThis should happen by the end of 2025.\nThe mission's first pictures of Mercury were snapped by low-resolution monitoring cameras on the side of the probe. For the moment, these are all that are available. \nBepi is not ready to deploy its high-resolution science cameras. They are tucked away inside what is referred to as the spacecraft stack.\nBepi is essentially two spacecraft in one. One part has been developed by the European Space Agency (Esa), the other part by the Japanese space agency (Jaxa). The way these two components have been packed for the journey to Mercury obstructs the apertures of the main cameras.\nThe engineering, or \"selfie\", cameras were still good enough to pick out recognisable features on the planet's surface.\nThe simple black-and-white photos started filtering back to Earth on Saturday. Once all are processed, Esa is expected to run them together to make a short film, most probably for release on Monday.\nProf Dave Rothery from the UK's Open University declared himself delighted with what Bepi had seen.\n\"It's just happy snaps as we're whizzing by, but what a wonderful view we've had of the planet,\" he told BBC News.\n\"You're seeing a cratered surface, but also areas which have been smoothed by vast outpourings of volcanic lava. Some of the brighter areas are where there've been volcanic explosions in the distant past, and you can also see where today some of the surface material is dissipating to space. \n\"When we see really high-resolution images when we're in orbit, you'll see that the top 10-20m of the surface is dissipating to space, giving you these steep-sided, flat-bottomed depressions that we call hollows.\"\nAlthough Bepi is a long way from beginning proper science operations, quite a few of the probe's instruments were switched on for the flyby. Phenomena such as magnetic fields and some particles can still be sensed, even in the stack configuration.\n\"We'll get data back,\" Dr Suzie Imber, from Leicester University, UK, said, \"but the purpose of the flyby, and the six flybys in total at Mercury, is to help us change our trajectory and slow us down.\n\"Eventually, in a few years from now in December 2025, our spacecraft and Mercury will be in the same place going in the same direction. And so, finally, we can separate our spacecraft, and get into orbit.\"\nThis first flyby will have put Bepi in a two-to-three resonance with Mercury. That's to say, as Mercury goes three times around the Sun, Bepi will go around twice.\nThe next flyby in June next year, will slow this to a three-to-four resonance: Bepi will circle the Sun three times compared with Mercury's four circuits.\nFurther passes in June 2023, September 2024, December 2024, and January 2025 should see Bepi in a regular orbit to begin full science operations in 2026.\nThe European and Japanese elements of the mission will separate when they get into orbit at Mercury and perform different roles.\nEurope's Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) is designed to map Mercury's terrain, generate height profiles, collect data on the planet's surface structure and composition, as well as sensing its interior.\nJapan's Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO) will make as its priority the study of Mercury's magnetic field. It will investigate the field's behaviour and its interaction with the \"solar wind\", the billowing mass of particles that stream away from the Sun. This wind interacts with Mercury's super-tenuous atmosphere, whipping atoms into a tail that reaches far into space.\nIt's hoped the satellites' parallel observations can finally resolve the many puzzles about the hot little world.\nOne of the key ones concerns the object's oversized iron core, which represents 60% of Mercury's mass. Science cannot yet explain why the planet only has a thin veneer of rocks.\n\"When we get into orbit, we'll then start studying the magnetic field at Mercury, and the surface of Mercury, which has huge temperatures of 450C, the temperature of a pizza oven, and yet it has water on the surface in some places,\" said Prof Mark McCaughrean, Esa's senior advisor for science and exploration.\n\"Bepi is only the third mission ever to go to Mercury and will be much closer in for much longer than the previous missions. So, we've got a real chance of answering some of those mysteries about why the planet is the way it is,\" he told BBC News.\nEurope's MPO was largely assembled in the UK by Airbus."

      "text": "Preparations have begun in for the 2021 series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.\nThe ITV show will be filmed at Abergele's Gwrych Castle for a second year, with Covid preventing a return to the Australian jungle.\nThe Conwy county castle has now closed to the public to allow TV producers to begin preparing for the series.\nA new book gives an idea of the work involved in converting the derelict Grade I listed castle for the show.\nIt reveals the show's production team is made up of 500 people, many of whom worked in a huge tent erected in the castle grounds.\nOn one windy day, the crew had to briefly abandon their offices when some guy ropes came loose.\nIt also reports the celebrities' sleeping and living area had to be roofed over because of the Welsh weather, but this meant building a special chimney and extractor to remove fumes from the camp fire.\nThe filming schedule meant the celebrities' trials, in which they complete tasks involving insects or unpleasant foods, were actually filmed well after midnight.\nA special kitchen was set up to prepare dishes like fermented duck eggs and blended vomit fruit - well away from the main staff canteen.\nThe souvenir guidebook was co-written by Mark Baker, chairman of the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, which owns the castle.\n\"It was an enormous task to turn a derelict and sometimes dangerous ruin into a TV set,\" he said.\n\"It was just extraordinary how they repurposed lots of the interior spaces in the historic building - it wasn't just all fake sets, they used the actual castle, and it's quite exciting to show people how that happened.\"\nHe said ITV had been \"incredibly sensitive to the history and fabric of the place\" and to Welsh culture.\n\"Where the celebrities' bathroom was, was also a place where staff would have washed back in history.\n\"It was lovely to work with them, and exciting to work with them again this autumn.\"\nThe sight of a crane over the top of the castle in the past few weeks has led to speculation that new areas of the castle may feature in the 2021 series.\nSources close to the programme said the most prominent Welsh character - Kiosk Cledwyn - would be making a return to the screen to give the celebrities luxury rewards if they succeed in challenges.\nPreparations have also begun in the town of Abergele itself, where the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust has opened a souvenir shop to sell merchandise while the castle is closed to visitors for the filming.\nThe throne on which Giovanna Fletcher was crowned queen of the castle at the end of the 2020 series is also in display in the shop.\nBusinesses in Abergele were hoping that the programme would help boost trade and create a buzz in the area.\nTracey Brennan, who owns The Veg Shop in the town centre, said she could not wait.\n\"It's been such a terrible trading year, and when last year's show went out, we were all in lockdown,\" she said.\n\"From a business point of view, after being locked down for lots of last winter, we can now look forward to a period with more visitors and more footfall, and try to recoup losses from earlier in the year.\n\"We've already seen lots of tourists who have been talking about coming back in winter and asking us where is the best place to view the castle.\n\"It will be something between autumn and Christmas to lift people's spirits.\n\"We can't wait to see the celebs, and are even hoping we'll get to see a bit more of them in the town this year.\"\nConwy council has put plans in place to improve safety on the roads in the area, where a woman was killed during last year's show after being hit by a car while trying to take a photo of the castle.\nIt also hopes the show's producers will look at featuring other locations around north Wales.\nLouise Emery, cabinet member for the economy, said: \"We're delighted the show is being filmed in Abergele again, and we're looking forward to seeing some familiar locations on national TV.\n\"Covid restrictions will be less this year, so we're quietly hoping that the production team will be able to do more filming in the surrounding area.\n\"The mountains, coast and landscapes of Conwy county lend themselves to all sorts of creative challenges for the celebrities - who knows what we'll see.\n\"This year's show has already brought economic benefits to the area. It's been really good to see local businesses supplying catering and other services to the production crew as they start to get the castle ready.\n\"We're hoping those economic benefits can continue long after the show comes off air and the celebrities have headed home.\""

      "text": "New one-stop shops for scans and tests will be set up in community venues in England, including shopping centres and a Premier League football stadium.\nMinisters said the network of 40 diagnostic clinics will help tackle the growing backlog in hospital treatment.\nThey will be able to carry out checks on cancer patients and scans to see if people need surgery for things such as knee and hip replacements.\nThe aim is to have them all up and running by March.\nThey will be kitted out with a range of equipment to carry out X-rays, breast screening, ultrasounds and CT and MRI scans.\nAmong the sites chosen for the new clinics are:\nCarrying out diagnostic tests in community settings is nothing new. A number of hospitals already operate similar clinics - in fact some of the sites included in this announcement are running now.\nThe investment is much needed. Access to tests and scans is a real bottleneck in the system at the moment, slowing down the ability of the NHS to work its way through the backlog in routine care and, sometimes, delaying the diagnosis of cancer. \nThe aim is to get these tests done within six weeks of referral, unless it is an urgent cancer case. \nBut currently nearly a quarter of patients wait longer than that. Before the pandemic fewer than 5% did.\nThe NHS carries out more than 15 million diagnostic tests a year. The government says these clinics will be able to do 2.8 million.\nBut as there is a shortage of specialists to carry out these tests, it remains to be seen by how much these clinics will expand capacity rather than just lead to services being transferred from hospital into the community.\nThe need for investment in diagnostic tests was highlighted in the NHS Long Term Plan in 2019. \nA review published last year - led by former cancer tsar Prof Sir Mike Richards - said the pandemic had just heightened the need for changes to the way tests are provided.\nThe idea was to create greater capacity in the community so hospital testing and scanning facilities can be focused more on emergency patients.\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said the investment - worth \u00a3350m - would help tackle the backlog in treatment caused by the pandemic.\n\"Tackling waiting lists will require new and more innovative ways of delivering the services people need,\" he said. \n\"That is why we're making it easier and more convenient to get checked.\"\nAnd NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard added: \"These one-stop shops will also help us to improve outcomes for patients with cancer and other serious conditions, ultimately sparing more patients and families the pain and trauma of disease.\"\nAre you waiting for NHS treatment?

      "tags": "Fuel,Haulage",
      "text": "Only 127 petrol tanker drivers from the EU have applied for temporary visas to help tackle the petrol crisis, according to the prime minister. The government is offering 300 short-term visas for overseas drivers. \nMeanwhile, military personnel have started driving fuel tankers to help resupply petrol stations. \nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) - which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations - says the worst-affected areas have seen a \"marginal\" improvement but still face a \"challenging\" time.\nIt said about a fifth of forecourts in London and south-east England were out of fuel on Monday.\nBut elsewhere in Britain, that figure was 8% and there had been a \"marked\" improvement, the association said.\nLast week the government said it would offer temporary visas for 5,000 overseas HGV drivers - including 300 immediate visas for tanker drivers.\nBut Boris Johnson told BBC Breakfast that so far only 127 European Union fuel drivers have applied for the scheme. \nHe said the low number of applicants reflected a \"global\" issue causing \"a particular problem in the UK\". He blamed long-standing underinvestment in pay and driver facilities. \nSeparately, about 200 Army and RAF personnel - including 100 drivers - will help deliver fuel to forecourts in the hardest-hit areas, including London and south-east England.\nThey have been given training in safety procedures, equipment and forecourt driving manoeuvres.\nOther measures include:\nThe doctors' body the BMA, the teachers' union NASUWT and some politicians including London Mayor Sadiq Khan wanted key workers to be given priority access to petrol stations to avoid disruption to essential services. \nHowever, the government hasn't announced plans to prioritise key workers as it did with nursery and school places during the pandemic.\nThe government has powers to limit how much fuel drivers can buy, and the hours when they can buy it, but hasn't used them so far.\nSome petrol stations have introduced a \u00a330 cap on the amount of petrol people can buy.\nOn 23 September, BP warned it would have to \"temporarily\" close a handful of its petrol stations, because of a lack of drivers. \nLong queues started to build up outside stations across Great Britain in the following days, amid fears that fuel might run out. \nOil companies have stressed there is plenty of petrol available. \nHowever, the key issue is there aren't enough drivers to deliver it to forecourts.\nThere's an estimated shortage of more than 100,000 HGV drivers, which has already caused problems for a range of retailers - from supermarkets to fast food chains.\nFuel tanker drivers need additional safety qualifications on top of their HGV licence to be able to transport chemicals such as petrol. \nThere are a number of reasons - and many countries across Europe have been affected - but the UK has been especially badly hit.\nAfter Brexit, many European drivers returned to their home countries, or moved elsewhere, because working in the UK involved additional border bureaucracy which had an impact on their income.\nThe pandemic saw even more drivers return to their home countries, with few coming back. \nMeanwhile, some older drivers have retired, and there's a huge backlog in HGV driver tests due to Covid. \nPetrol prices are at an eight-year high. According to the latest weekly statistics, the average petrol price at UK forecourts on Monday was 136.1p a litre, up from 135.19p a week earlier.\nThe price of a litre of diesel rose 137.95p to 139.2p over the same period.\nSimon Williams of the RAC said the increase was largely down to the rising price of oil rather than the recent supply problems."

He has been sentenced to a whole-life prison term.\nHe had been linked to two previous allegations of indecent exposure.\nPolicing minister Kit Malthouse said \"officers up and down the land recognise the devastating consequences of this event\".\n\"There is a job to be done to rebuild trust by the police, particularly, I have to say, in London,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick faces calls to resign over the force's handling of the case, as Home Secretary Priti Patel said it raised \"serious questions\".\nSpeaking outside the Old Bailey after Couzens was sentenced, Dame Cressida said \"a precious bond of trust has been damaged\" and she would ensure \"any lessons\" were learned.\nAs part of renewed efforts to ease fears in the capital, the Met will step-up \"reassurance patrols\" and treat indecent exposure allegations more seriously.\nAn extra 650 new officers will patrol busy public areas in London.\nScotland Yard admitted the case was part of a \"much bigger and troubling picture\".\nThe force advised people detained by a lone plain-clothes officer to ask \"searching questions\" such as why they are being stopped, where the officer's colleagues are and where the officer has come from.\nThe force said that, to verify the answers, people should ask to speak to an operator on a police radio to determine if the officer is genuine and acting legitimately.\nIt added that it understood people may be \"more distrusting\" as a result of the case.\nIn the event someone believes they are in \"real and imminent danger\" the Met advised they \"must seek assistance - shouting out to a passer-by, running into a house, knocking on a door, waving a bus down or if you are in the position to do so calling 999\".\nThe Met explained officers are expected to intervene when required, even when off duty, and that they routinely carry warrant cards and sometimes equipment when travelling.\nSpeaking to the London Assembly, Met Deputy Commissioner Sir Stephen House, said plain-clothes officers will not be deployed on their own and will be in pairs. \nBut he warned there would be occasions when that is not possible given off-duty officers not in uniform \"put themselves on duty\" when they come across an incident.\nCouzens, who had been a police officer since 2002, transferred to the Met in 2018 from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, where he had worked since 2011. He passed vetting checks.\nMet Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave admitted a vetting check on Couzens was not done correctly when he joined the Met.\nIt meant a link to an incident of indecent exposure in Kent in 2015, involving a vehicle linked to Couzens, was missed.\nThough Mr Ephgrave said that even if it had come up in the vetting process, it would not have changed the outcome as Couzens was not named as a suspect.\nAround 72 hours before Ms Everard's abduction, Met Police officers received a separate allegation of indecent exposure which also identified the vehicle involved, registered to Couzens.\nHe was sacked by the Met in July after pleading guilty to Ms Everard's murder.\nMeasures including a pilot scheme where plain-clothes officers patrol pubs and clubs were launched in England and Wales in the immediate aftermath of Ms Everard's murder.\nThe Met said it would publish a new strategy for tackling violence against women and girls soon.\nHave you been personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

A Labour MP branded the advice \"derisory\".  \nCouzens - who has been sentenced to a whole-life prison term - is believed to have been in a WhatsApp group with five police officers who are now being investigated for gross misconduct.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating the five, and one former officer,  for distributing \"grossly offensive\", obscene or menacing material. Couzens is understood not to be one of those under investigation, but was involved in sharing messages.\nThe prime minister said the IOPC should \"come down hard\" on them.\nAsked if he had confidence in the police, Mr Johnson said: \"I do think that we can trust the police and I think that the police do a wonderful, wonderful job.\"\nBut he said the government needed to get to the bottom of \"what on earth\" happened in the Couzens case to ensure nothing like it happened again. \nHe added that \"hundreds of thousands\" of officers would be \"absolutely heart sick\" at the events surrounding Ms Everard's death. \nHowever, he also accepted there were problems including \"the way we handle rape, domestic violence and sexual violence\" complaints.\nHe said the length of time between reporting an incident to the court case was \"far too long\".\n\"It is a nightmare for the women concerned, we've got to fix it.\"\nThe prime minister also argued that recruiting more female officers would make \"a lasting difference to the police culture,\" adding that 37% of recruits last year were woman. \nEarlier this year, Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was \"deeply ashamed\" of low rape conviction rates. \nBefore being arrested for the murder of Sarah Everard, Couzens had been linked to two previous allegations of indecent exposure. \nMet Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave admitted a vetting check on Couzens was not done correctly when he joined the Met, meaning a link to one of these allegations was missed. \nMr Ephgrave said that even if it had come up in the vetting process, it would not have changed the outcome as Couzens was not named as a suspect.\nIn a bid to ease concerns about women's safety, the Metropolitan Police has said it will treat indecent exposure allegations more seriously and announced an extra 650 new officers to patrol busy areas in London. \nScotland Yard has also issued advice to people who are detained by lone plain-clothes officers.\nThis includes asking \"searching questions\" about why they are being stopped and where the officer has come from.\nPeople should ask to speak to an operator on a police radio to verify the answers, the force said.\nIf someone feels they are in \"real and imminent danger\" they are advised to \"seek assistance\" by shouting to passers-by, waving down a bus or calling 999.\nLabour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy said on Twitter: \"This completely derisory advice shows they're still not taking it seriously.\"\nRefuge chief executive Ruth Davison said the Met had time and again \"responded to incidents of gender-based violence by telling women to change their behaviour\".\nShe added: \"Police forces across the country must be prepared for a fundamental shift and overhaul in their attitudes towards women and root out the misogyny that is at the heart of these failings.\"\nFollowing Couzens' guilty verdict, the head of the Met Dame Cressida Dick said \"a precious bond of trust has been damaged\" and she would ensure \"any lessons\" were learned.\nThe Met has said it would publish a new strategy for tackling violence against women and girls soon.\nBut Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper said \"sorry is not enough\" and called for an independent inquiry to examine police culture and procedures.\nAnd Conservative Sir Bob Neill and London Mayor Sadiq Khan have suggested misogyny should be made a hate crime."

      "text": "A TV presenter who was hurt while playing the role of a human crash test dummy has been awarded \u00a31.6m in damages after a High Court battle with the BBC.\nJeremy Stansfield, 50, said he suffered spine and brain injuries while filming a 2013 episode of science show Bang Goes The Theory, resulting in more than \u00a33m of lost future earnings. \nMrs Justice Yip ruled the effect of the injuries was \"to derail the claimant's successful career in television\".\nThe BBC disputed Mr Stansfield's claim.\nThe injuries happened when Mr Stansfield, who was 42 at the time, filmed a Bang Goes The Theory feature about the relative safety of forward and rear-facing child car seats. \nThe episode saw him \"strapped into a rig like a go-cart which was propelled along a track into a post\".\nIn the segment, Mr Stansfield explained he had calculated the experiment to give a similar crash profile to hitting a lamppost in a real car in an urban environment. The crashes were performed forwards and backwards twice each.\nMr Stansfield said he had been left with a \"constellation of symptoms\", leading to a significant decline in his health.\nMrs Justice Yip ruled that the \"combined effect\" of Mr Stansfield's physical injuries and his psychological reaction to the crash test had caused him \"significant impairment\" and restricted \"his enjoyment of life\".\nBefore the crash tests, Mr Stansfield had been an \"exceptionally fit\" man, the judge said.\nA BBC physical assessment for a 2012 project involving a human powered aircraft, which he had designed himself as a former engineer, suggested he was performing at the level of a competitive athlete.\nMrs Justice Yip said: \"I must say that I find it astonishing that anyone thought that this exercise was a sensible idea.\n\"On his own account to camera, the claimant was simulating a road traffic collision of the sort that commonly causes injury.\n\"It might be thought that someone of his intelligence and scientific background might have appreciated the risk.\"\nThe judgement was not assessing liability, but the extent of Mr Stansfield's injuries and the damages owed.\nThe judgement said the BBC argued that \"little more than a moderate whiplash injury with depressive symptoms\" could properly be attributed to the crash tests, so only modest damages should be awarded.\nShe said there was also evidence the BBC actively sought advice and had been warned of the danger yet still allowed the experiment to proceed.\nThe BBC has agreed to share responsibility and loss of earnings, the ruling said. Mr Stansfield had originally claimed almost \u00a34m in damages.\nA BBC spokesman said: \"We take the health and wellbeing of everyone who works for the BBC extremely seriously.\n\"We keep safety measures on set under constant review and we made adjustments following the incident in 2013.\n\"We acknowledge the court's judgment in this complex case and wish Mr Stansfield the best for the future.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Restaurants and pubs are warning that prices will go up due to a rise in VAT rates, which takes effect from Friday.\nOwners said the increase from 5% to 12.5% was badly timed, with one restaurant chain owner saying businesses were already \"hanging by a thread\".\nTrade bodies have called for a halt to any further rises in VAT, to help the industry recover from the pandemic.\nThe government said hospitality had received \"extensive support\".\nVAT - the tax paid when buying goods or services - has been levied at a reduced rate in pubs, restaurants and other hospitality businesses since July 2020 to help them stay afloat during the pandemic.\nThe sales tax won't return to its pre-pandemic rate of 20% until April 2022.\nHowever, Salima Vellani, founder of restaurant chain Absurd Bird, told the BBC she was \"extremely concerned\" about the increase to 12.5%, which she said was a blow to the hospitality industry.\n\"It's just one thing after the other that we are being hit by,\" said the chief executive, who runs five chicken restaurants across the country.\n\"We are all hanging on by a thread. We are going to have to put prices up.\" \nChancellor Rishi Sunak said the 5% rate was designed to \"get the sectors moving and to protect jobs\". \nThe hospitality and tourism sectors have been hit hard by the pandemic, with many venues closed altogether during lockdowns, and then catering to limited numbers due to social distancing measures. Now staff shortages are preventing some making the most of the recovery.\nDavid Moore, the founder of Michelin-star restaurant Pied \u00e0 Terre, said he had already told one customer who had a \u00a395 voucher for a 10-course menu, that their meal would now cost \u00a3105.\nHe said the government \"could not have picked a worse time\" to implement the VAT increase, with his business having to cope with rising import, energy and staffing costs.\n\"It just does not feel like life is back to anywhere near like normal,\" he added. \n\"We just have so many price rises across the board. The utilities are horrendous. The VAT [rise] is not something I can absorb. Every single supplier has increased prices.\n\"It's not just vegetables, or just meat, everything is more expensive than it was two years ago.\"\nHis restaurant was also currently \"massively understaffed\" he said, sometimes meaning table numbers had to be reduced at peak times.\nFor Sue Whiston, finance and operations director at Kuula Poke, a Hawaiian restaurant in Birmingham, the VAT increase was \"premature\". She believes the 5% rate should have been extended for another six months.\nShe said shipping costs to source Kuula Poke's produce, from countries such as Japan, China and Thailand, had \"shot through the roof\".\n\"Mango is something that we buy in hundreds of kilograms at a time, (it) has suddenly overnight increased by 20%,\" she said. \"We have had problems with food availability.\n\"Only this week along our main Japanese wholesaler has turned around and said to us they can't make any deliveries to us this week because of the shortage of diesel fuel.\n\"So right now we are  in this perfect storm of inflationary pressure and VAT is about to go up.\nShe expects prices for diners to rise across the sector.\nRob Pitcher, the chief executive of Revolution, predicts there will be further price increases next spring when the VAT rate increases to 20%.\nThe boss of the bar chain, which has 66 venues and employs about 3,000 staff, said businesses could not afford to take on the extra cost, and so it would be passed on to the customer.\n\"The consumer is going to end up paying twice,\" he said.\nTrade bodies, including UK Hospitality, the British Beer and Pub Association, and Tourism Alliance have called on the government to make the 12.5% VAT rate permanent, rather than increasing the rate again in the spring, to safeguard the future of businesses and protect jobs.\nIn a joint statement, they said returning VAT back to 20% would have \"serious consequences\", with six in 10 businesses noting in a survey that it would \"likely lead to cutbacks and job losses\".\nKate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said keeping the VAT rate at 12.5% would be the \"most effective\" move by the government to \"secure a more rapid recovery and rebuild resilience faster\".\nBut a Treasury spokesman said the government had \"always been clear\" that lower VAT rates were a \"temporary measure to support businesses as they recover from the pandemic\".\n\"The hospitality sector has benefited from extensive support throughout the pandemic through our \u00a3400bn Plan for Jobs, with the furlough scheme, grants, tax cuts and deferrals,\" he added."

      "text": "Petrol prices have hit an eight-year high, the RAC has said, due to a rise in the cost of wholesale fuel.\nThe pump price spike also comes amid the current fuel supply problems and reports of profiteering at some petrol stations.\nThis is adding up to a \"pretty bleak picture for drivers\", the RAC said.\nThe government has put the army on standby to help ease fuel supply problems caused by a shortage of lorry drivers to make deliveries.\nThe RAC said that the average price of a litre of petrol across the UK increased from 135.87p on Friday to 136.59p on Sunday, the highest level since September 2013.\nThe motoring organisation warned that prices could rise further as retailers pass on the cost of rising wholesale prices.\nThe wholesale price of petrol rose from 123.25p on Monday last week to 125.22p just four days later.\nOil prices slumped at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but demand has been rising in recent months as economies around the world have started to reopen.\nGlobal oil supplies have also taken a hit from hurricanes Ida and Nicholas passing through the Gulf of Mexico and damaging US oil infrastructure.\nThe price of Brent crude oil rose above $80 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time since October 2018.\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: \"When it comes to pump prices, it's a pretty bleak picture for drivers.\n\"With the cost of oil rising and now near a three-year high, wholesale prices are being forced up which means retailers are paying more than they were just a few days ago for the same amount of fuel.\n\"This has led to the price of a litre of unleaded already going up by a penny since Friday.\n\"We might yet see higher forecourt prices in the coming days, irrespective of the current supply problems.\n\"We are also aware of a small number of retailers taking advantage of the current delivery situation by hiking prices, so we'd remind drivers to always compare the price they're being asked to pay with the current UK averages which are 136.69p for petrol and 138.58p for diesel.\"\nThere is a national shortage of lorry drivers, which haulage firms have blamed on factors including Covid and Brexit.\nThe lack of drivers has been affecting businesses from food firms to petrol stations.\nDemand for fuel has been such that between 50% and 90% of pumps were dry in some areas of Britain, according the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA).\nThe industry group represents independent fuel retailers who account for 65% of all the 8,380 UK forecourts.\nThere have been claims on social media that some petrol stations are taking advantage of the surge in demand to inflate prices.\nTwitter user Trevor Lakin said that Shell was \"marking prices up and profiteering\" after charging 148.9p a litre at a petrol station.\nA Shell spokeswoman said that about half of Shell's UK network is owned by independent dealers who set their own prices.\n\"We are only able to control prices at the sites we own,\" she said, adding that \"Shell is prevented by law from telling dealer groups what to charge their customers for fuel.\"\nHoward Cox, founder of campaign group FairFuelUK, said price rises of between 5p and 10p per litre have become \"the norm in the last few days\".\nHave you noticed any price rises when refuelling recently?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,NHS,Cancer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The rollout of third doses of Covid vaccines for vulnerable people with weak immune systems has gone \"badly wrong\", say charities.\nVaccine experts recommended on 1 September that immunosuppressed patients should be given the extra dose to give them fuller protection.\nBut Kidney Care UK and Blood Cancer UK say many are still waiting.\nNHS England says eligible patients should be offered the third doses by the end of next week.\nStudies have shown that people who are immunosuppressed - around 500,000 people in the UK - are unlikely to mount a strong defence against Covid-19, even after two doses of vaccine.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation advised that individuals such as those undergoing chemotherapy, HIV patients or people who have received an organ transplant, should get a third dose as soon as possible.\nOn 2 September, NHS England sent out guidance to doctors saying this third dose should be given at least eight weeks after the second jab, and at a time when the patient is not receiving treatment that may make the vaccine less likely to work.\nGPs and hospital consultants were asked to identify eligible patients and begin contacting them by 13 September.\nBut people have taken to social media to express their frustration at not being able to access a jab, despite the rollout of the separate booster programme for the over-50s and at-risk groups.\nSteve Harrison, from Lincolnshire, had a kidney transplant in December 2020 and is eligible for a third dose. He feels the most vulnerable have been forgotten.\nHe said: \"Arranging the third vaccine has been a nightmare. Neither my consultant nor my GP knew about it.\n\"I have spent days speaking to doctors, consultants, the CCG (Clinical Commissioning Group) and I am still no closer to having my vaccine booked.\n\"Shielding ending, restrictions lifting, the world getting back to normal and moving forwards, yet I feel like I am moving backwards.\"\nThe charities Kidney Care UK and Blood Cancer UK have both expressed concern at the high number of calls and emails they have received about the issue over the last few weeks.\nKidney Care UK has passed on the names of more than 80 GP practices to NHS England which it says were not currently assisting people with a third dose. \nFiona Loud, its policy director, said: \"This lack of clarity is causing a huge amount of stress, anxiety and frustration amongst thousands of kidney patients.\n\"This group are returning to work and public places with no specific national advice or support.\n\"They feel completely let down and many have told us this is the most worried and anxious they have felt throughout the entire pandemic.\"\nNHS England issued new guidance to hospital trusts on 30 September, with instructions that action be taken immediately to contact all those eligible for their third dose by 11 October.  \nThese will be recorded as a \"booster\" shot until the national system can be updated to recognise third \"primary\" doses. This will ensure immunosuppressed patients can then be contacted again in six months for their booster fourth dose.\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \"While a decision on when to get a third jab remains a decision between a patient and their clinician who know about their ongoing care and treatment, all hospitals have been asked to identify and offer a jab to those who are eligible, by the end of next week. \n\"Where vaccines cannot be administered at the same site, patients and their GP will be written to shortly so they can arrange their jab at their local practice or vaccine centre.\""

Say how your mummy stood up to the wild boar.\"\nShakira is the latest victim of the increasingly aggressive hogs which have invaded the Catalan capital in recent years. \nIn 2016, Spanish police received 1,187 phone calls about wild hogs attacking dogs, plundering cat-feeders, holding up traffic and running into cars in the city.\nIn 2013, one city police officer attempted to take charge of the problem himself and shot at a boar with his service revolver, but missed and hit his partner instead. \nBoars, which can carry a wide variety of diseases, are listed among the world's most invasive species and can survive in almost any environment. But increasingly the animals are drawn to cities, where they live off rubbish discarded by humans. \nTheir numbers have exploded across Europe, with the latest estimates now surpassing around 10 million across the continent. \nAs they have become more aggressive and more of a nuisance, many cities have employed a variety of strategies to cull their numbers. In Berlin, urban hunters have killed thousands of the animals but the problem persists.\nLast year police officers in Rome sparked outrage after they shot a family of wild boar that had wandered into a children's playground with tranquiliser darts and gave them lethal injections.\nYou may also be interested in:"

I'd have to say to her: 'Five more breaths Halle and then they need to put it back in.'\n\"You could see the anxiety in her face, she was absolutely petrified.\"\nThe teenager began having problems with her jaw in 2018 but the condition became significantly worse in March this year.\nHalle has not been formally diagnosed with a condition but doctors have said they think it might be hypermobility of the jaw.\nJoint hypermobility syndrome is when people, usually children and young people, have very flexible joints and causes them pain, according to the NHS.\nBy the end of July, Halle had to be admitted to hospital as she was not eating or drinking properly because she was worried her jaw might dislocate.\nShe had lost 3.5 stone (22.5kg).\n\"At the time, she was so weak and frail. The child is 14 years of age, she doesn't need her personal care met by me, but I had to shower her in the hospital because she was so frail,\" said Halle's mother.\n\"I just kept on saying to Halle: 'I promise you, I will get this sorted'. And that's why I am so determined to get her the treatment she needs.\"\nIn July, doctors at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, fitted bands to her back teeth to hold her jaw together, but those teeth are now coming loose.\nShe has also been seen by doctors in Birmingham and at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.\nShe has had some botox treatment in Birmingham, the only treatment available there because she is under 16, but that has not helped.\nHalle, who has just started her GCSES, has still been going to school when she can, but said it was hard.\n\"I don't want people to look at me like this sad frail person\" she said.\n\"I want to be known as strong and fun, but when I get home I am not that person. \n\"I go to school - I have migraines all day. I have chronic pain all day.\"\nThe family have been told that Great Ormond Street in London would be the best place for Halle, but say the local health board will not give them a new NHS referral because doctors said she could be treated in Birmingham.\n\"Seeing Halle and the change in her is horrific enough in itself,\" said her mother.\n\"Let alone the stress added to that about the battle I am having with the NHS. I just feel that we have lost all faith in the NHS.\"\nThe family said they were now at the point of giving up, and faced a bill of \u00a310,000 for private treatment.\nThey are trying to raise money for that treatment through a GoFundMe appeal online.\nAn official for Cardiff and Vale health board said: \"The health board is committed to providing any treatment for Halle locally where possible and in other specialist centres as needed. \n\"To that effect we have been liaising with colleagues in Birmingham and Great Ormond Street Hospital. \n\"It is appreciated how difficult and distressing this situation is for Halle and her parents and we will continue to work with them to support any care which is deemed clinically necessary.\""

That information would have been enough to establish that Couzens was the owner.\nSpeaking to reporters at Scotland Yard, Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said Kent Police had investigated the report and took no further action.\nHe explained: \"One of a number of checks that forms part of the vetting process may not have been undertaken correctly when he joined the Met. \n\"This check related to a vehicle that was registered to Couzens that was linked to an allegation of indecent exposure that was reported to Kent Police in 2015.\"\nThe assistant commissioner said the review into the vetting of Couzens concluded that even if that information had been known, it would not have changed the outcome.\nHowever, the reasons for this remain unclear.\nThe statement the Met issued on Thursday night added: \"We want the public to have confidence in our vetting and are taking extra measures to ensure our processes are the best they can be and address any potential weaknesses.\u202f\n\"Vetting is a snapshot in time and, unfortunately, can never 100% guarantee an individual's integrity.\"\nMeanwhile, two senior Met officers told London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee they were not aware of rumours that Couzens was nicknamed \"the rapist\" by colleagues.\nHowever, HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Tom Winsor said the nickname was known by some officers.\nSir Tom, who in his role has responsibility for the inspection of police forces, told the BBC Couzens \"also had allegedly a reputation in terms of drug abuse, extreme pornography and other offences of this kind\"."

It had lowered the prices of some items on its food menu and soft drinks as a result.\nA rise in VAT rates from 5% to 12.5% takes effect on Friday and has been criticised as \"badly timed\" for business.\n\"If the chancellor decides to make these VAT reductions permanent, the company intends to retain lower prices indefinitely,\" Wetherspoon said.\nJulie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said: \"JD Wetherspoon finally began recovering from the turmoil the pandemic and Covid restrictions had put it through, to be greeted with a supply chain hangover and staff shortages.\"\nShe pointed out that affordability had always been the brand's selling point, but that the chain might have to rethink that strategy as supply chain issues and rising costs hit.\n\"The board may need a strong drink to warm them up for another tough year ahead.\""

      "text": "Labour's Jess Phillips says the onus can't be on women to change their behaviour, after the murder of Sarah Everard by an off-duty police officer.\nShe said she would have got into Wayne Couzens' car - \"almost anybody would\" - and more action was needed to restore trust in the police.\nCouzens showed a warrant card as he kidnapped Ms Everard.\nThe Met Police has advised anyone stopped by a lone plain clothes officer to check their credentials.\nThe force says people detained in this way should ask \"where are your colleagues\" and \"where have you come from?\"\nIt suggested other \"very searching questions\", including \"why are you here\" and \"exactly why are you stopping or talking to me?\"\nThe Met also advised that if someone believes they are in \"real and imminent danger\" they \"must seek assistance - shouting out to a passer-by, running into a house, knocking on a door, waving a bus down or if you are in the position to do so calling 999\".\nAnd the force said that, to verify the answers, people should ask to speak to an operator on a police radio.\nJess Phillips, Labour's shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, said she could \"sympathise with the Met - what else could they say?\".\nBut she described their advice as \"tone deaf\". \n\"I could scream about the amount of things women are told to do,\" she told the BBC, adding that Ms Everard was \"keeping herself completely safe, doing exactly what any woman would do\".\nMs Phillips - who ran domestic abuse refuges before becoming an MP - said she knows her rights \"better than most people\" but even she \"would have got in the car and almost anybody would have got in the car\".\n\"The onus is on the Metropolitan Police to do better,\" she added.\nDebbie Summers from Sisters Uncut - a group which campaigns for women's safety - described the police advice as \"nonsense\". \n\"Asking for his police ID would have made no difference in this case as Wayne Couzens was a serving officer - that would have been no defence to her at all,\" she said.\nMs Phillips said the only way confidence will be restored is \"if we see the government and police forces starting to actually take violence against women and girls, and the complaints that women make day in, day out, seriously\".\n\"This is a conversation where women have been saying for some time, even before the death of Sarah Everard, that they don't feel that they are trusted by the police when they speak up or that violence and crime against them is prioritised.\"\nAsked if Met Police Commissioner should resign, she said \"getting rid of Cressida Dick is not going to help the fundamental and systemic problem\".\n\"I want to hear more from Cressida Dick than 'we will work together, we will learn lessons' - honestly a five-year-old could come up with it.\" \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the police needed to provide clear communication, adding; \"That is not about telling women to change their behaviour, but how the police are going to change what they're doing to reassure women.\" \nHe also backed calls for an independent inquiry, saying the sooner it happened the better.\nPolicing minister, Kit Malthouse, has acknowledged police forces will have to work \"much harder\" to win back public trust.\nHe told Radio 4's Today that Wayne Couzens' crimes have dealt a \"devastating blow\" to public confidence in the police and it would take months and years to rebuild it. \n\"It's hard to underestimate the impact of this tragic, awful case,\" he said.\nMr Malthouse said \"sadly\" the Met had had to issue advice to women approached by police - and that it was \"perfectly reasonable\" they make enquiries and seek verification.\nAnd he insisted there was a \"suite of things\" being done by ministers to tackle the issue of violence against women. \nConservative MP and chair of the Justice Committee Sir Bob Neill suggested making misogyny a hate crime could be one solution.\nWhere a crime is proven to be due to the victim's race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity, it is considered a hate crime - and can therefore attract a greater punishment. \nCampaigners in England and Wales have argued that sex and gender should be added to this list of characteristics that make an offence a hate crime.\nSir Bob's call was echoed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who said misogyny should be made a hate crime. \nLiberal Democrat peer Lord Paddick - who served as deputy assistant commissioner in the Met Police - told the BBC there was \"widespread sexism\" within the force.\nOfficers are \"concerned that things may be going backwards rather than forwards\", he said."

      "text": "Walt Disney and Scarlett Johansson have settled a legal dispute over the release of the Marvel superhero movie Black Widow.\nJohansson sued Disney two months ago, accusing it of breaching her contract when it offered the movie on its Disney+ streaming service while it was still showing in cinemas.\nShe said the decision meant that she was deprived of potential earnings.\nDetails of the deal between Disney and Johansson have not been disclosed.\n\"I'm very pleased that we have been able to come to a mutual agreement with Scarlett Johansson regarding Black Widow,\" Alan Bergman, content chairman for Disney Studios, said in a statement.\n\"We appreciate her contributions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and look forward to working together on a number of upcoming projects, including Disney's Tower of Terror,\" he added.\nJohansson also said that she was pleased to have resolved her differences with the entertainment giant and looked forward to further collaboration.\n\"I'm incredibly proud of the work we've done together over the years and have greatly enjoyed my creative relationship with the team,\" her statement said.\nJohansson starred in Black Widow as the Russian assassin-turned-Avenger superhero of the film's title, a role she has played in nine Marvel films.\nHer complaint was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in July.\nIt argued that she was promised by Marvel Studios, which is owned by Disney, that Black Widow would be a \"theatrical release\".\nShe said she had understood this to mean a \"window\" of time would pass before it would be streamed - a period that has traditionally lasted 90 days.\nIn response, Disney said at the time that it had \"fully complied\" with her contract and that her case had \"no merit whatsoever\".\nBlack Widow, which debuted simultaneously on 9 July in cinemas and via Disney+, set a box office record for a release during the coronavirus pandemic in its first weekend, grossing $218m (\u00a3161m), but box office receipts then fell sharply.\nIt has now grossed more than $378m in worldwide box office receipts, according to film tracking service Box Office Mojo. \nThe film also generated about $60m through streaming purchases in its first 20 days of release, Disney has said.\nDuring the pandemic several big Hollywood studios opted to bypass cinemas, many of which had been closed, and release films online instead.\nNow that most cinemas have reopened, Disney, along with fellow giant Warner Bros, has chosen to maintain a dual release strategy for their major films.\nJohansson topped Forbes magazine's list of the world's highest-paid actresses in 2018 and 2019, with earnings before tax estimated to have topped $56m in the year to June 2019."

      "title": "Dame Cressida Dick: Crises and controversies of Met chief",
      "tags": "Metropolitan Police Service,Cressida Dick",
      "text": "How far will the repercussions of the Sarah Everard murder case ripple? The man who abducted, raped and strangled a young woman was a serving Metropolitan Police officer. Protests and vigils followed his arrest - some peaceful, some less so.\nThere have been calls for the head of the organisation that - however unwittingly - facilitated his crimes, to resign. \nDame Cressida Dick, the commissioner of the Met Police, is no stranger to such demands. When a two-year extension to her contract was announced, a number of well-known people who had fallen foul of Met malpractice signed an open letter urging the prime minister to have her replaced.\nNow politicians, campaigners and even former Met officers have joined in.\nClearly, Dame Cressida has no personal responsibility for Ms Everard's death. But her former police constable Wayne Couzens does.\nSpeaking after the sentencing of Couzens, Dame Cressida said: \"There are no words that can fully express the fury and overwhelming sadness we all feel about what happened to Sarah. I am so sorry.\"\nWill \"sorry\" be enough?\nAfter the death of Ms Everard, the force came under even more scrutiny over the handling of a vigil in her memory. Clashes broke out between women and police officers trying to control the gathering, held on Clapham Common under Covid lockdown measures. News coverage included pictures of women being handcuffed and dragged away - a report later found the police had acted \"appropriately\".\nAfterwards, Dame Cressida told the BBC confidence in policing was damaged because of remarks made on social media rather than the actions of any Met officers.\nShe has many supporters, although criticism of her tenure has not been restricted to the Sarah Everard case. The 60-year-old has never shown any inclination to stand down. \nShe continued to rise through the ranks, amid the persistent rumble of accusations against the Met Police of institutional racism, incompetence and corruption.\nThe first female commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and the UK's most senior police officer, she was made a dame in Theresa May's resignation honours. It was recently announced she is to stay as Met commissioner until 2024.\nDame Cressida is the first openly gay person to hold the post. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 2019, she said her sexuality was one of the least interesting things about her, adding: \"I happen to love Helen. She's my partner. And on we go.\"\nIt also emerged on the programme that she cannot smell cannabis - a fact her colleagues apparently find \"hilarious\" - and, perhaps appropriately for someone who has so consistently kept her hands clean despite the whiff of scandal in the air, her luxury item would be an endless supply of floral scented soaps.\nOriginally from Oxford and the daughter of two academics, Dame Cressida read forestry and agriculture at the university's Balliol College before joining the Met in 1983. \nOn her mother's side of the family, she is related to Sophia Jex-Blake, who led the fight for women's education in Britain, and is directly descended from Sophia's brother Thomas Jex-Blake, a 19th Century headmaster of Rugby School.\nShe took a brief career break to study criminology at Cambridge and had a short spell working in finance - but for most of her life she has been a police officer.\nShe was quickly promoted through both the Thames Valley force and the Met, and in 2001 she took on command roles in the police response to the 9/11 attacks and the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004. \nShe was first thrust into the public glare when, in 2005, she headed the operation that led to the fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes. She co-ordinated the surveillance officers, specialist firearms teams and other police as they attempted to catch the men behind the 21 July bombings.\nA subsequent trial found the Met Police guilty of endangering the public, but exonerated then-Commander Dick. She later described the killing as \"an awful time\".\n\"I think about it quite often. I wish, wish, wish it hadn't happened, of course, but if anything it has made me a better leader, a better police officer and it has made me more resilient.\"\nAt the trial she had told prosecution counsel that she \"does not get anxious - I don't have anxiety\".\nShe was promoted to deputy assistant commissioner in 2006, and in 2009 she became the first woman to become an assistant commissioner. \nDame Cressida left the police in 2015 to work at the Foreign Office, in an unspecified job shrouded in secrecy, but returned two years later when she assumed the mantle of Met commissioner.\nAt the time, she said it had been \"at least 25 years since I thought regularly about the fact that I was a woman, doing this job\" but added that some men were \"threatened, baffled and confused\" by it.\n\"I long for the day when we can all be ourselves, whoever we are, and express ourselves in whatever way we like, and we don't have these kinds of funny constraints in our heads that make us feel: 'Ooh, there's a different power relationship because that's a man and that's a woman.' And we still get that. It's not helpful.\"\nDame Cressida's background in counter-terrorism was soon proved to be starkly necessary - her first day in the job as commissioner came just weeks after the murder of PC Keith Palmer during a terrorist attack in Westminster. \nIt marked the beginning of a turbulent time for London. Four more terrorist attacks on the capital followed in the next six months, leaving 31 people dead.\nShe was the national lead for counter-terrorism for three years, and led the security operations for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the 2012 Olympics. She was made a dame in Theresa May's resignation honours in 2019.\nAllegations relating to the unholy trinity of dishonesty, prejudice and incompetence continue to dog the Met.\nDame Cressida has denied the force is institutionally racist but has admitted it \"is not free of discrimination, racism or bias\" and has said \"there is much more to be done\" to improve public trust.\nFurther accusations of racism came from the mother of two women murdered in a park in Wembley. Mina Smallman believes police treated the disappearance and deaths of Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry less urgently than if they had been white.\nShe said of the investigation: \"I knew instantly why they didn't care. They didn't care because they looked at my daughter's address and they thought they knew who she was. A black woman who lives on a council estate.\"\nThe disappearance of Richard Okorogheye, a teenager who was found dead two weeks after his mother reported him missing, is also subject to a review by the police watchdog, which will consider whether ethnicity played a role in the way his case was handled.\nAnd athlete Bianca Williams and her partner believe they were racially profiled when their car was stopped by Met officers in Maida Vale, in July 2020. The couple were handcuffed and separated from their baby son. Ms Williams said she thought her family had been targeted because \"we are black and we drive a Mercedes\".\nThe Met later apologised for any distress caused.\nDame Cressida also had to deal with the repercussions from the disastrous Operation Midland, the multimillion-pound investigation which saw detectives duped by false claims of a VIP sex abuse ring made by the paedophile and fantasist Carl Beech.\nShe had been responsible for supervising the senior investigating officer who said allegations made by Beech were \"credible and true\". Despite hearing the officer say this, and knowing it \"was a mistake\", Dame Cressida admitted that she had done nothing to correct it. \nShe said: \"I just felt for him... I remember thinking 'oh, no', I know he didn't mean to say that. What he will have meant to say was that 'this person appears credible' and unfortunately, when pressed and pressed, he said 'credible and true'.\n\"That of course was a mistake. It was unfortunate and it dented people's confidence in the investigation from there on in.\"\nThe force had to pay compensation to a number of people whose reputations had been unfairly tarnished by Beech's lies.\nA report by an independent panel set up in 2013 into the unsolved murder of Daniel Morgan accused the force of institutional corruption, and found that the then-Assistant Commissioner Dame Cressida had initially refused to grant access to a police internal data system.\nFurther criticism was forthcoming over the security of Wembley stadium during the final of the Euro 2020 championships, which saw thousands of ticketless fans storm the venue.\nDame Cressida later defended the Met's actions, stating she \"did not accept\" that the policing operation had failed, adding: \"Without [the officers'] immediate intervention, it is possible that this game could have been abandoned.\"\nIn a statement released before her contract extension was announced, the Metropolitan Police Federation said Dame Cressida had the \"full support of the rank and file\".\nThe federation, which represents more than 30,000 officers in London, said: \"It is easy to comment and criticise from the sidelines.\n\"We know her to be an ethical, courageous and highly competent police leader who genuinely cares about London, its citizens and her officers.\""

      "tags": "Scottish government,Vaccine passports",
      "text": "Major problems have been reported with Scotland's Covid vaccine passport app, just hours after its launch.\nPeople now need proof they have had two doses of vaccine in order to enter nightclubs and many other large events.\nThe NHS Scotland Covid Status app only became available to download on Apple and Android devices at about 17:30 on Thursday.\nBut many people have said they were unable to access their vaccination status through the app.\nThe Scottish government said more than 70,000 people had downloaded the app on on Thursday, with a spokesman adding: \"This huge demand did mean that some people experienced delays and we are sorry that happened.\n\"We have now increased the capacity of the NHS systems that sit behind the app - where most of the issues causing delays have occurred - in order to deal with demand and, as a result, we are seeing increasing numbers of people now able to access their records.\"\nAnecdotal evidence on social media suggested that problems may have arisen when people tried to use their NHS CHI number to register.\nThis step comes after users are asked to take a picture of their passport or driving licence.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there should be an \"indefinite delay\" to the rollout of the new scheme to avoid a \"weekend of chaos\" at venues across the country. \nHe added: \"Thousands of people will be at the football and going out to hospitality premises this weekend.\n\"This plan should really be scrapped altogether but, if the SNP insist on charging ahead, they must indefinitely delay the vaccine passport scheme until the most basic issues are ironed out.\"\nPeople have been sharing their experiences of trying to download the new vaccine passport app. \nDean of the Faculty of Advocates, Roddy Dunlop QC, described the app as the \"worst I have ever tried to use\". \nHe wrote on Twitter: \"I am not prone to hyperbole. I promise.\n\"And I instantly recognise that I was originally instructed to challenge the introduction of Covid passports and so am not neutral.\n\"But try the app. This is, literally, the worst app I have ever tried to use.\" \nAnother app user shared screenshots of his experience on Twitter during which he was told \"no match found\" followed by: \"Something went wrong. We're working on it.\"\nOthers reported issues getting past the initial log in page, while a BBC Good Morning Scotland listener told the programme that he had tried twice to download the app without success.\nHe said: \"I tried for a couple of hours last night but not joy and this morning I tried again and although I could get past the biometric part it would take me to end of the process and was still not working. \n\"It just isn't suitable for purpose at the moment, they should have known it was going to happen in the first place.\"\nUniversity of Edinburgh scientist Dr Christine Tait-Burkard said she was unable to get the app working, being told a match could not be found for her on the NHS database.\nHowever, the academic told the programme that once up and running, the app will help \"persuade some of the hesitant people [to get vaccinated] if the vaccine passport has consequences.\"\nMike Rhodes, of the IT firm ConsultMyApp, said he thought the servers being used for the app were being overloaded because of demand but this should have been anticipated. \nHe said: \"It is highly likely that those developers that built the app shell also built the interface to the back-end servers that ended up failing. \n\"Secondly, this wasn't an unforeseen event - the developers absolutely knew this would be downloaded incredibly quickly and was likely to get hundreds of thousands of people attempting to register at the same time.\"\nMr Rhodes questioned why there was \"so little time\" between the app being launched and it being needed for entry into events. \nThe new rules came into effect at 05:00 on Friday - but the government announced earlier this week that they will not actually be enforced until 18 October. \nPaul Banham, of Glasgow's Buff Club, told BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live: \"We'll be having a look at them over the next few weeks but we won't be refusing entry if someone doesn't have it - there's too many glitches at the moment. \n\"We've had a lot of students contact us and a lot of them are saying they have been vaccinated in other areas of the UK and that is not showing on their Covid status so there's a few gaps at the moment and hopefully they will be ironed out.\"\nThe Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), which represents nightclub, lost a legal bid to delay the rollout on Thursday. \nIt had argued that the new system was \"discriminatory\" and \"disproportionate\".\nBut judge Lord Burns ruled that the vaccine passports were \"an attempt to address the legitimate issues identified in a balanced way\", and was within the margin of what the government could decide was a reasonable response to the pandemic.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the court judgement was \"clear and emphatic\".\nShe said: \"This is a targeted and proportionate way to try and reduce the harm the virus will do over the winter months, to keep our economy open and fully functioning.\n\"We will continue to engage with businesses not just in the run-up to the enforcement of this on 18 October, we will do that afterwards as well so we are listening and understanding and working collectively to keep the country as safe as possible.\"\nThe vaccine certification scheme will require venues to put in place a \"reasonable system\" to check the status of customers over the age of 18, with certain exemptions on medical grounds.\nVenues affected include nightclubs, unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event with more than 10,000 people in attendance.\nElsewhere in the UK, Wales plans to introduce its own Covid passport rules later this month but England has scrapped similar plans.\nNorthern Ireland has yet to announce a formal vaccination passport scheme.\nThe Scottish launch comes as latest figures show that a total of 4,189,701 people have received the coronavirus vaccine in Scotland, of which 3,837,689 people have received two doses."

      "tags": "NHS,Pret allergy death,Fulham,Allergies,Wood Green",
      "text": "The parents of a teenager who died after an allergic reaction to a Pret a Manger baguette have welcomed the introduction of a new food safety law.\nThe rules - known as \"Natasha's Law\" - require full ingredient and allergen labelling on all food made on premises and pre-packed for direct sale. \nThe change follows the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse from anaphylaxis after she ate sesame in a baguette.\nHer parents said she would be \"very proud\" of the new regulations.\nNatasha's mother, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, told BBC Breakfast that she and husband Nadhim had been waiting for this day for years. \"Today we really feel like we've achieved it and it feels really special,\" she said.\nMr Ednan-Laperouse said they had set up a parliamentary petition online calling for an allergy tsar as a \"matter of life and death\".\n\"This is not what a great British nation should accept, that young people can die in this day and age because of the food they eat, when all it takes is more joined-up thinking to better protect them,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\nThe couple set up the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation and campaigned for the change in law after a food labelling loophole left Natasha unaware that the baguette she ate contained sesame seeds.\nThe coroner at the 2018 inquest into her death concluded that Pret a Manger's allergy labelling was inadequate.\nNatasha, from Fulham, west London, ate an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought from a Pret shop at about 07:00 BST in Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport on 17 July 2016, West London Coroner's Court heard.\nShe began to feel ill during a British Airways flight, and suffered a cardiac arrest. Despite her father administering two EpiPen injections, she died later the same day. \nThe inquest heard the baguette contained sesame - which Natasha was allergic to - baked into the dough, but the ingredient was not listed on the packaging.\nPret did not label \"artisan\" baguettes as containing sesame seeds despite six allergic reaction cases in the year before Natasha died, the inquest heard.\nThe regulations Natasha's law, all food retailers will be required to display full ingredient and allergen labelling on every food item made on the premises and pre-packed for direct sale - including sandwiches, cakes and salads.\nPreviously, non pre-packaged fresh food made on the premises did not need to be individually labelled with allergen or ingredient information.\nBy Colletta Smith, consumer affairs correspondent\nOver the last 18 months cafes and restaurants have had to deal with a raft of new legislation because of the pandemic, faced huge losses during periods of closure, and had to make significant changes to the way they operate to cope with changing customer habits. \nBut food labelling is a hugely important issue for a growing number of consumers who suffer from allergies. They've been asking for clearer labelling for years, and understandably they don't want to wait any longer.\nThe regulator is trying to be flexible with an industry already under strain, so we're unlikely to see fines straight away. \nBut the Food Standards Agency will expect cafes and restaurants to at least be attempting to sort out their labelling and comply with the law before the end of the year.\nMr Ednan-Laperouse said Natasha's Law would be vital in helping to protect the two to three million people in the UK living with food allergies from life-threatening allergic reactions.\nHe said: \"It is about saving lives and marks a major milestone in our campaign to support people in this country with food allergies.\n\"This change in the law brings greater transparency about the foods people are buying and eating; it will give people with food allergies confidence when they are buying pre-packaged food for direct sale such as sandwiches and salads. Everyone should be able to consume food safely.\"\nMrs Ednan-Laperouse said: \"Natasha was always extremely careful to check the food labels and until that terrible day in 2016 hadn't had a severe allergic reaction for over nine years.\n\"Nothing can bring Natasha back, and we have to live with that reality every day, but we know in our hearts that Natasha would be very proud that a new law in her name will help to protect others.\"Food Standards Agency chief executive Emily Miles said: \"If these changes drive down the number of hospital admissions caused by food allergies, which have seen a threefold increase over the last 20 years, and prevent further tragic deaths such as Natasha's, that can only be a positive thing.\"\nA Pret a Manger spokesman said it has fully rolled out ingredient labelling, and this process began in 2019."

      "tags": "Policing,Sarah Everard murder,Women,Metropolitan Police Service,Cressida Dick",
      "text": "People stopped by a lone plain-clothes officer should challenge their legitimacy, the Met Police says.\nAs it seeks to reassure women after the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer, the Met said it was \"entirely reasonable\" to demand an officer's identity and intentions.\nWayne Couzens showed a warrant card and used handcuffs as he kidnapped Ms Everard before her rape and murder.\nThe Met faces questions over whether chances were missed to stop him.\nCouzens, 48, targeted Ms Everard, 33, on a street in south London in March. He has been sentenced to a whole-life prison term.\nHe had been linked to two previous allegations of indecent exposure.\nPolicing minister Kit Malthouse said \"officers up and down the land recognise the devastating consequences of this event\".\n\"There is a job to be done to rebuild trust by the police, particularly, I have to say, in London,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\nHe said it was \"reasonable\" for a woman with doubts about a police officer's conduct to make \"lines of enquiry\", but that \"won't be appropriate in every circumstance\" because officers \"seeking to keep us all safe every day need to be able to go about their business\". \nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick faces calls to resign over the force's handling of the case, as Home Secretary Priti Patel said it raised \"serious questions\".\nSpeaking outside the Old Bailey after Couzens was sentenced, Dame Cressida said \"a precious bond of trust has been damaged\" and she would ensure \"any lessons\" were learned.\nAs part of renewed efforts to ease fears in the capital, the Met will step-up \"reassurance patrols\" and treat indecent exposure allegations more seriously.\nAn extra 650 new officers will patrol busy public areas in London.\nScotland Yard admitted the case was part of a \"much bigger and troubling picture\".\nThe force advised people detained by a lone plain-clothes officer to ask \"where are your colleagues\" and \"where have you come from?\"\nIt suggested other \"very searching questions\", including \"why are you here\" and \"exactly why are you stopping or talking to me?\"\nThe force said that, to verify the answers, people should ask to speak to an operator on a police radio to determine if the officer is genuine and acting legitimately.\nIt added: \"All officers will, of course, know about this case and will be expecting in an interaction like that - rare as it may be - that members of the public may be understandably concerned and more distrusting than they previously would have been, and should and will expect to be asked more questions.\"\nIn the event someone believes they are in \"real and imminent danger\" the Met advised they \"must seek assistance - shouting out to a passer-by, running into a house, knocking on a door, waving a bus down or if you are in the position to do so calling 999\".\nIt said it was unusual for lone plain-clothes officers to engage with people.\nThe Met explained that officers are expected to intervene when required, even when off duty, and that they routinely carry warrant cards, and sometimes equipment when travelling.\nSpeaking to the London Assembly, Sir Stephen House, the Met's deputy commissioner, said plain-clothes officers would not be deployed on their own and would be in pairs. \nBut he warned there would be occasions where that is not possible given that off-duty officers not in uniform \"put themselves on duty\" when they come across an incident.\nCouzens, who had been a police officer since 2002, transferred to the Met in 2018 from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, where he had worked since 2011. He passed vetting checks.\nAssistant Met Commissioner Nick Ephgrave admitted a vetting check on Couzens was not done correctly when he joined the Met.\nIt meant a link to an incident of indecent exposure in Kent in 2015, involving a vehicle linked to Couzens, was missed.\nThough AC Ephgrave said that even if it had come up in the vetting process, it would not have changed the outcome as Couzens was not named as a suspect.\nAround 72 hours before Ms Everard's abduction, Met Police officers received a separate allegation of indecent exposure which also identified the vehicle involved, registered to Couzens.\nHe was sacked by the Met in July after pleading guilty to Ms Everard's murder.\nJess Phillips, Labour's shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, said there were gaps in the Met's explanation of how Couzens passed its vetting checks and that trust in police was \"very badly damaged\".\n\"We'll be pushing ministers and the home secretary to have a look at what is going on in the vetting processes,\" she said. \nAnother Labour MP, Harriet Harman, called for Dame Cressida to stand down, saying women's trust in the force \"will have been shattered\", while former Met chief superintendent Parm Sandhu also called for the commissioner to resign.\nCabinet minister George Eustice said the government had been working hard in recent weeks to devise a strategy to reduce violence against women and girls.\n\"We are looking at making our streets safer, designing out some of the risks, getting more CCTV, supporting more helplines,\" he told BBC One's Question Time. \n\"We've had a domestic abuse bill which has given new powers to the police to intervene earlier in a pro-active way and to protect witnesses from being intimidated by their abusers in court.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that people \"must be able to walk on our streets without fear of harm and with full confidence that the police are there to keep them safe\".\n\"No woman should have to fear harassment or violence. We will do everything possible to prevent these abhorrent crimes and keep our communities safe,\" he added.\nMeasures including a pilot scheme where plain-clothes officers patrol pubs and clubs were launched in England and Wales in the immediate aftermath of Ms Everard's murder.\nThe Met said it would publish a new strategy for tackling violence against women and girls soon.\nHave you been personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "title": "Covid in Scotland: Vaccine passport app launch hit by problems",
      "tags": "Scottish government,Vaccine passports",
      "text": "Major problems have been reported with Scotland's Covid vaccine passport app, just hours after its launch.\nPeople now need proof they have had two doses of vaccine in order to enter nightclubs and many other large events.\nThe NHS Scotland Covid Status app only became available to download on Apple and Android devices at about 17:30 on Thursday.\nBut many people have said they were unable to access their vaccination status through the app.\nThe Scottish government said more than 70,000 people had downloaded the app on on Thursday, with a spokesman adding: \"This huge demand did mean that some people experienced delays and we are sorry that happened.\n\"We have now increased the capacity of the NHS systems that sit behind the app - where most of the issues causing delays have occurred - in order to deal with demand and, as a result, we are seeing increasing numbers of people now able to access their records.\"\nAnecdotal evidence on social media suggested that problems may have arisen when people tried to use their NHS CHI number to register.\nThis step comes after users are asked to take a picture of their passport or driving licence.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there should be an \"indefinite delay\" to the rollout of the new scheme to avoid a \"weekend of chaos\" at venues across the country. \nHe added: \"Thousands of people will be at the football and going out to hospitality premises this weekend.\n\"This plan should really be scrapped altogether but, if the SNP insist on charging ahead, they must indefinitely delay the vaccine passport scheme until the most basic issues are ironed out.\"\nPeople have been sharing their experiences of trying to download the new vaccine passport app. \nDean of the Faculty of Advocates, Roddy Dunlop QC, described the app as the \"worst I have ever tried to use\". \nHe wrote on Twitter: \"I am not prone to hyperbole. I promise.\n\"And I instantly recognise that I was originally instructed to challenge the introduction of Covid passports and so am not neutral.\n\"But try the app. This is, literally, the worst app I have ever tried to use.\" \nAnother app user shared screenshots of his experience on Twitter during which he was told \"no match found\" followed by: \"Something went wrong. We're working on it.\"\nOthers reported issues getting past the initial log in page, while a BBC Good Morning Scotland listener told the programme that he had tried twice to download the app without success.\nHe said: \"I tried for a couple of hours last night but not joy and this morning I tried again and although I could get past the biometric part it would take me to end of the process and was still not working. \n\"It just isn't suitable for purpose at the moment, they should have known it was going to happen in the first place.\"\nUniversity of Edinburgh scientist Dr Christine Tait-Burkard said she was unable to get the app working, being told a match could not be found for her on the NHS database.\nHowever, the academic told the programme that once up and running, the app will help \"persuade some of the hesitant people [to get vaccinated] if the vaccine passport has consequences.\"\nMike Rhodes, of the IT firm ConsultMyApp, said he thought the servers being used for the app were being overloaded because of demand but this should have been anticipated. \nHe said: \"It is highly likely that those developers that built the app shell also built the interface to the back-end servers that ended up failing. \n\"Secondly, this wasn't an unforeseen event - the developers absolutely knew this would be downloaded incredibly quickly and was likely to get hundreds of thousands of people attempting to register at the same time.\"\nMr Rhodes questioned why there was \"so little time\" between the app being launched and it being needed for entry into events. \nThe new rules came into effect at 05:00 on Friday - but the government announced earlier this week that they will not actually be enforced until 18 October. \nPaul Banham, of Glasgow's Buff Club, told BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live: \"We'll be having a look at them over the next few weeks but we won't be refusing entry if someone doesn't have it - there's too many glitches at the moment. \n\"We've had a lot of students contact us and a lot of them are saying they have been vaccinated in other areas of the UK and that is not showing on their Covid status so there's a few gaps at the moment and hopefully they will be ironed out.\"\nThe Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), which represents nightclub, lost a legal bid to delay the rollout on Thursday. \nIt had argued that the new system was \"discriminatory\" and \"disproportionate\".\nBut judge Lord Burns ruled that the vaccine passports were \"an attempt to address the legitimate issues identified in a balanced way\", and was within the margin of what the government could decide was a reasonable response to the pandemic.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the court judgement was \"clear and emphatic\".\nShe said: \"This is a targeted and proportionate way to try and reduce the harm the virus will do over the winter months, to keep our economy open and fully functioning.\n\"We will continue to engage with businesses not just in the run-up to the enforcement of this on 18 October, we will do that afterwards as well so we are listening and understanding and working collectively to keep the country as safe as possible.\"\nThe vaccine certification scheme will require venues to put in place a \"reasonable system\" to check the status of customers over the age of 18, with certain exemptions on medical grounds.\nVenues affected include nightclubs, unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event with more than 10,000 people in attendance.\nElsewhere in the UK, Wales plans to introduce its own Covid passport rules later this month but England has scrapped similar plans.\nNorthern Ireland has yet to announce a formal vaccination passport scheme.\nThe Scottish launch comes as latest figures show that a total of 4,189,701 people have received the coronavirus vaccine in Scotland, of which 3,837,689 people have received two doses."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic,Australia",
      "text": "Australia will reopen its international border from November, giving long-awaited freedoms to vaccinated citizens and their relatives.\nSince March 2020, Australia has had some of the world's strictest border rules - even banning its own people from leaving the country.\nThe policy has been praised for helping to suppress Covid, but it has also controversially separated families.\n\"It's time to give Australians their lives back,\" PM Scott Morrison said.\nPeople would be eligible to travel when their state's vaccination rate hit 80%, Mr Morrison told a press briefing on Friday.\nTravel would not immediately be open to foreigners, but the government said it was working \"towards welcoming tourists back to our shores\".\nAmy Hayes, who lives in the English town of Reading, Berkshire, and has not been back to Queensland in nearly three years, said it was \"encouraging to see things moving in the right direction\".\n\"But I'll believe the borders have reopened when I see it and hear the stories of stranded Aussies being able to get home uninhibited,\" she told BBC News.  \nHenry Aldridge is excited to fly back to the UK for Christmas to see his parents and five siblings in London. His partner Shana, a nurse from Ireland who lives with him in Sydney, nearly broke down when they heard the news. \n\"We're pretty excited,\" he told the BBC. \"The first year and a half [of the pandemic] we looked on at the UK and thought, we're pretty happy here. But the last few months haven't been ideal.\"\nHe said as the lockdowns were extended and the country recorded more and more cases, the travel ban started to feel \"a bit absurd\".\n\"It seemed silly - you still have to quarantine to come home to a country that's in lockdown,\" he said.\nBut David Mullahey in Western Australia - which has restricted entry to Australians in other parts of the country - told the BBC he was against changing the travel rules.\n\"Covid has hardly touched us here and we've had limited deaths. Why should we risk being put in the same scenario as Victoria and New South Wales?\" he said.\n\"I don't see how we can consider lifting international border controls when the government can't control Covid in those states.\"\nAt present, people can leave Australia - which has recorded more than 107,000 cases of Covid-19 and just over 1,300 deaths - only for exceptional reasons such as essential work or visiting a dying relative.\nEntry is permitted for citizens and others with exemptions, but there are tight caps on arrival numbers. This has left tens of thousands stranded overseas.\nMr Morrison said Australia's mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine - which costs each traveller A$3,000 (\u00a31,600; $2,100) - would be replaced by seven days of home quarantine for vaccinated Australians or permanent residents.\nUnvaccinated travellers must still quarantine for 14 days in hotels.\nAustralian carrier Qantas responded by announcing it would restart its international flying a month earlier. It had already put flights to major overseas destinations on sale from 18 December.\nSydney, Melbourne and Canberra are currently in lockdown due to outbreaks of the virus. \nThat has helped prompt a surge in the vaccine uptake in recent months.\nNew South Wales - which includes Sydney - is on track to be first state to cross the 80% threshold, in a few weeks. Victoria - containing Melbourne - is not far behind.\nBut states such as Queensland and Western Australia have threatened to keep their borders closed until vaccine rates are even higher.\nThese states have managed to maintain Covid rates at or near zero, after shutting their borders to states with infections. \nThis is a hugely anticipated announcement for thousands of Australians both here and overseas. No doubt it's an emotional moment for many, after nearly two years of isolation. \nAustralia's strict border policy has been credited for its success especially early in the pandemic, but the Delta variant has changed everything.\nWestern Australia and Queensland are still going for an elimination policy, meaning they have been quickest to close their borders to other parts of Australia. \nIt's a very different picture in NSW, the most populous state, where the policy has changed from elimination to vaccination. \nAll of that is going to make the practicalities of reopening international borders quite tricky. \nAirlines have already said they're not ready for the ramping up of services this reopening will require. And with so many details still vague in terms of restrictions and proof of vaccination, this could be a potential headache for border authorities too. \nNSW or Victoria may allow their fully vaccinated residents to travel abroad and come back to home quarantine but Western Australia, for example, will most likely be reticent to do that and take on increased risk. \nSo you could have a scenario where it could be easier for people in some states to travel to London for a vacation than it is to go to Perth!\nKey vaccination thresholds are also part of Australia's broader plan to emerge from lockdowns and \"live with the virus\".\nSydney - site of Australia's largest airport - is due to come out of a 13-week lockdown on 11 October.\nTim Soutphommasane, an academic and former Australian race discrimination commissioner, told AFP news agency Australia had become a \"fortress nation with the drawbridge pulled up to the rest of the world\". \n\"What we're seeing now with this announcement of borders being reopened is akin to Australia re-entering the world, and it's long overdue,\" he added.\nAdditional reporting by Simon Atkinson, BBC News, Australia\nDo you want to travel to and from Australia?

      "tags": "Cosmetic surgery,Cosmetics,Young people",
      "text": "Under-18s are no longer able to get botulinum toxin injections - often known as Botox - or dermal lip fillers for cosmetic reasons in England. \nThe new law aims to protect young people from harm after years of efforts to regulate the non-surgical beauty industry. \nCampaigners say the rules do not go far enough.\nThe ban does not cover other procedures like thread lifts some seek to get the popular 'fox-eye' look.\nGovernment estimates show up to 41,000 Botox-style procedures were carried out on under-18s in England last year. \nAnd the analysis, by the Department of Health and Social Care, suggests there were up to 29,300 dermal filler procedures for under-18s in 2017. \nLaura Brooks is 34 and decided to get dermal lip fillers in December 2020 to make her lips look fuller. But the procedure went almost instantly wrong and she is still dealing with some of the fallout months later.\nLaura says she chose to have the procedure partly because everyone else was doing it and also as she found a cut-price deal online. \nBut as the treatment got under way she could see the practitioner's face and knew something was wrong. \n\"I just saw this look on her face of panic and my heart started racing, and I could feel blood just trickling down the side of my face.\"\nLaura says she could feel her lip becoming increasingly swollen, and her therapist tried massaging it and putting a cold pack on it. \nShe added: \"My practitioner really panicked. She didn't know how to deal with that situation.\n\"My lip was massive and black and the underside was just filled with blood. I didn't know what to do. I wished it wasn't happening.\"\nLaura quickly contacted a friend  - who is medically trained -  who explained it was likely that a vein had been damaged during the procedure. \nSome of the swelling has now gone down, but some of the effects are still visible to Laura, nine months later.\nShe welcomes the change in the law, but says: \"It is important for more to be put in place to protect everybody.\n\"There are women of all ages, and men I guess, having these treatments. It is not just the age thing. You should be medically trained. \n\"And until that is law, this is just going to continue to happen over and over again.\"\nBefore the new legislation came into place in England, under-18s were able to have Botox-style procedures and dermal fillers with no checks on their age.\nUpdates on legislation in Wales and Scotland are expected in the near future, while Northern Ireland has no current plans to make any changes.\nCampaigners are calling on the other nations to act quickly to prevent young people in England travelling over the borders for treatments.\nThere remains no law in the UK requiring practitioners to have formal qualifications or training for this type of treatment. \nMaria Caulfield, minister for patient safety, said she understood the constant pressure for people to look their best, but said: \"Far too many people have been left emotionally and physically scarred by their experience, needing medical treatment after botched cosmetic procedures.\n\"Anyone considering these treatments should take the time to consider the impact on both their physical and mental health, and ensure they are using a reputable, safe and qualified practitioner.\"\nMP Laura Trott, who called for the legislation change in Parliament, said: \"No child needs cosmetic Botox or fillers and from today [Friday] they will no longer be able to walk into a clinic or someone's home and get a dangerous and unnecessary procedure that could ruin their lives.\n\"It will not fix the entirety of the problems in this industry, but it will make a real difference for under-18s.\"\nBut Ashton Collins, director of Save Face, a national register of accredited practitioners who provide non-surgical treatments, said the law needs to expand to incorporate all non-surgical treatment, like thread lifts (carried out to lift and tighten the face). \nShe told the BBC: \"We are seeing loads of women coming forward who have had these treatments and it's gone wrong - because anyone can do these threads and they are quite invasive. \n\"Although medical professionals who provide these treatments have to be regulated by the Care Quality Commission, lay people and beauty therapists do not.\"\nCampaigners say that while an age restriction is an important first step for the non-surgical cosmetic industry, there is still a long way to go, with customers aged over 18 as vulnerable as ever.\nSave Face says restricting who can do non-surgical cosmetic treatments, introducing mandatory insurance and restricting who can set up training academies, would create a safer environment.\nSimilar concerns were seen in a recent BBC Three documentary which revealed complicated aesthetic procedures being taught over the internet or on unsafe one-day courses.

      "tags": "Blue Origin,Jeff Bezos",
      "text": "The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said it will review safety concerns raised by whistleblowers at Blue Origin, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' space company. \nThe announcement comes after 21 current and former employees claimed the company had ignored safety concerns to gain an advantage in the space race. \nStaff also complained of a culture of sexism within the company. \nBlue Origin rejected the charges and said it stands by its safety record. \nA spokesperson for the company said it provides \"numerous avenues for employees, including a 24/7 anonymous hotline, and will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct\". \nIt added that it \"has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind\".\nStaffers led by Blue Origin's former head of internal communications, Alexandra Abrams, made the allegations in a letter that was sent to the FAA before being published on the whistleblowing website, Lioness, on Thursday. \nRaising concerns over the standard of the company's flagship New Shepard rocket, which Mr Bezos travelled into space on in July, the essay writers said: \"In the opinion of an engineer who has signed on to this essay, 'Blue Origin has been lucky that nothing has happened so far'.\" \nThe letter also alleged that more than 1,000 reports of issues related to the engines that power Blue Origin's rockets have never been addressed. \"Many of this essay's authors say they would not fly on a Blue Origin vehicle,\" the letter added. \nThe FAA, which regulates rocket launches in the US, said that it \"takes every safety allegation seriously, and the agency is reviewing the information\".\nIn addition to the safety concerns, staff also claimed that the company's management embraces a \"particular brand of sexism\" under which numerous managers and senior staff displayed consistently inappropriate behaviour towards women. \nOne senior executive was reported to the HR department multiple times for sexual harassment, the authors claim. However, no action was taken and they allege that the individual was later placed on a panel overseeing the appointment of a new senior HR role. \nAnother executive was reportedly so notorious for sexist behaviour that new female staff were warned to avoid him. \"It appeared to many of us that he was protected by his close personal relationship with Bezos \u2014 it took him physically groping a female subordinate for him to finally be let go,\" the group alleged.\nA Blue Origin spokesperson said Ms Abrams \"was dismissed for cause two years ago after repeated warnings for issues involving federal export control regulations\". Ms Abrams told CBS News, which first reported the allegations, she never received any warnings related to export control issues.\nIn July the company made the first crewed flight of its rocket ship, New Shepard, with Mr Bezos onboard. \nWhen the capsule touched back down after the 10 minute, 10 second flight, the Amazon founder exclaimed: \"Best day ever!\"\nThe rocket is designed to serve the burgeoning market for space tourism. However, it faces stiff competition to corner the market from Elon Musk's company SpaceX and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic. "

      "text": "Female police officers fear reporting male colleagues as they worry they will be abandoned if they need help on duty, says a former senior officer.\nEx-Met Ch Supt Parm Sandhu said female officers fear being \"kicked in\" while dealing with street violence.\nAnd a police watchdog inspector has admitted she would be concerned to approach a lone male officer at night.\nThey were speaking after Wayne Couzens was jailed for kidnapping, raping and killing Sarah Everard while an officer.\nThe 48-year-old abducted Ms Everard, 33, under the guise of an arrest as she walked home from a friend's home in south London on 3 March.\nSpeaking to Radio 4's The World at One, Ms Sandhu called the police service \"very sexist and misogynistic\".  \nShe told how she had been \"vilified\" after reporting an incident involving a male colleague.\nIn an environment dominated by male officers, any objections were often cast aside and the behaviour dismissed as \"banter\", the former senior officer said.\nMs Sandhu, who served in the Met for 30 years, said: \"A lot of women will not report their colleagues.\n\"What happens is that male police officers will then close ranks and the fear that most women police officers have got is that when you are calling for help, you press that emergency button or your radio, they're not going to turn up and you're going to get kicked in in the street.\n\"So you have got to be very careful which battles you can fight and which ones you can actually win.\"\nShe added that women officers who are married to male police officers \"won't report domestic violence either because of the same sort of issues\".\nMs Sandhu also called for change at the top - saying police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick \"cannot move with the times\".\nMeanwhile, Zoe Billingham, a senior inspector with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, told the BBC's Woman's Hour programme: \"We cannot dismiss Wayne Couzens as a one-off or an aberration.\"\nAsked if she would feel safe going to a male police at night with a problem, Ms Billingham replied: \"At this moment in time, like any other woman, I have concerns and reservations.\"\nAlso speaking on Radio 4, Labour MP Harriet Harman, chairwoman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, called for \"a cultural change in the police service\".\nMs Harman said she had written to Home Secretary Priti Patel setting out 10 points that she believed need to be acted on immediately to regain women's trust in the police.\nAfter Ms Everard's murder, the police watchdog announced it was probing alleged failures by the Met to investigate two indecent exposure incidents linked to Couzens in February.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is also investigating alleged failures by Kent Police to investigate a flashing incident linked to Couzens in 2015.\nMs Billingham told the BBC it was a \"watershed moment for policing\".\n\"What Wayne Couzens did to Sarah Everard has struck a hammer-blow to the heart of policing legitimacy in England and Wales, and it needs to be treated as such,\" she said. \nMs Billingham, who is responsible for inspecting 15 police forces including Kent - where Couzens previously worked - called for more vetting, screening and scrutinising of would-be police officers.\nShe referred to a 2019 report, led by her, which looked at police who abused their position for sexual purposes and said the report highlighted how - at the time - proper vetting did not take place when officers transferred between forces. \nThe outgoing inspector said she was not confident that the systems currently in place at police forces are enough to prevent another atrocity.\n\"There is an epidemic of violence against women and girls, and within policing male violence against women and girls is not prioritised enough, it's not taken seriously enough,\" she said.\nAlso speaking on Thursday, Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Tom Winsor said he had heard Couzens was known as \"the rapist\" by other officers at times during his career.\n\"Yes, I do know that,\" he said. \"And (he) also had allegedly a reputation in terms of drug abuse, extreme pornography and other offences of this kind.\"\nHe said there appeared to be a \"culture of colleague protection\" within the police service and warned that police officers were failing to raise concerns about colleagues who exhibit \"damaging or worrying\" characteristics.\nFollowing his sentencing, Dame Cressida called Couzens' actions \"a gross betrayal of everything policing stands for\". \n\"This man has brought shame on the Met. Speaking frankly, as an organisation we have been rocked.\""

      "tags": "Schools,Scotland Education",
      "text": "When Maureen McKenna was six weeks into her job as Glasgow's director of education, staff at one of her schools were threatening to go out on strike. \nA pupil at Drumchapel High had brought a weapon in to class and she was refusing a request for him to be permanently excluded. \nShe recalls how she took a phone call from a union rep describing the alarm among staff. \nMs McKenna says she \"took a deep breath\" and told him the staff must do what they had to do.\nBut her role, she told him, was to get everyone together to look at the reasons why that child brought a weapon into school and then look at support for the family and the young person.  \nShe says: \"I hung up the phone and I thought 'Oh god'.\"\nBut in the end, the staff didn't strike, instead teachers joined a meeting with social workers and others. \nIt was the first of several occasions during her 14 years in the job where Ms McKenna felt she had to push back against the status quo. Now, as she faces retirement at the end of the year, she stands by her decision on that first case.\n\"That young man went on and had a successful career at that school,\" she says. \n\"His additional support needs meant he didn't understand fully what he was doing. Would he have understood exclusion? Would sending him to a different school have changed his life? No, it would have probably made it worse.\"\nWhen the former maths teacher first took the top job in the city's education team in 2007, exclusions were at an all-time high and she knew she wanted to change that.\n\"They were just a habit,\" she says. \"Schools were excluding people again and again. I just didn't think they were reflecting enough about the context of the young person, where they had come from. \n\"In one of our secondary schools there were 770 exclusion incidents in one year, there are only 190 pupil days. \n\"It was like a revolving door - pupils are in school, an incident happens, straight out the door again. \n\"How were we ever going to improve outcomes and change lives? That is what education is most powerful at doing, changing people's lives, but they have to be in school.'\nMs McKenna's approach fitted with the work and ethos of Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit (VRU), which was started just before she took up her post. It aims to treat crime as a public health issue and look at root causes of the problem. \nThere has been an 88% reduction in school exclusions in the past 10 years, at the same time there has been a 50% reduction in youth crime. \nSeveral English councils and Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, have sent representatives to learn from Ms McKenna how the approach to exclusions could be having a positive impact on reducing violence.\n\"We need to be supporting our young people to make better decisions, because that's really what it's all about,\" she says.\n\"If you are in school and you see a bit of misbehaviour, you have to make those decisions yourself about whether you get involved or not. \n\"If you are doing that successfully in school then you are going to be able to do that successfully in the community.\"\nShe adds: \"English local authorities approached us and along with the violence reduction units down south, they are building on the success of the VRU and the schools' work up here, to take what they can for the English context.\"\nCutting back drastically on exclusions hasn't always gone down well with teachers and families, who feel it could mean more disruption in class.\nMs McKenna says there has never been a policy of zero exclusions.\n\"There are always times when for the safety of that child, or for the safety of other children, there needs to be an exclusion,\" she says.\n\"Without a shadow of a doubt. It's about understanding that when a child acts out, maybe they are communicating with you, rather than deliberately being bad. \n\"I'm not saying children don't behave badly, or that everyone in the city is perfect, absolutely not, it's a hard shift in Glasgow and it always will be a hard shift but if we can help our children to manage themselves better, we are creating the next generation of families.\""

      "text": " Firefighter Craig Hope deals with \"hundreds and hundreds\" of wildfires across the south Wales valleys every year.\nBut he has noticed recently they are changing - burning later into the year, getting larger and causing more damage.\nHis colleagues are also having to deal with \"unbelievable\" flood events and landslides.\nAll signs of climate change, he says - and \"it's like watching a Hollywood film\".\nWith a month to go until world leaders gather in Glasgow for the crucial COP26 summit on global warming, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has urged action, warning that its members are on the front line.\nAs a wildfire specialist, Mr Hope travelled to Greece in August with three other colleagues from South Wales Fire and Rescue to assist with devastating blazes there.\nHe predicts parts of Wales could soon suffer similar scenes unless action is taken to adapt to the challenges of warmer weather.\nMediterranean countries now experiencing severe issues \"were having fires like we have 30 years ago\", he explained.\n\"We're in a position where we need to act - the next 30 years will be the deciding factor.\"\nBut it is a complex problem.\nIt involves working with farmers and landowners, as well as forestry firms, conservationists and government, to manage landscapes so they are less prone to blazes that burn out of control.\nA project in Rhondda Cynon Taf called Healthy Hillsides was a good example of what needs to be happening further afield, he said. \n\"The problem we have in Wales is that we have a lot of poor weather.\"\nHe said it meant fires might not be at the forefront of people's minds.\nBut when it is wet in Wales, vegetation grows and it gets bigger and bigger.\n\"And then we get bursts of very hot, dry, windy weather,\" said the firefighter.\nHe said his own fire service had now \"totally evolved\" the way it responds, with a wildfire toolkit and different uniforms better suited to the conditions.\nBut is he worried for the future?  \n\"Definitely,\" he said.\nHe said at the moment it was very rare for UK wildfires to affect properties or harm people. \nBut he said that could change.\n\"I was in Portugal recently... they lost 77 people in a wildfire and only last month a firefighter died in Spain. So this is very real,\" he said.\n\"As our fires become bigger and the climate changes, we need to start preparing to make ourselves safe.\"\nWildfire-prone Kilvey Hill, above the St Thomas area of Swansea is one cause of concern.\nSix homes were evacuated in 2019 after a major blaze, with resident Jan Murphy describing the evening as \"really quite horrendous\".\n\"All you could see was the smoke and glow of red. We were in the street until 3am and we had five fire engines here until the following day,\" said the 72-year-old.\nThe fire reached the edge of her garden, and she has since cut down a row of trees on her property as a precaution.\nNeighbour Stephen Passmore said he tried not to think about the implications of climate change but \"obviously\" there would be more fires.\nHe said he felt for the \"struggling\" firefighters.\n\"The whole hill was burning - where do you start?\" he said.\nFirefighters are under pressure on all sides from climate change and are increasingly called out to rescue people from severe flooding too.\nMr Hope described the deluge of February 2020 - when a series of storms pummelled Wales - as \"incredible\".\n\"When you see shipping containers being washed down rivers and then you link that with the footage we saw in Germany and elsewhere across Europe just this summer - it's unbelievable,\" he said.\nAnd the damage is all linked, he pointed out - with wildfires burning away vegetation that could help prevent flooding and landslides.\nMore focus on adapting to the effects of climate change, while securing tougher action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, are key aims of November's COP26 summit.\nIn a plea to those attending, Cerith Griffiths, who heads up the FBU in Wales, said it was \"high time the politicians took it seriously\".\n\"If we don't deal with this climate emergency and do so quickly then it's going to deal with us,\" he said.\n\"Firefighters are on the front line - we're dealing with bigger fires and more floods that cover a wider area - it's happening in front of our eyes right now.\"\nFire services were adapting, he said, but could be doing more \"if the resources are there\".\nWelsh Climate Change Minister Julie James said the government had been running \"a massive programme all year learning from the effects of the various storms we had last winter\".\n\"It's awful to be flooded out and I've met with many people who are traumatised by what happened,\" she said.\n\"So we have worked really hard on mapping out where our flood protections are, what needs to be done to shore them up and prepare for this winter.\"\nOn wildfires, she said the government was working with further education colleges, young people, the farming community and others to raise awareness of the behaviour that could lead to blazes.\n\"We can't mitigate against all extreme weather events but we can try and put the best defence in place that we can to make sure we're as resilient as possible,\" she said."

      "text": "The Green Party's new leaders have vowed to make it a powerful electoral force across England and Wales.\nCarla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay have been elected to replace Jonathan Bartley and Sian Berry.\nMs Denyer said voters were increasingly seeing Greens \"can get elected\".\nShe said the party agreed with many of the aims of Insulate Britain - the group staging protests on motorways - but did not \"necessarily agree\" with their tactics.\nThe new leadership team has pledged to build on recent electoral successes and take more seats at every level, including more MPs.\nThe party currently has just one MP, Caroline Lucas, but gained 99 seats in May's local elections and became the joint largest on Bristol City Council. \nMs Denyer, who is a councillor in Bristol, said: \"We increasingly are in power. The Greens are part of the administration on 14 councils in England and Wales now and in government in Scotland.\n\"That's a steep curve, that's improving all the time.\" \nShe said the party was the \"electoral wing\" of the Green movement, and while there was a place for \"direct action in the wider political movement\", Insulate Britain is \"not necessarily always doing it in the most constructive way\". \nMr Ramsay said strong voices are needed to make the case for a Green agenda, not just on the environment but a whole range of issues.\n\"Our country is in crisis  - pumps running out of petrol, empty shelves in supermarkets and millions heading into winter fearing rising fuel bills\" he added and Green polices would \"help prevent the next crisis\". \nBy BBC Political Correspondent Ione Wells\nCarla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay put an emphasis in their campaign, and victory speeches, on becoming a serious electoral force. \nMs Denyer has often been touted within party circles as the \"obvious next MP\" and came second in the race for the Bristol West seat in 2019. \nMr Ramsay was part of the campaign team that got their only MP, Caroline Lucas, elected and has been credited with co-writing the election strategy that saw them deliver more Green councillors on more councils than ever at the English local elections in 2021. \nThey beat a number of other candidates including deputy leader Amelia Womack and Tamsin Omond, a founding member of Extinction Rebellion. \nThe new leadership were keen to stress that groups like Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion were different from the Green Party, and they don't always support their tactics, but credited the organisations for putting climate at the \"top of the agenda\". \nFor this pair though, winning influence through positions of power is a key aim. \nThey hope to use current issues like rising energy bills and empty petrol pumps to demonstrate their view that the UK is too reliant on fossil fuels. \nMr Ramsay said the Greens would create \"sustainable, secure jobs with decent rates of pay\" with policies to install insulation and renewable energy systems in homes, improve public transport system and prioritise sustainable food supplies. \nSpeaking after the result was announced, Ms Denyer said both she and Mr Ramsay would \"focus on getting more Greens elected\" at every level, including more Green MPs. \nShe said: \"It is time for the Greens to shine. \n\"We intend to lead this party to the electoral success we know is within our grasp\", adding: \"A better future is possible.\"\nMr Ramsay and Ms Denyer took 44% of the first preference votes in the leadership contest.\nAnd in the second round of voting, the new leaders secured 62% of preferences, with 6,274 votes. \nAmelia Womack and Tamsin Omond came second with 30% of first preference votes. Ms Womack will continue to be the party's deputy leader.\nThe election was triggered after Jonathan Bartley announced he would be standing down as party co-leader and Sian Berry decided not to seek re-election.

      "text": "Armed forces personnel will begin delivering petrol to garages across the UK from Monday, the government says.\nAlmost 200 servicemen and women, 100 of them drivers, will provide \"temporary\" support to ease pressure on stations. \nMinisters have also announced that up to 300 overseas fuel tanker drivers will be able to work in the UK immediately until the end of March.\nThere have been long queues at petrol stations this week after a shortage of drivers disrupted fuel deliveries.\nMinisters - who have maintained there is enough fuel if people buy at their normal rates - say the situation at petrol station forecourts is improving, with more fuel now being delivered than sold.\nBut they acknowledge some parts of the country are worse affected than others.\nBrian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 petrol stations said Scotland, the north of England and parts of the Midlands had seen a \"distinct improvement\" with fewer dry sites.\nBut he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it remained a \"big problem\" in London and south-east England, where \"if anything it had got worse.\"\nHe said the military drivers will be a \"large help\" but a \"prioritisation of deliveries to filling stations, particularly the independent ones, which are the neighbourhood sites\" was needed \"immediately\".\nMr Madderson warned drivers would see a rise in fuel prices next week, but because of \"global factors\" not because of profiteering.\nOn Friday, the RAC motoring group also said the disruption in deliveries was continuing to ease, though many areas were still experiencing supply issues.\nSmaller fuel stations were facing major supply problems as drivers filled up for the weekend, it said. \nMilitary personnel are currently training at haulier sites and will be on the road delivering fuel supplies across the country to \"help fuel stocks further improve\" from Monday, the government said.\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said personnel would be seen working alongside drivers this weekend following training this week. \nIn addition to the 300 fuel tanker drivers being allowed to work temporarily in the UK, temporary visas are also being offered to 4,700 food haulage drivers who are able to arrive from late October and leave by 28 February 2022. \nVisas are being offered to a further 5,500 poultry workers who can come from late October and stay until 31 December.\nPreviously, the government said these temporary visas would last until Christmas Eve. \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said there were \"continued signs that the situation at the pumps is slowly improving\".\n\"UK forecourt stock levels are trending up, deliveries of fuel to forecourts are above normal levels, and fuel demand is stabilising,\" he said.\n\"It's important to stress there is no national shortage of fuel in the UK, and people should continue to buy fuel as normal.\" \nBy political correspondent Pete Saull\nMore than a week after queues started appearing on petrol station forecourts, just under 200 military personnel will take to the roads.\nMinisters say it takes time to train up servicemen and women to drive large tankers carrying highly flammable substances into built-up areas.\nWhile they will help with getting supplies to garages, there's been a concern inside government that falling back on the armed forces could be counter-productive.\nWhat message does it send to worried motorists to see soldiers driving petrol tankers? Could it lead to more panic buying?\nMinisters are confident the situation will continue to stabilise, but they've been under pressure to take more urgent action.\nIt's notable that alongside the decision to deploy the military, up to 300 tanker drivers will be allowed into the UK from overseas immediately - several weeks before the wider visa scheme comes into effect.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called on the PM to recall Parliament from party conference recess, saying \"emergency action\" was needed to speed up the visas.\nBut Prime Minister Boris Johnson accused the haulage industry of being too reliant on low-paid migrant workers.\nHe added that he would not allow the UK to repeat the \"failures\" of the past, by allowing mass immigration to create a \"low-wage, low-skill economy\" for British workers.\nThe haulage industry says the driver shortage already existed, but has been made worse by factors including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, low wages and poor working conditions.\nIn addition to offering temporary visas, the government last week set out a number of other measures aimed at limiting disruption in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. \nThese include increasing HGV (heavy goods vehicle) testing capacity, sending nearly one million letters to drivers who hold an HGV licence, encouraging them back into the industry, and offering training courses for HGV drivers. \nMeanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned there is global disruption to supply chains in other industries, which could continue until Christmas.\n\"These shortages are very real,\" Mr Sunak told the Daily Mail. \"We're seeing real disruptions in supply chains in different sectors, not just here but around the world. We are determined to do what we can to try to mitigate as much of this as we can.\"\nAnd the Financial Times reports that turkeys will be imported to the UK from France and Poland in the run-up to Christmas after farmers reared about one million fewer birds.\nBritish Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths told the paper that Brexit had cut off the industry's supply of cheap labour."

He has been sentenced to a whole-life prison term.\nSpeaking outside the Old Bailey, where Couzens was sentenced, Dame Cressida said she was \"absolutely sickened\" by the case - adding that it had \"brought shame on the Met\" and \"rocked\" the organisation.\nCouzens' actions were a \"gross betrayal of everything policing stands for\", she said, and had \"eroded the confidence that the public are entitled to have in the police\".\nShe said: \"I absolutely know that there are those who feel that their trust in us is shaken. I recognise that for some people a precious bond of trust has been damaged.\"\nDame Cressida said she realised what had happened to Sarah Everard and other women in London and elsewhere recently had \"raised important questions about women's safety\".\nShe committed to \"keep working with others to improve women's safety and reduce the fear of violence\".\n\"There are no words that can fully express the fury and overwhelming sadness that we all feel about what happened to Sarah. I am so sorry.\"\nThe Met has announced that it will no longer deploy plain-clothes officers on their own, and will instead send them in pairs.\nDeputy Commissioner Sir Stephen House said there would be \"occasions\" where that was not possible - such as when a pair of officers were split up - and noted that off-duty officers not in uniform \"put themselves on duty\" when they come across an incident. \nIn other moves to allay concerns, the Met said it would deploy 650 new officers into busy public places, including those where women and girls often lack confidence that they are safe\u202f\nCouzens, who had been a police officer since 2002, transferred to the Met in 2018 from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, where he had worked since 2011.\nHe was sacked by the Met in July after pleading guilty, but the force is still facing questions over whether chances were missed to prevent his predatory behaviour.\nAfter Ms Everard's murder, the police watchdog announced it was probing alleged failures by the Met to investigate two indecent exposure incidents linked to Couzens in February.\nIn a statement, the Met said it received an allegation of indecent exposure some 72 hours before Sarah was abducted. That crime was allocated for investigation but by the time of Sarah's abduction it was not concluded, the force said.\u202f \nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct is also investigating alleged failures by Kent Police to investigate a flashing incident linked to Couzens in 2015.\nA Scotland Yard review into how Couzens became a police officer in London found that it missed that his car had been linked to an allegation of indecent exposure. \nHe passed vetting processes.\nThe Met said it had asked the policing watchdog to pay \"particular attention to our vetting practices\" in its inspection of the force.\u202f\nBut the force added that \"vetting is a snapshot in time and unfortunately, can never 100% guarantee an individual's integrity\".\nA \"complete overhaul\" of vetting procedures was needed, Ms Sandhu, a former Met chief superintendent, told BBC Radio 4's World, adding that she did not have trust in the Met commissioner to make the necessary changes. \nMeanwhile, Ms Harman, who is chairwoman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, said it was \"not possible\" for Dame Cressida to \"rebuild the shattered confidence of women in the police service\". \nThis month, it was announced that Dame Cressida - the first woman to lead London's police force - will serve an extra two years in her role and remain in post until 2024.\nDays before the announcement, a number of high-profile figures wrote an open letter accusing her of \"presiding over a culture of incompetence and cover-up\".\nMs Patel said there were \"serious questions\" that needed to be answered by the Metropolitan Police - but backed Dame Cressida. \nSpeaking at the Home Office, the home secretary said: \"From the very day that Sarah went missing, I have been, clearly, in contact with the Metropolitan Police and putting forward some questions around the conduct of the potential suspect at the time and all the requirements and checks that should have been put in place.\"\nWhen asked if Dame Cressida should resign, she said: \"I will continue to work with the Metropolitan Police and the commissioner to hold them to account as everybody would expect me to do.\""

      "text": "The RAC motoring group has said the fuel shortage problem continues to ease, although many areas of the UK are still suffering supply issues.\nSmaller fuel stations were still facing major supply issues as drivers fill up for the weekend, the RAC said.\nEarlier, BP said problems at its stations caused by a shortage of HGV drivers was starting to improve.\nIt comes as one of the big fuel delivery firms, Hoyer Petrolog, confirmed it was training army drivers.\nThe RAC said that on Thursday its patrol vehicles dealt with nearly five times the number of out-of-fuel breakdowns than was typical. However, that was down on the 13-times it dealt with on Monday.\nMr Williams said: While the fuel delivery situation continues to improve in many areas, that's sadly not the case right across the country.\n\"Those drivers that rely on independent forecourts, especially where there aren't any supermarkets selling fuel, may still be struggling to fill up.\"\nBP was the first company to warn it had to close some petrol stations due to a shortage of drivers, which has worsened due to Covid and Brexit. But the company said on Friday the situation was \"stabilising\".\nA big fuel delivery supplier to BP forecourts and other outlets, Hoyer, confirmed to the BBC it was training army drivers over the last two days.\nHoyer, which delivers to about 25% of the UK's petrol stations, was not able to confirm how many army personnel were being trained nor when they would start work. However, the army drivers will use a mix of Hoyer and military vehicles to make deliveries, the company said.\nThe UK has been grappling with a fuel crisis that has caused huge queues outside some petrol stations, and forced customers to drive round multiple sites in search of supplies.\nBP said the situation had started to improve over the last few days, adding it was \"working flat out\" to keep sites across the country supplied. \nWhile the government and retailers say there is enough fuel at UK refineries, a shortage of drivers has slowed the transport of fuel to petrol stations.\nThe haulage industry says an existing shortage of lorry drivers has been made worse by a number of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, low wages and poor working conditions.\nSpeaking on the BBC's Today programme, policing minister Kit Malthouse said: \"My latest briefing is that the situation is stabilising, that we are seeing more forecourts with a greater supply of fuel and hopefully that, as demand and supply come better into balance over the next few days, week or so, that we will see a return to normality.\"\nHe added that if the situation started to deteriorate again, Prime Minister Boris Johnson would review matters.\nHowever, Labour leader Kier Starmer said it was time for \"emergency action\" as the \"chaos\" looked set to continue.\nHe said: \"We're going to see this driver shortage problem coming back again in different sectors. \n\"By the government's own admission, their scheme won't be up and running for weeks with the first HGV drivers not on the roads until November. This simply isn't good enough.\"\nHe called for the use of the military to get petrol to areas of the country in most need, and for fuel stations with supplies to extend opening hours for NHS shift staff and other key workers.\n\"Normally a tanker would last three to four days, but now it's selling out in 12 hours,\" says Danyal Shoaib, who runs a petrol station near Leatherhead, in Surrey. In the last week he says they've run dry three times.\n\"I think social media has played a massive part. As soon as anyone sees a tanker, they stick it online and the queues develop all the way down the road,\" he says.\nMr Shoaib says he's been surprised by the abuse he and his colleagues have faced from \"a significant minority\" of customers. \n\"A man tried to bypass the queue and when I politely asked him to join the end, he tried to drive his car into me to get me to move,\" he says. After he asked the man to calm down, he was then subjected to abusive language including \"quite obscene racial slurs\", he adds. \nDespite this, Mr Shoaib says they've had \"loads of lovely messages\" thanking them, and seen huge relief on people's faces when they can fill up. \nAt his petrol station, he says demand remains high: \"What we're saying to people is, if you can, please be reasonable. If you can make do with half a tank or three quarters of a tank, please do that.\"\nThe BBC understands that demand at supermarkets Asda and Morrisons is also easing, continuing a trend seen throughout the week.\nA Morrisons spokesperson said: \"It is a rapidly moving situation and we are working hard with our suppliers to ensure we can continue to keep our pumps open and serve our customers.\"\nSainsbury's, which has more than 300 sites in total, said that it was still experiencing high demand for fuel. \n\"We're working closely with our supplier to maintain supply and all our sites continue to receive fuel,\" a spokesperson said.\nTesco added: \"We have good availability of fuel, and we're working really hard to ensure regular deliveries to our petrol filling stations across the UK every day.\"\nThe firm operates 500 petrol stations, with another 200 managed by Esso with a Tesco Express store on-site.\nAn Esso spokesman told the BBC that a number of its Tesco Alliance sites were affected.\n\"The picture is constantly changing, but the situation at the 200 Esso Tesco Alliance sites is stabilising and continues to improve in terms of fuel availability,\" they said.\nLike a car running low on petrol, the situation at the pumps seems to have slowed and possibly stalled. \nFuel demand is still far from normal and the picture is very patchy. \nWhile there are hopeful noises from some areas of the industry that fuel is getting through, those who are selling it are still seeing queues, particularly in London and the south east. \nThe situation is not as bad as last weekend, but it still isn't over. The messaging could be tricky for the government. Tell everyone the crisis is solved before it dies down, and ministers risk losing the public's trust. \nThe question now is what will reassure the public to go back to normal buying? \nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 petrol stations\nIt said on Friday there had been little change for its members who are independent fuel retailers. \nIts survey of 1,100 sites across the UK found that 26% had neither petrol nor diesel in stock, down slightly from 27% on Thursday.\nGordon Balmer, its executive director, said: \"Whilst the situation is similar to recent days, there are signs it is improving, but far too slowly. \n\"Independents, which total 65% of the entire network, are not receiving enough deliveries of fuel compared with other sectors.\"\nMr Balmer said he believed queues were likely until independent retailers started getting more frequent deliveries.\nIn an attempt to limit disruption, the government has confirmed that 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers can receive temporary UK visas, with the scheme ending on Christmas Eve.\nA temporary relaxation on drivers' hours has also been extended until 31 October. This allows the daily driving limit to be increased from nine hours to 10 hours up to four times in a week. \nA government spokesperson said it had taken \"immediate action\" to increase the supply of HGV drivers and relieve the pressure on petrol stations.\n\"We recognise the challenges facing industry and streamlined the testing process in July to boost the number of drivers,\" they said, adding that it was important people continued to buy fuel as normal."

Rangers has also said the match with Hibs on Sunday at Ibrox will be used as a \"test event\" and no supporters will be refused entry due to vaccine status.\nThe new rules came into effect at 05:00 on Friday - but the government announced earlier this week that they would not actually be enforced until 18 October. \nThe NHS Scotland Covid Status app only became available to download on Apple and Android devices at about 17:30 on Thursday.\nOpposition parties have described the rollout as a \"shambles\", and questioned why the government had launched the app when it did not work.\nThe Scottish government said that by the end of Thursday more than 70,000 people had downloaded the app, which is used to show proof that people have had two doses of vaccine in order to enter nightclubs and many other large events. \nIt said it had since increased the capacity of the NHS systems that sit behind the app.\nMr Yousaf told BBC Scotland: \"I know it is frustrating because a lot of people have downloaded the app.\n\"I regret any inconvenience caused to anybody, be it an individual or business, but that shouldn't stop you from going about your activities over the course of the next few days.\n\"Largely, the issues are down to volume of traffic but what I would say if you're having persistent problems do feel free to call the Covid helpline.\"\nHe added: \"We always stress test these things before they go live and we have done so but actually, once it goes live, in the real world there can be these glitches and my hope is those glitches should be resolved - we hope in a matter of hours, but it may be a matter of days.\"\nThe vaccine certification scheme will require venues to put in place a \"reasonable system\" to check the status of customers over the age of 18, with certain exemptions on medical grounds.\nVenues affected include nightclubs, unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event with more than 10,000 people in attendance.\nMany people experienced problems with the app when they tried to use their NHS CHI number to register.\nThis step comes after users are asked to take a picture of their passport or driving licence.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there should be an \"indefinite delay\" to the rollout of the new scheme to avoid a \"weekend of chaos\" at venues across the country.\nHe added: \"Thousands of people will be at the football and going out to hospitality premises this weekend.\n\"This plan should really be scrapped altogether but, if the SNP insist on charging ahead, they must indefinitely delay the vaccine passport scheme until the most basic issues are ironed out.\"\nScottish Labour health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the launch of the app had been a \"complete shambles\", adding: \"It is typical of the SNP to rush this out when it clearly doesn't work.\"\nPeople have been sharing their experiences of trying to download the new vaccine passport app. \nDean of the Faculty of Advocates, Roddy Dunlop QC, described the app as the \"worst I have ever tried to use\". \nHe wrote on Twitter: \"I am not prone to hyperbole. I promise.\n\"And I instantly recognise that I was originally instructed to challenge the introduction of Covid passports and so am not neutral.\n\"But try the app. This is, literally, the worst app I have ever tried to use.\" \nAnother app user shared screenshots of his experience on Twitter during which he was told \"no match found\" followed by: \"Something went wrong. We're working on it.\"\nOthers reported issues getting past the initial log in page, while a BBC Good Morning Scotland listener told the programme that he had tried twice to download the app without success.\nHe added: \"It just isn't suitable for purpose at the moment, they should have known it was going to happen in the first place.\"\nMike Rhodes, of the IT firm ConsultMyApp, said he thought the servers being used for the app were being overloaded because of demand, but said this should have been anticipated. \nHe said: \"It is highly likely that those developers that built the app shell also built the interface to the back-end servers that ended up failing. \n\"Secondly, this wasn't an unforeseen event - the developers absolutely knew this would be downloaded incredibly quickly and was likely to get hundreds of thousands of people attempting to register at the same time.\"\nMr Rhodes questioned why there was \"so little time\" between the app being launched and it being needed for entry into events. \nPaul Banham, of Glasgow's Buff Club, told BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live: \"We'll be having a look at them over the next few weeks but we won't be refusing entry if someone doesn't have it - there's too many glitches at the moment. \n\"We've had a lot of students contact us and a lot of them are saying they have been vaccinated in other areas of the UK and that is not showing on their Covid status so there's a few gaps at the moment and hopefully they will be ironed out.\""
