      "text": "An industrial tower is to be demolished after a last-minute conservation listing was quashed by the new culture secretary hours after her appointment. \nPlans to destroy the Dorman Long structure on the former Redcar steelworks site were revealed by Redcar and Cleveland Council a week ago.\nHistoric England then advised it should be granted Grade II-listed status.\nNow, in one of her first acts in the role, Nadine Dorries has revoked this saying it did not \"merit\" listing.\nTees Valley Combined Authority (TVCA) and the Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen had lodged an appeal against the listed status, alongside the request to the secretary of state for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to intervene. \nMr Houchen said: \"I would like to send a message to those that think trying to stop these developments is the right thing to do - our heritage does not lie in a rotting coal bunker, our heritage lies in the people that built this great region.\n\"It lies in the structures that stand tall across the world, from The Shard, Sydney Harbour Bridge and One World Trade Centre.\"\nHe later claimed that, if the Brutalist-style concrete tower had been allowed to remain, it \"would have cost the taxpayer in excess of \u00a39m\".\nThe South Tees Development Corporation, which has responsibility for developing the Teesworks site, said the 183ft (56m) tower would be demolished in the early hours of Sunday. \nThe coal bunker, which was built in the 1950s and could store 5,000 tonnes of fuel, will be razed along with other buildings on the site in a series of controlled explosions between 00:00 and 02:00 BST.  \nCampaigners against the destruction had argued the tower was a monument to Teesside's industrial past.\nTV architect George Clarke said it was \"heart-breaking news\", adding: \"We've lost way too many buildings in the North East that celebrate our incredible industrial past.\"\nHe said it was a \"unique building and should be saved\".\nLabour's former candidate to be Tees Valley mayor, Jessie Joe Jacobs, accused Ms Dorries of \"cultural vandalism\".\n\"The Dorman Long tower is one of UK's best examples of brutalist architecture and a proud symbol of Teesside's industrial heritage. This is just tragic,\" she wrote.\nHowever, correspondence seen by the Local Democracy Reporting Service showed the culture secretary had judged the building \"not of sufficient architectural or historic interest to merit listing\".\u00a0\nShe ruled that the loss of fabric from the building reduced its architectural interest and made it \"essentially a functional structure\".\u00a0\nThe tower sits near the South Bank coke oven battery on the former Redcar SSI steelworks site, which closed in 2015 with the loss of thousands of jobs.\nThe ovens will now make way for a new wind turbine manufacturing facility being built by LM Wind, a subsidiary of GE renewable energy.\nA statement from Historic England said: \"We recognise the importance of the public benefits that will come from the remediation and planned regeneration of the whole Teesworks site.\u00a0\n\"We also accept, with regret, that demolition of the tower is now likely to proceed but we are keen to continue supporting local partners as works progress.\"\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

However, I now feel the time has come to say goodbye. \n\"Emmerdale will always remain special to me. I've been treated with respect and kindness and I've had the very best friends and colleagues, both past and present. I'll miss everyone dearly.\"\nJohn Whiston, head of continuing drama and of ITV in the North, called the actress \"the natural heart and centre of the Sugden family\".\nHe added: \"It's a role she has made so totally her own, bringing compassion, humour and credibility to her portrayal of Diane. Whenever she's on screen, as a viewer, you just let out a contented sigh and say to yourself, 'The Queen is on her throne and all is well with the world.'\"\nHe added that actors don't \"get to stay in a soap that long\" unless they are \"truly professional\" and a really, really lovely person\".\n\"Liz is both,\" he said. \nThe actress also appeared on ITV's Coronation Street from 1996 to 1998 as well as BBC comedy The Liver Birds from 1975 to 1979.\nAnd she played the character T Bag in the ITV children's shows about a witch-like character and her assistant T Shirt, during the late 1980s. \nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "The Taliban appear to have shut down the women's affairs ministry and replaced it with a department that once enforced strict religious doctrines.\nOn Friday, the sign at the ministry was removed, and a sign for the ministry of virtue and vice put in its place.\nVideos on social media showed women employees outside the offices, urging the Taliban to let them return to work. \nDuring the Taliban rule in the 1990s, the ministry forced strict Islamic rules and harsh restrictions on women.\nIn the last 20 years Afghan women have fought for and gained a number of basic rights, but there are now fears that progress is being upended by the Taliban's new all-male interim government.\nThe BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet, in Kabul, says that while Taliban leaders have made promises that they understand Afghanistan has changed - and that so have they - there seems to be a growing mismatch between promises and policies.\nHuman rights groups have previously criticised the virtue and vice ministry for silencing dissent, violently enforcing restrictions on citizens - especially women and girls - and spreading fear and distrust throughout communities. \nBut Taliban members say the institution is important: \"The main purpose is to serve Islam. Therefore, it is compulsory to have [a] Ministry of Vice and Virtue,\" a Taliban member, Mohammad Yousuf, told the New York Post.\nIts full name, according to the new sign on the Kabul compound, is the Ministry for Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice.\nIt was already in existence before the Taliban first came to power, but it expanded during their rule between 1996 and 2001. \nThe ministry was responsible for deploying so-called morality police onto the streets to enforce the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islamic religious law, known as Sharia.\nIt became known for beating women who it perceived were dressed \"immodestly\", or who were outside without a male guardian. Girls were not allowed to be educated past primary school - a measure the group has now reportedly reintroduced.\nEntertainment like music and dancing was banned, and activities such as playing chess or flying a kite were prohibited. Prayer times were strictly enforced, men were made to grow beards, and Western-style haircuts were frowned upon.\nAnyone found to have violated the rules was harshly punished - flogging, beatings, amputation and public execution were not uncommon.\nTwo Taliban members in Kabul told The Washington Post newspaper that they did not expect the Taliban to use force in the same way the group had in the past, and that its enforcers would not be police or soldiers.\nThe ministry was disbanded after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, although then-President Hamid Karzai re-established a similar but less powerful department in 2006 following pressure from conservatives.\nAt the time, Human Rights Watch called the ministry a \"notorious symbol of arbitrary abuses\".\nFemale staff who worked at the women's affairs ministry compound said they had been trying to come back to work for weeks, but had been locked out of the building.\n\"For women, nothing will be there anymore,\" one worker said. \"All of us have responsibilities for our families... We are educated and do not want to confine ourselves to the house.\"\nTaliban officials have said that under their new government, women will be allowed to study and work in accordance with the group's interpretation of Islamic religious law. \nWomen have been told to stay at home until the security situation improves, and Taliban fighters have beaten women who were protesting against the all-male interim government.\n\"When there is no ministry, what should an Afghan woman do? Is their [Taliban] conscience agreeable if Afghan women beg on the roads?\", another woman said outside the compound."

      "tags": "Scottish government,John Swinney,Scottish Parliament,Vaccine passports",
      "text": "People in Scotland will need proof they have been fully vaccinated before they can enter nightclubs and many large events from 1 October.\nThe vaccine passport plan was formally approved by Holyrood after the SNP and Greens voted in favour. \nSome businesses have complained of a lack of detail about how the scheme will work in practice. \nThe proposals were opposed by the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats. \nDeputy First Minister John Swinney said the system would reduce the risk of transmission and help prevent venues - many of which have only recently reopened - from having to close again due to Covid.\nA paper published by the government on Thursday morning, just hours before the vote in the Scottish Parliament, said officials were still working to define what a nightclub actually is.\nAnd it said evidence was still being gathered about the effectiveness of similar schemes elsewhere in the world.\nPeople in England will need to have a \"Covid pass\" to access \"higher risk\" settings such as nightclubs from the end of this month.\nThere are no current plans to introduce a similar scheme in Wales or Northern Ireland.\nThe new rules will mean people over the age of 18 in Scotland will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to: \nIt means that many major sporting events - particularly football matches - will be affected, as will concerts and music festivals.\nPeople who have had two vaccines in Scotland can already download or get a paper copy of a certificate with a QR code.\nBy the end of the month, it is expected that this code will also be available on a new NHS Scotland Status app.\nThese codes can be scanned at a venue to confirm the user is fully vaccinated.\nAnyone who has good reasons for not getting fully vaccinated - including children and people with particular medical conditions - will be exempt. \nA major goal of the scheme is to encourage more younger people to be vaccinated - with the latest figures showing that uptake among those under the age of 40 in Scotland has been lower than older age groups. \nMany areas of Scotland have seen some of the highest Covid rates in Europe in recent weeks - although there are signs that the surge in cases is beginning to slow down.\nThe number of people in hospital and intensive care units has also been steadily rising, with health professionals warning that that NHS is coming under increasing strain.\nMr Swinney said Scotland was in a \"fragile position\" with Covid-19 case rates still high, telling MSPs that \"we all recognise the need to try all we can to protect the return to greater normality that we have experienced in recent weeks\".\nHe said the scheme would reduce the risk of transmission in some settings, allowing those venues to \"operate more safely when the potential alternative would be closure\".\nMr Swinney said it would also protect vulnerable people who cannot be vaccinated, and would encourage others to come forward for a jab.\nHe said: \"On balance - given the benefits to individuals, to the health of the population, and as a way to keep certain venues and events open - a certification scheme is a proportionate step to take.\"\nMr Swinney had been critical of vaccine passports when the proposals for England were unveiled by the prime minister, as had Health Secretary Humza Yousaf and the SNP's partners in government, the Scottish Greens.\nGreens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the facts on the ground had changed - and that the scheme was \"worth considering when cases are running at around 7,000 a day and once the entire adult population has had two doses\".\nHospitality groups have called for more details about how the system will work, while a football supporters association said it was \"concerned about inequalities\" shutting some fans out of games.\nLeon Thompson of the trade body UK Hospitality Scotland told BBC Scotland there had been \"very rushed and hurried conversations with officials\" in recent days, with members \"very concerned\" about the practicalities of the plans.\nDr Liz Cameron, chief executive of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said it would \"directly impact on consumer confidence and risks creating further financial damage to those sectors who have already been hardest hit by Covid-19\".\nCBI Scotland director Tracy Black said vaccine passports had the potential to be \"a useful tool in managing risk in large venues\" - but that there needed to be \"close cooperation and coordination\" with businesses.\nThe Scottish Tories voted against the proposals despite the Conservative UK government planning to introduce a similar system.\nLeader Douglas Ross said not enough detail had been provided about the Scottish scheme, and that the government should not be asking MSPs to \"impose\" a vaccine certification scheme on establishments it was not able to define.\nHe said: \"A responsible government should bring forward proposals that are able to be enacted.\n\"We are in a really difficult position as politicians seeking to make a decision on an extremely difficult subject if the government cannot even give us simple information.\"\nScottish Labour also opposed the plans, with deputy leader Jackie Baillie saying there was a \"practical question about the government's ability to even implement this\".\nShe said people with a vaccination certificate could still have the virus and be infectious, saying ministers were in danger of giving people a false sense of confidence that they were \"invincible\".\nMs Baillie said the government should \"not simply reach for anything just to be seen to take action, and end up making things worse\".\nAnd Alex Cole-Hamilton said his Scottish Liberal Democrats were \"fundamentally opposed to the plans, which he said set the country on a \"disturbing and illiberal course\".\nHe added: \"Medical ID cards will be introduced by this coalition tonight and liberals will immediately begin the campaign to see their abolition.\""

      "text": "The widow of a man who took his own life after the stress of running a care home during Covid is calling for a public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic. \nLouise Hough, who co-ran Gwastad Hall nursing home in Cefn-y-Bedd, Flintshire, said they had no testing, oxygen or PPE.\nMrs Hough's husband, Vernon, killed himself on 21 May 2020.\nThe Welsh government said it would act on the UK-wide inquiry's findings.\n\"The World Health Organization stressed that we tested, tested, tested. There was no testing in the nursing home at all at that time,\" said Mrs Hough.\nShe said the couple resorted to sending staff as far as Manchester Airport to get drive-through tests.\nOn 28 April 2020, the UK government announced Covid testing would be extended to all staff and residents in England, even for those who did not have symptoms.\nThat was not the case in Wales, with First Minister Mark Drakeford saying he saw \"no value\" in providing tests to everybody in care homes at the time.\n\"That was a pivotal moment for me and Vernon,\" said Mrs Hough, part of the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice group. \n\"We were watching it on the television... we just stopped speaking, Vernon and I, and we just thought, 'where do we go from there?'\n\"We were walking through mud and the government really decided, 'you are out there on your own'. \n\"There was no help. There was no help coming from anywhere.\"\nIt was not until 16 May where the then Health Minister Vaughan Gething brought in blanket testing for staff and care home residents. \nThe changes resulted from \"emerging evidence and scientific advice\", Mr Gething said at the time.\nTwelve Gwastad Hall residents died in those first few months of the pandemic, but Mrs Hough said she was still unsure of how many died because of Covid. \nShe said she believed her husband's distress at seeing the patients struggling led directly to his death.\n\"Vernon is a victim of Covid, he never actually caught it that we know of, but being around it and nursing patients with Covid... there was nothing else that could make him so unhappy.\"\nMrs Hough said she wanted the Welsh government held to account and \"wants answers\".\nMary Wimbury, chief executive of Care Forum Wales which represents health and social care providers, said it was important the story about how the sector was affected by Covid-19 was told and \"lessons are learned\".\nShe said, despite the Hough family's tragedy, their experience was not \"atypical\" and she also felt early testing could have made a \"phenomenal\" difference.\nMrs Hough sold Gwastad Hall in January and has since retired, a plan she had made with her husband.\n\"He would have loved being retired. We worked in the nursing home for 33 years, coming up 34. He was looking forward to retirement. There were a lot of plans we had for the future. It was sadly not to be.\" \nIn May, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs an independent public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic would be held in spring 2022. \nMr Drakeford previously said he believed a UK-wide inquiry was the best way to properly scrutinise the decisions made by the Welsh government and other public sector organisations in Wales.\nIn a statement, a Welsh government spokesperson said: \"A UK-wide inquiry will have the capacity and force to oversee the interconnected nature of the decisions that have been made across the four nations. \n\"The first minister has written directly to the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster about the many specific issues the inquiry must focus on to deal comprehensively with the actions of the Welsh government.\"\nThe BBC Action Line has links to organisations which can offer support and advice"

Both of us were very distressed. He's a very unwell man so this is going to be reoccurring - but one of these days our luck is just going to run out.\n\"The ambulance crew were absolutely amazing, but they were run ragged. When I went to the hospital there were nine ambulances outside the hospital waiting to admit people - that's nine crews that are off the road for hours.\"\nBrian from Troon said he was proud of his daughter who is an emergency call handler - but often hears of frustrated people becoming \"abusive\" to staff when they are told their cases are not high priority.\n\"It's reducing them to tears,\" said Brian. \"The staff are coming home looking for someone to talk to about it. \n\"Luckily the ambulance service have got it covered - supervisors listen in to the calls and say that's not acceptable and will cut them off and take the call themselves. They also look at the welfare side of things, they are such a good service. Abuse is totally not acceptable.\n\"It's their professionalism that gets them through this - they have sympathy with their callers, they try to calm them and in some cases they save people's lives until the ambulance arrives, whether it be someone having a stroke or having a baby.\"\nThe head of the Scottish Ambulance Service has previously apologised to patients over increased waiting times, saying staff were working under \"unprecedented pressure\" due to a \"huge increase\" in both Covid and non-Covid cases.\nPauline Howie said the service was \"at full capacity\" and hospitals were too, meaning it takes longer to hand over patients at emergency departments - creating delays in responding to other calls.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the ambulance service was \"in crisis\", and said cases like that of Mr Brown \"shouldn't be happening in Scotland in 2021\".\nHe also called for Health Secretary Humza Yousaf to withdraw comments he made on BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday, when he said people should \"think twice\" about whether they really needed an ambulance before calling for one. \nMs Sturgeon said the ambulance service was already \"operating at its highest level of escalation\" in response to current pressures, and said Mr Yousaf's comments reflected others made by services \"in every part of the UK\".\nLabour leader Anas Sarwar raised the same case, describing it as an \"avoidable human tragedy\".\nHe said Ms Sturgeon should not use the pandemic as an excuse, adding: \"There is a simple truth - nobody should be left to die on the floor while waiting 40 hours for an ambulance.\"\nMs Sturgeon said governments across the world were dealing with similar problems at the moment, and that her administration was \"absolutely focused\" on providing solutions.\nMeanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton called for the military assistance to be deployed swiftly, saying the government had \"done too little, too late\"."

Man Utd will pay the striker's previous club Juventus an initial \u20ac15m (\u00a312.8m) for his services, as part of a deal which could rise to \u20ac23m over five years.\nMr Woodward, executive vice chairman, said the Ronaldo deal, along with the signings of Raphael Varane, Jadon Sancho and Tom Heaton, were \"made possible by the strength of our operating model, with sustained investment in the team underpinned by robust commercial revenues\". \n\"While the financial impact from the pandemic is visible, our continued underlying strength is also clear to see and everyone associated with the club can be proud of the resilience we have shown through these most testing of times,\" he said.\n\"These signings have demonstrated our continued ability to attract some of the world's best footballers to Old Trafford, and our firm commitment to helping Ole deliver success on the pitch.\"\nIn April, thousands of United supporters gathered outside Old Trafford to protest against the club's owners for their involvement in the short-lived European Super League (ESL).\nProtestors called for the Glazer family to leave the club, after United became one of the 12 founding members of the competition.\nCo-chairman Joel Glazer apologised and admitted the distant nature of the club's American ownership \"was not right\" when he spoke to 11 representatives on a virtual fans forum - the first time any representative of the family had engaged with supporters since the bought the club in 2005.\nThe club's total revenues for the year to June dropped from \u00a3509m to \u00a3494.1m.\nUnited reported a net loss of \u00a392.2m for the period - up from \u00a323.2m in 2020 -  which was largely down to the accounting impact of a \u00a366.6m tax charge.\nLast year, United said it suffered a \u00a370m drop in expected revenue, from \u00a3627.1m to \u00a3509m, as a direct result of the pandemic.\nMr Woodward, will step down from his role at the end of 2021, said while Man Utd was \"confident\", it remained clear that \"football as a whole faces major financial challenges caused by years of material inflation in wages and transfer fees, exacerbated by the impact of the pandemic\".\n\"We are committed to working within the Premier League, the ECA and UEFA to promote greater financial sustainability at all levels of the game,\" he said.\n\"Global demand for live football is as strong as ever, as evidenced by the robust level of recent domestic and international broadcasting rights deals and record engagement with our own club content. \n\"But no club can succeed on its own. We want to be part of healthy, vibrant domestic and European football pyramids, working together with our governing bodies and, most importantly, the fans, to preserve and enhance the magic of our game.\""

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "Health officials are urging people to get a flu vaccination this winter.\nMore than 40 million people will be offered the jab, amid fears the months ahead could see a surge in flu alongside a rise in Covid cases.\nIn England the flu vaccine is being offered free to:\nFor most people the flu vaccine will be be offered via GPs, midwives and schools. Eligible patients can also book an appointment at a pharmacy.\nHealth officials in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales plan to cover similar groups - with some variation.\nIn Scotland, teachers, nursery teachers and support staff in close contact with pupils are being offered the jab. \nIn Northern Ireland secondary school children in their first year can have the vaccine. Older children are eligible if they are at risk.\nPeople not included in these groups can pay for a flu vaccine at pharmacies or some supermarkets, at a cost of about \u00a315.\nHowever, officials say vaccine supplies will be prioritised for people most at risk.\nFor many people it will typically last about two weeks, and get better on its own.\nHowever, for some, flu can be very serious - particularly for older adults, very young children and people with underlying health conditions.\nThe added concern this year is that some of these people are also at greater risk of getting seriously ill from Covid.\nAnnual flu deaths vary each year, depending on the strain and other factors. Social distancing is likely to have helped to keep the number low last year. \nThere were more than 22,000 estimated deaths in the 2017-18 season, but just under 4,000 deaths in 2018-19.\nIt can be hard to tell if you have flu or coronavirus as they sometimes share similar symptoms, including:\nSome people may also experience muscle aches, a headache, sore throat and diarrhoea and vomiting with flu. \nBut these symptoms can be seen with other common winter viruses too. \nIf any doubt, it's best to get a test.\nFlu and coronavirus can also be spread before people have symptoms.\nYes, in which case you are more likely to be seriously ill.\nResearch shows those infected with both viruses are more than twice as likely to die as someone with Covid alone.\nAbout 30 million people in the UK are being offered a booster jab against Covid, including the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions. \nThey may be offered the flu and booster jab at the same time - but only if it's practical.\nDeputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam has said that it's safe to have both jabs simultaneously, and doesn't affect how well they work. \nMost side-effects are mild and only last a day or two, including a slightly raised temperature, muscle-ache and a sore arm where the needle went in. \nAllergic reactions are rare but you should avoid the vaccine if you have previously had a serious allergic reaction to a flu vaccine. \nPeople who have allergies to eggs should consult their pharmacist or GP to get a low-egg or egg-free vaccine. \nIt is best to avoid the vaccine if you are ill with a high temperature. You should re-book for when you are fully recovered.\nThere are several types of flu vaccine. \nChildren will typically be offered the vaccine via a a nasal spray. Adults are offered injections. \nFor adults aged 65 and over the most common vaccine includes an extra ingredient that triggers a stronger response from the immune system.\nIf you are getting your vaccine on the NHS, experts say you will be offered the one that is most effective for you - depending partly on your age and taking into account vaccine stocks.

      "tags": "Grenfell Tower fire,Construction industry,Grenfell Tower Inquiry,UK fire safety",
      "text": "Leaked test results suggest the government and construction industry had early evidence of the dangers posed by cladding, 13 years before the Grenfell Tower fire. \nPanels, commonly used on buildings in the UK, failed fire tests carried out in 2004. \nThe results, marked \"Commercial in confidence\", were circulated within an industry advisory group. \nThey were recently passed to the BBC and, until now, never made public. \nHundreds of thousands of flat owners are now threatened with large bills because of construction materials which pose a risk in fires. \nThe 2004 results were among the first from a British test of full-scale building systems, developed in the late 1990s when there were growing concerns in Parliament about the risks of cladding. \nThe tests were part of research commissioned by the then Labour government to determine what standards building systems should have to meet. \nFive cladding systems were tested, including one with aluminium panels, although the primary aim was not to assess the risk of particular designs\nThe aluminium and plastic cladding at Grenfell has been blamed for spreading the fire. \nTwo were constructed from high pressure laminate (HPL) boards, formed from wood, or paper fibre, widely used on modern apartment blocks in the UK.\nIn the tests, all five cladding systems were judged to have failed against \"proposed performance criteria\".\nMost of the tests were carried out without using \"fire breaks\" - extra components which should be fitted to block the spread of flames. \nHowever, fire breaks were used in one high pressure laminate panel system, but it still failed. \nZoe Bartley bought a three-room flat in Chelmsford four years ago, and with her partner Ash, now has a baby.  \nThey are desperate to move to a bigger home, but the cladding crisis means they cannot sell the flat. \nIt has HPL panels, as well as wooden balconies and missing fire breaks, \nZoe finds it \"disgusting\" that the test results were not circulated more widely. \nThe couple are anticipating a bill of tens of thousands of pounds to remove the dangerous materials, which could bankrupt them. \n\"There's no finish line, and it's all-consuming at times,\" Zoe says. \n\"We are very angry that we've been put in this situation. \n\"We've done everything right. Everything by the book: 'Buy a property and set yourself up for the future.'\n\"I might end up bankrupt by the time I'm in my 30s.\"\nHer building is lower than 18 metres, so does not qualify for government funding. \nThe UK Cladding Action Group called the test results \"staggering new evidence which shows the government and its advisers knew these materials were dangerous, but simply stood back and allowed them to be installed on hundreds of thousands of buildings.\n\"The British state knew from this moment on that it was gambling with a disaster in a high-rise, but it chose not to act.\"\nJonathan Evans, director of Ash and Lacy, a major UK supplier of cladding systems, said he had never seen the results, and described them as \"really vital bits of information\" which would have helped assess fire risks after Grenfell. \nHe said that when poor test data is not made public, it creates a bias towards tests with successful outcomes.\n\"We all proceed along the route of thinking these systems are safer than they are, until there's a disaster.\"\nHe said a lack of public information about cladding systems in the 2000s may have resulted in governments not abandoning a controversial British standard for building materials, known as Class 0.  \nThe Grenfell Tower inquiry has heard evidence that this standard was much easier to meet than a stricter European classification, and that keeping it as an option in England and Wales allowed combustible materials to be installed on thousands of buildings.\nIf Class 0 had been abandoned and a ban on combustible materials introduced, Grenfell might not have happened, Dr Evans said.\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) described the 2004 tests as \"experimental... for a different purpose\" than the rounds of testing ordered in the wake of the Grenfell disaster. \nThey were carried out to \"to check the criteria for testing\" rather than to assess the \"intrinsic safety of building materials\", officials said.\nThe findings fed into a review of technical standards used by building designers to assess the safety of cladding. \nAn MHCLG spokesman said: \"We are taking action to improve building safety where successive governments have failed, through our Building Safety Bill, which marks the biggest improvements to building safety in 40 years, with more rights and protections for residents and a \u00a35bn investment to remove unsafe cladding.\n\"The new Building Safety Regulator will enforce a more stringent regulatory regime for buildings over 18m and oversee the safety and performance of all buildings, ensuring products are removed from the market if they do not meet regulation.\"\nThe Building Research Establishment, which carried out the tests and circulated them to the industry advisory group, refused to comment.\nNext month the Grenfell Tower public inquiry will begin examining evidence of what governments knew about the risks of cladding fires before the 2017 disaster, and what they did about it.

We rely on a by-product from their production process to keep Britain's food chain moving,\" Mr Allen said.\nAbout 20 million birds per week are slaughtered, but abattoirs only hold a limited stock of carbon dioxide, British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths said.\n\"With fewer than 100 days to go until Christmas, and already facing mounting labour shortages, the last thing British poultry production needs is more pressure.\n\"If CO2 supplies become tighter and more unpredictable then supply chains will have to slow down. Ultimately, no CO2 means no throughput.\"\nHe said the industry group's members \"are on a knife-edge situation at the moment\".\nMeat processors are working with government to \"mitigate any major impact on a sustainable supply of food\", he added.\n\"This is incredibly serious,\" one supermarket executive told the BBC. \"Some suppliers are telling us they could run out of CO2 in less than two weeks.\"\nIndustry groups and processors also had a meeting with the government on Thursday.\nMeat processors have already been struggling with a shortage of lorry drivers and recruitment problems at abattoirs exacerbated by EU nationals leaving the UK after Brexit.\nCarbon dioxide is used when slaughtering pigs and chickens to stun them, and it is used during the packaging process for all meat to prolong shelf life.\nIt is widely used throughout the food industry, including in brewing.\nHowever, the closure of the two CF Industries plants has cut 60% of the UK's food-grade carbon dioxide supply, the BMPA spokesperson said.\nIt unclear how much carbon dioxide abattoirs and other food factories have stored.\nThe remaining UK carbon dioxide production is being prioritised for the NHS for medical uses, and for the nuclear industry, which uses it as a coolant.\nWithout carbon dioxide, the slaughtering process of pigs and chickens cannot go ahead, the spokesperson said.\nThe Cucumber Growers Association also warned of the effect of high natural gas prices on crops.\nGas is used to heat greenhouses and provide carbon dioxide \"which are both critical factors in growing and achieving the yields required to survive in the modern industry\", it said in an open letter.\nThe \"extreme rise\" in wholesale gas prices has piled costs on growers, it added.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are monitoring this situation closely and are in regular contact with the food and farming organisations and industry, to help them manage the current situation.\""

      "text": "Doctors can judge if under-16s can give informed consent to puberty blocker use, the Court of Appeal has ruled.   \nThe appeal was brought by the Tavistock Trust, which runs the UK's only youth gender identity clinic.\nThe decision reverses a 2020 ruling that under-16s lacked capacity to give informed consent to the treatment, which delays the onset of puberty.\nThe original case was brought by Keira Bell, who says the clinic should have challenged her more over transitioning. \nShe said she was disappointed by the decision, and will seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.\nCourt of Appeal judges said they recognised \"the difficulties and complexities\" of the issue, but that \"it is for the clinicians to exercise their judgement knowing how important it is that consent is properly obtained according to the particular individual circumstances\".\nPuberty blockers are drugs used to \"pause\" puberty by suppressing the release of hormones.\nThey are prescribed to some children who are experiencing gender dysphoria, which the NHS describes as \"a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity\".\nThe Tavistock clinic said it welcomed the decision.\n\"The judgement upholds established legal principles which respect the ability of our clinicians to engage actively and thoughtfully with our patients in decisions about their care and futures,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"It affirms that it is for doctors, not judges, to decide on the capacity of under-16s to consent to medical treatment.\"\nThe Tavistock's Gender Identity Development Service (Gids) said that hormone treatment \"allows a young person time to consider their options and to continue to explore their developing gender identity before making decisions about irreversible forms of treatment\".\nIn December 2020, the High Court ruled under-13s were \"highly unlikely\" to be able to give informed consent to what it described as \"experimental\" treatment and it was \"very doubtful\" those aged 14 and 15 would have the sufficient understanding of the implications.\nKeira Bell, one of the claimants in the case, started taking puberty blockers at the age of 16 after being referred to Gids.  \nShe was later prescribed the male hormone testosterone and had surgery to remove her breasts.\nNow in her mid-20s, she regrets the decision to transition to a male, and feels there wasn't enough investigation or therapy before she reached that stage.\nShe said she had \"no regrets\" about bringing the case, which she said \"shone a light into the dark corners of a medical scandal that is harming children and harmed me. \n\"I am obviously disappointed with the ruling of the court today, and especially that it did not grapple with the significant risk of harm that children are exposed to by being given powerful experimental drugs.\"\nThis a complex, controversial area, yet the Court of Appeal's ruling is very clear. \nIt is for doctors working with families and the children themselves to decide whether that young person can truly understand the implications of taking drugs that could change the course of their life. \nEffectively this ruling has removed the courts from the decision-making process in all but the most difficult cases. \nThis will be welcomed by many young people struggling with their gender identity, who believe the long wait for treatment that they already face is causing huge distress and harm. \nBut for those like Keira Bell, who believe they weren't challenged enough when they made decisions that shaped their futures, there will be real disappointment. \nHowever, the court cases have led to more discussion of the issues - and many will hope that they will also lead to greater understanding. \nIn March, a separate judgement from the court's Family Division had ruled parents could give consent for under-16s to access puberty blockers, with other safeguarding measures considered.\nThe Tavistock temporarily paused new referrals to its endocrinology service following the rulings. \nEligible under-16s who had already been referred for treatment, and have parental consent, are having their cases reviewed by Gids, with decisions overseen by an independent NHS England review group.\nThe NHS said the findings of Dr Hilary Cass's independent review into NHS gender identity services for children and young people would shed further light on the issue.\nThe review was announced in September 2020, when it was said it would take \"12 months or possibly longer\". \n\"The NHS commissioned Dr Hilary Cass to review gender identity services prior to the original High Court ruling to ensure the best model of safe and effective care is delivered - this will set out wide-ranging recommendations including on the use of puberty blockers and the many contested clinical issues identified by the court,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"An independent multi-professional review group will continue to confirm whether clinical decision making has followed a robust consent process now that the endocrine pathway has been reopened by the Tavistock.\" "

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Cabinet reshuffles",
      "text": "Boris Johnson's new cabinet has met for the first time since he fired a string of ministers and brought in new faces in a wide-ranging reshuffle.\nThe prime minister gave his new team what he called \"a half-time pep talk\".\n\"This is the moment when we spit out the orange peel, adjust our gum shields and get back on the pitch,\" he said.\nEarlier this week, Mr Johnson sacked three of his senior ministers including Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland.\nBut there were promotions for Liz Truss who becomes foreign secretary, Nadhim Zahawi is the new education secretary and Nadine Dorries was given the role of culture secretary. \nMichael Gove replaced Robert Jenrick as the new communities secretary. His appointment comes as the government pauses its planning reforms, which have sparked concern among Conservative MPs. \nThe BBC has been told that Mr Gove wants to take stock and discuss concerns with his colleagues.           \nIn the new Cabinet's first meeting, Mr Johnson praised his government as one \"that delivers things people previously thought was impossible\" citing Brexit and the vaccine programme.\nHe also said the government was going to \"get social care done\" and enable \"our NHS to bounce back from the pandemic\" as well as fulfilling \"our fundamental project of uniting and levelling up the whole country\".\nAnd in a joke about the number of children he has, he said: \"I've been thinking about delivery, I've seen a few delivery rooms, probably more delivery rooms than anyone else in this room.\"\nHe added that delivery \"normally involves a superhuman effort by at least one person in this room... but plenty of other people in that room who are essential to the success.\"\nOliver Dowden moved from the culture department to become Conservative co-chair, telling staff at party HQ to start preparing for a general election that could be in 20 months time, according to the Daily Telegraph.\nAsked if Mr Dowden was putting the party on an \"election footing\", Environment Secretary George Eustice said \"I think what Oliver Dowden said is that we should be ready for an election whenever it might come.\n\"We've still got several years left of this Parliament and we've got a lot that we want to achieve.\"\nDominic Raab leaves behind his job as foreign secretary to take up both the justice secretary role and the position of deputy prime minister. \nAccording to the Times this has put him on a collision course with his foreign office successor Ms Truss as both ministers vie for access to the government's country residence, Chevening House in Kent. \nA Downing Street spokesperson said there was a \"long process in place for nominating access\" to the house which would get under way after the reshuffle had been concluded.\nAs part of the reshuffle, a number of long-serving ministers lost their jobs including John Whittingdale at the culture department and education minister Nick Gibb, who had been in the role since 2014.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Whittingdale said he was sad to give up his job, adding: \"I quite recognise the prime minister is keen to have a front-facing cabinet that reflects modern Britain. \n\"Equally it's no bad thing to have a bit of experience around that table and people who have got a good grasp of the detail of the jobs they are being asked to do.\"\nOther ministers returning to the back bench include: Caroline Dinenage, James Duddridge, Luke Hall,  Jesse Norman, Graham Stuart, Justin Tomlinson and Matt Warman.\nPenny Mordaunt lost her job as Paymaster General but was later made a minister in the Department for International Trade.\nConor Burns, a long-term ally of Mr Johnson, had resigned his government job in May 2020 after a report found he used his position as an MP to intimidate a member of the public.\nHowever he now returns to government taking on a ministerial role in the Northern Ireland Office.\nThere were also a promotion for Alex Chalk who moves from being a justice minister to the position of Solicitor General. \nVictoria Atkins becomes a justice minister but will continue to manage the Afghan resettlement scheme, which she took on while at the Home Office.\nThe appointment of Anne-Marie Trevelyan as International Trade Secretary was criticised by Labour who drew attention to the MP's previous tweets denying climate change.\nShadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said \"at least the last trade secretary only hired climate change deniers\", in an apparent reference to former Australian premier Tony Abbott, who is a trade adviser."

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "tags": "Streaming,Netflix,United States",
      "text": "Georgian chess icon Nona Gaprindashvili has filed a defamation lawsuit against Netflix, saying she was incorrectly portrayed in the hit series The Queen's Gambit.\nThe case refers to a sequence in the drama's final episode which says Gaprindashvili, now 80, had never played competitive chess with men.\nThe document says that by 1968, the year in which the episode is set, she had faced at least 59 male players.\nNetflix said the claim had \"no merit\".\nThe company said it had \"only the utmost respect\" for Gaprindashvili and her \"illustrious career\" but that it would \"vigorously defend the case\".\nThe Queen's Gambit is based on the 1983 novel by Walter Tevis and focuses on a fictional chess player called Beth Harmon, played by Anya Taylor-Joy. The series was released last year, becoming what Netflix described as its \"biggest limited scripted series ever\".\nIn the final episode, a commentator mentions Gaprindashvili when describing Harmon: \"The only unusual thing about her, really, is her sex. And even that's not unique in Russia. There's Nona Gaprindashvili, but she's the female world champion and has never faced men.\"\nThe 25-page case filed in the Federal District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday said: \"Netflix brazenly and deliberately lied about Gaprindashvili's achievements for the cheap and cynical purpose of 'heightening the drama' by making it appear that its fictional hero had managed to do what no other woman, including Gaprindashvili, had done.\"\nIt added: \"The allegation that Gaprindashvili 'has never faced men' is manifestly false, as well as being grossly sexist and belittling.\"\nBorn in 1941 in the Georgian town of Zugdidi, Gaprindashvili began playing chess at the age of 13, became female World Championship at 20 and was the first woman to be awarded the title of grandmaster, according to the lawsuit.\n\"By 1968,\" the lawsuit says, Gaprindashvili \"had competed against at least 59 male chess players (28 of them simultaneously in one game), including at least 10 Grandmasters of that time.\"\nGaprindashvili, who lives in Tbilisi and continues to compete in chess tournaments, is seeking $5m (\u00a33.6m) in compensation and the removal of the statement that she had never played against men. The lawsuit says the line had been changed from the book on which the series is based.\nThe Queen's Gambit was viewed in more than 62 million households in the first 28 days after its release, according to Netflix. It won two awards at this year's Golden Globes and has garnered 18 nominations at the Emmy Awards, which will take place this weekend."

      "tags": "Policing,Violence against women,Sarah Everard murder",
      "text": "Tackling violence against women and girls should be as much of a priority as countering terrorism, a police watchdog has said.\nIt has identified major inconsistencies between police forces in how they tackle the issue.\nA report was commissioned by Home Secretary Priti Patel after the murder of Sarah Everard earlier this year.\nPolice say they need more investment to help bring offenders more quickly to justice. \nHer Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) called for \"fundamental cross-system change\" after identifying continuing failings. \nThree-quarters of domestic abuse cases are closed early without the suspect being charged, its report said. \nAccording to official statistics, in the year ending March 2020 there were:\nThe HMICFRS said that the police have made \"vast improvements\" over a decade in dealing with this \"epidemic\" of violence - but there were still staggering variations between police forces. \nIt said a police power which allows officers to tell women that a partner has a history of abuse, known as Clare's Law, was used so differently by individual forces it amounted to a postcode lottery. \nAnd too often, said the inspectors, police were neither working closely enough with colleagues from other agencies nor giving the threat of violence the resources it deserved. \nThat response sharply contrasted to how police dealt with terrorism and, more recently, county lines drugs gangs. \nThese major crimes, said inspectors, were treated as national priorities, benefiting from a \"clearer focus, better funding and relentless pursuit\" of offenders.  \nOne woman, whose identity we are protecting, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme about the \"restrictive and aggressive\" domestic abuse she faced.\n\"I was very frightened, and had all my civil liberties curbed - where I went, what I did, who I met with, how I spent my money.\n\"I was very much in fear about what the next step what be.\"\nOn the occasions she did call the police, she says it was out of concern for her abuser - who made her feel \"responsible\" for his \"bad moods and angry outbursts\".\nPolice did not understand that this \"was the nature of the abusive relationship\" she says, and officers initially treated the case as mental health-related.\nShe says her abuser threatened to burn the house down and to kill himself, before physically assaulting her.\nHe was arrested, but then released without charge, she explains, adding that a police officer told her that it was a matter of \"he-said-she-said\" and that there was \"no substantial evidence\".\nIt takes a \"huge amount of courage\" to report abuse, she says, and \"the point when someone is released without charge really signifies to the victim that it's not worth ringing the police because they won't do anything.\"\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said police forces must \"learn\" from each other to improve their approach to dealing with violence against women.\nHe told Sky News: \"Obviously Priti Patel will now look at these recommendations but I think this report does highlight some differences between police forces.\n\"What we really need to do is learn from those police forces that are addressing this well - and I think the report highlights that some of them are doing far better than others - and actually try and replicate those approaches that work in parts of the country.\"\nSarah Everard was snatched by Met Police officer Wayne Couzens as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, on 3 March, and was then raped and strangled.\nThe firearms officer has since pleaded guilty to the 33-year-old's murder.\nZoe Billingham, HM Inspector of Constabulary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that police had \"vastly improved\" their response to tackling violence against women and girls in the last seven years.\nBut she warned we would not be able to \"police our way out of the the breadth and depth of crimes being inflicted on women, day in, day out\".\nThere needs to be an \"uplift in the prioritisation\" of violence against women and girls, with a \"bold and radical whole system approach\", she added.\nShe said that councils, courts, teachers and the NHS - among others - should be expected to treat violence against women and girls \"as their business\" and work together to prevent it.\nWhen HMICFRS carried out fieldwork with four forces - Avon and Somerset, Cheshire, Surrey and Humberside - it asked them to each identify 10 serious local offenders who posed an ongoing risk to women. \nOf the 40 individuals identified, 34 had not actually been flagged within the force's intelligence systems as being prolifically dangerous individuals. \nLabour's Harriet Harman, chairwoman of Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights, urged the government to enact the report's recommendations and ensure it doesn't just \"gather dust on the shelf\".\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We need the government to implement this report, to actually put in place the structures that this report proposes, and give it the prioritisation and we also need them to ensure that the resources are there.\"\nRefuge, a charity providing support for women and children experiencing domestic violence, said for too long there had been a failure to implement recommendations that would improve how violence against women and girls (VAWG) is tackled.\nRuth Davison, Refuge's chief executive, said: \"This must change. The report rightly calls for 'radical action' and we hope that the home secretary, who has commissioned this report, will look at the recommendations carefully and respond accordingly.\"\nAssistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe, the National Police Chiefs' Council leader on violence, said the report set out a \"clear way forward\" for change and that there was \"no lack of commitment\" for this work.\nShe insisted that forces were recognising violence against women and girls as a \"significant priority\", adding that chief constables were signing up to a national violence against women and girls strategy and a co-ordinator would be employed to to ensure the report's recommendations were implemented.\nResponding to the report, Home Secretary Priti Patel said tackling violence against women and girls was a top priority for the government.\nShe said: \"Our VAWG Strategy, which commits to radically changing how we end abuse using a whole system approach, focuses on working with key agencies including police, healthcare and education. \n\"We have already taken essential action including introducing a national police lead for tackling VAWG and making Relationship Education compulsory in all primary schools.\"\nThe Association of Police and Crime Commissioners said the way police responded to violence against and girls had improved in recent years, but consistency and improvements were still needed. \nSophie Linden, London's deputy mayor for policing and crime and joint victims' lead for the APCC, added: \"The numbers of cases closed without a suspect being charged - either because of evidential difficulties or because the victim does not support a prosecution - shows that too many victims are still being let down.\" \nIf you or someone you know has been affected by any of the issues in this article, information and support is available via the BBC Action Line.\nAdditional reporting by Mary O'Connor."

      "text": "The Wanted's Tom Parker says he refuses to let cancer dominate his life, almost a year after being diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour.\n\"It's not that I'm ignoring cancer but I just don't want to pay it any attention,\" he told BBC Breakfast. \n\"The more attention you pay it, the more it consumes your life and I don't want to consume my life. \n\"I've got kids, I've got family. So I just try and just ignore it as much as possible.\"\nThe star was speaking to the BBC ahead of a special charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall on Monday.\nAll proceeds will be split equally between Stand Up To Cancer and the National Brain Appeal.\nThe fundraiser will feature Ed Sheeran, Sigrid, Liam Payne and McFly as well as the first appearance for more than seven years by The Wanted.\n\"That came out of nowhere to be honest with you,\" said Parker, who thought the band would never return from the \"indefinite hiatus\" they announced in 2014.\nDiscussions about a reunion initially took place in 2020, but were put on hold by the pandemic and Parker's cancer diagnosis. \nBut after playing four songs at Monday's charity show, they will release a greatest hits album and embark on a 12-date UK tour next March.\n\"I'm pretty scared, to be honest, but at the same time very excited,\" said Parker.  \"We've been together a little bit over the last few weeks and the chemistry's still the same.\"\nAnd while playing for fans again has got him excited, another part of life on the road holds equal allure.\n\"Do you know what I'm looking forward to? Sleeping on the tour bus again,\" he laughs. \"It was all cosy and stuff. I loved it, I loved our time on the tour bus, probably just as much as being on stage.\"\nThings will be different this time around, though. Although Parker's tumour shrunk after six cycles of chemotherapy and 30 rounds of radiation, it is still very much there. \nOne of the side-effects is limited movement on his left-hand side. \n\"That's hard at times, when you've [got] stilted walking and you can't move your arm properly,\" he said.\n\"I was a bit of livewire on stage. So this time it's probably going to be a little calmer,\" he says. \"But The Wanted were never really known for their dancing.\"\nThe 33-year-old achieved fame in the early 2010s as one-fifth of The Wanted, reaching number one with the singles All Time Low and Glad You Came.\nSince they went on hiatus in 2014, he has played Danny Zuko in a touring production of Grease, and made the semi-finals of Celebrity Masterchef.\nHe married actress Kelsey Hardwick in 2018. The couple have two children, Aurelia and Bodhi, who was born weeks after Parker discovered he had cancer last October. \nThe singer described those initial months of treatment as the loneliest time of his life. \n\"You feel like you want to curl up and die, to be quite honest with you,\" he told BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson.\n\"It took me so long to not be able to be affected by things that I saw online. Every morning I would Google, or go on Twitter and type in glioblastoma, and it would just drag my day down. \n\"Now that I've kind of put that to bed, I'm not as obsessed with it. I'm just learning to live my life a little bit more.\"\nHe said he had struggled with his weight after losing appetite during chemotherapy.\n\"I lost about three-and-a-half stone in about three weeks,\" he recalled. \"That was actually the toughest part, trying to sustain the weight - because obviously you don't have an appetite. \n\"We were trying to stick to a diet, trying to eat as clean as possible - but then, you don't want to eat a salad.\n\"It was like, 'I'll order KFC,' but you don't really want to put stuff like that in your body. It's a bit of a catch 22.\"\nParker said he survived the darkest days thanks to the support of his wife - \"she's a warrior\" -  and paid tribute to the kindness of fans and strangers.\n\"People are just beautiful. They just want to help in any way they can, even just little things like people popping into the shop and bringing you some milk. Just beautiful.\"\nHis bandmates Max George, Siva Kaneswaran, Jay McGuiness and Nathan Sykes have also been \"a great support network,\" he added. \n\"I don't think I would have been able to get by to without their help.\"\nLooking to the future, he is concentrating on raising his young family and planning The Wanted's tour. \n\"It's getting closer by the day. I'm like, 'I probably need to go to the gym and do  some work'. But I'm just excited - just buzzing about everyone's involvement in it.\"\nThe first step will be Monday's concert, dubbed Inside Your Head, where The Wanted will appear alongside Sigrid, KSI and a specially-recorded performance by Ed Sheeran.\n\"I'm genuinely over the moon about it. He's the biggest artist on the planet,\" Parker said. \n\"It means the world - not just to me personally but to our community, for the cancer community, for people who are going through glioblastoma.\"\nParker's hope is that the concert will not just offer encouragement to patients with brain tumours like his, but that it could change the course of their treatment.\n\"No one's been able to find a cure, no one's been able to find a treatment, so we want to focus on trying to get as much money and funding for charities as  possible, so they can try and find new breakthroughs.\n\"It feels like they're on the cusp of doing it. So hopefully this concert can make a change.\"\nSource: The Brain Tumour Charity\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

He was found less than two miles from where he went missing.\nNow living in Edinburgh, the owners are delighted to have 12-year-old Forbes back in their lives.\nThey had searched for their pet for months after he went missing. \nMr Henderson said: \"When Forbes first went missing in March 2011, we were distraught. We'd had him from when he was a kitten and we had such a special bond. He was such a unique and friendly character, we absolutely adored him.\n\"Our friend made posters and we went door-to-door in the area we lived in Rosemount. We asked people to check garages and sheds as we thought he may have just been locked inside.\n\"After eight or nine months, we very sadly had to come to the realisation that the worst may have happened.\"\nHe said he was \"overcome with emotion\" when he learned that Forbes had been found.\n\"My wife phoned when I was on the motorway and she told me I had to pull over. I was completely unprepared for what I was about to be told and hearing that Forbes had been found left me completely astounded,\" said Mr Henderson.\nHe immediately turned the car round to go home. \n\"We travelled to Aberdeen the next day and when he was brought out, I recognised him immediately. Forbes did give me a big cuddle so I'm hopeful that he remembered us.\n\"At the moment, we are just gradually introducing him to our two dogs and two cats. This is just the best outcome for us.\n\"We never thought we would see him again. It's like a closed chapter has just opened up. It's a dream come true.\"\nAnimal rescue officer Greg Stevenson had been called out when Forbes was spotted and said he found the cat to be very friendly. \nHe contacted the phone number on the cat's microchip and got through to Forbes' owners.\nHe said: \"I was amazed to hear how long Forbes had been missing for.\n\"The owners couldn't believe it but were absolutely over the moon - they were just thrilled to hear that Forbes was coming back to them.\n\"We have no way of knowing where Forbes had been all this time or what adventures he might have been on.\""

      "text": "Three Chinese astronauts have returned to Earth after completing the country's longest crewed space mission. \nThey spent 90 days at the Tianhe module on China's space station, some 380km (240 miles) above Earth.\nThe three men had on Thursday boarded the Shenzhou-12 crewed spacecraft and undocked from the space station.\nThe successful mission is another demonstration of China's growing confidence and capability in the space domain.\nNie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Honbo touched down in the Gobi desert in Inner Mongolia at around 13:35 local time (05:35 GMT) on Friday. \nThey had left for space on 17 June, and had lifted off from the same desert. \nWhile in space, the three men completed various tasks including transmitting experiment data back to Earth and conducting hours-long spacewalks, according to China's Global Times. \nThe core module of the space station, where the astronauts lived, is said to have separate living spaces for each astronaut and a space gym equipped with a specifically designed treadmill and bicycle, the Global Times reported quoting China's Aerospace Science and Industry Corp. \nChina has made strides in its space ambitions in recent years. In 2019, it became the first country to send a robotic rover to the far side of the Moon.\nBut it had to develop its own space station, in part because it has been excluded from the International Space Station project. \nThe US, which leads that partnership with Russia, Europe, Canada and Japan, will not co-operate with China in orbit."

      "text": "Queen's University Belfast (QUB) has said it is \"unlikely\" to offer a room to any student living less than 40 miles from the university.\nThey have told students living within that radius to make \"alternative travel and accommodation arrangements\".\nBut students living more than 40 miles away have also been told they may not get a room until mid-October.\nIt was laid out in an email sent to some students who had applied for rooms in halls of residence.\nQUB had previously offered students a \u00a31,500 deal to withdraw from its accommodation.\nIt said due to \"unprecedented\" demand, accommodation in its halls was oversubscribed.\nAbout 3,500 students each year live in halls of residence run by the university.\nOn Wednesday night, some students who had applied for QUB's rooms for the 2021/22 academic year received a further update by email.\nThe university apologised \"for the upset caused by the uncertainty of the past few weeks\" and said it was doing all it could \"to find solutions\".\nQueen's said the financial package to withdraw from accommodation had been accepted by \"several hundred students\" and they were still working to secure additional rooms, including at Ulster University's Jordanstown campus.\n\"In prior years, the 3,400 rooms provided by the university has been enough to meet all our requirements,\" QUB said.\n\"This year, despite securing an additional 770 rooms, we are still unable to meet demand which hopefully gives you some idea of the size of the challenge we have faced.\n\"We continue to work tirelessly to secure other options but it may be mid to late October before some of these become available.\n\"We will be allocating all available accommodation by distance lived from Queen's.\n\"Presently, it is unlikely we will be able to offer a room to anyone who lives within a 40 mile radius of the university.\"\nHowever, students living more than 40 miles from QUB were not guaranteed a room for the start of term.\n\"We strongly advise students who have not yet received an accommodation offer and who live outside the 40-mile radius, to make travel arrangements for the first three to four weeks of term as it is unlikely you will be able to move into your accommodation before mid-October,\" the university email said.\nOne QUB student from Londonderry who contacted BBC News NI said the move would mean they would have to take a bus to Belfast and back every day until then.\nThe university said it would start to make room offers by email from Monday 20 September.\nHowever, if students did not accept within 24 hours their room would be offered to another student.\nQUB also said, however, they were \"working with a range of local hotels\" to enable students to book rooms \"for one or two nights per week\" if necessary."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nChanges to the rules on international travel are expected, with ministers considering simplifying the traffic light system by scrapping the amber list and removing the requirement for fully vaccinated people returning to the UK to take lab-processed PCR tests. The changes would apply to England, initially at least, as the UK's devolved administrations set travel rules for their nations.\nComprehensive analysis suggests long Covid is less common than previously thought, with one in 40 people in a survey reporting coronavirus symptoms lasting at least three months. The Office for National Statistics' previous analysis had suggested one in every 10 people were affected. \nMinisters will decide later whether proof of vaccination will be legally required to enter nightclubs and large events in Wales, as part of the latest review of coronavirus restrictions. However, a nightclub trade body warned the move may damage the industry, while Conservatives and Lib Dems in the Senedd oppose the idea.\nAs a charity says thousands of tenants fell into debt during the pandemic, one woman tells us about her constant fear of eviction. StepChange says 10% of private renters have fallen into arrears, owing nearly \u00a3800 each on average, and is calling for emergency support as the furlough scheme and Universal Credit uplift end. The government says unprecedented action has helped keep people in their homes and it's right for measures to be lifted as the economy reopens.\nA group that launched a \u00a31m Covid-response fund to support the UK's sea-going community says it hopes interest generated by a photography prize will help ensure they have continued access to vital support.

      "text": "A judge has ruled that Prince Andrew's US lawyer can be served with legal papers in a sexual assault case filed by Virginia Giuffre in New York.\nIt follows a dispute over whether the prince has been formally notified of the civil claim against him.\nNew York judge Lewis Kaplan ruled Ms Giuffre's lawyers could take the US route to serve papers on the prince.\nMs Giuffre, 38, claims she was sexually assaulted by the prince at three locations including New York City.\nPrince Andrew, the Queen's 61-year-old second son, has consistently denied the allegation.\nSeparately, the High Court in London has given the prince's lawyers until next Friday to appeal against its decision to serve papers on him in the UK.\nServing of documents is the critical first stage in any claim for damages - it means that a defendant has been made fully aware of the allegations against them by receiving all of the papers in the case. \nIf a defendant does not take part in the case after they have been served, they risk automatically losing.\nJudge Kaplan, whose ruling emerged in public court records overnight, said that given the dispute over whether the papers had been served in London, it was now entirely lawful for him to order that they should be sent to the prince's Los Angeles-based lawyer Andrew Brettler.\nMr Brettler spoke for the prince in a telephone hearing on the case earlier this week - but he was not formally designated as a lawyer who was authorised to accept service for him and pass the material on.\nBut Judge Kaplan ruled: \"Service on the defendant's US counsel is reasonably calculated to bring the papers served to the defendant's attention, regardless of whether his US counsel is 'authorised' to accept service on his behalf.\"\nThe judge noted that Ms Giuffre's lawyers had already proceeded with an attempt to serve the case on Prince Andrew in London under an international convention between the US and UK courts.\nThis request to intervene and assist in handing the documents to the prince was accepted earlier this week at the High Court.\nMaster Barbara Fontaine, a senior English judge who oversees requests from foreign courts for help, has authorised officials to begin the process of serving.\nShe has given the prince's legal team until next Friday to decide if they will challenge her decision to proceed with serving the papers in the UK.\nThe Judicial Office said in a previous statement: \"Lawyers for Prince Andrew have indicated that they may seek to challenge the decision of the High Court to recognise the validity of the Hague Convention request for service made by Ms Giuffre's lawyers.\n\"The High Court has directed that any challenge must be made by close of business on September 24.\"\nA spokeswoman for the prince declined to comment.\nBBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the \"slightly arcane legal tussle\" had ended \"with a victory for Virginia Giuffre's lawyers [and] a defeat for Prince Andrew's lawyers\".\nThis, he said, had drawn Ms Giuffre's civil case \"one step closer to the courtroom - which is exactly where Prince Andrew and his lawyers don't want it to be\".\nMs Giuffre was an accuser of the billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein who died in prison in 2019.\nMs Giuffre - then known as Virginia Roberts - says she was assaulted by the prince at the London home of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Little Saint James, in the US Virgin Islands.\nHer case claims Prince Andrew engaged in sexual acts without Ms Giuffre's consent, including when she was 17, knowing how old she was, and \"that she was a sex-trafficking victim\".\nThe prince has consistently denied the claims and, in 2019, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme: \"It didn't happen.\n\"I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened.\n\"I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\""

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Queen Elizabeth II",
      "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh's will is to remain secret for at least 90 years to protect the \"dignity and standing\" of the Queen, the High Court has ruled.\nIt has been convention for over a century that, after the death of a senior member of the Royal Family, the courts are asked to seal their wills.\nIt means that, unlike most wills granted probate, it will not be open to public inspection.\nThere will be a private process in 90 years to decide if it can be unsealed. \nThe hearing into the application to seal the will was also held in private in July by Sir Andrew McFarlane, the most senior judge in the family courts.\nHe heard arguments from lawyers representing the duke's estate and the attorney general, the government's chief legal adviser, and published his ruling on Thursday.\nSir Andrew said that as president of the Family Division of the High Court, he is the custodian of a safe containing more than 30 envelopes, each containing the sealed will of a dead member of the Royal Family.\nAnd for the first time in more than 100 years, he set out a process by which those wills could be made public.\nSir Andrew said: \"I have held that, because of the constitutional position of the Sovereign, it is appropriate to have a special practice in relation to royal wills.\n\"There is a need to enhance the protection afforded to truly private aspects of the lives of this limited group of individuals in order to maintain the dignity of the Sovereign and close members of her family.\"\nThe judge said he had not seen Prince Philip's will or been told anything of its contents, other than the date of its execution and the identity of the appointed executor.\nHe said he decided to hold the hearing in private because it would be likely to generate \"very significant publicity and conjecture\" that would \"defeat the purpose of the application\".\n\"I accepted the submission that, whilst there may be public curiosity as to the private arrangements that a member of the Royal Family may choose to make in their will, there is no true public interest in the public knowing this wholly private information,\" he said.\nHe said there was no legal reason for any representations from media organisations because the public interest was represented by the attorney general.\nLawyers for Philip's estate argued that news of the hearing and the application \"might generate wholly unfounded conjecture\" which would be \"deeply intrusive\" for the Queen and the Royal Family.\nDetailing the history of previous decisions, Sir Andrew said the first family member whose will was sealed by the court was Prince Francis of Teck, the younger brother of Queen Mary, who died in 1910.\nAccording to the legal and royal expert Michael L Nash, author of Royal Wills in Britain from 1509 to 2008, the new legal mechanism was devised after Prince Francis left valuable emeralds prized by Queen Mary to his mistress, the Countess of Kilmorey.\nAn envelope containing Prince Francis's will resides in the safe held by Sir Andrew, with the most recent additions being those of the late Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, the Queen's sister, who died in 2002.\nIn 2007, a man claiming to be the illegitimate child of Princess Margaret, Robert Andrew Brown, applied to unseal the wills of the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret but his claim was struck out as \"vexatious and an abuse of process\".\nHowever, Sir Andrew amended previous orders, which had sealed royal wills indefinitely, so that they can be inspected privately 90 years after probate was granted.\nThe \"grant of probate\" is an order that allows someone to distribute a deceased person's assets according to their wishes, and normally marks the point where person's will becomes a public document.\nSir Andrew said after 90 years each royal will would be opened and examined by the monarch's private solicitor, the keeper of the Royal Archives, the attorney general and by any personal representatives of the dead person who may still be available.\nThey will decide whether the will may be made public at that stage, but Sir Andrew said some royal wills may never be published, even in part.\nThe unsealing should be conducted by a professional archivist to ensure the documents and seals are properly preserved. Further details of the process will be decided by the court before it begins to unseal the first of the wills.\nThe Queen's solicitor and the attorney general argued that the wills should be sealed for 125 years, but Sir Andrew said that 90 years was \"proportionate and sufficient\" and would mean the risk of publication intruding on the private lives of royals would be substantially reduced.\nSir Andrew said he intends to publish an annex listing the names on the 30 envelopes in his safe, but added that he will not do so until any potential appeal against his judgement has been able to run its course.\nOne name which will not feature is that of Diana, Princess of Wales. Unlike other members of the Royal Family, her will was published after her death in 1997, revealing that the majority of her fortune was being held in trust for her sons until they reached the age of 25."

      "text": "Boris Johnson's new cabinet has met for the first time since he fired a string of ministers and brought in new faces in a wide-ranging reshuffle.\nThe prime minister gave his new team what he called \"a half-time pep talk\".\n\"This is the moment when we spit out the orange peel, adjust our gum shields and get back on the pitch,\" he said.\nEarlier this week, Mr Johnson sacked three of his senior ministers including Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland.\nBut there were promotions for Liz Truss who becomes foreign secretary, Nadhim Zahawi is the new education secretary and Nadine Dorries was given the role of culture secretary. \nMichael Gove replaced Robert Jenrick as the new communities secretary. His appointment comes as the government pauses its planning reforms, which have sparked concern among Conservative MPs. \nThe BBC has been told that Mr Gove wants to take stock and discuss concerns with his colleagues.           \nIn the new Cabinet's first meeting, Mr Johnson praised his government as one \"that delivers things people previously thought was impossible\" citing Brexit and the vaccine programme.\nHe also said the government was going to \"get social care done\" and enable \"our NHS to bounce back from the pandemic\" as well as fulfilling \"our fundamental project of uniting and levelling up the whole country\".\nAnd in a joke about the number of children he has, he said: \"I've been thinking about delivery, I've seen a few delivery rooms, probably more delivery rooms than anyone else in this room.\"\nHe added that delivery \"normally involves a superhuman effort by at least one person in this room... but plenty of other people in that room who are essential to the success.\"\nOliver Dowden moved from the culture department to become Conservative co-chair, telling staff at party HQ to start preparing for a general election that could be in 20 months time, according to the Daily Telegraph.\nAsked if Mr Dowden was putting the party on an \"election footing\", Environment Secretary George Eustice said \"I think what Oliver Dowden said is that we should be ready for an election whenever it might come.\n\"We've still got several years left of this Parliament and we've got a lot that we want to achieve.\"\nDominic Raab leaves behind his job as foreign secretary to take up both the justice secretary role and the position of deputy prime minister. \nAccording to the Times this has put him on a collision course with his foreign office successor Ms Truss as both ministers vie for access to the government's country residence, Chevening House in Kent. \nA Downing Street spokesperson said there was a \"long process in place for nominating access\" to the house which would get under way after the reshuffle had been concluded.\nAs part of the reshuffle, a number of long-serving ministers lost their jobs including John Whittingdale at the culture department and education minister Nick Gibb, who had been in the role since 2014.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Whittingdale said he was sad to give up his job, adding: \"I quite recognise the prime minister is keen to have a front-facing cabinet that reflects modern Britain. \n\"Equally it's no bad thing to have a bit of experience around that table and people who have got a good grasp of the detail of the jobs they are being asked to do.\"\nOther ministers returning to the back bench include: Caroline Dinenage, James Duddridge, Luke Hall,  Jesse Norman, Graham Stuart, Justin Tomlinson and Matt Warman.\nPenny Mordaunt lost her job as Paymaster General but was later made a minister in the Department for International Trade.\nConor Burns, a long-term ally of Mr Johnson, had resigned his government job in May 2020 after a report found he used his position as an MP to intimidate a member of the public.\nHowever he now returns to government taking on a ministerial role in the Northern Ireland Office.\nThere were also a promotion for Alex Chalk who moves from being a justice minister to the position of Solicitor General. \nVictoria Atkins becomes a justice minister but will continue to manage the Afghan resettlement scheme, which she took on while at the Home Office.\nThe appointment of Anne-Marie Trevelyan as International Trade Secretary was criticised by Labour who drew attention to the MP's previous tweets denying climate change.\nShadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said \"at least the last trade secretary only hired climate change deniers\", in an apparent reference to former Australian premier Tony Abbott, who is a trade adviser."

      "text": "Love him or loathe him, Michael Gove has a reputation in government as a man who gets things done.\nOften described as a \"reformer\",  he's been given a pretty hefty brief in Boris Johnson's latest cabinet reshuffle - running the department for housing, communities and local government with added responsibility for \"levelling up\" the UK and defending the union.\nWhile some have called it a sideways move, for others it's a clear sign of the prime minister's faith in his one-time adversary turned ally.\nBoris Johnson has put him in charge of delivering what was a key election promise - addressing regional inequalities and improving people's prospects regardless of where they live.\nThat is no easy task.\nThe \"levelling up\" agenda has been criticised for being too vague, lacking in definition or strategy and failing to set out how success might be measured. \nEarlier this year, Conservative MP Neil O'Brien was appointed as an adviser to give the idea direction, and I understand he's been working internally to try to bring coherence to a concept that spans several departments, with a white paper expected this autumn.\nNow he's been given a ministerial role working alongside Michael Gove, who it seems, has been brought in to boost its profile, give it political clout and put some meat on the bones - I'm told he's been 'itching' to get his hands on a department which allows him to get stuck into operational policy.\nAs Will Tanner, director of the Onward think-tank and former No 10 advisor put it, he is a '\"heavy hitter\" who is now in charge of a department that will be the \"engine\" for the levelling-up agenda.\nBut there are nerves among Tory councillors, who will inevitably be working closely with the new secretary of state.\nI understand the leaders of some of the largest Conservative-run councils were on a call on Thursday morning discussing what his appointment might mean, and there was a distinct sense of uncertainty.\nMichael Gove's radical ideas have not always proved popular.\nDuring his tenure as education secretary he incurred the wrath of many, with controversial reforms that have left him with a toxic reputation among plenty within a sector which he famously branded \"the Blob\".\nHis new brief has got some tricky sticking points, not least the government's highly controversial planning reforms. The government announced on Friday it was \"pausing\" the changes, so that Mr Gove could take stock of concerns.\nThere are some Conservatives who hope that as a Surrey MP Michael Gove will be particularly alive to the political tension around planning.\nThe prospect of what critics see as overdevelopment in Surrey was largely blamed for Tory losses at the local elections in May.\nBut while the government is widely thought to have softened its stance on some of the most controversial aspect of its proposals, Boris Johnson is committed to building more homes.\nIt's seen as a key element of \"levelling up\" - and some in the Conservative Party wonder whether Mr Gove has been given his new job to drive development.\nAs one Tory MP put it, Mr Gove will be \"formidable in that post\", adding: \"We can't tell whether he's been appointed to build any and everywhere regardless of the opposition, or whether he's been appointed to deliver some sort of compromise.\"\nMr Gove will also have to work with Labour-controlled councils.\nOn hearing the news of Michael Gove's appointment, I'm told jokes about his past speeches - and nightclub dance moves - started doing the rounds among Labour councillors. \nThere is real concern, though, that he will introduce radical reform and ride roughshod over opposition.\nOne Labour councillor referred to his \"bad reputation\", saying: \"The fear is he'll fly in, make his mark, and fly out like he did in education.\"\nSome in Labour do privately feel Mr Gove might boost the profile of local government, which has often felt overlooked - particularly in the debate over social care - but few believe his arrival will solve what they see as an unfair funding system.\nOne said the government was \"highly political\" when it came to funding, and though it \"can't get much worse\" they didn't hold out much hope of it getting better. \nI'm told Mr Gove has already responded to backbench Conservative MPs who are concerned about planning reforms, which suggests he's willing to engage, though few yet know his thinking.\nAnd while Mr Gove's supporters say he's a man of action, his critics point to a past willingness to override opposition to achieve his desired outcome.\nThat's proving a worry for some, given the contentious issues now under his charge - the long-running problem of shortfalls in council funding, the creaking social care system and the prospect of local government reorganisation to name a few. \nTim Oliver, the Conservative leader of Surrey County Council and chairman of the County Councils Network, said Mr Gove would be an advocate for local government, but suggested he would want reform. \n\"He (Mr Gove) understands local government,\" he said. \n\"But he will expect us to look at ways we can streamline services and perhaps deliver savings. I don't think he's going to be somebody who's going to provide large bailouts.\"\nMost agree the new secretary of state won't be content to simply oversee a department without implementing change.\nFor some that's an exciting prospect, for others the cause of nervous anticipation.

      "text": "At the age of 46, Liz Truss has become the UK's second female foreign secretary - following a trail blazed previously only by Labour's Margaret Beckett 15 years ago.\nIn a relatively short time in Parliament, she has held a wide variety of posts, dealing with high-profile domestic and international issues.\nBut her new role will bring a new level of scrutiny, as her predecessor Dominic Raab found when he faced widespread criticism for remaining on holiday during the Afghanistan crisis.\nMs Truss, who has a husband and two daughters, has plenty of big issues in her Foreign Office in-tray, her promotion coming at a time when China, Russia, the UK's place in a post-Brexit world and Iran's nuclear programme are provoking many questions in diplomatic circles.\nBorn in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss describes her parents, a mathematics professor and a nurse, as \"left-wing\". \nIt was not a characteristic inherited by their daughter.\nShe moved to Paisley, in Scotland, aged four, and, in 1983 - in a hint of her future political proclivities - played the part of Margaret Thatcher in a school dramatic production.\nThe family then decamped to Leeds, where she attended a state secondary school.\nMrs Truss went on to Oxford University, where she read philosophy, politics and economics and was active in student politics, initially for the Liberal Democrats and later for the Conservatives.\nAfterwards she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, but her heart was set on Westminster.\nShe was the Tory candidate for Hemsworth and Calder Valley in the 2001 and 2005 general elections, failing to win either seat. But she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, from 2008 also working as deputy director of the right-of-centre Reform think tank.\nPart of Conservative leader David Cameron's \"A-list\" of priority candidates, Ms Truss was finally elected MP for for the safe Tory seat of South West Norfolk in 2010, with a 13,140-vote majority.\nWhile in Parliament she co-authored a book called Britannia Unchained, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches.\nIn 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister.\nShe clashed with Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg over schools reform, but Mr Cameron promoted her to the cabinet in 2014, as environment secretary.\nAt the 2015 Conservative conference, Ms Truss was mocked for giving a speech including an impassioned section on UK cheese imports, but this did not impede her progress.\nIn 2016, she became justice secretary under Theresa May, the following year moving on to become chief secretary to the Treasury, a position at the heart of the government's economic programme.\nAfter Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which means meeting political and business leaders to promote UK PLC.\nAs foreign secretary she will rack up just as many, if not more, air miles, with an awful lot more people watching her every move."

      "tags": "Conservative Party,UK government,Boris Johnson,Elizabeth Truss",
      "text": "Boris Johnson is putting the finishing touches to his reshuffle after making significant changes to his top team. \nOn Wednesday, the PM fired both Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, before replacing Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab with Liz Truss. \nHe has now moved on to confirming which junior ministers are in or out of jobs.\nBut one ousted minister, John Whittingdale, told BBC's Newscast that the new team could lack experience.\nIn some of the latest manoeuvres, Conor Burns, who resigned as a trade minister in 2020 after a report found he used \"veiled threats\" to aid his father in a financial dispute, returned to the front bench as a Northern Ireland minister. \nOthers moved to more high-profile ministerial roles on Thursday included Alex Chalk, who was appointed Solicitor General, and Skills Minister Gillian Keegan, who now joins the Department for Health and Social Care.\nBut Justin Tomlinson lost his job as minister for disabled people in the same department, while Matt Warman was sacked as minister of digital infrastructure. \nFormer Brexit and Northern Ireland Minister, Robin Walker, has gone to the Department for Education, where he will work with the new Secretary of State, Nadhim Zahawi.\nAnd Helen Whately, who was the minister for social care, has been moved to the Treasury, but Jesse Norman joined the list of sackings.  \nEarlier on Thursday, Penny Mordaunt left her post as paymaster general at the Cabinet Office to become a minister at the trade department.\nMr Whittingdale - who lost his job as data minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport - said his post had been one he \"loved\" and was \"sad to give up\". \nHe also revealed some of the PM's appointments \"came out of the blue\".\nThe former minister told Newscast: \"I understand that every prime minister has to make room to allow people to be brought forward. I quite recognise the prime minister is keen to have a front-facing cabinet that reflects modern Britain. \n\"Equally it's no bad thing to have a bit of experience around that table and people who have got a good grasp of the detail of the jobs they are being asked to do.\"\nThere were big winners from the reshuffle too, included Nadine Dorries, who was promoted from being a junior health minister into her first cabinet-level job as culture secretary.\nThe Mid Bedfordshire MP is probably best known outside Westminster for her 2012 appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.\nMs Truss, who is the Tory party's first female foreign secretary - and only the second woman to hold the role, following Labour's Margaret Beckett - said she was delighted by the appointment and would use the role to \"promote a positive, outward vision of global Britain\".\nOther changes made on Wednesday included:\nFormer Justice Secretary Mr Buckland's sacking was greeted with some surprise, with a number of Labour MPs tweeting praise for him and senior Conservative Sir Bob Neill - who chairs the Commons Justice Committee - saying he \"deserved better\". \nIn a letter to the prime minister after his dismissal, Mr Buckland called for more investment in the justice system, adding that \"years of underfunding\" had made it harder for it to recover from the effects of the pandemic.\nNew Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Mr Gove will also get the added responsibility of the government's \"levelling up\" agenda - which it claimed would spread wealth and opportunity around the country - while continuing to handle demands for another Scottish independence referendum.\nThe Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Dowden, following his appointment as the Tory party's new co-chairman, had told staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters to start preparing for a general election which could be in 20 months' time.\nAfter the early traumas of Brexit, then the emergency and horror of the pandemic, the moves represent, they hope, a refreshed team that can get things done.\nWhether it's building houses without upsetting the Tory shires, sorting out school exams, pushing through tougher prison sentences, with new faces it's a government that Downing Street hopes will be more able to push reform forward, and make its case.\nNearly two years after the election, it's perhaps the start of Mr Johnson's third act as prime minister.\nRead more from Laura\nMr Johnson continued making changes late into the night on Wednesday as he got the reshuffle of more junior ministers under way, ahead of the further changes on Thursday.\nLong-serving Nick Gibb was sacked from his role at the Department for Education, while Caroline Dinenage lost her job as a culture minister, and Luke Hall was fired as a local government minister.\nAmanda Milling, who was removed as Conservative Party co-chairwoman, has become a Foreign Office minister.\nJulia Lopez has been moved from the Cabinet Office to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, while Greg Hands left the Department of International Trade for a new brief as business minister."

      "text": "\"Measures to simplify international travel\" will be announced later, the transport secretary has confirmed.\nGrant Shapps said the forthcoming changes would \"reduce costs, take advantage of higher levels of vaccination, and keep us all safe\".\nMinisters are considering scrapping the requirement for double-jabbed people returning to the UK to need PCR tests.\nThe \"traffic light\" system for overseas travel could also be simplified, with the amber list removed entirely.\nAny changes would apply to England initially, as the UK's devolved administrations are in charge of their own travel rules.\nCabinet ministers are understood to have discussed the move ahead of the announcement by Mr Shapps.\nNo 10 hinted Mr Shapps would announce an easing of restrictions following \"steady progress\" in containing Covid.\nAsked about whether the changes were likely to be permanent, a Downing Street spokesman cautioned that \"the pandemic is still ongoing and there is always the chance of unexpected challenges, such as an even more transmissible or more deadly variant emerging\".\nBut he said the success of the vaccine rollout \"is enabling us to move steadily and remove restrictions, as you saw when we came out of Step 4\", referring to the widespread lifting of restrictions across England on 19 July.\n\"I think it would be wrong to rule out anything in the future but it is important to note that we continue to make steady progress to ease restrictions, and that is very much the intention of the approach we will be taking.\"\nMeanwhile, the Guardian and the Times have reported that dozens of countries will be removed from the red list - the highest level of alert for international travel which means returning travellers must spend 11 nights in hotel quarantine at a cost of \u00a32,285.\nThere are currently 62 countries on that list.\nCurrently, travellers who are not fully vaccinated are required to quarantine upon returning to the UK from an amber list destination. \nBy removing the amber category, only passengers arriving from red list countries would have to quarantine in a government-approved hotel.\nMinisters have also been under pressure to reconsider the testing requirements for travellers - with the industry and holidaymakers hoping for the change ahead of the October half-term holiday.\nUnder current rules, people arriving from green list countries must take a Covid test shortly before their return and submit a PCR test on their second day back in the UK.\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK told the BBC that testing requirements were preventing the UK travel industry from competing with European rivals.\nHe also warned that thousands of jobs could be at stake if restrictions remain while  furlough support ends.\nIf you plan to travel abroad, check carefully the Covid rules where you are going.\nFor example:\nThe UK Foreign Office has detailed advice for each country.  \nHuw Merriman, Conservative chairman of the Commons Transport Select Committee, said PCR tests were expensive and \"putting people off travel\" while the rapid lateral flow tests were \"just as safe\". The NHS charges \u00a368 for a lab-processed PCR test.\nFully vaccinated people should only need a PCR test as confirmation if their lateral flow test came back positive, he said.\nOne justification for requiring PCR tests is that they can be used for gene sequencing and tracking coronavirus variants. \nBut Mr Merriman said just 5% of positive tests were sequenced in July, adding that people were being \"ripped off\".\nAlan McNally, professor of Microbial Evolutionary Genomics at the University of Birmingham, said lateral flow testing would be \"sufficient\" for travellers given the UK's high Covid rate, but argued it was \"vitally important\" that genome-level surveillance of travel-related Covid cases continued.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I would really hope that there will be very strong mandate that any [lateral flow] tests from travel have to get a confirmatory PCR test.\"\nHe said past experiences and the emergence of the Delta variant showed that travel-related Covid cases were a \"very high risk\" to the UK and could cause \"big trouble\" if they were not being monitored.\nWith countries such as those in the EU, there is a greater degree of confidence that variants are being reported and vaccination records are accurate, he said. But he said in others it may be less certain.\nDo you have hopes to travel between a red-list country and the UK soon? How would a change in the travel guidance affect your plans?

      "text": "Despite all the promises to take action, the world is still on course to heat up to dangerous levels.\nThat's the latest blunt assessment of the United Nations. \nIts experts have studied the climate plans of more than 100 countries and concluded that we're heading in the wrong direction. \nScientists recently confirmed that to avoid the worst impacts of hotter conditions, global carbon emissions needed to be cut by 45% by 2030. \nBut this new analysis shows that those emissions are set to rise by 16% during this period.\nThat could eventually lead to a temperature rise of 2.7C (4.9F) above pre-industrial times - far above the limits set by the international community.\n\"The 16% increase is a huge cause for concern,\" according to Patricia Espinosa, the UN's chief climate negotiator.  \n\"It is in sharp contrast with the calls by science for rapid, sustained and large-scale emission reductions to prevent the most severe climate consequences and suffering, especially of the most vulnerable, throughout the world.\"\nIt's a stark warning about the scale of the challenge faced at the COP26 climate conference, scheduled to take place in Glasgow in just over six weeks' time.\nThe central aim of the giant event is to keep alive hopes of limiting the rise in global temperatures by persuading nations to cut their emissions. \nUnder the rules of the Paris Agreement on climate change, countries are meant to update their carbon reduction plans every five years.\nBut the UN says that of 191 countries taking part in the agreement, only 113 have so far come up with improved pledges. \nAlok Sharma, the British minister who will chair the COP26 conference, said nations that had ambitious climate plans were \"already bending the curve of emissions downwards\". \n\"But without action from all countries, especially the biggest economies, these efforts risk being in vain.\" \nA study by Climate Action Tracker found that of the G20 group of leading industrial nations, only a handful including the UK and the US have strengthened their targets to cut emissions.  \nIn another analysis, the World Resources Institute and Climate Analytics highlight how China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - together responsible for 33% of greenhouse gases - have yet to submit updated plans.  \nIt says that Australia and Indonesia have the same carbon reduction targets they did back in 2015 - while the Paris Agreement is meant to involve a \"ratchet mechanism\" of progressively deeper cuts. \nAnd the study finds that Brazil, Mexico and Russia all expect their emissions to grow rather than to shrink. \nFor the poorest countries - most vulnerable to rising sea levels and new extremes of heat and drought - seeing a rapid fall in the gases heating the planet is a priority. \nSonam P Wangdi, chair of the Least Developed Countries group, said: \"G20 countries must take the lead in quickly cutting emissions to mitigate climate change. \n\"These are the countries with the greatest capacity and responsibility, and it's well past time they step up and treat this crisis like a crisis.\"\nThere are hopes that China may revise its climate plans ahead of the Glasgow conference.\nAs the world's largest emitter, it has previously said it aims to peak its emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.\nAn announcement soon of more ambitious targets would give the talks a significant boost but there are no clues about when - or even whether - that might happen.\nFollow David on Twitter."

      "tags": "China,United States,Australia",
      "text": "China has criticised a historic security pact between the US, UK and Australia, describing it as \"extremely irresponsible\" and \"narrow-minded\".\nThe deal will see the US and UK give Australia the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines for the first time.\nIt is being widely viewed as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea.\nThe region has been a flashpoint for years and tensions there remain high.\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the alliance risked \"severely damaging regional peace... and intensifying the arms race\".\nHe criticised what he called \"the obsolete Cold War... mentality\" and warned the three countries were \"hurting their own interests\".\nChinese state media carried similar editorials denouncing the pact, and one in the Global Times newspaper said Australia had now \"turned itself into an adversary of China\".\nThe US is sharing its submarine technology for the first time in 60 years, having previously only shared it with the UK.\nIt means Australia will be able to build nuclear-powered submarines that are faster and harder to detect than conventionally powered fleets. They can stay submerged for months and shoot missiles longer distances - although Australia says it has no intention of putting nuclear weapons on them.\nThe new partnership, under the name Aukus, was announced in a joint virtual press conference between US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning.\nAnd while China was not mentioned directly, the three leaders referred repeatedly to regional security concerns which they said had \"grown significantly\".\n\"This is an historic opportunity for the three nations, with like-minded allies and partners, to protect shared values and promote security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,\" a joint statement read.\nThe Aukus alliance is probably the most significant security arrangement between the three nations since World War Two, analysts say.\nIt means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines.\nWhile they are the big-ticket item in the deal, cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies will also be shared.\nAustralia will also acquire long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, and allow more US troops to be stationed in the country's north.\n\"This really shows that all three nations are drawing a line in the sand to start and counter [China's] aggressive moves,\" said Guy Boekenstein from the Asia Society Australia.\nBoris Johnson later said the pact would \"preserve security and stability around the world\" and generate \"hundreds of high-skilled jobs\".\nUK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the BBC that China was \"embarking on one of the biggest military spends in history... Our partners in those regions want to be able to stand their own ground.\"\nIn recent years, Beijing has been accused of raising tensions in disputed territories such as the South China Sea.\nIt has been increasingly assertive over what it says are centuries-old rights to the contested region, and has been rapidly building up its military presence to back up those claims.\nThe US has bolstered its military presence too, and has been investing heavily in other partnerships in the region such as with Japan and South Korea.\nHaving the submarines stationed in Australia is critical to US influence in the region, analysts say.\nThe Western powers have also been wary of China's infrastructure investment on Pacific islands, although it remains below US and Australian spending there.\nChina is Australia's biggest trading partner, and in the past, the two have maintained good relations. But in recent years that has broken down. \nAustralia has accused Beijing of interfering in its domestic politics, blocked Chinese investment, and banned Chinese telecom giant Huawei from building Australian tech infrastructure.\nCanberra also echoed a call by the US last year for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus.\nBeijing's response was to deliver a series of trade punishments - sanctioning over a dozen Australian goods. It has slapped Australian wine with taxes of up to 200%.\nAustralia hopes the new alliance will also help cushion the economic blowback.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday: \"Beijing has seen over the past months that Australia will not back down and the threats of economic retaliation and pressure simply will not work.\"\nBut France has also reacted angrily to the new pact, because it means Australia will now abandon a $50bn (\u20ac31bn; \u00a327bn) deal with it to build 12 submarines.\n\"It's really a stab in the back,\" France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Info radio. \"We had established a relationship of trust with Australia, this trust has been betrayed.\"\nThe European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell said he understood why France was disappointed by the deal, adding that the EU was not consulted about the new alliance.\n\"This forces us once again... to reflect on the need to make the issue of European strategic autonomy a priority. This shows that we must survive on our own,\" he said on Thursday.\nSecretary Blinken said the US cooperated \"incredibly closely\" with France and would continue to do so, adding that \"we place fundamental value on that relationship, on that partnership\".

It would \"carefully consider\" the proposed changes on testing but said they are \"not without risk\".\nScotland said it would simplify its traffic light system but ruled out removing the requirement for PCR tests, due to \"significant concerns at the impact on public health\".\nThe transport secretary said the new travel rules would remain in place \"at least until the new year\".\n\"The purpose is to make it easier to travel without the bureaucracy, without so many tests, and with a greater level of certainty now that we've got so many people vaccinated,\" he said.\nThe travel industry said the announcement was a step towards helping tourism recover.\nAirlines UK said it was a \"shot in the arm\" that \"moves us much closer to the reopening of UK aviation\".\nStewart Wingate, chief executive of Gatwick Airport, said customers can \"book with more confidence in the months before Christmas and beyond\" and said there was \"significant pent-up demand for travel\".\nBut he said the remaining constraints on travel, such as the need to fill out a passenger locator form, should also be removed.\nBritish Airways' chief executive and chairman, Sean Doyle, said fewer than 1% of travellers from low-risk countries tested positive and all testing for fully vaccinated travellers should be scrapped \"in line with most other European countries\".\nHuw Merriman, the Conservative chairman of the Commons Transport Committee, said the changes could have an immediate positive impact on the UK's travel industry, coming before the October half-term break for schools.\nHe said the changes addressed the committee's criticism of \"confusing watchlists and quarantines\", the delay in \"reaping the benefit\" of vaccination levels, and the high costs of PCR tests.\nby Jim Reed, BBC health reporter\nOver the summer, scientists advising the government said that the biggest threat to our health security was a coronavirus variant that could spread faster or was resistant to our current vaccines. \nWe've been bitten by this before. In April the first cases of the Delta variant were spotted in travellers from India. \nIt started spreading quickly and, by June, it had taken over as the dominant form of the virus in the UK. Later studies suggested it was more contagious and more likely to put those infected in hospital.\nDetecting new variants was a key reason why all vaccinated travellers had been told to pay for a private PCR test two days after they arrived back home. We were told that those expensive lab tests were needed to genetically sequence the sample and find out if the next potentially more dangerous variant had arrived.\nBut critics said that, in reality, the proportion of samples that could be analysed in this way was very low - partly because a certain level of virus was needed for the test to work properly. \nThe latest figures suggest that between August 12 and September 1 only around 25% of positive cases in travellers arriving in the UK were successfully sequenced. \nUnder the new plans, fully vaccinated travellers will instead be able to pay for a cheaper, but less sensitive, lateral flow test which can be taken quickly at home.\nLFTs cannot be sequenced so anyone who tests positive will be asked to take a second follow up PCR lab test, which will be paid for by the NHS.\nBut there is a worry that without regular, automatic PCR testing of all samples, more variants could slip through the net and weaken our defences against coronavirus in the future."

      "tags": "Nadhim Zahawi",
      "text": "Former vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed the new education secretary, replacing the sacked Gavin Williamson.\n\"I must be one of the luckiest human beings on earth,\" Mr Zahawi has said when reflecting on his childhood.\nBorn in Iraq in 1967 he could easily have been sent to fight in the 1980s Iran-Iraq War.\n\"I would have been drafted in to the Iraqi army, had to go to front line and probably die,\" he told Nick Robinson on the Political Thinking podcast earlier this year.\nInstead, he and his parents were forced to flee Iraq and he grew up in Britain.\nHis family had been influential in the country - his grandfather was the governor of the Central Bank of Iraq and his signature appeared on the country's banknotes.\nHowever, when Saddam Hussein came to power in the late 1970s, his family came under threat.\nMr Zahawi's father, a businessman, got a tip-off that the authorities were coming for him and quickly arranged to fly out. \nHis son has recalled the anxiety of watching the plane preparing to take off from Baghdad Airport.  \nAfter all the passengers had boarded, a military vehicle drove up to the plane. His mother was in tears as they saw a passenger being removed from the plane.\nThe passenger turned out not to be his father, but the man who had been sitting behind him on the plane. \nMr Zahawi described it as a \"traumatic\" childhood moment \"stamped on his memory\".\nSo instead of growing up in Iraq, Mr Zahawi grew up in Sussex. He was educated at private and comprehensive schools and became a keen equestrian.\nBut, as he was heading to university another disaster struck the family.\nA business venture of his father's fell through, and he, in Mr Zahawi's words, \"lost everything\" except a brown Vauxhall car.\nThe young Nadhim Zahawi decided he would use the Vauxhall to become a minicab driver in order to help put food on the table.\nBut his mother insisted on her son going to university and pawned her jewellery so he wouldn't have to worry about the finances. \nAfter studying chemical engineering at University College London, he followed in his father's entrepreneurial footsteps and set up a firm selling Teletubbies merchandise - a company which attracted investment from the then-Conservative politician Jeffrey Archer. \nSpeaking to the BBC's Profile programme, Lord Archer remembered the young Nadhim Zahawi as \"a born organiser - if you said I need six taxis, three aeroplanes and a double decker bus, all in 30 minutes he went and did it.\"\nThrough Lord Archer's parties, Mr Zahawi met influential Conservative figures including the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \nIn 1994 he became a Conservative councillor in Wandsworth, south London and three years later unsuccessfully stood for Parliament in Erith and Thamesmead.\nWhen Lord Archer launched his campaign to become London mayor, Mr Zahawi joined his team.\nBut the candidate was forced to pull out of the race, and Mr Zahawi had to look for alternative work.\nAlong with another ex-member of team Archer - Stephan Shakespeare -  he launched YouGov, an online polling company.\nThe venture was successful and according to the Evening Standard Mr Zahawi was able to cash in his shares for \u00a31.2m.\nHaving made his fortune, Mr Zahawi turned his thoughts once again to securing a seat in Parliament. \nIn 2010 he was successful, winning the safe Conservative seat of Stratford-Upon-Avon. \nParliament was still reeling from the MPs expenses scandal, and Mr Zahawi quickly became embroiled in his own transgression when it emerged he had claimed expenses to supply his stables with electricity.\nHe said he was \"mortified by this mistake\" and paid back the money. \nIt didn't hinder his political progress too much and in January 2018 then-PM Theresa May made him an education minister, with responsibility for children and families.\nHowever, he quickly found himself in trouble for attending a gala held by the men-only Presidents Club.\nAn undercover reporter for the Financial Times had revealed the hostesses had been subjected to groping and lewd comments.\nMr Zahawi's attendance at the event earned him a reprimand from Downing Street.\nDespite labelling the current prime minister a \"controversial face from the past\", Mr Zahawi remained a minister when Boris Johnson came to power in July 2019, moving from the education to the business department.\nThen in November 2020, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, he was handed what he has called \"the most important job I'll ever do\" - the position of vaccines minister.\nFor almost 11 months he has overseen the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine programme, and has been able to boast a fair amount of success, especially earlier in the year when the UK raced ahead of many other countries. \nReflecting on his own skills, he says he \"loves an operational challenge\".\nAs this country's new education secretary he faces the unprecedented challenge of ensuring a whole generation of children can catch up after having missed months of school as a result of the pandemic.\nIt may yet proved to be an operational challenge too far, but he at least benefits from his previous experience as a minister in the education department.\nDavid Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, says the new minister \"knows the college sector well\" and I absolutely expect that he will pick up the baton and continue to champion colleges\".\nMr Zahawi's appointment has also been welcomed by one unlikely source. \nOpposition Labour MP Jess Phillips tweeted: \"He wouldn't be my choice obviously, but I genuinely feel relieved for the children of Birmingham including my own at this appointment.\"\nAnd in a dig at his predecessor, she added: \"Nadhim is competent and easy to work with and anyone would have been an improvement to be fair.\""

      "text": "Soldiers will be drafted in to drive ambulances in a bid to ease the \"unprecedented\" pressure on the NHS.\nScottish Ambulance Service chief executive Pauline Howie said logistical staff would also be made available to support paramedics and technicians.\nMs Howie said the impact of Covid had placed the service at its \"highest level of escalation\".\nOn Thursday, the Scottish government confirmed it had asked the MoD for military assistance.\nMs Howie was asked on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme if it would mean soldiers driving NHS ambulances or army ambulances.\nShe said: \"I would expect the former and we will be working through the details of that over the coming days.\"\nHer comments came after it emerged an 86-year-old woman had to wait eight hours for an ambulance after falling and breaking her hip at home.\nLillian Briggs, who has Parkinson's, skin cancer and has had two heart attacks, was left lying on her kitchen floor in agony after blacking out.\nHer son, Robert Ewing, and his sister rang for an ambulance a number of times only to be told their mother was in the system but was not a priority.\nMr Ewing told BBC Scotland: \"I thought she was going to die in front of us.\"\nThe Scottish Ambulance Service apologised for the delay and confirmed it was investigating the circumstances.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said health services were dealing with the most challenging combination of circumstances in their history due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nOpposition politicians have highlighted a series of serious ambulance delays, including one where a man died after a 40-hour wait.\nMs Howie was asked on Good Morning Scotland if the two cases highlighted in the media were \"anomalies\".\nShe said: \"The vast majority of patients, for immediately life-threatening patients, will receive a response under 10 minutes and for other emergency patients, under 40 minutes.\"\nThe chief executive confirmed the service would apologise directly to the families and share the findings of its reviews into the circumstances.\nMs Howie also described the current pressures on the NHS as \"unprecedented\" and added staff face an \"extremely challenging\" winter.\nScottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane told the programme the problem was not new and recalled one of his patients waiting eight hours for an ambulance in 2018.\nHighlighting the stress on all parts of the health service, he said on Monday alone he had 80 patient contacts during his GP shift.\nDr Gulhane said: \"Ambulances queuing round the block. Record A&E waiting times. This is shining a light on a crumbling NHS that happened before Covid.\"\nHe also accused the Scottish government of using the pandemic as a \"smokescreen for everything\".\nScottish Labour health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie welcomed the involvement of the military.\nBut she told Good Morning Scotland: \"What it demonstrates is that the ambulance service and the NHS are absolutely in crisis, and this is all before the winter starts.\" \nMs Baillie also said ministers had \"taken their eye off the ball\" and failed to respond to delays which were reported in June.\nShe added efforts should now be made to bring back recently-retired staff and increase capacity.\nOne suggestion has been to reopen the NHS Louisa Jordan at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow.\nThe temporary facility, which closed in March, carried out outpatient and diagnostic appointments, hosted training and accepted blood donations.\nDr John Montgomery told BBC Scotland's The Nine: \"Given that the critical problem that we face right now is lack of beds and the Louisa Jordan was set up effectively as a field hospital then, unfortunately, closing it because of the forthcoming COP26 may be one of the worst decisions we have made.\n\"The Louisa Jordan would have been a perfect place for the patients who might have required, not-necessarily high intervention levels of medicine, but perhaps required nursing care and would have been a perfect place for ambulances to take patients to.\"\nThe GP, who is based on the south side of Glasgow, added he is \"very, very fearful indeed\" for the winter ahead. \nThe Scottish Ambulance Service said the current problems were not about capacity alone.\nMs Howie added: \"I think the challenges are not just about facilities, they are about workforces as well.\n\"Across health and care services, there are workforce capacity challenges and those are being actively addressed by health boards.\"\nOn Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said her government was looking at a range of plans to deal with the significant challenges facing the health services.\nShe told the Scottish Parliament: \"I'll be going back to my office to finalise the detail of the request for military assistance so we can submit that as quickly as possible.\"\nThe first minister added: \"Such military assistance is already being provided to ambulance services in England and of course we have had military assistance for other aspects of the pandemic over the past 18 months.\"\nA Scottish government spokesperson later confirmed it was seeking military assistance to address acute services, and a separate request had been made to support mobile testing units."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you on Saturday morning.\nInternational travel rules for England are to be simplified, scrapping the green and amber list in favour of a single red list from 4 October. Under new testing guidelines, people who are fully vaccinated will no longer need to take a pre-departure test before leaving any country not on the red list. And, later in October, returning travellers will be able to replace the day two PCR test with a cheaper lateral flow test. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the aim was to give overseas travel \"a greater level of certainty\". The new travel rules would remain in place \"at least until the new year\", he said. While travel is a devolved matter, the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish governments have often followed the UK government's rules during the pandemic. Wales said it would \"carefully consider\" the proposed changes.\nPeople will need a vaccine passport to enter nightclubs and attend large events in Wales from next month, First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced. From 11 October, the NHS Covid Pass - proving someone has been fully vaccinated or had a negative Covid test - will be required by all over-18s to enter nightclubs, indoor non-seated events for more than 500 people, outdoor non-seated events for more than 4,000 people - and any setting or event with more than 10,000 in attendance. Mr Drakeford said cases in Wales had risen \"to very high levels\" over the summer. He said taking \"small but meaningful action\" now to control the spread of the virus would reduce the need for tougher measures later. \nRetail sales in the UK fell for the fourth month in a row in August but people spent more time eating and drinking in bars and restaurants, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has revealed, as people \"rediscovered our passion for a big night out\". Food store sales fell by 1.2%, but the ONS claims the fall was linked to the lifting of restrictions on hospitality, leading to more people eating out. Meanwhile, analysts say labour shortages and supply chain disruption have also impacted sales.\nScotland continues to have the highest level of coronavirus cases in the UK, according to the latest figures. The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey estimated about one in 45 had Covid in the week ending 11 September. In addition, the number of people in hospital with Covid in Scotland went over 1,000 earlier this week, having doubled in less than a fortnight. It has been confirmed that soldiers in Scotland will be drafted in to drive ambulances in a bid to ease the \"unprecedented\" pressure on the NHS.\nThe 2020-21 football season will go down as the one that clubs survived despite having virtually no fans coming through the turnstiles. Figures from Manchester United's latest annual report show the club went from matchday revenues of \u00a389.8m down to just \u00a37.1m last season. However, simultaneously, the money that the club made from broadcasters showing the matches to fans in the UK and around the world - many confined to their homes during lockdowns - jumped from \u00a3140.2m to \u00a3254.8m, wiping out that shortfall.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nConfused about the Covid travel rules?

      "text": "The leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has called for Irish President Michael D Higgins to reconsider his decision to turn down an invite to a church service to mark Northern Ireland's centenary.\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson said \"politics are at play\" in the decision.\nEarlier, the Alliance Party also said President Higgins should reconsider.\nThe Queen has been invited to the service, which has been organised by Christian church leaders.\nIt will take place at the Church of Ireland cathedral in Armagh city on 21 October.\nThe inter-denominational service is part of a programme of events to mark the centenary of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921.\nOn Wednesday, a spokesperson for President Higgins said he was \"not in a position to attend the ceremony and this has been communicated to the organisers\".\nIt is understood he had been expected to attend. He did not offer any further explanation of his decision.\nRT\u00c9 reports that the Irish government said it did not advise President Higgins to decline an invitation to attend the church service.\nBut the Irish government told BBC News NI that \"the president's diary is a matter for the president and it would not be appropriate to comment\".\n\"Any invitation for a government representative to attend the ceremony will be considered,\" it added.\nSir Jeffrey, who has written to President Higgins about the matter, said it was a \"disappointing and retrograde step\" by the president.\n\"We hope he will rethink this decision - it is not conducive to the kind of respectful relationship with the head of state of our neighbouring jurisdiction,\" he said.\n\"In the absence of clarity around the reason for him not attending many may reach a conclusion that it is a decision based on politics.\"\nSir Jeffrey said the service was about \"marking the centenary\", which he added was a \"fairly neutral term\".\nFormer Presbyterian Moderator Dr John Dunlop said he was disappointed by the decision.\n\"This is a time when I think you have to consolidate bridges especially in a time like this when things between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland or between Ireland and Northern Ireland are a bit fraught and a bit fragile,\" he said.\nAlliance Party MP Stephen Farry also said President Higgins should reconsider his position.\n\"This event is very much in keeping with the reconciliation efforts of successive Irish presidents and the Queen over recent years and the inclusive approach to marking the decade of centenaries,\" he said.\nHowever independent assembly member Trevor Lunn, formerly of the Alliance Party, tweeted in support of the president's decision.\n\"I don't see it as a discourtesy to Her Majesty, just a correct if difficult decision,\" he wrote.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said people should take President Higgins \"at his word when he says he can not be there\". \nMr Eastwood said President Higgins had a track record of reconciliation.\nHe said: \"President Higgins' term has been marked by diversity and reaching out to all traditions across our island. \n\"He has been an advocate of bringing people together and I think people should not read too much into this given all that he has done for community relations and reconciliation across Ireland.\"\nUlster Unionist Party assembly member Mike Nesbitt described the move as \"surprising and uncharacteristic from someone who has shown a consistent willingness to reach out and promote reconciliation\".\n\"The reciprocal state visits were a high watermark in Anglo-Irish relations and until we know the reason why he is not in a position to attend, we cannot be critical,\" he said.\nThe leader of Aont\u00fa, Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn, said President Higgins had made \"the right decision not to attend the event\".\n\"There isn't a president in the world that would attend an event to mark, commemorate or celebrate the partition of his or her country,\" he said.\nThe Independent Group of Senators in the Republic of Ireland has expressed its concern at President Higgins' decision.\nSenator Gerard Craughwell, who is a member of the group, said he was \"deeply disappointed\".\n\"It is a commemoration service, not a celebration service, so there should be no political connotations whatsoever to the event,\" he told BBC News NI.\nSo far the church leaders have made no comment about the issue.\nPresident Higgins is in Italy and has not yet responded to calls for him to reconsider his decision or give his reasons."

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson carried out a reshuffle of his cabinet on Wednesday, removing several key ministers including Gavin Williamson. \nThis is the second major reshuffle since Mr Johnson became leader of the Conservative party and took over as prime minister from Theresa May in July 2019. The last one took place in February 2020.\nSome of the big moves included Liz Truss to foreign secretary, the Tories' first woman in that role; Nadhim Zahawi moved from leading the vaccine rollout to education - at the expense of Mr Williamson; and Nadine Dorries stepped up from health minister to culture secretary.\nWho's in the other posts? Here's a guide to the people that make up Mr Johnson's cabinet, with the latest new faces and who's changed places.\nNote: BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) is a term widely used in the UK to describe people of non-white descent, as defined by the Institute of Race Relations.\nClick here if you cannot see the Cabinet Guide\nAs well as Mr Williamson, Mr Johnson removed three other members of the cabinet: Robert Jenrick, who was housing secretary; Robert Buckland, who was justice secretary; and Amanda Milling, who was Conservative Party co-chair - although she has been handed a ministerial role at the Foreign Office. \nDominic Raab, who had been the foreign secretary, was demoted to justice secretary. \nAccording to data from ConservativeHome, Mr Williamson was the least popular member of the cabinet with Conservative party members. Liz Truss, who has been promoted to foreign secretary from international trade secretary, was the most popular.\nThe make-up of the cabinet has also changed with all the comings and goings. \nThere are two more women then there had been before the reshuffle, but the proportion has stayed about the same because the overall number of people attending cabinet has also increased slightly. \nAs for the education of those now in cabinet, about 63% of them went to private schools, down slightly when compared to Mr Johnson's previous reshuffle last year - but still a stark contrast to his predecessor's.\nJust 30% of Theresa May's first cabinet in 2016 attended independent schools, which was fewer than both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's original cabinets. \nAccording to the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, every prime minister since 1937 who attended university was educated at Oxford - except for Mr Brown.\nAt 43%, Mr Johnson's new cabinet has slightly fewer members who were educated at Oxford or Cambridge compared to his last reshuffle - but it's still more than double what is was in Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1997.

      "tags": "France,China,Submarines,Nuclear submarines,United States,Australia",
      "text": "France has said it is recalling its ambassadors in the US and Australia for consultations, in protest at a security deal which also includes the UK. \nThe French foreign minister said the \"exceptional decision\" was justified by the situation's \"exceptional gravity\".\nThe alliance, known as Aukus, will see Australia being given the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines.\nThe move angered France as it scuppered a multibillion-dollar deal it had signed with Australia.\nThe agreement is widely seen as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea. It was announced on Wednesday by US President Joe Biden, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison.\nFrance was informed of the alliance only hours before the public announcement was made.\nIn a statement late on Friday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who had described the pact as a \"stab in the back\", said the ambassadors were being recalled at the request of President Emmanuel Macron.\nThe deal \"constitute[s] unacceptable behaviour between allies and partners whose consequences directly affect the vision we have of our alliances, of our partnerships and of the importance of the Indo-Pacific for Europe\", Mr Le Drian said.\nA White House official said the Biden administration regretted the move and would be engaged with France in the coming days to resolve their differences.\nSpeaking in Washington, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said she understood the \"disappointment\" in France and hoped to work with the country to ensure it understood \"the value we place on the bilateral relationship\".\nA recall of ambassadors is highly unusual between allies, and it is believed to be the first time France has recalled envoys from the two countries. French diplomats in Washington had already cancelled a gala to celebrate ties between the US and France which was scheduled for Friday.\nAt the Elys\u00e9e in Paris, they are concerned that in Washington, Canberra and London officials are underestimating and misinterpreting French anger - which is not about the loss of the submarine contract per se,  but about the way France - an allied nation with a presence in the Pacific - was cut out of the picture in secret talks between the three English-speaking countries.  \nThat's why President Macron last night ordered the recall for consultations of the two ambassadors:  to show that from France's perspective this is a very big deal indeed,  and that it raises questions over the essence of its relationship with America, Australia  and, indeed, the UK - though it's noticeable that France is not recalling its ambassador to London.  \nThe explanation given in briefings to the French press,  with deliberate disdain,  is that France considers the UK a junior player in the new pact, seeking a new world role post-Brexit, and riding along on Uncle Sam's coat-tails.\nThe pact means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. It will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies.\nThe announcement ended a deal worth $37bn (\u00a327bn) that France had signed with Australia in 2016 to build 12 conventional submarines. China meanwhile accused the three powers involved in the pact of having a \"Cold War mentality\"."

      "text": "People in Wales will need to show a pass proving they have been fully vaccinated or had a negative Covid test to attend clubs and large-scale events.\nThe new rules begin on 11 October.\nCustomers will be able to use an NHS Covid Pass to show they have been vaccinated, or had a negative lateral flow test in the past 48 hours.\nThe pass will be needed for clubs, indoor no-seating events with more than 500 people and outdoor no-seating events with more than 4,000 people.\nIt will also be required for any event with more than 10,000 people.\nPasses will be available to anyone over the age of 16, though will only be compulsory for those aged over 18 to enter certain events.\nIt comes as Public Health Wales (PHW) reported eight further deaths with coronavirus and 2,618 new cases.\nThe Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in Cardiff Bay also said they were disappointed by the move, Plaid Cymru said it was \"perplexed\" by elements of the plan.\nBut Alys Scourfield, from Cardiff, who has cancer, said the announcement means she will now be able to go to watch Wales in the autumn nationals with her son, for what may be her final time. \nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford made the announcement as part of the latest review of coronavirus restrictions, despite warnings from a nightclub trade body that the move may damage the nightclub industry.\n\"The last thing we want is further lockdowns and for businesses to have to close their doors once again,\" he said.\n\"That's why we must take small but meaningful action now to control the spread of the virus and reduce the need for tougher measures later.\"\nThe Welsh government rejected the idea of a vaccine-only passport for large-scale events as it would discriminate against those who cannot get a vaccine, Mr Drakeford said in a news conference.\nThe first minister said only allowing the double-jabbed into nightclubs or sports matches raised \"a series of ethical, legal and technical questions\".\nScotland is introducing vaccine passports on 1 October, but the Welsh government will use what is calls vaccine passes instead, which allow people to use a negative lateral flow test to gain entry.\nUnder the UK government's winter plan, vaccine certification will be required for nightclubs and other large events in England if data suggests action is needed to \"prevent unsustainable pressure on the NHS\".\nGraeme Da Silva, regional director at Rekom, which manages the Pryzm and Fiction nightclubs in Cardiff and Swansea, said he was \"frustrated\" with the go-ahead for Covid passports.\n\"Once again nightclubs are being singled out,\" he said.\nMr Da Silva said the move will cost the company money, whether that be in extra staffing or the loss of their walk-up trade.\n\"There is not much difference between a club and a nightclub at midnight on a Friday or Saturday. People are dancing, people are busy and actually nightclubs are a lot safer because of the ventilation we have.\n\"First to close, last to open and we've been picked on by the government. Despite all our efforts its been a really tough time for us.\n\"Our venues are at a really fragile state of recovery and many hundreds of jobs are at risk.\n\"Our customer and staff safety have been at the forefront of our agendas but, in the interest in fairness, we would have liked to see this across all retail and hospitality which makes it a difficult pill to swallow.\"\nNight Time Industries Association Wales said: \"We are disappointed that the Welsh government has felt it must mandate Covid passports at this stage, albeit a more liberal implementation with the inclusion of testing.\n\"We still feel that these measures will have a negative impact on businesses, and will create considerable market distortion.\"\nAnd UK Hospitality's executive director for Wales, David Chapman, said it would be an \"extra burden\" leading to closures and job losses.\nHe said it had made the case against passes because of difficulties including definitions of businesses and conflict with customers, all at the same time as a shortage of staff.\n\"Those affected businesses, already in a fragile state following repeated lockdowns and periods of onerous trading restrictions, now find themselves facing further economic and resourcing pressures,\" he said. \nFor Alys Scourfield, from Cardiff, the announcement of Covid passes has \"changed her life\". \nIt means she will now be able to go to watch Wales in the autumn nationals with her son, for what may be her final time. \nMrs Scourfield's \"time is limited\" after her cancer recently spread to her spine. \nShe said she would not go to an event with a large crowd unless she was sure everyone was double jabbed or had a negative test.\n\"I need to go out for mine and my children's mental health and pretend to be a normal person for the short time I've got left,\" she said.\n\"This will make me feel much safer and feel that I've done everything I can possibly do to reduce the risk.\"\nThe leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said he was disappointed by the announcement.                                                                                                       \n\"Welsh Conservatives have been against the introduction of such documentation from the outset, due to the wide-ranging ethical, equality, privacy, legal, and operational ramifications,\" he said.\n\"The inclusion of the lateral flow test element eases one area of concern but a whole host remain, particularly regarding the overall effectiveness of this measure and the impact it will have on businesses, jobs and Wales' economic recovery.\" \nRhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, said he was \"a bit perplexed about elements of this Covid pass scheme\".\n\"It's a much broader target base - we're talking about football matches, not just nightclubs, so there are issues of implementation, certainly,\" he said.\nWelsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds promised to vote against the scheme if it faces a vote in the Senedd.\n\"I understand many people want to get back to a sense of normality, but vaccine passports are not the way to do this and we need to be careful about the precedent they set. They are medical ID cards in all but name and Welsh Liberal Democrats will lead the fight against their introduction.\"\nAt Friday's news conference, Mr Drakeford also said people should keep working from home where possible.\nAlthough the guidance has no legal force, the Welsh government said it wanted to \"reinforce the importance\" of working from home.\nMany large employers are already using \"hybrid\" models, with staff splitting time between home and the office.\nMr Drakeford said: \"If you don't need to be in the office, for example, please work from home whenever you can.\n\"In England, working from home is part of their Plan B - here in Wales is part of our Plan A and in line with that advice from Sage that we should build up our defences in the autumn and winter early.\""

      "tags": "Women,Personal debt,NHS,Pregnancy",
      "text": "Some pregnant women visiting the UK have been wrongly told they could be denied visas for future trips unless they pay maternity care bills while in the country, the BBC has learned.\nCharity Maternity Action says it has found significant failings in how debt collectors CCI Credit Management work.\nCCI says it represents more than 75% of trusts and health boards, and recoups money from visitors for NHS care.\nIt said it was reviewing all communications with overseas visitors.\nMigrants, visitors and former residents of the UK must pay for their care when they are in the UK.\nRules on charging are aimed in part at preventing people from overseas deliberately coming to the UK to give birth on the NHS for free. Government rules compel NHS trusts to chase up debts. \nHowever, NHS guidelines say debt should not be an automatic reason for refusal of visas - which may be needed to visit, work or stay in the UK - and only that officials \"may consider\" it.   \nSafeguards are designed to be in place to ensure that those in need of urgent care always receive it, and there are exemptions from charges for some groups of people. \nJune (not her real name), who came to the UK from overseas, received a bill from CCI Credit Management for more than \u00a34,600 for her maternity care while she was pregnant. \nShe had just fled a violent relationship, was destitute and her pregnancy was considered high risk because of a past stillbirth.  \n\"I was really, really scared. I can't tell you how stressed I was. I kept going on the internet searching about this stuff,\" she says. \nHer letter from CCI contained the warnings about future visas. It also said debts would be taken into account for potential asylum applications. In fact, NHS debts are not considered when asylum applications are assessed.\nCCI said in a statement: \"For this error we unreservedly apologise.\n\"Please be assured that we are currently reviewing all communications with NHS overseas visitors in order to ensure that there can be no repetition of this mistake, and that further training is being provided to our teams.\"\nThe NHS trust dropped June's charges after Maternity Action contacted them. \nBut the charity says there are trusts who have refused to write off debts for those who are destitute or on very low incomes - despite guidance saying they can. They also say some trusts show poor understanding of the domestic violence provisions. \nChristine Benson, senior legal officer at Maternity Action, said NHS trusts needed to take safeguarding seriously. \n\"NHS trusts must take responsibility for the debt collection agencies and the messages that they're giving to women,\" she said.\nMaternity Action warns there is a growing body of evidence that charging for NHS maternity care deters women from coming forward for care. \nMary came to Britain to meet her husband - an EU national working here for seven years. But at immigration, the authorities said they believed she was involved in a sham marriage. She was allowed into the country but not given leave to remain. Her claim is still pending.\nShe said she did not access medical care throughout her pregnancy because she feared being charged until, at 21 weeks, she miscarried. She now owes \u00a34,500. \nIt is not clear if going for scans earlier in her pregnancy would have resulted in a different outcome. But evidence suggests the kind of care someone receives can have an impact. \n\"It's really important that you have regular check-ups in pregnancy, and that's kind of a standard of care worldwide,\" says Andrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at King's College London. \n\"There are many scenarios where acute management will make a big difference and turn around the outcome.\"\nThere is also evidence that some women turn to desperate measures to pay off their debts.\nMs Benson says: \"Women tell us that they engage in survival sex to support themselves and their families and to repay debts, that they stay in exploitative relationships.\"  \nDr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, says he was \"incredibly concerned\" that women are putting off seeking care during pregnancy and says \"urgent action was needed to break down barriers\". \nClare Livingstone, from the Royal College of Midwives, says that charging these women is \"not only wrong, it is dangerous\". \n\"There must be no barriers that prevent or make these women fearful of coming to our maternity services for the care they need.\" "

      "tags": "China,United States,Australia",
      "text": "The US and UK are facing growing international criticism over a new security pact signed with Australia.\nThe deal - seen as an effort to counter China - will see the US and UK give Australia the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines.\nBut the move angered France, which said it had been \"stabbed in the back\", while China accused the three powers of having a \"Cold War mentality\".\nAnd the pact has raised fears that it could provoke China into a war.\nThe alliance, known as Aukus, was announced by US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday.\nWhile they did not mention China, Aukus is being widely viewed as an effort to counter Beijing's influence in the contested South China Sea.\nMr Johnson later told MPs that the agreement was \"not intended to be adversarial\" to China.\nBut the prime minister was questioned by his predecessor, Theresa May, about whether the deal could lead to Britain being dragged into war with China.\nShe asked the prime minister about the \"implications\" of the partnership in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. \nMr Johnson replied: \"The United Kingdom remains determined to defend international law and that is the strong advice we would give to our friends across the world, and the strong advice that we would give to the government in Beijing.\"\nDemocratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, but Beijing has increased pressure on the island which it views as a breakaway province.\nMeanwhile Washington has sought to quell anger in Paris at the pact, which has scuppered a multibillion-dollar submarine deal France had signed with Australia.\nFrance's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the announcement a \"stab in the back\".\nHe called it a \"brutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision\" that reminded him of former US President Donald Trump.\nFrench diplomats in Washington cancelled a gala to celebrate ties between the US and France in retaliation.\n\"It's a very low moment,\" France's former ambassador to the US, G\u00e9rard Araud, told the BBC's World Tonight programme. \"The US knew that this contract and this strategic contract were essential French national interests, and the US didn't care.\"\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken called France \"a vital partner\" and said Washington would still work \"incredibly closely\" with Paris.\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki shrugged off the French criticisms.\n\"There are a range of partnerships that include the French and some partnerships that don't, and they have partnerships with other countries that don't include us,\" she said. \"That is part of how global diplomacy works.\"\nThe pact, which will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies, was described as showing \"profound strategic shifts\" by the UK's national security adviser Stephen Lovegrove.\nIt means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines.\nMr Lovegrove said the pact was \"perhaps the most significant capability collaboration in the world anywhere in the past six decades\".\nChina, meanwhile, has accused the allies of having a \"Cold War mentality\" that would hurt their own interests.\nThe Chinese state-run Global Times warned of an arms race for nuclear submarines, adding that Australian soldiers were likely to be the \"first to die\" in a Chinese \"counterattack\".\nAnd on Friday, China's President Xi Jinping said foreign powers should not be allowed to interfere in the country's affairs. \n\"The future of our country's development and progress should lie firmly in our own hands,\" he said, according to state media.\nBut Australia's defence minister, Peter Dutton, brushed aside Beijing's reaction.\n\"This is not the first time that we've seen different outbursts from China in terms of Australia's position,\" he said. \n\"We are a proud democracy in our region. We stand with our neighbours in the Indo-Pacific to ensure enduring peace, and this collaboration makes it a safer region. That's the reality and no amount of propaganda can dismiss the facts.\"\nMeanwhile, China applied to join a key Asia-Pacific trade pact on Thursday as it attempts to strengthen its position in the region.\nThe country's foreign ministry, however, denied that the move to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) was a response to the UK-US-Australia pact.\nJoining the CPTPP, which was signed in 2018 by 11 countries including Australia and Japan, would mark a significant boost to China's trading power."

      "tags": "Renting,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "\"If my landlord asks me to leave, I'll have to go into emergency accommodation\", said Sue, who's 61 and owes around \u00a32000 in unpaid rent. \nShe's one of thousands of renters who fell into arrears during the pandemic, according to the debt charity StepChange.\nA poll they carried out with YouGov suggests 10% of private renters are now behind on rent. \nThe charity estimates they owe on average just under \u00a3800 each. \nStepChange is calling for emergency support from the government as things like the furlough scheme and the uplift to Universal Credit payments are phased out. \nA spokesperson for the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said that unprecedented action was taken to keep people in their homes during the pandemic - and that it was right, as the economy reopened, for measures to be lifted.\nSue had recently left her job and was looking for a new one when the pandemic hit. With no furlough pay, she enrolled on Universal Credit while she looked for work. The benefits weren't enough to cover her rent, and as a result she underpaid for months. \n\"My landlord was initially understanding\" she explained, \"but when restrictions relaxed I was asked for full rent as well as payments towards my arrears, even though my situation hadn't changed.\"  \nHelp from her local council means Sue is now back to paying full rent  - but with no chance of paying off the debt she's accrued until she finds a job.  \n\"I'm constantly worrying about the prospect of being evicted.\" \n\"I've also fallen behind on things like credit card payments so my credit rating is low - it could stop me getting something else.\" \nFor Sue, the impact has been significant: \"I try not to let it get to me, but there are often nights when I can't sleep. My blood pressure's been up - it's extremely stressful.\"\nAfter polling more than 8,600 adults around the UK, StepChange estimates that the debt accrued by renters now stands at around \u00a3360m - a figure they say hasn't changed since the beginning of the year. \n\"Renters have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic - they're likely to be working in sectors where jobs have gone, and less likely to have had the resources to weather the storm in the way others may have been able to do,\" StepChange's Head of Policy, Peter Tutton told the BBC.  \nThe charity has welcomed the grant schemes recently launched by the Welsh and Scottish Governments to help those who have fallen behind on rent, but say that in England, many renters are facing an uncertain future. \nEmergency measures to protect renters were brought in in March last year - including a ban on evictions. This came to an end in England on 31st May, with the notice landlords had to give tenants they wanted to move out reduced from 6 months to 4 months. From next month, they return to what they were before the pandemic - 2 months. \n\"The pandemic help is now coming to an end, things like the furlough scheme, and the courts are reopening for evictions, so there's a perfect storm of worries\", said Mr Tutton, \"that's why thousands of people are concerned they're going to lose their home.\" \nStepChange is also calling on the government not to scrap the \u00a320 a week uplift in Universal Credit, to further protect those on low incomes from falling into debt.\nCalls for emergency support for those in rent arrears are backed by the National Residential Landlords Association. Meera Chindooroy, their Deputy Director of Policy, Campaigns and Public Affairs, described the rent debt issue as a \"crisis.\" \n\"We know that the majority of landlords have responded flexibly when they've been asked for things like reductions in rent and deferrals in rent payments, but that can't continue indefinitely,\" she said. \nThe NRLA want to see a combination of grants and loans for tenants, depending on their circumstances, with Ms Chindooroy adding that she expects the end of furlough and reduction in Universal Credit payments will have a \"significant impact\" on private renters. \n\"Our statistics suggest that the amount of arrears that tenants are in is increasing, so it is an issue that will continue unless there is action taken,\" she said.  \nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \"Our \u00a3352 billion support package has helped renters throughout the pandemic and prevented a build-up of rent arrears.\" \n\"We also took unprecedented action to help keep people in their homes by extending notice periods and pausing evictions at the height of the pandemic,\" the spokesperson added. \nSue fears she may be waiting a while for her personal economic recovery. \"When I get a job I'll be obviously paying extra each month to pay off the debt,\" she said, but despite months of looking, she's still out of work. \n\"Until I get a job and I know what I'm earning, and what I can afford, I don't know when it will be paid off.\""

      "text": "The Scottish government has asked the MoD for military assistance for the country's ambulance service. \nNicola Sturgeon said health services were dealing with the most challenging combination of circumstances in their history due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nOpposition politicians have highlighted a series of serious ambulance delays, including one where a man died after a 40-hour wait. \nThey said this should not be happening in Scotland in 2021.\nMs Sturgeon said her government was looking at a range of plans to deal with the significant challenges facing the health services, with the detail of a request for military assistance being considered.\nShe told the Scottish Parliament: \"I'll be going back to my office to finalise the detail of the request for military assistance so we can submit that as quickly as possible.\"\nThe first minister added: \"Such military assistance is already being provided to ambulance services in England and of course we have had military assistance for other aspects of the pandemic over the past 18 months.\"\nA Scottish government spokesperson later confirmed it was seeking military assistance to address acute services, and a separate request had been made to support mobile testing units. \nThe Ministry of Defence confirmed it had received a request from the Scottish government, which it said related to support for Scottish Ambulance Service mobile testing units.\nA spokeswoman said the MoD was \"working hard to identify where we can most effectively assist other government departments and civil authorities.\"\nInvestigations are ongoing into several cases reported in the media on Thursday, including one where a Glasgow pensioner died after a 40-hour wait for an ambulance.\nThe Herald newspaper reported that the family of 65-year-old Gerard Brown were told that he could have survived had help arrived sooner.\nMr Brown's GP - who is said to have repeatedly warned 999 call handlers that the patient's status was critical - was quoted as describing the crisis engulfing the Scottish Ambulance Service as being like \"third world medicine\".\nThe Scottish Ambulance Service is investigating the circumstances of the case, and said it will be \"in contact with Mr Brown's family directly to apologise for the delay\".\nMr Brown's death has been reported to the procurator fiscal, who said an investigation was \"ongoing\".\nPressed on the case at her weekly question session at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon offered her condolences to Mr Brown's family, and said what had been reported was \"unacceptable\".\nShe said Scotland was \"experiencing probably the most challenging combination of circumstances that our health service has faced since its establishment\" due to the pandemic.\nEvelyn from Kilwinning told BBC Radio Scotland's Mornings with Stephen Jardine that her husband had been rushed to hospital three times in the last last few weeks due to concerns about his kidney function.\nTheir longest wait for an ambulance was 23 hours - and on an occasion where it had been called by their GP.\n\"He's an amputee and I wanted to take him in the car,\" said Evelyn. \"The doctor said no, it had to be an ambulance in case he deteriorated. \n\"Twenty-three hours was the longest wait, the time before was 11 and a half hours and the quickest was six hours. Both of us were very distressed. He's a very unwell man so this is going to be reoccurring - but one of these days our luck is just going to run out.\n\"The ambulance crew were absolutely amazing, but they were run ragged. When I went to the hospital there were nine ambulances outside the hospital waiting to admit people - that's nine crews that are off the road for hours.\"\nBrian from Troon said he was proud of his daughter who is an emergency call handler - but often hears of frustrated people becoming \"abusive\" to staff when they are told their cases are not high priority.\n\"It's reducing them to tears,\" said Brian. \"The staff are coming home looking for someone to talk to about it. \n\"Luckily the ambulance service have got it covered - supervisors listen in to the calls and say that's not acceptable and will cut them off and take the call themselves. They also look at the welfare side of things, they are such a good service. Abuse is totally not acceptable.\n\"It's their professionalism that gets them through this - they have sympathy with their callers, they try to calm them and in some cases they save people's lives until the ambulance arrives, whether it be someone having a stroke or having a baby.\"\nThe head of the Scottish Ambulance Service has previously apologised to patients over increased waiting times, saying staff were working under \"unprecedented pressure\" due to a \"huge increase\" in both Covid and non-Covid cases.\nPauline Howie said the service was \"at full capacity\" and hospitals were too, meaning it takes longer to hand over patients at emergency departments - creating delays in responding to other calls.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the ambulance service was \"in crisis\", and said cases like that of Mr Brown \"shouldn't be happening in Scotland in 2021\".\nHe also called for Health Secretary Humza Yousaf to withdraw comments he made on BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday, when he said people should \"think twice\" about whether they really needed an ambulance before calling for one. \nMs Sturgeon said the ambulance service was already \"operating at its highest level of escalation\" in response to current pressures, and said Mr Yousaf's comments reflected others made by services \"in every part of the UK\".\nLabour leader Anas Sarwar raised the same case, describing it as an \"avoidable human tragedy\".\nHe said Ms Sturgeon should not use the pandemic as an excuse, adding: \"There is a simple truth - nobody should be left to die on the floor while waiting 40 hours for an ambulance.\"\nMs Sturgeon said governments across the world were dealing with similar problems at the moment, and that her administration was \"absolutely focused\" on providing solutions.\nMeanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton called for the military assistance to be deployed swiftly, saying the government had \"done too little, too late\"."

      "tags": "Long Covid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates about 1.3 million people in the UK have \"long Covid\" - symptoms lasting more than four weeks. \nMost people who catch Covid don't become severely ill and get better relatively quickly. \nBut some have long-term problems after recovering from the original infection - even if they weren't very ill in the first place.\nLong Covid is not fully understood, and there is no internationally-agreed definition - so measures of how common it is or what symptoms are involved vary. \nGuidance for UK health workers describes long Covid as symptoms that continue for more than 12 weeks after an infection which cannot be explained by another cause. \nAccording to the NHS website, these can include:\nBut patient surveys have identified tens and even hundreds of other symptoms. A large study by University College London (UCL) identified 200 symptoms affecting 10 organ systems.  \nThese include hallucinations, insomnia, hearing and vision changes, short-term memory loss and speech and language issues. Others have reported gastro-intestinal and bladder problems, changes to periods and skin conditions.  \nThe severity of symptoms varies, but many have been left unable to perform tasks like showering or remembering words. However these symptoms can have other causes too. \nONS research published in September 2021 found 0.5% of people who tested negative for coronavirus had at least one symptom that lasted for three months, compared to 3% who tested positive. \nThere is currently no standard test, with doctors first ruling out other possible causes for symptoms.\nPeople who are suspected of having it are likely to be tested for other issues first like diabetes, thyroid function and iron deficiency, before being offered a long Covid diagnosis. \nIt is possible that a blood test could become available in the future. \nWe don't yet know for sure.\nIt could be that the initial infection makes some people's immune systems go into overdrive, attacking not just the virus but their own tissues. \nThe virus itself getting into and damaging our cells might explain some symptoms like a loss of smell and taste, while damage to blood vessels could, for example, contribute to heart and lung problems. \nAnother theory suggests that fragments of the virus could remain in the body, possibly lying dormant and then becoming reactivated. \nThis happens with some other viruses, like herpes and the Epstein Barr virus which causes glandular fever. \nHowever, there isn't currently much evidence for this happening with Covid.\nIt's likely there are several different things going on in different people, to cause such a wide range of problems. \nThis is difficult to pin down because doctors only recently started recording long Covid.\nThe latest ONS estimate suggests that about 1.3 million people in the UK have it. Of those, 892,000 (70%) first caught the virus at least 12 weeks ago and 506,000 (40%) at least a year ago.\nThe survey asked nearly 352,000 people to record their own symptoms.\nIt suggests the condition is most common in: \nIn April, the ONS indicated about one in every 10 people with Covid had symptoms lasting at least three months. \nBut in September, it suggested this proportion was one in 40.\nFigures will continue to change as more data is collected, and will vary according to the definitions used. \nChildren are less likely than adults to catch Covid and are therefore less likely to develop long Covid - but some still do. \nHowever, in August 2021 leading experts said they were reassured about the scale of long Covid in young people after the biggest study in the world showed persistent symptoms were less common than feared. \nSome early estimates had suggested as many as half of all children who caught coronavirus would develop long Covid.\nA team of researchers, led by the Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, investigated more than 200,000 positive cases among 11 to 17-year-olds between September 2019 and March 2020.\nThey think that between 4,000 and 32,000 of those were still experiencing symptoms 15 weeks later. \nWe don't have know how severe the symptoms were, but there was little evidence that children were left bedridden or unable to go to school.\nBut the researchers stressed the risk to young people is \"not trivial\", and said it was vital children get the medical support they need. \nSome reports suggest people who have been vaccinated are less likely to have long Covid. \nVaccination can help prevent people contracting the virus and developing long Covid in the first place.\nIt may also prevent infections \"turning into\" long Covid but this is less clear. \nAbout 90 long Covid assessment centres have been set up across England.\nSimilar clinics have opened in Northern Ireland, while in Scotland and Wales patients are referred to different services by their GPs or other health professionals, depending on their symptoms.\nAt the moment there are no proven drug treatments and the main focus is on managing symptoms and gradually increasing activity. \nStudies on how best to spot, treat and improve the lives of people with long Covid are continuing.

      "tags": "Afghanistan",
      "text": "The US has admitted that a drone strike in Kabul days before its military pullout killed 10 innocent people.\nA US Central Command investigation found that an aid worker and nine members of his family, including seven children, died in the 29 August strike.\nThe youngest child, Sumaya, was just two years old.\nThe deadly strike happened days after a terror attack at Kabul airport, amid a frenzied evacuation effort following the Taliban's sudden return to power.\nIt was one of the US military's final acts in Afghanistan, before ending its 20-year operation in the country.\nUS intelligence had tracked the aid worker's car for eight hours, believing it was linked to IS-K militants - a local branch of the Islamic State (IS) group, US Central Command Gen Kenneth McKenzie said.\nThe investigation found the man's car had been seen at a compound associated with IS-K, and its movements aligned with other intelligence about the terror group's plans for an attack on Kabul airport.\nAt one point, a surveillance drone saw men loading what appeared to be explosives into the boot of the car, but these turned out to be containers of water.\nGen McKenzie described the strike as a \"tragic mistake\", and added that the Taliban had not been involved in the intelligence that led to the strike.\nThe strike happened as the aid worker - named as Zamairi Ahmadi - pulled into the driveway of his home, 3km (1.8 miles) from the airport. \nThe explosion set off a secondary blast, which US officials initially said was proof that the car was indeed carrying explosives. However the investigation has found it was most likely caused by a propane tank in the driveway.\nOne of those killed, Ahmad Naser, had been a translator with US forces. Other victims had previously worked for international organisations and held visas allowing them entry to the US.\nRelatives of the victims told the BBC the day after the strike that they had applied to be evacuated, and had been waiting for a phone call telling them to go to the airport.\nIn a statement, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said: \"We now know that there was no connection between Mr Ahmadi and Isis-Khorasan, that his activities on that day were completely harmless and not at all related to the imminent threat we believed we faced.\n\"We apologise, and we will endeavour to learn from this horrible mistake.\"\nThe horrific consequences of the US military's miscalculation have drawn questions about the accuracy of future counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan with a US presence no longer on the ground. \nThis catastrophe exposed the dreadful human cost of a war that inflicted a lot of damage from the air for years.\nThat it should take place just as the Americans ended their 20-year occupation will cast an even darker stain on the chaotic US exit. \nBut for some in the region, it is a particularly stark example of the ongoing dangers of drone warfare.\nWhen the US started to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, the Taliban managed to seize control of the country within about two weeks in a lightning-fast offensive. \nPresident Ashraf Ghani fled to the United Arab Emirates, and Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, fell on 15 August.\nIt sparked a mass evacuation effort from the US and its allies, as thousands of people tried to flee. Many were foreign nationals or Afghans who had worked for foreign governments.\nThere were scenes of panic and chaos at Kabul airport, and some people fell to their deaths after trying to cling to US military planes as they took off.\nThe security situation was further heightened after a suicide bomber killed up to 170 civilians and 13 US troops outside the airport on 26 August. IS-K said it had carried out the attack.\nMany of those killed had been hoping to board evacuation flights leaving the city.\nThe last US soldier left Afghanistan on 31 August - the deadline President Joe Biden had set for the US withdrawal. \nMore than 124,000 foreigners and Afghans were flown out of the country beforehand. But some people were unable to get out in time, and evacuation efforts are ongoing."

      "tags": "Housing,Michael Gove",
      "text": "The government is pausing its controversial planning reforms in England amid an angry backlash from Conservative MPs, government sources have told the BBC.\nMichael Gove - who was given the role of housing secretary on Wednesday - is said to want to address MPs' concerns.\nThe government has pledged to build 300,000 new homes a year.\nAnd ministers had insisted the planning rules needed a radical shake-up to ensure more homes could be delivered.\nUnder their proposals, the current system - where local planning officials assess applications case-by-case - would be replaced with new rules based on zones. \nCouncils in England would have to classify all land in their area as \"protected\", for \"renewal\", or for \"growth\".\nIn protected areas, including areas of natural beauty, places at risk of flooding, and the green belt, development would generally remain restricted.\nBut councils would have to look favourably on development in \"renewal\" areas, whilst in \"growth\" zones, applications conforming to pre-agreed local plans would automatically gain initial approval.\nLocal residents would get a say on new 10-year plans underpinning the zones, but their ability to comment on individual applications would be curtailed.\nCouncils would have to plan for a share of homes from the government's 300,000 annual house building target for England.\nPoliticians have generally agreed on the need for more affordable homes in England.\nIn 2020 research conducted by the BBC found that the difference between the current housing stock and the number needed for everyone to have a decent home to live in is more than one million homes\nHowever, the plans had been met by resistance from the government's own MPs as well as the opposition. \nIn a Commons debate last year, former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May described the proposals as \"ill-conceived\" and warned that it would \"build up planning permissions, but not houses\".\nEarlier this year, the Conservatives lost their previously safe seat of Chesham and Amersham, in part due to local concerns over increased house building. \nLabour's shadow communities secretary Steve Reed said the reforms should be \"scrapped altogether\" adding that they risked \"selling out communities and gagging residents from having a say over development in their area\".\nAnother Conservative MP, Bob Seely, who had been highly critical of the changes welcomed the pause. He told the BBC he and other MPs would be meeting Mr Gove next week.\nHe said change was needed but expressed concern that the current proposals would give \"too much power to developers\". \nAnother critic, Conservative Sir Roger Gale, said: \"The zoning concept has got to go and I want a clear undertaking that there will be presumption that top quality agricultural land will not be developed on.\" \nSpeaking to the BBC's World at One, Gemma Burgess, a Cambridge University housing expert, said the pause would \"create a period of uncertainty\" and developers and house builders were likely to get \"nervous\" because \"we don't know what's coming next\".\nAndrew Whitaker, of The Home Builders Federation, said the \"very inefficient\" current system needed reform because it allowed people too many \"bites of the cherry\" when it came to objecting developments.\nHe added that there were \"too many local authorities, particularly in the south-east of England\u2026 who don't care about delivering the number of houses that they need in their local area\".\nThe appointment of Mr Gove to the housing department, has been met with apprehension in some quarters, given his reputation as a radical reformer.\nOne Conservative MP told the BBC: \"We can't tell whether he's been appointed to build any and everywhere regardless of the opposition, or whether he's been appointed to deliver some sort of compromise.\"\nA Labour councillor expressed concern Mr Gove would override any opposition to changes, adding \"the fear is he'll fly in, make his mark, and fly out like he did in education\" - a reference to his school reforms and battles with the teachers' unions. \nMeanwhile, Mr Gove has faced calls to return \u00a3100,000 in donations from a property developer on 6 August to avoid any conflict of interest. \nParliamentary records show that he received two donations of \u00a350,000 each from Zachariasz Gertler, a British/German developer.\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"The Tories are much more interested in taking developers' cash than they are in building affordable and social housing.\"\nA spokesperson for the Housing, Communities and Local Government said all donations made to Mr Gove \"have been declared publicly and the proper process followed\"."

      "text": "A British woman who reported being gang-raped in Cyprus has appealed against her conviction for lying about the attack.\nHer legal team told the Cypriot Supreme Court that her statement retracting the gang rape allegation was unreliable because of how it was obtained.\nShe was detained for more than six hours, they said, with no access to a lawyer or translator, and placed under extreme pressure.\nPolice deny violating her rights.\nThe woman, who is 21 and from Derbyshire, originally told Cypriot police she had been raped by a group of 12 Israeli men and boys in Ayia Napa in July 2019.\nAfter retracting the allegation she was then tried and convicted of causing public mischief.\nShe was given a four-month suspended sentence in January 2020, which meant she could return to the UK.\nShe did not attend the two-hour appeal hearing, which was conducted in Greek in front of a panel of three judges.\nThere was no ruling on the appeal today, and it could take as long as six months.\nSpeaking after the hearing, the woman's English barrister, Lewis Power QC, said: \"This is the biggest case here in the last decade beyond a shadow of a doubt and the world is watching.\n\"It is so important for young women across the world. This case is a beacon.\"\nMr Power said he had spoken to the woman and her mother, who were \"back in the UK watching from afar\".\n\"She's bearing up really well. She is getting on with her life at university,\" he said.\n\"She is very anxious about the result but she is fairly upbeat and determined that this won't ruin her life.\"\nHer case has attracted widespread publicity and dozens of protesters gathered outside the court building for the appeal hearing.\nAs they banged drums, chanted and clapped their hands, some held up banners reading \"End rape culture\" and \"I believe her\".\nAdamos Demosthenous, representing the Cyprus attorney general, had argued the appeal should not be heard because the woman had criticised the trial judge in an ITV documentary, but the court ruled against the submission and heard the arguments.\nThe woman's lawyers said the retraction statement, which formed the basis of the prosecution case, should never have been admitted into evidence.\nThey said as well as being placed under pressure with no lawyer or translator, she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder at the time as a result of the rape.\nThey also argued the retraction statement was not written by a native English speaker.\nHer Cypriot lawyer, Nicoletta Charalambidou, said the lower court started from the position that there was no rape and had misunderstood the offence of public mischief, which requires a false statement of a make-believe crime.\nShe said the trial judge, Michalis Papathanasiou, also did not allow the defendant to talk about the alleged rape, repeatedly saying: \"This is not a rape trial.\"\nIf the conviction is not overturned her legal team intends to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights.\nAfter the hearing, Mr Power said: \"I think it was a very fruitful hearing where the court asked very poignant questions, considered the legal arguments and identified the points which will ultimately decide this appeal.\n\"We cannot pre-empt the decision of the court, but we were glad to see the court had given much thought and considerable consideration to a very, very difficult case.\"\nMichael Polak from Justice Abroad, which has been helping the woman, added: \"Without wanting to pre-judge the decision of the Supreme Court, we feel we were happy with the way proceedings went today and the way the judges engaged with our arguments.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Michael D Higgins,Simon Coveney,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson",
      "text": "Irish President Michael D Higgins has continued to defend his decision not to attend a church service to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland.\nThe Queen is among the guests due to attend the event in Armagh on 21 October, and Mr Higgins denied that his decision was a snub to the Queen.\nHe said he declined the invite because the event had become politicised.\nPresident Higgins said the title of the service made it \"inappropriate\" for him to attend as head of state.\nThe Armagh church service has been organised to \"mark the centenaries of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland\".\nSpeaking in Rome, where he met Pope Francis on Friday, President Higgins said he felt the title \"wasn't a neutral statement politically\".\nHe explained that he had been considering the invitation for about six months, and in the week before St Patrick's Day, he shared his concerns with the organisers of the event.\nPresident Higgins said he recalled saying: \"We must do everything we can to support each other's events, but if this event is titled as it is, and structured as it is, it would present difficulties.\"\nDuring an interview with the Irish Times on Thursday, President Higgins also said he had been incorrectly referred to as the president of the Republic of Ireland in the invitation rather than the president of Ireland.\nHowever, in the press conference in Rome, he corrected his earlier statement about how he had been titled.\n\"I do want to clarify one point in my interview yesterday with Harry [McGee], that I may be responsible for creating a small confusion, and that is - the organisers writing to my office have always referred to me as president of Ireland,\" he said. \n\"The reference to the president of the Republic of Ireland is really the remark of the leadership of the DUP.\"\nPresident Higgins insisted that he had been a \"regular\" visitor to Northern Ireland and \"had no difficulties appearing in Northern Ireland with Her Majesty\".\nHe explained that his decision to decline the invitation was not a sudden one, saying he had given the matter proper consideration. \n\"When you are president, and you are responsible for the long vision you have to take all of the consequences into account and all of the interpretations, and I did that,\" he said. \nThe president also took issue with some commentators who had criticised his decision not to attend the Armagh event and those who were \"telling me what I have to do\".\nIn his newspaper interview on Thursday, the president said he was \"not snubbing anyone and I am not part of anyone's boycott or any other events in Northern Ireland\".\n\"I wish their service well but they understand that I have the right to exercise discretion as to what I think is appropriate,\" he added.\nThe president's decision provoked criticism in Northern Ireland, with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson saying it was a \"disappointing and retrograde step\".\nHowever, President Higgins said criticism from the DUP was \"a bit much\".\n\"I have gone up to Northern Ireland to take part in events. There often has not been a great deal of traffic down from the DUP people who are criticising me now.\"\nSir Jeffrey said the president's comments were \"not conducive to reconciliation\" and added that he was disappointed by his remarks about the DUP.\nHe told BBC Radio UIster's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday morning that the church service was intended to mark the event of the centenary and \"reflect where we are\".\n\"It is not just my party that has raised this as a concern. unionists will be disappointed,\" he said.\n\"Failing to recognise the existence of Northern Ireland does not help anybody.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in President Mary Lou McDonald, however, tweeted that the partition of Ireland had been a \"catastrophe for our people and our country\".\nShe added: \"The partition of Ireland costs us to this day, holds us back, divides us. Uachtar\u00e1n na h\u00c9ireann has made clear his decision not to attend a commemorative event. His decision is the correct one.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in assembly member Declan Kearney, speaking at another centenary event held in Belfast on Friday, said the party had not yet received an invitation to October's church service but added: \"If we do so, we too will be declining it.\"\nThe leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland said it would have been \"very special\" if President Higgins was able to attend the church service and said his absence was \"unexpected\".\nArchbishop Eamon Martin added that the event was \"completely non-political\" and was intended to provide a moment for prayer and reflection. \nNewly appointed Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns, also in attendance at the Union Theological College service, said it was \"a matter for the president of the Irish Republic to decide what diary commitments he accepts and what he doesn't\".\n\"We will carry on marking a very historic, inclusive event for all communities in Northern Ireland,\" he added. \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood called for political leaders across the island to \"pause and reflect on the weight of their words\".\nHe said \"cynical criticism\" of President Higgins' decision not to attend the event would \"not advance the cause of reconciliation, particularly when it comes from quarters that have downplayed and degraded the importance of all-island cooperation for two decades\".\n\"I would respectfully ask that those for whom this is disappointing reflect on the honest remarks made by President Higgins last night and understand the views of those for whom partition is not a cause for celebration or commemoration,\" he added.\nOnce elected Irish presidents, like the Queen, are rarely criticised and are expected to be above daily politics.\nSo, it is no surprise there has been to date a largely muted reaction south of the border to President Higgins' decision not to attend the centenary event organised by the four main Christian churches.\nThose few voices that have asked him to reconsider his position have done so in the name of north-south reconciliation - a cause he would argue he has been to the forefront of with his first state visit to the UK by an Irish president.\nThose who support his decision say no head of state of any country could acquiesce to an event that marked the partitioning of his country and caused huge harm.\nIn past comments, President Higgins, who was a left-wing politician, has spoken about \"ethical remembrance\" and reminding the British of their role in colonialism and imperialism and the legacy of that for descendants.\nWhile his non-attendance at the event has been criticised by unionist and other politicians, it is unlikely to damage his reputation south of the border where the controversy is largely seen as - at least until now - a \"political bubble\" story.\nResponding to President Higgins' explanation for not attending the church service, Ulster Unionist MLA Mike Nesbitt said he had previously admired the president's outreach.\n\"If there was a problem with language then there is no reason why the presidential support staff could not have opened a quiet back channel to resolve all issues of language,\" he said.\nHe added that the issue had the potential to \"infect good relations and reconciliation\".\nAlliance MP Stephen Farry previously called on President Higgins to reconsider his decision, saying the event was \"very much in keeping with the reconciliation efforts of successive Irish presidents and the Queen\". \nIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney travelled to Belfast on Friday to continue talks with Stormont parties as the controversy over the service continues.\nSpeaking ahead of another event to mark the centenary organised by the Presbyterian church, he confirmed the Irish government had been consulted about the president's invitation to the church service. \nBut he said there was no \"clear advice\" given on whether or not he should attend. \nHe added President Higgins had made his own decision and that had to be respected.\nThe Irish government previously said the issue of attendance at the service was a matter for the president alone and any invitation for a government representative to attend would be considered."

It's the first time that this drawing is out in the open,\" said Teio Meedendorp, senior researcher at the Van Gogh Museum.\nHe told the BBC it was \"absolutely impossible\" to say how much it was worth.\nVan Gogh appeared to have used  the drawing as the basis for a slightly different version of the drawing shortly afterwards, which he preferred, and which is currently in the museum's collection under the title Worn Out.\nThe artist made Study for Worn Out when he was living in the Hague and still learning to draw at around the age of 29. Experts say it offers an exceptional insight into Van Gogh's working process at the time.\nThe museum's director, Emilie Gordenker, said the team were \"delighted with this discovery\".\n\"We are very happy to have made a contribution to our specialist field,\" she added. \"It's quite rare for a new work to be attributed to Van Gogh. We're proud to be able to share this early drawing and its story with our visitors.\"\nThe owner of the work, who wants to remain anonymous, asked the museum to determine whether the drawing could be attributed to Van Gogh.\nIn a statement, Meedendorp said: \"In stylistic terms, it fits perfectly with the many figure studies we know from Van Gogh's time in The Hague and the connection with Worn Out is obvious. \n\"The artist began by drawing a grid on the paper, which tells us that he worked with a perspective frame to help him capture a figure quickly with the correct proportions. He then worked the sheet up in his characteristically expressive drawing style: not refined, but with energetic scratches and strokes and laying down contours, in search of a pithy image with special attention to effects of light and shade.\n\"In terms of the materials, you also find everything you'd expect in a Van Gogh drawing from this period: a thick carpenter's pencil as medium, coarse watercolour paper as support, and fixing with a solution of water and milk. \n\"There are traces of damage in the corners on the back of the drawing, which we can link to the way Van Gogh customarily attached sheets of paper to his drawing board using wads of starch.'\"\nThe announcement comes six months after a Van Gogh painting of a Paris street went on display for the first time after spending more than 100 years behind closed doors.\nA Street Scene In Montmartre has been owned by a French family for most of the time since it was painted in 1887.\nThe painting went on to fetch 13.09 million euros (\u00a311.2m) at auction in March."

      "text": "One in 40 people with coronavirus has symptoms lasting at least three months, Office for National Statistics figures suggest.\nIn April, an ONS report put the proportion at about one in every 10.\nThe latest, large and comprehensive analysis suggests long Covid may be less common than previously thought. \nBut the condition is not fully understood and still has no universally agreed definition, leading to different studies producing different figures.\nThe latest ONS analysis asked two groups of people - those who had tested positive for coronavirus and those who had not - whether they had:\nWhat are the symptoms of long Covid?\nAbout 3% of people in the study who had tested positive had at least one of the symptoms for at least three months after infection.  \nAmong those who had not tested positive, that proportion was 0.5%, meaning one in every 40 infected people had their coronavirus symptoms last for three months or longer.\nAnd like many other reports, the analysis suggests women, 50- to 69-year-olds and people with other long-term health conditions are the most likely to have some of these symptoms 12 weeks after a Covid infection.\nPeople with high levels of virus in their body when testing positive are also more likely to have long Covid, the analysis suggests.\nThe ONS study is big, detailed and very carefully put together.\nThey looked at data from more than 50,000 people, half of whom had tested positive for coronavirus. \nAnd they were testing people at random, so we can be pretty certain that we're comparing a group of people who had Covid with another group who didn't. That's not true for all analyses.\nThey asked people about specific symptoms, as well as asking people to self-diagnose in another analysis.\nThey say their estimates are closer to the truth than the higher estimates they gave in April, because they have long-term follow-up on a lot of people and they've improved their statistical analysis. \nNo analysis of long Covid is perfect, and this analysis does omit some classic long Covid symptoms.\nBut this is a big addition to research on the condition and one that suggests that this illness is, thankfully, less common than we may have feared.\nONS statisticians point out studies from other organisations have their own definitions of long Covid with more symptoms, focus on different people (for example some include people with suspected Covid infections alongside those confirmed by a test) and a different way of collecting data. \nTheir own list of symptoms didn't include \"brain fog\", something commonly reported by people with long Covid. \nSo they also asked people whether they had long Covid - rather than about the 12 symptoms on the list. \nThis analysis shows around one in nine people infected with the virus said they had experienced the condition. \nKevin McConway, emeritus professor of statistics at the Open University, said the report shows that what counts as long Covid is far from clear. \nHe added: \"It does not concern me that, at this stage in the pandemic, numerical estimates about something as new and complicated as long Covid differ quite a lot - what is important is that those involved should discuss openly what needs to be done to clarify the position.\n\"But the need to do that should not hold up the establishment and improvement of services to help people with these conditions, however they are defined and counted.\""

      "text": "Covid PCR testing should be abandoned for most holidaymakers, says travel organisation Abta.\nFully vaccinated travellers should not need to be tested on their return from lower-risk countries, it said.\nIt also called for a \"significant overhaul\" of the traffic light system for travel destinations.\nAbta said the policies had \"choked off\" this summer's travel trade, with seven out of 10 travel firms planning to make redundancies after furlough ends.\nIt also called for the government to reduce the traffic light system to just a small number of \"red list\" countries, purely for the management of known Covid variants of concern.\nThe expense of PCR testing is widely blamed for discouraging people from travelling abroad.\nAt present, going on holiday abroad means taking Covid tests when you are returning to the UK.\nMost private providers charge above \u00a360 for PCR tests and \u00a330 for lateral flow devices. The government has warned more than 80 providers over misleading prices.\nThe next formal review of the government's travel policies is expected by 1 October, while the furlough scheme is due to end on 30 September.\nWith more than 80% of eligible UK adults already vaccinated against Covid, it was time for a \"stable framework\" for international travel, said Abta, which represents tour operators and travel agents.\nNew summer foreign holiday bookings for 2021 were down 83% on 2019, Abta said, while almost half of travel companies reported they had seen no increase in 2021 bookings compared with last year, despite the rollout of the vaccine programme.\nThe summer sun is fading, but the travel industry's fears are heating up as the end of furlough approaches. \nThe industry is disappointed that vaccination didn't open up international travel as they would have hoped. The government said it will review the way international travel works before October and many expect it will come this week. Voices in the industry are hoping to make themselves heard before ministers meet to discuss exactly what might change. \nA sticking point could be PCR testing. The government has argued so far that it's needed for all travellers to catch variants of concern as early as possible, but the industry say these expensive tests are putting off travellers. \nWinter is approaching and travel companies need to make decisions about their future operations: they are waiting anxiously to see which way the government will go. \nAbta chief executive Mark Tanzer said: \"The government's travel requirements have choked off this summer's travel trade - putting jobs, businesses and the UK's connectivity at risk. \n\"While our European neighbours have been travelling freely and safely, the British were subject to expensive measures which have stood in the way of people visiting family and friends, taking that much-needed foreign holiday and making important business connections.\n\"The government needs to wake up to the damage its policies are doing to the UK travel industry and the impact they will have on the wider economic recovery.\"\nAbta urged the government to extend the furlough scheme for travel businesses alongside a package of tailored financial support for the industry.\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"Our top priority is to protect public health. Decisions on our traffic light system are kept under regular review and are informed by the latest risk assessment from the Joint Biosecurity Centre and wider public health factors.\n\"We recognise the challenging times facing the travel sector, which is why we have committed around \u00a37bn of support by September 2021 and continue to work with industry to help them navigate this difficult period.\""

      "text": "People in England are no longer legally required to wear face masks in almost all public spaces, although they are still recommended in some settings. \nThe change is part of the government's decision to lift Plan B coronavirus measures in England.\nMasks are still required in many situations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nFrom Thursday 27 January:\nWhat are the latest changes to the UK's Covid rules?\nFace mask changes: 'We hope customers aren't discouraged'\nIn Scotland, masks must be worn in most indoor public spaces including public transport, shops and gyms (although they can be temporarily removed when exercising).\nThey must be worn in pubs and restaurants when not seated or dancing, and in the workplace in communal areas and canteens. \nThey are compulsory for all school staff as well as secondary school pupils and are required in indoor public spaces in universities.\nLike England, under-12s are exempt.\nFrom Friday 28 January, adults running organised sessions with under-5s will no longer need to wear face coverings. \nIn Northern Ireland, post-primary pupils must wear face coverings inside school buildings, as must staff if they can't socially distance.\nMasks must also be worn on public transport, in shops and hospitality venues unless you're sitting down to eat or drink.\nMasks aren't required in gyms or other exercise venues.\nHowever, people no longer have to show proof of exemption if they're not wearing a mask.\nUnder-13s don't have to wear masks in public indoor places, and primary school pupils are exempt from the rules on public transport.\nPeople no longer have to wear face masks by law in cafes, pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, but face coverings are required on public transport and  most public spaces, including shops.\nSecondary school pupils are being asked to wear masks in class until the end of half term. \nThe guidance in Wales applies to everyone aged 11 or over.\nIn England, Transport for London (TfL) officers and police can currently fine people \u00a3200 for their first offence. This drops to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days. \nThe penalty doubles for each subsequent offence, with no discount for quick payment. So, a second penalty would be \u00a3400, a third \u00a3800, up to a maximum of \u00a36,400. \nIn Wales, the penalty for a first offence is \u00a360, with the fine doubling for each subsequent offence - up to a maximum of \u00a31,920. Repeat offenders can also be prosecuted in court where fines are unlimited.\nIn Scotland, the police can issue a penalty notice of up to \u00a360 for breaking the law on mask-wearing.\nEvidence suggests transmission mainly happens indoors where people are close together.\nCovering the nose and mouth reduces the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and while speaking.\nThe main purpose is to protect others although there is some evidence they offer protection to wearers.\nIt should:\nStandard surgical masks are acceptable. It is also possible to buy FFP2 and FFP3 masks used by healthcare workers which can offer higher protection. However, these must be fitted correctly to work."

      "text": "The UK's \"most vulnerable\" hospital patients, who are unable to build up an antibody response to Covid, will be offered new drug Ronapreve from Monday. \nThe new Covid treatment, approved just last month, uses a pair of laboratory-made antibodies to attack the virus.\nIt was famously used as part of the suite of experimental medicines given to US President Donald Trump last year. \nThe antibody cocktail has been shown to reduce hospital stays by four days and cut the risk of death by a fifth.\nThe government said it had secured sufficient supply of the new therapeutic for eligible NHS patients across the four nations to cover the forthcoming winter.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said he was \"thrilled it will be saving lives from as early as next week\".\n\"The UK is leading the world in identifying and rolling out life-saving medicines, particularly for Covid 19, and we will continue our vital work to find the best treatments available to save lives and protect the NHS,\" he said.\nThe new treatment is expensive and priority will be given to those patients at greatest risk of becoming severely ill. \nIt will be offered to those over-50 without the necessary antibodies, and those aged 12-49 who are immuno-compromised - for example those with certain cancers - who struggle to mount an antibody response, either through being exposed to Covid, or from vaccination.\nThe government said guidance would be sent to clinicians imminently so they can begin prescribing the treatment as soon as possible.\nOf those eligible patients, antibody testing will initially be used to determine whether they are seronegative - meaning those who do not have an adequate existing antibody response - and will therefore be eligible for treatment. \nThe treatment antibodies - casirivimab and imdevimab - will then be administered to patients through a drip. The drug works by binding to the virus' spike protein, stopping it from being able to infect the body's cells.\nThe antibody therapy attacks the virus, unlike other Covid treatments such as the steroid dexamethasone that calm the body's overactive immune system. \nThere had been concern the idea was a dud after trials failed when antibodies were taken from patients who had recovered from Covid.\nHowever, the companies Regeneron and Roche tested monoclonal antibodies in the laboratory to find the two that were best able to stick to the virus. \nThis has proved far more effective, and the therapy continues to work against new variants. \n\"Ronapreve is the first dedicated medicine developed for Covid 19 to receive marketing authorisation from the MHRA, representing a significant milestone in how the NHS is able to fight this disease,\" said Paul McManus, Covid 19 lead at Roche Products Ltd.\n\"We're grateful for the collaboration of the vaccine taskforce and NHS England in helping to bring this important antibody cocktail to treat and prevent acute Covid 19 across the UK.\""

That's not true for all analyses.\nThey asked people about specific symptoms, as well as asking people to self-diagnose in another analysis.\nThey say their estimates are closer to the truth than the higher estimates they gave in April, because they have long-term follow-up on a lot of people and they've improved their statistical analysis. \nNo analysis of long Covid is perfect, and this analysis does omit some classic long Covid symptoms.\nBut this is a big addition to research on the condition and one that suggests that this illness is, thankfully, less common than we may have feared.\nONS statisticians point out studies from other organisations have their own definitions of long Covid with more symptoms, focus on different people (for example some include people with suspected Covid infections alongside those confirmed by a test) and a different way of collecting data. \nTheir own list of symptoms didn't include \"brain fog\", something commonly reported by people with long Covid. \nSo they also asked people whether they had long Covid - rather than about the 12 symptoms on the list. \nThis analysis shows around one in nine people infected with the virus said they had experienced the condition. \nKevin McConway, emeritus professor of statistics at the Open University, said the report shows that what counts as long Covid is far from clear. \nHe added: \"It does not concern me that, at this stage in the pandemic, numerical estimates about something as new and complicated as long Covid differ quite a lot - what is important is that those involved should discuss openly what needs to be done to clarify the position.\n\"But the need to do that should not hold up the establishment and improvement of services to help people with these conditions, however they are defined and counted.\""

      "text": "People in Wales will need to show a pass proving they have been fully vaccinated or had a negative Covid test to attend clubs and large-scale events.\nThe new rules begin on 11 October.\nCustomers will be able to use an NHS Covid Pass to show they have been vaccinated, or had a negative lateral flow test in the past 48 hours.\nThe pass will be needed for clubs, indoor no-seating events with more than 500 people and outdoor no-seating events with more than 4,000 people.\nIt will also be required for any event with more than 10,000 people.\nPasses will be available to anyone over the age of 16, though will only be compulsory for those aged over 18 to enter certain events.\nIt comes as Public Health Wales (PHW) reported eight further deaths with coronavirus and 2,618 new cases.\nThe Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in Cardiff Bay also said they were disappointed by the move, Plaid Cymru said it was \"perplexed\" by elements of the plan.\nBut Alys Scourfield, from Cardiff, who has cancer, said the announcement means she will now be able to go to watch Wales in the autumn nationals with her son, for what may be her final time. \nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford made the announcement as part of the latest review of coronavirus restrictions, despite warnings from a nightclub trade body that the move may damage the nightclub industry.\n\"The last thing we want is further lockdowns and for businesses to have to close their doors once again,\" he said.\n\"That's why we must take small but meaningful action now to control the spread of the virus and reduce the need for tougher measures later.\"\nThe Welsh government rejected the idea of a vaccine-only passport for large-scale events as it would discriminate against those who cannot get a vaccine, Mr Drakeford said in a news conference.\nThe first minister said only allowing the double-jabbed into nightclubs or sports matches raised \"a series of ethical, legal and technical questions\".\nScotland is introducing vaccine passports on 1 October, but the Welsh government will use what is calls vaccine passes instead, which allow people to use a negative lateral flow test to gain entry.\nUnder the UK government's winter plan, vaccine certification will be required for nightclubs and other large events in England if data suggests action is needed to \"prevent unsustainable pressure on the NHS\".\nGraeme Da Silva, regional director at Rekom, which manages the Pryzm and Fiction nightclubs in Cardiff and Swansea, said he was \"frustrated\" with the go-ahead for Covid passports.\n\"Once again nightclubs are being singled out,\" he said.\nMr Da Silva said the move will cost the company money, whether that be in extra staffing or the loss of their walk-up trade.\n\"There is not much difference between a club and a nightclub at midnight on a Friday or Saturday. People are dancing, people are busy and actually nightclubs are a lot safer because of the ventilation we have.\n\"First to close, last to open and we've been picked on by the government. Despite all our efforts its been a really tough time for us.\n\"Our venues are at a really fragile state of recovery and many hundreds of jobs are at risk.\n\"Our customer and staff safety have been at the forefront of our agendas but, in the interest in fairness, we would have liked to see this across all retail and hospitality which makes it a difficult pill to swallow.\"\nNight Time Industries Association Wales said: \"We are disappointed that the Welsh government has felt it must mandate Covid passports at this stage, albeit a more liberal implementation with the inclusion of testing.\n\"We still feel that these measures will have a negative impact on businesses, and will create considerable market distortion.\"\nAnd UK Hospitality's executive director for Wales, David Chapman, said it would be an \"extra burden\" leading to closures and job losses.\nHe said it had made the case against passes because of difficulties including definitions of businesses and conflict with customers, all at the same time as a shortage of staff.\n\"Those affected businesses, already in a fragile state following repeated lockdowns and periods of onerous trading restrictions, now find themselves facing further economic and resourcing pressures,\" he said. \nFor Alys Scourfield, from Cardiff, the announcement of Covid passes has \"changed her life\". \nIt means she will now be able to go to watch Wales in the autumn nationals with her son, for what may be her final time. \nMrs Scourfield's \"time is limited\" after her cancer recently spread to her spine. \nShe said she would not go to an event with a large crowd unless she was sure everyone was double jabbed or had a negative test.\n\"I need to go out for mine and my children's mental health and pretend to be a normal person for the short time I've got left,\" she said.\n\"This will make me feel much safer and feel that I've done everything I can possibly do to reduce the risk.\"\nThe leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said he was disappointed by the announcement.                                                                                                       \n\"Welsh Conservatives have been against the introduction of such documentation from the outset, due to the wide-ranging ethical, equality, privacy, legal, and operational ramifications,\" he said.\n\"The inclusion of the lateral flow test element eases one area of concern but a whole host remain, particularly regarding the overall effectiveness of this measure and the impact it will have on businesses, jobs and Wales' economic recovery.\" \nRhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, said he was \"a bit perplexed about elements of this Covid pass scheme\".\n\"It's a much broader target base - we're talking about football matches, not just nightclubs, so there are issues of implementation, certainly,\" he said.\nWelsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds promised to vote against the scheme if it faces a vote in the Senedd.\n\"I understand many people want to get back to a sense of normality, but vaccine passports are not the way to do this and we need to be careful about the precedent they set. They are medical ID cards in all but name and Welsh Liberal Democrats will lead the fight against their introduction.\"\nAt Friday's news conference, Mr Drakeford also said people should keep working from home where possible.\nAlthough the guidance has no legal force, the Welsh government said it wanted to \"reinforce the importance\" of working from home.\nMany large employers are already using \"hybrid\" models, with staff splitting time between home and the office.\nMr Drakeford said: \"If you don't need to be in the office, for example, please work from home whenever you can.\n\"In England, working from home is part of their Plan B - here in Wales is part of our Plan A and in line with that advice from Sage that we should build up our defences in the autumn and winter early.\""

      "tags": "Media,Andrew Neil",
      "text": "Former BBC presenter Andrew Neil says he left GB News over the direction the channel was taking, saying he became a \"minority of one\" within management. \nThe journalist told BBC Question Time he would let people \"make up their own minds\" over whether his exit was because the channel was too right wing.\nHe also described the launch of the new station as not a \"startling success\".\nNeil resigned on Monday as lead presenter and chairman just three months after the channel went to air.\nIn a statement at the time, he said he had decided to \"reduce [his] commitments on a number of fronts\" - something he repeated on BBC One - and wished it well for the future. \nIn response, GB News said: \"Andrew is without doubt one of the finest journalists and interviewers in this country.\n\"GB News thanks him for his 12 months of leadership, wisdom and advice, and we wish him well.\"\nThe TV channel launched in June, promising to \"change the face of news and debate in the UK\".\nIt recruited a number of big names alongside Neil, including former BBC News presenter Simon McCoy, ITV veteran Alastair Stewart and ex-Sun journalist Dan Wootton.\nBut it has been troubled by low viewing figures and resignations from other staff members, including the former advisor to Boris Johnson and ex-BBC correspondent Guto Harri. \nNeil, 72, was on air for less than two weeks before announcing he was taking a break. amid reports that relations between him and chief executive Angelos Frangopoulos had broken down over the direction of the company.\nIn his first appearance since leaving the channel, Neil was asked by a Question Time audience member whether the recent resignations would lead GB News to become \"a new British Fox News\" - the US news channel popular with right-wing viewers. \nThe journalist said he had \"always made it clear it wouldn't be a British Fox News\", claiming the US channel \"deals in untruths, it deals in conspiracy theories, and it deals in fake news\".\nHe added: \"That is not my kind of journalism and I would never have set out to do that.\"\nBut pressed on whether the comparison was why he left, Neil said: \"I will let you draw your own conclusions as to why I am here tonight and not with GB News.\"\nHe added: \"In the run-up to the launch, through the launch and in the aftermath of the launch and I think most of you who know anything about it will know you couldn't file the launch under startling success, more and more differences emerged between myself and the other senior managers and the board of GB News.\n\"And rather than these differences narrowing, they got wider and wider and I felt it was best that if that's the route they wanted to take then that's up to them, it's their money.\"\nPushed again by presenter Fiona Bruce on whether the channel had gone \"too far to the right\", Neil said: \"People should make up their own minds on that. \n\"What I have told you is the differences were such, the direction they were going in was not the direction that I had outlined, it was not the direction that I had envisaged for the channel and I was in the minority of one. \n\"So it is doing what it is doing and it is up to them, good luck to them if that is what they want to do, but it wasn't going to be with me.\""

      "tags": "North Korea-US relations,Asia,North Korea weapons programme,North Korea missile tests,North Korea",
      "text": "Earlier this week, North Korea announced it had successfully tested a long-range cruise missile capable of hitting much of Japan. \nCruise missiles, unlike ballistic missiles, can swerve and turn through most of their flight - allowing them to attack from unexpected angles. \nIt shows North Korea is continuing its pursuit of ever more diverse and sophisticated means to deliver nuclear weapons.\nIt's clear the pandemic, a spate of natural disasters, and internal economic difficulties have done little to deter North Korea's fundamental prioritisation of its nuclear deterrent. \nThe latest successful test brings up a series of questions - why is North Korea doing this now, how significant is this, and what does it tell us about its priorities?\nNorth Korea has broadly been on a trajectory of qualitatively refining and quantitatively expanding its nuclear capabilities since the spring of 2019. \nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un, since returning from the failed February 2019 summit with former U.S. President Donald J. Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam, expressed resolve to continue investing in North Korea's nuclear deterrent and pursuing a \"self-reliant\" national defence strategy.\nBut why is North Korea choosing to do this even as it struggles through food shortages and a deepening economic crisis?\nIt serves multiple ends. \nInternally, these tests amplify Mr Kim's narrative of pursuing self-reliance in national defence and bolsters morale.\nIn practical terms, new capabilities, like these cruise missiles, complicate planning by North Korea's adversaries, who must now contend with new capabilities. \nUnlike ballistic missiles, cruise missiles fly low and slow towards their target.\nThe cruise missiles North Korea tested recently covered a range of some 1,500km (930 miles) over a little more than two hours of flight time. \nBallistic missiles of equivalent range would take a matter of minutes, but North Korea's interest in cruise missiles may be due to the difficulty for its adversaries in detecting their launches and in defending against them.\nAnd what these tests show is that Mr Kim - despite openly contending with the country's difficulties - has maintained his determination to continue advancing his nuclear capabilities.\nUnless we see a fundamental shift in priorities by North Korea or successful diplomatic outreach by the United States, Pyongyang should be expected to continue refining and advancing its capabilities.\nBut is it notable that North Korea chose to introduce this weapon system at this point in time? \nDespite commentary to the contrary, the introduction of this weapon system and its testing likely have little to do with the policy specifics of the Biden administration or the twentieth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, which coincided with these recent tests.\n Of greatest concern to South Korea, Japan, and the international community is the North Korean state media description of these newly tested missiles as \"strategic weapons.\"\nThis usually means that the regime hopes to attach a nuclear warhead to the weapon.   \nNo previous cruise missile system in North Korea has had an implied nuclear weapon delivery role.\nBut the development of these cruise missiles shouldn't come as a surprise. Mr Kim had in January 2021 announced that such a system was under development. \nHe also implied that this missile system could be used in the future for a potential tactical nuclear weapon delivery role. \nCruise missiles are also functionally different from ballistic missiles - which the North tested just two days later. \nThe UN Security Council sanctions actually forbid North Korea from testing ballistic missiles - but not cruise missiles. \nThis is because it considers ballistic missiles to be more threatening because they can carry a bigger and more powerful payloads, have a much longer range and can fly faster.\nBut unlike ballistic missiles, which have a limited ability to manoeuvre in the final stages of their flight, as their payloads hurtle down to the earth, cruise missiles can swerve and turn through the majority of their flight, allowing them to attack from unexpected angles. \nMeanwhile, their low altitude flight means that ground-based radar systems will often only detect these missiles in the final stages of their flight, when it may be too low to successfully attempt to intercept them.\nCruise missiles aren't a fundamentally new technology for North Korea. For years now, it has tested and refined Soviet-derived anti-ship cruise missiles. \nThe recently tested missiles, however, exceed the range of those older cruise missiles by an order of magnitude.\n But these cruise missiles are but one part of this broader effort by North Korea. \nAs the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency recently assessed, Pyongyang has also resumed operations at the gas-graphite reactor at the Yongbyon complex, implying the resumed production of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. \nThe test of ballistic missiles in the days after the cruise missile tests underscores the possibility of North Korea resuming a sustained campaign of missile development, testing, and evaluation.\nAnkit Panda is Stanton Senior Fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace"

      "title": "What's Boris Johnson's reshuffle really all about?",
      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Cabinet reshuffles",
      "text": "\"This is a mad way to run the country,\" confessed a member of the government.\nWhether prime ministers wield sharp knives or attack with blunt spoons, reshuffle days like this are indeed a strange mixture of bravado and farce.\nBravado when, earlier, one cabinet minister told me, \"I think I'm OK,\" as, ashen-faced, looking nauseous and clammy, they were en route to see the prime minister before promptly being sacked.\nAnd farce when, as legend has it, on several occasions, would-be ministers end up jobless, because the post-it notes with their name on fell off the board. Forgotten, their career plunged to the floor too. \nThe way the most senior government politicians are recruited and removed is bizarre and brutal. For weeks ministers have nervously inquired of journalists: \"Is it on?\" And inhabitants of the Westminster village who claim real knowledge of the plan are rarely those who truly know. \nBut, whatever the curious British traditions of how it's done, it is what is done that makes the difference. Prime ministers rarely wield as much power as on the day of the big hirings and firings. \nAnd Boris Johnson has used this occasion to make big changes to the cabinet. The most significant switch came in one of the chunkiest jobs of all.\nRemoving the foreign secretary is a big deal. Dominic Raab's always happy to let it be known that he holds a black belt in karate. And his conversation with the prime minister this reshuffle day took longer than expected, suggesting he fought his move pretty hard. Sources suggest he managed to wangle the ill-defined title of deputy prime minister out of Mr Johnson.\nBeing justice secretary, running prisons, courts, and the legal system, is of course a huge job. Downing Street insists it's not a demotion, and that it doesn't want this move to be seen as punishment after what looked, to many people, like a debacle in Afghanistan.\nBut even with the DPM bauble, Mr Raab, the now former foreign secretary, is a less senior figure in the government.\nThere are some other slightly puzzling aspects. Steve Barclay was, until the reshuffle, chief secretary to the Treasury, wielding the calculator on what is a hugely important Spending Review, when cash for departments for the next few years is fixed. That review is coming in just a few weeks' time, so you might wonder at the wisdom of moving Mr Barclay right now.\nHe's being replaced by Simon Clarke, a previous inhabitant of a Treasury role, a strong supporter of Mr Johnson and North East MP. He's also, at 6ft 7ins, around a foot taller than his new boss in Number 11 - cue the inevitable jokes about Number 10 wanting to make the chancellor feel small.\nIn a similar vein Anne-Marie Trevelyan, also a strong Johnson backer, returns to cabinet as trade secretary. Irrespective of the merit of her move to that department, Ms Trevelyan had been part of the government's team preparing for COP26, a major international event that starts in about 50 days. If it's a true priority, unpicking a part of the team right now may raise a few eyebrows. \nThere are many more jobs to be allocated, more intrigue to come when middle-ranking and junior ministers get their P45s or offers. But the shape of the cabinet itself is clear.\nWhat's harder to divine is any one strong political ideology, or any radical guiding idea. Certainly, politicians popular with the Tory party like Truss seem to have prospered. Loyalty to the prime minister himself seems to have been rewarded.\nBut it's not a Brexit cabinet, or a small-state cabinet, or to use Tory verbiage, a \"one-nation\" cabinet for those more in the middle.\nIt's a Johnson cabinet, with no particular bent towards any one faction or tribe. For some of his backers, that is one of Mr Johnson's attributes - he's not wedded to principle, but staying on top. For other Tories, that's rather the problem - with no one strong ideology other than a desire to win, it begs the question of what it's all really for.\nFor Downing Street, though, this is a day for the doers. After the early traumas of Brexit, then the emergency and horror of the pandemic, the moves represent, they hope, a refreshed team that can get things done.\nWhether it's building houses without upsetting the Tory shires, sorting out school exams, pushing through tougher prison sentences, with new faces it's a government that Downing Street hopes will be more able to push reform forward, and make its case.\nNearly two years after the election, it's perhaps the start of Mr Johnson's third act as prime minister. And while the shuffling of his cabinet pack has passed, so far largely without incident, there is no doubt about the scale of the challenge, individual and collective, that they face. "

      "text": "Boris Johnson is putting the finishing touches to his reshuffle after making significant changes to his top team. \nOn Wednesday, the PM fired both Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, before replacing Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab with Liz Truss. \nHe has now moved on to confirming which junior ministers are in or out of jobs.\nBut one ousted minister, John Whittingdale, told BBC's Newscast that the new team could lack experience.\nIn some of the latest manoeuvres, Conor Burns, who resigned as a trade minister in 2020 after a report found he used \"veiled threats\" to aid his father in a financial dispute, returned to the front bench as a Northern Ireland minister. \nOthers moved to more high-profile ministerial roles on Thursday included Alex Chalk, who was appointed Solicitor General, and Skills Minister Gillian Keegan, who now joins the Department for Health and Social Care.\nBut Justin Tomlinson lost his job as minister for disabled people in the same department, while Matt Warman was sacked as minister of digital infrastructure. \nFormer Brexit and Northern Ireland Minister, Robin Walker, has gone to the Department for Education, where he will work with the new Secretary of State, Nadhim Zahawi.\nAnd Helen Whately, who was the minister for social care, has been moved to the Treasury, but Jesse Norman joined the list of sackings.  \nEarlier on Thursday, Penny Mordaunt left her post as paymaster general at the Cabinet Office to become a minister at the trade department.\nMr Whittingdale - who lost his job as data minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport - said his post had been one he \"loved\" and was \"sad to give up\". \nHe also revealed some of the PM's appointments \"came out of the blue\".\nThe former minister told Newscast: \"I understand that every prime minister has to make room to allow people to be brought forward. I quite recognise the prime minister is keen to have a front-facing cabinet that reflects modern Britain. \n\"Equally it's no bad thing to have a bit of experience around that table and people who have got a good grasp of the detail of the jobs they are being asked to do.\"\nThere were big winners from the reshuffle too, included Nadine Dorries, who was promoted from being a junior health minister into her first cabinet-level job as culture secretary.\nThe Mid Bedfordshire MP is probably best known outside Westminster for her 2012 appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.\nMs Truss, who is the Tory party's first female foreign secretary - and only the second woman to hold the role, following Labour's Margaret Beckett - said she was delighted by the appointment and would use the role to \"promote a positive, outward vision of global Britain\".\nOther changes made on Wednesday included:\nFormer Justice Secretary Mr Buckland's sacking was greeted with some surprise, with a number of Labour MPs tweeting praise for him and senior Conservative Sir Bob Neill - who chairs the Commons Justice Committee - saying he \"deserved better\". \nIn a letter to the prime minister after his dismissal, Mr Buckland called for more investment in the justice system, adding that \"years of underfunding\" had made it harder for it to recover from the effects of the pandemic.\nNew Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Mr Gove will also get the added responsibility of the government's \"levelling up\" agenda - which it claimed would spread wealth and opportunity around the country - while continuing to handle demands for another Scottish independence referendum.\nThe Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Dowden, following his appointment as the Tory party's new co-chairman, had told staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters to start preparing for a general election which could be in 20 months' time.\nAfter the early traumas of Brexit, then the emergency and horror of the pandemic, the moves represent, they hope, a refreshed team that can get things done.\nWhether it's building houses without upsetting the Tory shires, sorting out school exams, pushing through tougher prison sentences, with new faces it's a government that Downing Street hopes will be more able to push reform forward, and make its case.\nNearly two years after the election, it's perhaps the start of Mr Johnson's third act as prime minister.\nRead more from Laura\nMr Johnson continued making changes late into the night on Wednesday as he got the reshuffle of more junior ministers under way, ahead of the further changes on Thursday.\nLong-serving Nick Gibb was sacked from his role at the Department for Education, while Caroline Dinenage lost her job as a culture minister, and Luke Hall was fired as a local government minister.\nAmanda Milling, who was removed as Conservative Party co-chairwoman, has become a Foreign Office minister.\nJulia Lopez has been moved from the Cabinet Office to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, while Greg Hands left the Department of International Trade for a new brief as business minister."
