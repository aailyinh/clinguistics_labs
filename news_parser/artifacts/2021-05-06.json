      "text": "Poor pupils have fallen further behind in maths as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to research. \nThe Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) study suggests primary-school pupils eligible for free school meals have fallen another month behind their classmates since the first lockdown. \nAnd the gap is unlikely to narrow without intervention, despite all pupils returning to class in September.\nThe government has already made \u00a31.7bn catch-up funding available in England.\nBut Sir Peter Lampl, who chairs the EEF, is calling for significant extra funding to mitigate against the long-term impact of school closures as failing to act now will be a \"catastrophe\" for disadvantaged children.\nPupils from 132 primary schools in England were tested in autumn 2019, September 2020 and then towards the end of the autumn term. \nContrary to previous estimates, the interim findings of this study indicated no discernible change to the disadvantage gap in reading. \nPrevious studies have suggested children in England are up to three months behind in their studies after lockdown, with boys and poor pupils worst hit. \nResearch by the National Foundation for Educational indicated the learning gap between rich and poor pupils had grown by almost 50% between March and July 2020. \nThe EEF report found considerable variation in how schools and teachers responded to the huge disruptions caused by Covid-19. \nFor example, 23% of teachers surveyed reported phoning pupils at least once a week, while 37% never called them.\nAnd 24% of schools in the study provided video lessons, while the remaining 76% did not. \nBut the research found no clear evidence of a link between different teaching methods and changes to the achievements of pupils. \nEEF chief executive Prof Becky Francis said: \"The pandemic has brought the significance of social and educational inequality into sharp focus. \n\"Research studies like this one are providing clear evidence that substantial existing gaps have grown further due to the disruption to learning caused by the pandemic.\"\nA department for education spokesperson said: \"We have invested \u00a31.7 billion in ambitious catch-up activity, including high-quality tutoring and summer school provision. The majority of the funding is targeted towards those most in need, while giving schools the flexibility to use it as they believe best, to support their pupils.\n\"We are working with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure all pupils have the chance to recover from the impact of the pandemic as quickly and comprehensively as possible.\" "

      "text": "Madonna has paid tribute to Nick Kamen, the model, actor and singer whose biggest hit was co-written by the star.\nKamen caught the eye in a 1985 Levi's jeans advert - baring his chest in a launderette - and the queen of pop invited him in on a track the following year. He died this week aged 59.\n\"Heartbreaking to know you are gone,\" the superstar posted online.\nThe pair had a top five hit with Each Time You Break My Heart, which featured Madonna on backing vocals.\n\"You were always such a kind, sweet human and you suffered too much,\" she added.\n\"Hope you are happier wherever you are Nick Kamen.\"\nKamen - real name Ivor Neville Kamen - rose to fame in the Levi's commercial, which showed him stripping down to his boxer shorts in a launderette as several women looked on.\nThe advert, soundtracked by Marvin Gaye's I Heard It Through The Grapevine, helped to boost the company's denim sales and made him a sex symbol in the process.\nIt also caught the attention of Madonna, who told the BBC at the time she had been taken by Kamen's \"charisma\" and \"beautiful voice\".\nShe then contacted Kamen and asked him to record Each Time You Break My Heart - a synth-pop track left over from her third album True Blue.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast on Thursday, fashion designer Wayne Hemingway said the memorable Levi's advert was a game-changing cultural moment.\n\"This was an advert that came totally out of club culture, and back then club culture was totally underground,\" he said. \"We didn't have the internet we didn't have social media so things stayed underground and this brought a movement on to mainstream telly.\"\nHemingway added that Kamen was, at the time, \"one of the glamorous young men\" on the London club circuit.\n\"They picked the right person, the right music,\" he continued.\n\"They dressed everybody [in] what today we call vintage styling - it starts off with a vintage car and an old laundrette, and with the 50s-style haircuts.\n\"They got everything right, and on top of that they broke the rules because back then the idea of women ogling men in an advert rather than the horrible other way around - we've now moved on as a society, not fully.\n\"This broke all of the norms and it just stands the test of time, everything about it.\"\nKamen's former girlfriend Amanda de Cadenet also posted a tribute, along with \"one of the sweetest\" photos she took of him with her daughter Atlanta.\n\"Any notoriety you gained, was something you never embraced,\" she wrote. \"It almost embarrassed you.

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Prime Minister has said the government needs to carefully handle outbreaks of the India variant of coronavirus in the UK.\nIt comes as Public Health England (PHE) said one version of it had been elevated to a \"variant of concern\".\nB.1.617.2 appears to be spreading more quickly than two other identified subtypes of the Indian variant.\nScientists believe it is at least as transmissible as the variant first detected in Kent last year.\nBoris Johnson said the government needs to think \"very carefully\" about the public health response.\n\"We're doing a huge amount, obviously, to make sure that when we do find outbreaks of the Indian variant that we do surge testing, that we do door-to-door testing,\" he said.\nPHE said there was currently \"insufficient evidence\" to indicate that any of the variants recently detected in India cause more severe disease or make current vaccines any less effective. \nScientists are now carrying out laboratory testing to better understand the impact of the mutations on the behaviour of the virus.\nViruses mutate all the time, producing different versions of themselves. Most of these mutations are insignificant - and some may even make the virus less dangerous - but others can make it more contagious and harder to vaccinate against.\nThe original India variant - officially known as B.1.617 - was first detected in October.\nThat version has now been re-characterised as three different subtypes, all with slightly different genetic mutations.\nThe UK has seen a sharp increase in one type in particular, known as B.1.617.2, which now makes up the majority of all Indian variant cases and appears to be growing faster than other versions. \nCases have increased from 202 to 520 in the last week, with most detected in London and the North West of England. \nAlmost half were related to travel or contact with a traveller but there have been examples of community transmission linked to work and religious gatherings. \nIn one cluster at a care home, 14 elderly residents who had all been vaccinated, were infected with the variant, a source told the BBC. A number needed hospital treatment, but not for severe disease, and it is thought all have now recovered.\nAll current vaccines are thought to offer some degree of protection against variants but can never completely stop all infections, especially among vulnerable or elderly people.\nIt is tempting to conclude that because there is now evidence this variant is more infectious and because cases have risen rapidly in the UK, this marks the start of the rise of this Indian variant.\nBut there are some good reasons why we should not jump to that conclusion.\nThe rapid rise in cases is being linked to an increase in international travel from India ahead of the country being put on the \"red list\".\nThere are some early signs in the data, Public Health England sources say, that the increase may be coming to an end, meaning that it may reflect that rise in travel rather than significant community spread.\nTwo key factors are in our favour - the vaccines appear to work just as well against this variant as the dominant virus circulating in the UK (although uptake in the Indian community is a little lower) plus there are still significant social distancing restrictions in place that should help to limit spread.\nLots of testing and contact tracing in different areas are taking place - and some surge testing is expected to be announced later in areas where there is most concern. \nIt will be a couple of weeks before we know for sure. The message is clear - this needs to be taken seriously, but there is no need to panic.\nPHE said extra surge testing was now being put in place in affected areas along with more targeted contact tracing to try and stop the spread of the variant. \nAll individuals living in specific postcodes will be asked to get a PCR test, even if they don't have symptoms. \nEnhanced testing is already being rolled out in parts of Bolton which has seen an increase in cases of B.1.617.2 in the last week. \nAnyone living, working or studying in the Rumworth, Deane or Great Lever areas is strongly urged to visit a mobile testing unit, whether they have symptoms or not. \n\"The way to limit the spread of all variants is the same and although we are all enjoying slightly more freedom, the virus is still with us,\" said Dr Susan Hopkins, Covid-19 strategic response director at PHE.  \n\"We are monitoring all of these variants extremely closely and have taken the decision to classify this as a variant of concern because the indications are that it is more transmissible.\"\nLaboratory work is needed to sequence individual Covid tests and identify specific variants, meaning the latest figures are likely to represent the situation about a week ago.\nFigures from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, which analyses positive swabs for different variants, also showed clusters of B.1.617.2 in places including Leicester, Bolton, Nottingham and Blackburn in the week to 24 April.\nIt comes as seven confirmed cases of the same variant have been detected in Northern Ireland - the first discovered in the region.\nIndia has said the B.1.617 variant may be linked to a deadly second coronavirus wave that has swept the country in recent weeks.\nThe country reported a record 412,000 cases in the space of 24 hours on Wednesday, and 3,980 deaths.\nThe surge in infections has already overwhelmed the healthcare system with hospital beds, oxygen and even crematorium space in short supply, while several states are under localised lockdowns and curfews.\nAdditional reporting by Ella Willis."

      "tags": "Tiananmen Square protests of 1989,Hong Kong anti-government protests,China,Hong Kong,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong has been sentenced to 10 months in jail for participating in an unauthorised vigil marking the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. \nThe annual vigil, which has been held in Hong Kong since 1990, was banned for the first time last year by police citing virus measures. \nNevertheless, tens of thousands of people including activists, showed up.\nThe activists that attended, including Wong, were later charged by police. \nWong - aged 24 and Hong Kong's best-known activist internationally - is already in prison for a separate unauthorised assembly conviction under the country's restrictive national security law.\nHe was earlier convicted to 13.5 months and four months in jail on two separate charges, which he is still serving. \nHe will now serve an additional 10 months in jail. \nWong had last Friday, along with other prominent young activists Lester Shum, Tiffany Yuen and Jannelle Leung, pleaded guilty for participating in the Tiananmen vigil. \nThursday's sentencing saw Shum jailed for six months, while the two others have been jailed for four months each. \nHong Kong and Macau are the only parts of China that have been allowed to mark the Tiananmen crackdown. \nThe Tiananmen vigil was again banned this year, with officials again citing public health concerns. \nHowever, there have been questions over whether or not the vigil will be allowed in Hong Kong again, after Beijing imposed the national security law last year which targets dissent in the city. \nPro-democracy protesters occupied Tiananmen Square in April 1989 and began the largest political demonstrations in communist China's history. They lasted six weeks, with as many as a million people taking part.\nOn the night of 3 June tanks moved in and troops opened fire, killing and injuring many unarmed people in and around Tiananmen Square.\nAfterwards the authorities claimed no-one had been shot dead in the square itself. Estimates of those killed in the crackdown range from a few hundred to several thousand.\nOn the mainland, references to the crackdown are banned, and the government mentions it rarely - if at all.\nBut in Hong Kong, tens of thousands of people traditionally gather at the city's Victoria Park to mark the crackdown. \nLast year, one protester said she was afraid it would be the \"last time we can have a ceremony [in Hong Kong]\".\nIntroduced in 2020 by China, the law criminalises secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces, with the maximum sentence life in prison.\nBeijing said the law would target \"sedition\" and bring stability but critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech.\nAround 100 people have been arrested since the law was enacted in June.\nIt was introduced in response to huge pro-democracy protests in 2019 over fears that the country's Basic Law was being eroded.\nBritain handed back Hong Kong to China in 1997, and the Basic Law was created under the handover agreement under the \"one country, two systems\" principle.\nThis is supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,NHS,Personal data,Coronavirus pandemic,Privacy",
      "text": "The NHS is revising the booking system for Covid-19 jabs in England after complaints that it could reveal individuals' vaccination status.\nBy entering details such as their name, date of birth and postcode it may be possible to work out if another person has been given both doses, one or none.\nPrivacy campaigners Big Brother Watch called it a \"shocking failure\".\nNHS Digital said the system had no direct access to medical records and allowed millions to quickly book jabs.\nThe flaw in the website was first revealed by the Guardian, which said it could allow employers to monitor their workers' vaccination status or put people at risk of peer pressure from anti-vaccination friends and colleagues not to get the jab.\nIt comes as the UK reported another 543,323vaccinations given in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of people who have had both jabs to nearly 16.3 million, with 34.9m first doses given out.\nA further 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded, while there were 2,613 new confirmed cases.\nThe website allows people to book appointments without using their NHS number, by entering their name, date of birth and postcode.\nBut it gives different results depending on whether the individual has already had two doses, one or none, allowing another user to quickly determine other people's vaccination status.\nIn the case of someone who has had both doses it currently says: \"You do not need to book any coronavirus (COVID-19) appointments using this service.\" The Guardian earlier reported that it said \"you have had both of your appointments\".\nFor people who have had one dose, the site presents a screen referring to their booking for a second appointment.\nAnd for those who have not had any jabs, it goes to a standard screening page.\nSilkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, said it is \"a seriously shocking failure to protect patients' medical confidentiality at a time when it could not be more important\".\nShe said the data was \"exposed to absolutely anyone to pry into\" because date of birth and postcode information can easily be found or bought.\n\"This is personal health information that could easily be exploited by companies, insurers, employers or scammers,\" Ms Carlo said.\n\"Robust protections must be put in place immediately and an urgent investigation should be opened to establish how such basic privacy protections could be missing from one of the most sensitive health databases in the country.\"\nThe National Data Guardian for Health and Social Care, which advises healthcare organisations about handling personal data, said it had been contacted by some people with concerns about the way the NHS booking site works.\n\"It is important that it is as simple and easy as possible for people to book their vaccinations and we understand that the website has been developed to support this aim,\" a spokeswoman for the Office of the National Data Guardian said.\nBut the spokeswoman said the organisations responsible for the site had been contacted to raise its concerns and discuss \"the twin important aims of protecting confidentiality whilst maintaining easy access to vaccinations for the public\".\nNHS Digital said it was revising the messages used by the booking system to improve privacy, but suggested that conclusions about someone's vaccine status from entering other people's data would not always be accurate.\nThe online booking system enabled millions of people to book their vaccinations quickly and easily, it said.\nA spokesperson said: \"This is making a significant impact on the management and containment of the pandemic and is saving lives.\n\"The system does not provide access to anyone's medical records and people should not be fraudulently using the service - it should only be used by people booking their own vaccines or for someone who has knowingly provided their details for this purpose.\""

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus vaccines,World Trade Organization,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The US has thrown its support behind a move at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to temporarily lift patent protections for coronavirus vaccines.\nAdvocates of the move say it would increase global vaccine production, but drugs manufacturers argue it will not have the desired effect.\nCritics say it strips financial rewards from cutting-edge drug developers. \nThe decision by US President Joe Biden comes amid pressure from Democrats in his party to remove patent protections.\nIn announcing the new policy, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said that \"extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures\". \nMs Tai said the US would now embark on negotiations at the WTO to try to secure the waiver, but warned this could take time.\nIndia and South Africa were the leading voices in a group of about 60 countries which for the last six months has been trying to get the patents on vaccines set aside. \nOne hundred of the WTO's 164 states are said to be in favour, and a panel on intellectual property is expected to discuss the issue next month. \nIf approved, supporters say, the waiver would allow production of vaccines to be ramped up and provide more affordable doses for less wealthy countries.\nThe countries in favour of the move met with strong opposition from the previous US administration of Donald Trump, the UK and the EU. Mr Biden had proposed a waiver during the 2020 presidential election campaign. \nIntellectual property describes creations, such as inventions, which are protected by patents, copyrights and trademarks. These prevent copying and allow the originator to be financially rewarded.    \nPatents give innovating firms a short-term monopoly on production to cover the costs of development and encourage investment.\nBiotech firms argue that such protection has provided incentives to produce Covid vaccines in record times.\nMany developing countries have argued that rules requiring countries to protect patents and other forms of intellectual property are an obstacle to increasing the production of vaccines and other products needed to tackle the pandemic.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, called the US decision \"historic\" and said it marked \"a monumental moment in the fight against Covid-19\".\nThe medical NGO, MSF - Doctors Without Borders - said the move would \"increase sufficient and timely access to these lifesaving medical tools as Covid-19 continues to ravage countries across the globe.\"\nCalls for a vaccine patent waiver come as lower income countries face acute vaccine shortages.\nMSF points out that many of the low-income states where it operates \"only received 0.3 percent of global Covid-19 vaccine supply while the US has secured enough doses to protect its entire population\".\nIndia, which was shipping vaccines to other countries, has now had to cancel exports as it grapples with surging coronavirus cases and falls behind on its vaccination targets.\nBut pharmaceutical companies have voiced their opposition to a waiver, insisting that patents are not the primary obstacle, and cautioned that the move could stifle innovation.\nThe head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Thomas Cueni, told the BBC's Today programme that technology transfer should not be enforced. \n\"I'm deeply concerned if you hand this over and allow companies to try to get it done the right way, safe and high quality, you could compromise the quality and safety of vaccines which we see now and it would be disruptive.\"\nHe said Western pharmaceutical companies were already sharing technology on a voluntary basis. \n\"The bottlenecks right now are trade barriers, preventing companies from moving their goods from one country to another. It is shortages and scarcity in the supply chains, which need to be addressed. And it is also right now the disappointing unwillingness of rich countries to early share doses with the poor countries. \n\"None of this is addressed with the patent waiver.\" \nDr Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the Reuters news agency that the waiver \"amounts to the expropriation of the property of the pharmaceutical companies whose innovation and financial investments made the development of Covid-19 vaccines possible in the first place\".\nNobody is protected until everyone's protected: on that world and business leaders are agreed.\nBut pharmaceutical companies have called the decision by the US to back the sharing of secret recipes for vaccinations short-sighted, claiming it is understanding the production process that is the real challenge, particularly when it comes to the new breed of mRNA vaccines - such as Pfizer and Moderna - as well as the availability of raw materials. \nIt is, they say, akin to handing out a recipe without sharing the method or the ingredients, and could lead to quality issues and less efficient production.\nInstead, the UK and the EU have favoured a system of licensing, whereby know-how is shared and there is more oversight. It is already being done on some cases on a voluntary basis - such as the tie up between Oxford AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India. And that licensing can be made compulsory, although the pharmaceutical companies could then be eligible for compensation. \nSome trade specialists have speculated that the US might be hoping that, by backing a lifting of patents, manufacturers might be more open to sharing expertise voluntarily - or at least, for a reduced charge. \nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"the EU is also ready to discuss any proposals that address the crisis in an effective and pragmatic manner\".\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has changed his position, now saying he is \"absolutely in favour\".  \nA UK government spokesperson said the UK was \"working with WTO members to resolve this issue\" and was \"in discussions with the US and WTO members to facilitate increased production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines\". \nThe head of the World Health Organization called the US announcement a \"monumental moment\" in the fight against Covid-19. \nThe prospect of a waiver hit shares in the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax. \nSome experts say pharmaceutical companies would also need to share know-how, such as production techniques, with poorer countries to have any real beneficial effect. \nLicensing agreements are another way of boosting production. \nOne of the largest Covid vaccine producers is the Serum Institute of India which manufactures the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab under a licensing agreement with the Anglo-Swedish company.

      "text": "Voting has officially closed for the Welsh Parliamentary elections as some people had to queue outside polling stations to cast their vote.\nLong queues were seen outside some polling stations in the final hours before the ballot closed at 22:00 BST.\nWhile counting for the poll would normally take place overnight, due to the coronavirus pandemic it will start on Friday morning.\nThe first result is expected to be declared on Friday afternoon.\nPolling stations opened at 07:00 on Thursday for people to vote for the new 60 members of the Senedd to make up the Welsh Parliament - and for the next Police and Crime Commissioners.\nFor the first time 16 and 17-year-olds had the right to vote in Wales - but only in the Senedd election.\nWith social distancing measures in place - and limited space for people inside polling stations due to strict Covid rules - long queues were seen outside a number of polling stations as the deadline approached.\nHowever, rules mean that anyone who joined a queue to vote before 22:00 will still be able to cast their ballot after they close, and those in line were handed cards to ensure they could vote.\nBBC reporters outside polling stations reported queues of more than an hour for people to get inside to cast their votes.\nSome took to twitter to say they had tried to vote but with long-queues some said they had no choice but to leave the line due to childcare or having to go to work.\nIn Cardiff, a long line of people were seen queueing outside Victoria Park polling station, while in Roath people were seen lining the street to cast their ballot.\nWriting on twitter, Frank Sanders said he had tried to vote twice, but had been forced to give up both times due to the length of the queues outside Broad Street polling station.\n\"The queue was too long for me to get back to work this morning and then to get up to work tomorrow. Helpfully eliminating a lot of working voters,\" he tweeted.\nOn Friday you can follow comprehensive coverage as the votes for the Senedd election are counted and the results declared across BBC Wales' online, television and radio services.\nThe police and crime commissioner (PCC) votes will be counted on Sunday.\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nAfter the polls officially closed Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford, who was first minister in the previous Welsh government, thanked 16 and 17 year olds who had \"exercised their new right to vote for the first time\". \n\"In the coming days, the political make-up of the next Senedd will become clear. We await those results,\" he said.\nVoters had cast their ballot to elect 40 Members of the Senedd (MSs) representing local constituencies, and 20 representing five large regions - North Wales, Mid and West Wales, South Wales West, South Wales Central and South Wales East.\nThe regions elect four MSs each.\nVoters had got two ballots - one to back a candidate in their constituency, and one to support a party list of candidates or individual in their region.\nIn the constituency ballots the candidate with the most votes wins, the same system used at UK general elections.\nBut the ballot for the region is decided by a mathematical process in which people are elected more according to their share of the vote.\nThe system takes into account who has won the constituency seats within that region and gives parties winning fewer or none of those constituencies a better chance of winning regional ones.\nThe party or combination of parties that can command the greatest support in the Senedd after the election will form the next Welsh government.\nIn police and crime commissioner elections you can vote for a first and second choice candidate.\nIf no candidate gets more than 50% of the first choice votes, all except the top two candidates are eliminated.\nIf your first choice candidate is eliminated, and your second choice is for one of the top two, your second choice is counted.\nElections were also held on Thursday for the Scottish Parliament, and London's mayor and assembly.\nIn England, PCC elections took place and voters went to the polls to elect local councils and directly elected mayors. There was also a by-election to choose a new MP at Westminster for Hartlepool. "

      "text": "Over 45,000 people have applied to cull bison in the Grand Canyon after the US National Park Service (NPS) requested volunteers to help with overpopulation.\nThe famed national park in Arizona is seeking 12 \"skilled volunteers\" to reduce the herd, which has grown large enough to cause environmental damage.\nThe event is not being classified as a \"hunt\", as hunting is forbidden in US national parks.\nSome environmentalists have warned the move could set a dangerous precedent.\nThe lottery opened on Monday and closed after 48 hours with 45,040 applicants. \nAn initial 25 names will be selected. After being vetted by park officials for skills including marksmanship, 12 people will be given the opportunity to kill a bison in the park's North Rim area.\nVolunteers are permitted to bring a support crew along, according to the NPS rules. Bison can weigh over 2,000lbs (900kg), but the sharp-shooters must carry out any meat on foot without the help of motorised transport or pack animals.\nThe event will take place in rugged, rocky and sometimes snowy terrain, with elevations exceeding 8,000ft (2,440m).\nOfficials say the pilot programme is required after the herd rapidly grew to 600 bison in recent years. The NPS hopes to bring the herd residing on the North Rim down to about 200 in order to reduce trampling of Native American archaeological sites, soil erosion and water contamination.\nBefore being hunted to near-extinction in the 19th Century, bison (which are also known in the US as buffalo) roamed across much of the continent. An estimated 30 to 60 million bison were reduced to only about 400 by the late 1800s.\nBut environmentalists say there is little evidence that the Grand Canyon was ever part of their historic range.\nAccording to historians, the North Rim herd was introduced to the area after a frontiersman's failed attempt to interbreed bison with cattle in the early 1900s."

      "tags": "Economics,Job Retention Scheme,Economic growth,UK economy,Bank of England,Andrew Bailey",
      "text": "The UK economy will enjoy its fastest growth in more than 70 years in 2021 as Covid-19 restrictions are lifted, according to the Bank of England.\nThe economy is expected to expand by 7.25% this year, with extra government spending helping to limit job losses.\nHowever, it follows a contraction of 9.9% in 2020, the biggest in 300 years.\nAndrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said the recovery was \"strong\" but likened it to \"more of a bounce back\" than a boom.\nHe added that the surge in growth, while \"good news\", would only return the UK economy back to its 2019 size.\nMr Bailey told the BBC: \"We're going to see a continued strong recovery this year, but let's put that into perspective.\n\"That's two years passed with no growth in the economy.\"\nHis comments came as Bank policymakers held interest rates at a record low of 0.1%.\nThe Bank expects the recovery to gather pace as the reopening of high streets paves the way for a mini-spending boom.\nThe UK's rapid vaccine rollout is also expected to boost consumer confidence.\nGrowth of more than 7% this year would represent the strongest expansion since official records began in 1949.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak announced in the March Budget that the furlough scheme, which subsidises employees' wages, would be extended until the end of September. \nMr Bailey said the extension would limit the rise in unemployment \"significantly\" by providing a \"bridge of support that will last until the recovery is underway\".\nThe Bank now expects the unemployment rate to peak at 5.5% later this year. This is far below the 7.75% it predicted in February.\nMr Bailey added: \"Longer term unemployment is one of the most difficult things to deal with. And we think that will be substantially reduced.\"\nThe number of people on furlough is expected to fall to 2.75 million in the three months to June, from just under five million at the start of this year.\n\"Given the expected near\u2011term recovery in activity, unemployment is projected to increase only slightly,\" policymakers said in the Bank's latest Monetary Policy Report.\nThe Bank of England is trying to play down the idea that there is a post pandemic boom, but nonetheless these are very significant increases to the forecast for economic growth this year, and a substantial cut to predicted peak unemployment.\nMuch of this is \"rebound\" - the natural and obvious result of large swathes of the economy reopening. But the changes indicate the underpinning of a more sustained recovery too.\nThe peak in unemployment has been sharply downgraded, from close to 8% to 5.5%, thanks to the furlough scheme extension, a stronger recovery, and an assumption that the long-term damage from the pandemic will be smaller than previously expected. \nThat means about 700,000 expected job losses not materialising. If this does come to pass, it will far exceed even the most optimistic assumptions from the start of the pandemic crisis.\nThe Bank also assumes that vaccinated Britons feel safer, more confident and are now spending more of the savings arising from a year of lockdowns. \nThere are clear uncertainties, relating to virus variants. But the Bank is at least pointing to a summer recovery, with the economic damage from the pandemic repaired by the end of this year.\nHouseholds have squirrelled away more than \u00a3150bn in extra savings over the past year as more people have worked from home, particularly higher earners.\nThe Bank expects them to spend about 10% of this extra cash as the economy returns to normal.\nHowever, more than half of those surveyed by the Bank said they would keep the money in savings, suggesting that many households remain cautious about the economic outlook.\nPolicymakers stressed that the outlook \"remains uncertain\" and \"continues to depend on the evolution of the pandemic\".\nNon-essential shops, pubs and restaurants started reopening last month as part of a phased easing of restrictions across the UK.\nThe Bank's survey of businesses showed that \"footfall increased rapidly in the first few days of trading\", with hairdressers, pubs and restaurants all reporting a surge in bookings.\nAnecdotal evidence suggested that many people were also opting to take holidays in the UK instead of overseas, with demand \"much higher\" than pre-Covid levels.\nThe Bank also suggested that pay rises were likely to remain subdued this year.\nWhile fewer businesses are freezing pay, the Bank said most were awarding increases of between 1.5% and 2%.\nIt added: \"Where bonuses were being paid, these were generally lower than a year ago.\"\nRecent increases in commodity and factory gate prices, combined with record low interest rates, have raised fears of a bigger rise in the price of goods and services.\nInflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), currently stands at 0.7%.\nHowever, this is expected to increase sharply towards the Bank's target of 2% in the next few months amid a rise in energy prices.\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates was split on Thursday over the size of its latest round of bond buying, as it announced it will slow the pace of purchases.\nOutgoing chief economist Andy Haldane voted for a reduction in the Bank's quantitative easing programme to guard against the risk of the economy overheating. \nHowever, the MPC stressed it would not raise interest rates until there was \"clear evidence\" that the recovery was sustainable."

      "text": "Environmental campaigners suspect a Liechtenstein prince shot dead probably the biggest bear alive in the EU on a hunting expedition in Romania in March.\nThey say Prince Emanuel von und zu Liechtenstein had been granted a permit to shoot a female bear that had caused damage to some farms.\nBut it was not a female that was shot but Arthur, a 17-year-old brown bear.\nThe prince who lives in Austria has not yet responded, and the BBC's attempts to reach him have been unsuccessful.\n\"We don't have a personal problem with the prince,\" Gabriel Paun of Environmental group Agent Green told the BBC. \"We believe the hunting association was meeting his needs.\" \nThe office of the Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein told AFP news agency it did not know the background of this \"private and personal matter\". But it did stress that nature \"has been one of the fundamental concerns of the House and is a central element of the family's commitment to ecological and social sustainability\". \nRomania's national environmental guard has launched an investigation into the bear's death.\nThere is no verification that a hunting permit was granted to the prince. However, Agent Green has produced a leaked document that appears to be a permit from authorities to a hunting association in Covasna granting the prince several days in March, and detailing the death of a bear in the village of Ojdula in Transylvania.\nTrophy hunting was barred in Romania in 2016 as the brown bear is protected by an EU directive. But hunting is allowed for \"problematic\" bears that cause damage. Campaigners say a local farmer had complained of an issue with three females and their cubs some time ago, but that the March kill had not solved the issue.\n\"To get a derogation [permit] you have to prove you've done all diligence. Derogation is the exception and not the rule,\" said Mr Paun. \"Once you extract large bears out of the population you start to destabilise the population so he had a crucial role.\" Without bears such as Arthur there is a risk of in-breeding, he fears.\nEnvironment Minister Tanczos Barna confirmed that a permit had been issued to get rid of a nuisance bear but did not give details of who received it.\nThe head of Romania's National Environmental Guard protection agency, Octavian Berceanu, said an inquiry had been opened last week into why a male bear had been shot and that poaching was one of the suspicions of the case.\nAs females are far smaller than Arthur, activists believe the older alpha male was deliberately targeted for his trophy value of 592.8 points out of a possible maximum 600.\nAnn-Kathrin Freude of Austrian environmental group VGT told the BBC that as far as they were aware the shooting of Arthur had produced the highest score ever recorded. \"It is a really great trophy to get one of these iconic animals - it's like a good wine.\""

A large-print version should also be available.\nPolling stations are selected for accessibility. But if a voter cannot enter, the presiding officer may take the ballot paper to them.\nFor help, call the Electoral Commission on 0333 103 1928.\nPeople occasionally sign their ballots - but if the name is identifiable, the vote will not count.\nNo - it is entirely up to you whether or not you vote. \nLocal councils recruit the presiding officer and staff to conduct the ballot, count the votes and process the postal votes.\nThe first councils will be counted overnight into early Friday morning.\nBut making the process Covid-secure means the results will probably take much longer than usual - possibly as late as Monday in some areas."

      "tags": "Women,United States,Coronavirus pandemic,Pregnancy",
      "text": "The American birth rate fell for the sixth consecutive year in 2020, with the lowest number of babies born since 1979, according to a new report.\nSome 3.6 million babies were born in the US in 2020 - marking a 4% decline from the year before, found the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics.\nThe slump was seen across all recorded ethnicities and origins, according to the findings. \nThe national picture mirrors a decline in births seen worldwide, a trend some experts say has been accelerated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. \nIn the CDC report, demographers examined the country's general fertility rate, which compares the number of live births with the number of women considered to be of childbearing age - between 15 and 44 years old. \nIn 2020, the general fertility rate in the US was about 56 births per 1,000 women - the lowest rate on record and about half of what it was in the early 1960s. \nThe decline in birth rates was seen across all measured racial and ethnic groups. Births dropped by 4% among white, black and Latina women, 9% for Asian women, 3% for Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders and 7% for Native American and Alaska native women. \nThe report also analysed the total US fertility rate, which estimates how many babies a hypothetical group of 1,000 women would have over their lifetime based on actual birth rates. For a generation to exactly replace itself, this number must be at or above 2.1.\nAccording to the CDC, this rate has generally been \"below replacement\" since 1971 and has consistently been below replacement since 2007. Today, the US total fertility rate sits at 1.6 - another record low. \nExperts say the country's tumbling birth rate is closely linked to the average age of American mothers. Women are becoming mothers later in life - a phenomenon tied to increases in educational attainment, growing labour force participation and delays in marriage, according to the Pew Research Center. The average age of mothers at first birth is 27, up from 23 in 2010, recent CDC data has found. \nThis changing picture of motherhood has been driven in part by declines in pregnancy among teenagers. The birth rates among teenagers aged 15-19 had the steepest decline of all age groups: down by 8% in 2020 to around 15 births per 1,000 females.\nThe National Center for Health Statistics has said it is too early to determine whether the pandemic had a significant effect on birth rates because this year's data is in keeping with past trends. But initial research suggests that Covid-19 may have compounded existing patterns. \nIn a June 2020 study by the Guttmacher Institute, one in three US women said that because of Covid-19, they were likely to delay having children or have fewer children altogether. And researchers from the Brookings Institution - who predicted a \"large, lasting baby bust\" due to Covid-19 - have suggested that the anxiety and economic uncertainty wrought by the pandemic will further depress birth rates going forward. \nData from the CDC shows births falling most sharply toward the end of last year when babies conceived at the start of the pandemic would have been born. \nThe slowing US birth rate is echoed by worldwide trends.\nWhile wealthy countries like Germany and Japan have seen slowing birth rates for some time, the same is now happening in middle-income countries as well, including Thailand and Brazil. Globally, the fertility rate is expected to fall below replacement levels - 2.1 births per woman - by 2070, according to a 2019 report from the UN. \nBy the end of this century, the report found, the world's population is projected to virtually stop growing for the first time in history. And a widely cited study published in the Lancet last year suggested this population peak would come even earlier - in 2064. \nBetween 2020 and 2100, 90 countries are expected to lose population, including two-thirds of all countries and territories in Europe. According to the UN numbers, Africa is the only region in the world projected to have strong population growth for the rest of the 21st Century - mostly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa. \nSimilar to trends in the US, the UN has linked falling fertility rates and population growth to gradual delays in childbearing among women. Though the mean age of childbearing varies widely throughout the world, overall increases will continue to lower fertility rates and global population growth in turn. "

HMS Tamar is nearby and both ships are maintaining a presence and did not intervene in the protest.\nShortly after 13:30 BST the two French patrol vessels, police boat Athos and patroller Themis, appeared to be heading south, away from Jersey.\nBy Jean Mackenzie, BBC Europe correspondent, in Carteret port on the Normandy coast\nAs the boats pulled out of this harbour at 02:30 on Thursday morning, the fishermen were prepared for this 15-hour stand-off in the cold and rain.\nThis protest was their plan to get noticed and it worked.\nYes they are angry, but they are also shaken by these unexpected restrictions and worried about their livelihoods. Some fishermen have only been given permission to fish for a handful of days a year. \nOne fisherman, who catches half his whelks and lobsters along Jersey's shores, told me if he can't get full access to Jersey's waters he will have to sell his boat and change his job.\nWhen they returned to the French coast this evening, drenched and exhausted, they were surprisingly upbeat. Talks with Jersey's government did not go well, they said, but they know they have been heard.\nThey are now hopeful their government and Brussels will step in to resolve the issue. \nThey feel their part is done, for now.\nEarlier, the maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the vessels were on a public service mission to ensure safety.\nFrance has threatened to cut off electricity to Jersey, the largest Channel Island and a Crown dependency, located 14 miles (22km) off France. Crown dependencies are not part of the UK, but are defended and represented internationally by the UK government.\nThe boats were protesting against new fishing rules - introduced last week by the Jersey government under the UK-EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) - which require French boats to show they have a history of fishing in Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice.\nFrench authorities say \"new technical measures\" had not been communicated to the EU, rendering them \"null and void\".\n\"We agreed that all sides remain committed to engaging with our partners in the EU and France to resolve the concerns arising from the issuing of fishing licenses under the Trade and Co-operation Agreement, which led to today's protest,\" Jersey's Senator Gorst said.\nEarlier, Jersey fisherman Loic Farnham said of his French counterparts: \"They are professional fishermen, the same as we all are, we'd like to keep it all amicable so we can have access to the markets and they can carry on earning a living in our waters.\"\nThe maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the two French vessels were not on military missions.\nIt said the boats' roles were to stay in French waters and to be near the fisherman in order to ensure safety.\nAn Elys\u00e9e source said France was monitoring the situation \"very closely\", adding that it is \"currently calm and we hope that this will remain the case\".\n\"We want to be able to return to negotiations, that we can obtain the fishing licenses provided for in the agreement.\"\nFrench fishermen have complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. \nUnder an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice.\nJersey has the sole power to issue the licences, and as of last week all fishing boats were required to have a licence to operate there.\nOn Friday, the Jersey government granted 41 permits to French fishing vessels that are equipped with technology that allows them to be located.\nBut the French government claimed the list of approved ships came with further demands that \"were not arranged or discussed, and which we were not notified about\".\nChris Le Masurier, who runs Jersey Oyster and Normandy Trader Freight, said the French fisherman were rightly upset by the situation.\nHe said: \"I see it as very much an insult to them and they are extremely upset. The criteria that they were given was to prove they have fished in Jersey waters for 10 days. Nothing about what species were caught, nothing about if you've fished for 20 days or 30 days [and having to] prove that.\" \nBut Don Thompson, from the Jersey Fisherman's Association, said affected French crews have \"had since 1 January\" to comply with the new rules and \"perhaps some of the boats that perhaps didn't qualify are a little bit put-out\".\nThe threat to cut off Jersey's electricity supply - 95% of which is delivered by three underwater cables from France - was made by French Maritime Minister Annick Girardin on Tuesday.\nHMS Severn and HMS Tamar, which are based in Portsmouth, are each crewed by 45 sailors and up to 50 Royal Marines. \nThe ships are routinely used for fisheries protection - with sailors able to board other boats for spot checks.\nAdditional reporting by BBC Jersey's political reporter Freddie Miller.\nUpdate: This story has been amended to clarify the specifications of Royal Navy vessels HMS Severn and HMS Tamar."

It said a number of them had died. \nThe group posted video footage of the boxes piled up to the ceiling of the truck on social media site Weibo. \n\"The cargo box is full of screams from cats and puppies,\" the group wrote. \nVolunteers stayed with the animals throughout the night, feeding them and giving them water, while they underwent health inspections. \nThe rescue centre announced on Thursday that it had managed to bring the animals back to their base for resettlement and a further 38 were receiving medical treatment. \nThe courier company involved, ZTO, said the person in charge of delivery safety in Sichuan province has been suspended and his annual performance bonus had been deducted. It confirmed that it had broken China's postal regulations and apologised to members of the public, People's Daily Online reported. \nZTO also said it had launched additional training regarding postal safety and national animal protection. \nThe incident has caused outrage on social media with people calling for a boycott of such boxes and buying animals online. The phrase \"pet blind box\" has had millions of views on Weibo. \n\"Have we made any achievements in the rescue and management of stray animals? Now there is a pet blind box industry?\" one user wrote. \nAnother wrote: \"Let's talk about boycotting pet blind boxes again.

It is iterating the design, making upgrades as engineers learn how to build and fly the rockets.\nOperational Starships will eventually launch atop a booster called Super Heavy. \nThis will feature perhaps 28 Raptors, producing more than 70 meganewtons (16 million lbs) of thrust - about double that of the mighty Apollo Saturn 5 rocket, which sent men to the Moon."

      "tags": "Gangs,Brazil,Rio de Janeiro",
      "text": "At least 25 people including a police officer have been killed in a shootout in Rio de Janeiro, according to local media. \nThe shootout took place during a police operation in a favela in the Jacarezinho area of the city. \nPolice launched the operation after receiving reports that drug traffickers were recruiting children for their gang. \nTwo passengers on a metro train were hit by bullets but survived. \nPolice in the Brazilian city confirmed the death of one of their officers, Inspector Andre Leonardo de Mello Frias. A statement on Facebook said \"he honoured the profession he loved and will be missed\". \nPolice Chief Ronaldo Oliveira told Reuters news agency that Thursday's raid was \"the largest number of deaths in a police operation in Rio\". \nAccording to local news, the gang targeted in this raid engages in drug trafficking, mugging, murders and kidnappings. \nTelevision images showed suspects trying to escape across rooftops as police entered the favela. \nMeanwhile, residents of Jacarezinho have shared accounts of what they witnessed on social media.\nOne resident posted a photo of his blood-covered floor and said two people had died in his house as police chased the criminals. The man, who did not want to give his name, said he would try to move out of the area as soon as possible. \n\"We're trying to sell the house as fast as possible, we can't continue to live here,\" he said. \nOther residents said officers had seized their phones, accusing them of warning gang members of the raid. \nSociology professor Ignacio Cano from the Laboratory for the Analysis of Violence at Rio State University dismissed the reasons the police gave for the raid: \"To say that drug traffickers recruit children and teenagers to deal drugs is almost laughable because everyone knows that these gangs have minors who work for them. \n\"To say that you're going to launch a massive raid because you've discovered that traffickers recruit children is a joke,\" he told O Dia newspaper. \nRio de Janeiro is one of Brazil's most violent states and vast areas are under the control of criminals, many of them linked to powerful drug-trafficking gangs. \nSecurity forces in Brazil have often been accused of excessive use of force against the civilian population during anti-crime operations in major cities. \nA court ruling last June restricted police action in poor neighbourhoods of Rio during the pandemic unless it was deemed essential. \nRio de Janeiro is the city with the biggest percentage of people living in shanty towns in Brazil - 22%. It's a population of 1,3 million, 70% of which are black. \nAnalysis by Camilla Motta, BBC Brasil reporter, Sao Paulo\nPolice operations targeting favelas controlled by drug traffickers are quite common in Rio. This, however, is the deadliest operation since 2016.\nSince a court ruling last June restricted police action in poor neighbourhoods in Rio, the number of deaths in shootouts in favelas has fallen. \nIn the first month alone, deaths plummeted 70% when compared to the average recorded since 2007, according to the research group Grupo de Estudos dos Novos Ilegalismos, from Universidade Federal Fluminense. \nThe drop was not followed by a rise in crime. In fact, property crimes were down by 40% and homicides by 48%. Researchers argue this shows that police operations are not the best strategy to tackle crime. "

It's got lots of opportunities, not only for me but for my family also and in my mind it was worth fighting for.\" \nThe Home Office says it is currently reviewing its policy for situations where the application fee for relatives can be waived. \nMrs Mahabir told the Home Office in emails that finding the money for her family to apply would be a \"daunting task\".\n\"We have never been separated from each other before,\" she said.\n\"I would like for them to be given the opportunity to join me here where we can continue to make the positive impact on lives that we come into contact with.\"\nToufique Hossain, from the firm representing the claimants, said: \"The pain and misery that has been imposed on the Windrush generation is unimaginable. \n\"The Home Office on one hand commiserates their suffering and yet continues to develop and then defend policies that keep families apart.\n\"It should pull down, not put up, barriers to Windrush families staying together.\"\nIn a statement, a Home Office official said: \"We remain determined to right the wrongs suffered by the Windrush generation.\"\nThe official said more than12,500 people had been given new citizenship or had their citizenship confirmed for free under the Windrush scheme. \n\"We are carefully considering the implications of this judgment and will continue our work to ensure members of the Windrush generation receive the documentation they need, free of charge, in order to live, work and access services in the UK,\" the official added. \nPeople arriving in the UK between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries have been labelled the Windrush generation.\nIt refers to the ship MV Empire Windrush, which docked in Tilbury on 22 June 1948, bringing workers from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and other islands, to help fill post-war UK labour shortages.\nIt is unclear how many people belong to the Windrush generation, but they are thought to be in their thousands.\nThe Home Office kept no record of those granted leave to remain and issued no paperwork - making it is difficult for Windrush arrivals to prove their legal status. In 2010, it destroyed landing cards belonging to Windrush migrants.\nBecause they came from British colonies that were not independent, they believed they were British citizens.\nThose who lacked documents were told they needed evidence to continue working, get NHS treatment, or even to remain in the UK.\nRead more here"

      "text": "India has said a new variant of the coronavirus first discovered there in March may be linked to a deadly second wave.\nSamples containing the \"double mutant\"- or B.1.617 variant - have been found in several states with high case numbers.\nAn official with the National Centre for Disease Control said, however, that they had still been unable to fully establish a correlation.\nA double mutant is when two mutations come together in the same virus.\nMeanwhile, India reported a record 412,000 cases in the space of 24 hours on Wednesday, and 3,980 deaths.   \nThe government's top scientific adviser also warned a third wave is inevitable.\nSpeaking at a health ministry news briefing, K VijayRaghavan admitted that experts had not anticipated the \"ferocity\" of the surge in cases.  \n\"Phase three is inevitable, given the high levels of circulating virus,\" he added during a news briefing. \"But it is not clear on what timescale this phase three will occur... We should prepare for new waves.\"\nThe current surge of the virus has already overwhelmed the healthcare system with hospital beds, oxygen and even crematorium space in short supply.\nSeveral states are under localised lockdowns and curfews, but the government is reluctant to impose a national lockdown, for fear of the impact on the economy. \nOut of roughly 13,000 samples sequenced, more than 3,500 were found to be variants of concern - including B.1.617 - across eight states.  \nThe B.1.617 variant was reported in several states reporting surges including Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh.\nFor more than a month, Delhi insisted that the variant had no link to the current surge. \nVirologist Dr Shahid Jameel told the BBC's Vikas Pandey earlier that India started seriously looking at mutations fairly late, with sequencing efforts only \"properly started\" in mid-February 2021.\nIndia is sequencing just over 1% of all samples at the moment. \"In comparison, the UK was sequencing at 5-6% at the peak of the pandemic. But you can't build such capacity overnight,\" he said.\nAnd although the central government now says there is a correlation, it added the link is not \"fully established\".\n\"Its epidemiological and clinical correlation is not fully established\u2026 without the correlation, we cannot establish direct linkage to any surge. However, we have advised states to strengthen public health response - increase testing, quick isolation, prevent crowds, vaccination,\" Sujeet Singh, National Centre for Disease Control said.\nA number of states reported their highest fatalities in a single day on Wednesday - including the northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab and Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the south.\nThe western state of Maharashtra, which has had the highest caseload throughout the pandemic, reported 920 deaths.\nHowever, experts say the tally could be far higher due to reduced testing, and under-reporting of deaths.  \nIn  a weekly report, the World Heath Organization said that India accounted for nearly half the coronavirus cases reported worldwide last week, and a quarter of deaths.  \nAn Indian delegation that travelled to the G7 Foreign Ministers' meeting in London this week, is self-isolating after two of its members tested positive for Covid-19.  \nIndia's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar travelled with the delegation to London, and says he will attend the rest of the summit virtually.  \nIndia has been unable to meet an ambitious vaccination programme - it initially wanted to vaccinate 300 million people by July - and there's been a dramatic drop in jabs because of a shortage of doses.\nJust 26 million people out of a population of 1.4 billion have received both shots, and about 129 million have only received a single dose.  \nVaccine stocks in the country have nearly dried up, with the latest age bracket to become eligible - adults under the age of 45 - struggling to register and secure appointments.\nExperts say lockdowns and vaccinations are the only way out, but that the government would need to act now in order to break the chain.

It also said the new Office for Health Promotion would lead national efforts to tackling the issue of harmful alcohol consumption. \nProf Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance - a coalition of charities and campaign groups - said the increase in deaths linked to alcohol was \"devastating\".\n\"Each of these numbers represents a life of an individual cut short by alcohol consumption and a family that has been left in mourning.\"\nProf Gilmore said the government must urgently introduce an alcohol strategy which addresses health inequalities, improves access to treatment \"and stops the sale of cheap, strong alcohol that is so harmful to health\".\nOver the past year charities and health experts have warned that changing drinking habits, which saw more people drinking at home during lockdown, could lead to a sharp rise in people misusing alcohol and increased demand for services.\nEven before last year's coronavirus restrictions which forced the closure of pubs and restaurants for many months, the UK had some of the highest levels of alcohol-related harms in Europe.\nProf Julia Sinclair, chair of the addictions faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the numbers were \"a wake-up call to the government\".\n\"Since the start of the pandemic, millions more people have been drinking at levels that are putting them at risk of addiction and serious physical conditions that could be life-threatening,\" she said.\n\"Addiction services must be given the resources they need to tackle this public health crisis.\"\nBut Dr Sadie Boniface, from the Institute of Alcohol Studies at King's College London, said the reasons behind the 2020 increase needed to be better understood, with most deaths occurring in people already drinking heavily.\n\"Liver disease often presents as an emergency, but people may have been frightened to go to A&E because of the virus,\" she said.\n\"Last year there was a reduction in emergency presentations and admissions across the board, and addiction treatment data also showed fewer new clients starting treatment last summer.\" \nUK guidelines advise people to drink a maximum of 14 units of alcohol (equivalent to six large glasses of wine or six pints of beer) a week, and to spread any drinking over three days or more.\nDrinking too much alcohol can damage the liver and increase the risk of a number of other health conditions, such as heart disease and stroke. \nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We are committed to supporting everyone's mental and physical wellbeing through the pandemic and we encourage anyone who is struggling to come forward for help.\" "

      "text": "Two Royal Navy ships are preparing to return home after a protest by French fishermen over post-Brexit rights in Jersey's territorial waters ended.\nThe UK government said \"the situation is resolved for now\" but \"we remain on standby\" to assist Jersey.\nFrench fishermen say their rights are unfairly restricted by licences issued under the Channel Island's new system.\nJersey's External Relations Minister Ian Gorst said discussions with the French crews had been \"positive\".\nThe UK said it had agreed with Jersey's government that one of the Royal Navy offshore patrol vessels will return to its home port on Thursday night while the other will leave on Friday morning.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"pleased the situation in Jersey has been resolved.\"\n\"The UK will always stand resolutely by the people of Jersey,\" he said.\nAbout 60 boats took part in a protest at St Helier, Jersey's capital and main port, prompting the dispatch of two Royal Navy ships - HMS Severn and HMS Tamar - and two French vessels to the area.\nThe French government said it was acting \"in a spirit of responsibility\" after the \"British failure\" to abide by the trade deal.\nIt said it hoped the situation would be \"swiftly resolved by the full and total implementation\" of the deal, which France said allowed continued access to British waters for fishermen who worked in them prior to Brexit.\n\"We want to use all the leverage at our disposal to protect the fishing industry and enable it to continue its activities,\" a spokesman for France's ministry for Europe and foreign affairs said.\nBy Jean Mackenzie, BBC Europe correspondent, in Carteret port on the Normandy coast\nAs the boats pulled out of this harbour at 02:30 on Thursday morning, the fishermen were prepared for this 15-hour stand-off in the cold and rain.\nThis protest was their plan to get noticed and it worked.\nYes they are angry, but they are also shaken by these unexpected restrictions and worried about their livelihoods. Some fishermen have only been given permission to fish for a handful of days a year. \nOne fisherman, who catches half his whelks and lobsters along Jersey's shores, told me if he can't get full access to Jersey's waters he will have to sell his boat and change his job.\nWhen they returned to the French coast this evening, drenched and exhausted, they were surprisingly upbeat. Talks with Jersey's government did not go well, they said, but they know they have been heard.\nThey are now hopeful their government and Brussels will step in to resolve the issue. \nThey feel their part is done, for now.\nA spokesman for fishermen from France's Normandy region suggested the situation was still in \"deadlock\". Hugo Lehuby told Reuters news agency: \"Either this gets resolved, or retaliatory measures are taken.\"\nAnd a European Commission spokeswoman said \"additional conditions\" attached to the new fishing licences were a breach of the Brexit trade deal.\nFrance has threatened to cut off electricity to Jersey, the largest Channel Island and a Crown dependency, located 14 miles (22km) off France. Crown dependencies are not part of the UK, but are defended and represented internationally by the British government.\nThe boats were protesting against new fishing rules - introduced last week by the Jersey government under the UK-EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) - which require French boats to show they have a history of fishing in Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice.\nFrench authorities say \"new technical measures\" had not been communicated to the EU, rendering them \"null and void\".\nJersey's Senator Gorst said after Thursday's talks \"all sides remain committed\" to resolving the concerns that led to the fisherman's protest.\nThe Royal Navy ships sent to Jersey, HMS Severn and HMS Tamar, are based in Portsmouth and are routinely used for fisheries protection - with sailors able to board other boats for spot checks.\nThey are both 90.5m in length, have two large guns, including a short-range anti-aircraft weapon, and are crewed by 45 sailors and up to 50 Royal Marines.\nFrance said its two vessels were not on military missions and were told to stay in French waters and to be near the French fishermen to ensure safety."

So, a month after 9/11, the US launched air strikes against Afghanistan.\nAs other countries joined the war, the Taliban were quickly removed from power.

The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. \nThere are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs.

      "text": "Police officers who killed four people at the start of the Troubles were never held to account due to investigative failings, a report has found.\nOne of the four, nine-year-old Patrick Rooney, was the first child killed in the Troubles.\nThe police ombudsman also stated the use of machine guns by officers to deal with rioting in Belfast in 1969 was \"disproportionate and dangerous\".\nNo former officers can be prosecuted due to a lack of evidence.\nThe ombudsman, Marie Anderson, has published a 128-page report covering the deaths of four people during severe rioting in the city on 14 and 15 August 1969.\nShe said their relatives were justified in believing they died \"without good reason\".\nNine-year-old Patrick Rooney - the first child killed in the Troubles - was hit in his bedroom by one of the shots fired to disperse rioters at Divis flats.\nA separate incident in the same area also claimed the life of off-duty soldier Hugh McCabe, 20, killed by a police marksman who stated he was returning gunfire, though no witnesses saw anyone armed.\nSamuel McLarnon, 27, was shot dead while he stood at a window in his house at Herbert Street in Ardoyne.\nMichael Lynch, 28, was killed in nearby Butler Street by an officer who claimed he had seen \"gun flashes\".\nThe four deaths occurred at a time of serious civil unrest which saw the arrival of British soldiers on to the streets of Northern Ireland to help restore order.\nThe ombudsman's report concluded that \"even allowing for the tumultuous circumstances of the time\", the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) failed to effectively investigate any of the deaths.\nIt noted there had been limited enquiries, inadequate forensic examinations and no evidence any officer had been interviewed for potential criminal or misconduct offences. \nMrs Anderson said it was \"a matter of regret\" that her investigation was unable to identify the individual police officers who were responsible.\nShe said that if proactive action had been taken at the time it may have been possible to determine responsibility for each of the deaths.\n\"Unfortunately, responsibility cannot be determined over 51 years later, given the passage of time and the fact many witnesses and former police officers who may well have been able to assist are now deceased or unwell,\" she said.\nCon Rooney was eight-years-old on the night his nine-year-old brother, Patrick, was shot.\nHe said he remembered seeing a bullet rip through his family's flat and his father saying Patrick had been shot.\nHe thought Patrick had slumped down and fainted but noticed his mother's beige coat was saturated with blood.\n\"It was just horrific,\" he said. \"They put him on the bed and just started screaming and crying and they got down and prayed, it was just pandemonium.\"\nHe said a couple of other family members were in the room at the time sheltering from the gun fire \"where my father thought it was safe for us to be\".\nMr Rooney said he believes that if police had \"properly investigated\" the killings at the time there would have been prosecutions.\n\"They've covered every base for themselves as regards to the evidence at the time, it's been left too long and I'm very, very disappointed.\nHe said that his father passed away eight years ago and feels \"so sorry for my mummy and daddy for all the years we've been fighting\".\nHe added that he does not want to see legislation brought in to restrict future prosecutions of British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.\n\"You need investigations to get to the truth for families to close the door and, obviously, I don't think it's right.\n\"Sorry is not good enough. It's a thing that shouldn't have happened because Patrick was in the right place at the wrong time, he was in his home.\"\nReacting to the report, the family of Mr McCabe said they were \"extremely disappointed\" the ombudsman failed to find his killing to have been unlawful.\n\"He was himself a soldier, on leave from his regiment. Some of his senior officers attended his funeral, something they would never have done if he had been firing on police,\" said his daughter, Liz McCabe.\nRelatives of Mr Lynch said a proper investigation at the time \"was never likely to happen with the RUC\".\n\"It was completely unjustified. He wasn't doing anything to get shot. He was trying to get home,\" they added.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it was considering the findings of the report.\nDeputy Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said: \"Our thoughts today are first and foremost with the families\u00a0of\u00a0Patrick Rooney, Hugh McCabe, Samuel McLarnon and Michael Lynch.\n\"We respect and acknowledge the hurt and suffering of each of the bereaved families, and we offer our sincerest and heartfelt sympathies to them for the loss they endured.\""

      "text": "Increasing numbers of top female athletes will walk away from their sport due to difficulties during the pandemic, leading figures have warned.\nGymnast Latalia Bevan, 20, and rugby international Angharad de Smet, 24, say Covid has left their careers in the balance.    \nSports sociologist Dr Ali Bowes said it had highlighted inequalities in sport. \n\"There are absolutely concerns women will walk away,\" she said. \nWales rugby international de Smet, who has worked on the front line during the pandemic, said she's been left wondering whether \"the love of the game is enough?\" \nThe 24-year-old from Ammanford, who was playing for Wales in the Autumn Internationals and as part of the sevens squad before Covid-19, was \"living the life of a professional athlete, without the pay cheque\". \nBut as Wales began its first lockdown, games and training were cancelled.  \nOver the last year, she said she's trained with just one kettlebell, unable to access proper equipment or facilities. Her last game of rugby was 14 months ago.\nThe physiotherapist technician, who works on an elderly care ward in Swansea, said she has struggled to train after gruelling shifts in hospital. \n\"You've seen things you would hope to never see again in your lifetime, to come home and try and do a gym session... in your tiny kitchen... you think 'why am I bothering?'\" \nIn 2019, the 24-year-old had been travelling to Worcester to train a couple of times a week after work, arriving home in the early hours.  \n\"Nobody understands how much we give, just the wear and tear on your car, the petrol, putting food on the table, trying to get good food into you to aid recovery is expensive.\" \nNow, she describes her future in the sport as \"uncertain\".  \n\"Do I put my career first or do I pursue my dream of playing internationally, becoming a professional athlete? I am 24, should I have to make those sorts of calls already?\" \nCommonwealth Games silver medallist Latalia Bevan said the challenges of a global pandemic were a \"massive\" factor in her decision to retire from elite gymnastics earlier this year. \n\"It was so hard to keep your motivation, we'd do two or three Zooms a day, so my home turned into a gym and I'm from a family of seven.\" \nThe 20-year-old from Merthyr Tydfil, who won Wales' first gymnastics medal at the Gold Coast 2018 Games in Australia, had been training for 32 hours a week as well as studying at university in Cardiff. \nAs a student, she used her loan to help cover costs after losing GB funding and while recovering from an operation. \nBut after leaving her studies, she lost the financial support and struggled to adjust to a new life away from the gym after 14 years. \nShe's been working as a home carer since retiring and said it's nice not to have to rely on her family to pay for things. \nThe former gymnast said she'd thought about returning to the sport but, if she did, she'd have to quit her job and that isn't an option with rent to pay. \nShe's now focused on becoming a gymnastics coach and personal trainer. \nRugby player Alecs Donovan \"would never have thought\" that at the end of the third lockdown she'd retire.\nWith her yoga businesses closed, the 30-year-old said she was able to train \"more than ever\".  \nThe business owner said the pandemic has given her the chance to sit back and prioritise seeing family and friends.  \nAs a personal trainer who works with professional male athletes, she said it can be worse seeing their schedules and the support they get. \nShe added she was aware of women who don't go for promotions because their current job allows them to play the sport, but she wonders what will happen when rugby stops.\nDr Ali Bowes, senior lecturer in sociology of sport at Nottingham Trent University, said: \"It's one year on from lockdown and it's really obvious where the inequalities exist.\"\nHer research, looking at the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on elite women's sport, found women struggled to access equipment, a gender \"play\" gap where men's sport returned faster and financial difficulties for women who were unable to play. \n\"There are absolutely concerns that women will walk away and we've seen that already with some examples in a number of sports where it's been too difficult for them to continue,\" she said.\nThe sociologist is optimistic that discussions about the problems in women's sport, and the difficulties athletes face can be used for positive change.  \n\"There's also been significant forward steps, and it's put equality really on the agenda for lots of sports organisations, teams, clubs and national governing bodies. There's no hiding place now.\""

      "tags": "Economics,Job Retention Scheme,Economic growth,UK economy,Bank of England,Andrew Bailey",
      "text": "The UK economy will enjoy its fastest growth in more than 70 years in 2021 as Covid-19 restrictions are lifted, according to the Bank of England.\nThe economy is expected to expand by 7.25% this year, with extra government spending helping to limit job losses.\nHowever, it follows a contraction of 9.9% in 2020, the biggest in 300 years.\nAndrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said the recovery was \"strong\" but likened it to \"more of a bounce back\" than a boom.\nHe added that the surge in growth, while \"good news\", would only return the UK economy back to its 2019 size.\nMr Bailey told the BBC: \"We're going to see a continued strong recovery this year, but let's put that into perspective.\n\"That's two years passed with no growth in the economy.\"\nHis comments came as Bank policymakers held interest rates at a record low of 0.1%.\nThe Bank expects the recovery to gather pace as the reopening of high streets paves the way for a mini-spending boom.\nThe UK's rapid vaccine rollout is also expected to boost consumer confidence.\nGrowth of more than 7% this year would represent the strongest expansion since official records began in 1949.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak announced in the March Budget that the furlough scheme, which subsidises employees' wages, would be extended until the end of September. \nMr Bailey said the extension would limit the rise in unemployment \"significantly\" by providing a \"bridge of support that will last until the recovery is underway\".\nThe Bank now expects the unemployment rate to peak at 5.5% later this year. This is far below the 7.75% it predicted in February.\nMr Bailey added: \"Longer term unemployment is one of the most difficult things to deal with. And we think that will be substantially reduced.\"\nThe number of people on furlough is expected to fall to 2.75 million in the three months to June, from just under five million at the start of this year.\n\"Given the expected near\u2011term recovery in activity, unemployment is projected to increase only slightly,\" policymakers said in the Bank's latest Monetary Policy Report.\nThe Bank of England is trying to play down the idea that there is a post pandemic boom, but nonetheless these are very significant increases to the forecast for economic growth this year, and a substantial cut to predicted peak unemployment.\nMuch of this is \"rebound\" - the natural and obvious result of large swathes of the economy reopening. But the changes indicate the underpinning of a more sustained recovery too.\nThe peak in unemployment has been sharply downgraded, from close to 8% to 5.5%, thanks to the furlough scheme extension, a stronger recovery, and an assumption that the long-term damage from the pandemic will be smaller than previously expected. \nThat means about 700,000 expected job losses not materialising. If this does come to pass, it will far exceed even the most optimistic assumptions from the start of the pandemic crisis.\nThe Bank also assumes that vaccinated Britons feel safer, more confident and are now spending more of the savings arising from a year of lockdowns. \nThere are clear uncertainties, relating to virus variants. But the Bank is at least pointing to a summer recovery, with the economic damage from the pandemic repaired by the end of this year.\nHouseholds have squirrelled away more than \u00a3150bn in extra savings over the past year as more people have worked from home, particularly higher earners.\nThe Bank expects them to spend about 10% of this extra cash as the economy returns to normal.\nHowever, more than half of those surveyed by the Bank said they would keep the money in savings, suggesting that many households remain cautious about the economic outlook.\nPolicymakers stressed that the outlook \"remains uncertain\" and \"continues to depend on the evolution of the pandemic\".\nNon-essential shops, pubs and restaurants started reopening last month as part of a phased easing of restrictions across the UK.\nThe Bank's survey of businesses showed that \"footfall increased rapidly in the first few days of trading\", with hairdressers, pubs and restaurants all reporting a surge in bookings.\nAnecdotal evidence suggested that many people were also opting to take holidays in the UK instead of overseas, with demand \"much higher\" than pre-Covid levels.\nThe Bank also suggested that pay rises were likely to remain subdued this year.\nWhile fewer businesses are freezing pay, the Bank said most were awarding increases of between 1.5% and 2%.\nIt added: \"Where bonuses were being paid, these were generally lower than a year ago.\"\nRecent increases in commodity and factory gate prices, combined with record low interest rates, have raised fears of a bigger rise in the price of goods and services.\nInflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), currently stands at 0.7%.\nHowever, this is expected to increase sharply towards the Bank's target of 2% in the next few months amid a rise in energy prices.\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates was split on Thursday over the size of its latest round of bond buying, as it announced it will slow the pace of purchases.\nOutgoing chief economist Andy Haldane voted for a reduction in the Bank's quantitative easing programme to guard against the risk of the economy overheating. \nHowever, the MPC stressed it would not raise interest rates until there was \"clear evidence\" that the recovery was sustainable."

      "tags": "Turkey,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,Air travel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "UK travellers returning from \"red list\" countries are flying home via Turkey to avoid hefty hotel quarantine fees.\nPassengers are breaking their journey in Istanbul, and staying in hotels there for a fraction of the cost they would have to pay in Britain.\nTravellers from countries on the red list would otherwise face bills of up to \u00a31,750-per-person to isolate in a hotel if they flew to the UK directly.\nThose using the route must still quarantine at home once back in the UK.\nOne hotel worker in Istanbul said he had seen British nationals flying in from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh - which are all on the UK's red list.\nThe BBC has also spoken to travellers returning from Pakistan to the UK, many of whom were attending weddings or funerals and say they couldn't afford the cost of quarantining once the rules changed.\nAs long as they isolate at home for 10 days after returning from a non-red list country, they are not breaking the UK government's Covid rules.\nThe UK has a so-called red list with travel heavily restricted to countries on it - usually those with high coronavirus rates.\nAny British citizen arriving home who has been to a country on the list in the past 10 days must then pay to quarantine in a government-approved hotel.\nThe cost is \u00a31,750 for a single adult, while a family of four with teenage children would pay \u00a33,700. Guests are largely restricted to their rooms for the duration.\nBy comparison, anyone arriving in the UK from a country not on the list is told to self-isolate at home - so long as they've not been in a red list country in the past 10 days.\nOne travel agent in Bradford said some of his clients who had travelled to Pakistan had been left facing a hefty bill to return home after the country was placed on UK's banned list on 9 April. \n\"I've got customers who can't afford to come back,\" said Ascher Khawaja of Oltrax Travel, citing UK quarantine costs. To ease the burden on his clients, Mr Khawaja says he has arranged 15-20 journeys home via Turkey. \nThe country brought in a three-week lockdown last week because of rising infections - but it has not been added to the UK's red list. \"With the hotel factored in, it works out at around \u00a3600 compared to \u00a31,700-plus,\" he said. \nAnyone entering Turkey must have had a negative Covid test within 72 hours. They also must have a negative PCR test to leave the country. Foreign tourists are, however, exempt from Turkey's current lockdown rules. \nBradford businessman Mohammad Saad travelled to Pakistan on 23 March to attend his nephew's funeral and had been due to fly home on 10 April - the day after Pakistan was added to the red list. \nWhen he couldn't change his flights, he and his 16-year-old son flew to Turkey instead. The cost was about \u00a3450 for 10 days in Istanbul, he said.\n\"It's like an extra holiday. Then you can fly back into the UK from Istanbul without any hotel quarantine.\"\nHashir, a 21-year-old student returning from Pakistan, said he had met other Britons at the airport when he arrived in Istanbul.  \n\"There's no way I have that money, I'm a university student,\" said Hashir, referring to the cost of returning directly to the UK. He is due back in the UK on 7 May.\nZulfiqar Ali, a 45-year-old taxi driver from Leeds, travelled from Pakistan to Istanbul on 24 April. \"I paid \u00a3100 for 11 nights. It's a double bed, a TV and a fridge. It was online and food was very cheap.\"\nHe said he was returning to the UK on 5 May.\nThe BBC has also spoken to staff at hotels in Istanbul. One accommodation worker in the old city said British travellers were using the country as \"a bridge\".\nHis hotel had booked British passport holders travelling from Pakistan, Bangladesh and India - all on the red list, he said.\nTurkey has since tightened its rules on people arriving from India, who must now quarantine in designated dormitories.\nA manager at another hotel in the city said, through his membership of an international booking website, he could see there had been a rise in people travelling from Pakistan and India to Istanbul. \nBradford MP Naz Shah said others had been unable to book family rooms on the UK hotel quarantine booking system. She said she was \"deeply concerned\" about children potentially missing school because their parents can't afford to fly home.\nThe UK's Department for Transport said people who had not been in a red list country for the past 10 days were not prevented from entering the UK - but should isolate at home.\nIt said the rules were aimed at stopping people - other than British residents - entering the UK from red list countries.\nAdditional reporting by BBC Turkish Service."

      "text": "Pregnant women are struggling to get the coronavirus vaccine because clinics are unable to guarantee they will have the right type of jab available, Labour MP Stella Creasy has said. \nThe Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna jabs are preferable for pregnant women because there is more safety data available.\nBut the online booking system in England does not allow them to specify which vaccine they require. \nPregnant women are advised to speak to their GP instead of booking online.\nBut Ms Creasy, 44, said GPs do not always know when local vaccination centres will have specific types of the jab available. \nThe MP for Walthamstow, who is currently pregnant with her second child, said she had received five invitations to be vaccinated but she could not take them up because there is no system to specify she needs the Pfizer or Moderna jab. \n\"I don't think it's been made enough of a priority because there's a presumption it will become more of a priority as they move through the age groups, which is a misreading of the data about pregnancy,\" she told the BBC. \n\"More women in this country are pregnant over the age of 40 than under 20 so there are quite a lot of us now who qualify. \n\"There are also pregnant women who have serious health conditions who still can't get a vaccine because of a logistics problem.\"\nMs Creasy is currently working with doctors in Walthamstow, north-east London, to arrange for pregnant women to receive leftover Pfizer vaccines. \nBut she said there should be a national system in place to allow people to specify if they need a particular type of vaccine when booking an appointment.  \nGiuditta Fontana, 36, from Birmingham, has received a text inviting her to book her coronavirus vaccine but has been unable to do so yet. \nShe was told by her GP surgery that they were unable to book her in for a specific vaccine and was advised to call the 119 central booking service.\nBut she still encountered the same problem and was then told to visit her nearest vaccination centre to see what doses they had available. \nGiuditta tried a mass vaccination centre nearby but was told they did not have Moderna or Pfizer vaccines available. \nShe said many of her friends who are pregnant have had similar experiences - and even if they have booked an appointment they do not know which vaccine they will be offered. \nAt 32 weeks pregnant Giuditta is now worried she will not be able to be vaccinated before she gives birth and is concerned about the risk of catching Covid-19 in hospital. \n\"In my case, I know that in six weeks' time, I'm going to be taken into hospital, and I'm going to have a booked C-section. And I'm going to have to spend two or three days there,\" she said. \n\"It would really make a huge difference if I was able to have at least the first dose of the vaccine before getting into hospital.\"\n\"The whole process is proving incredibly stressful, which is something that in theory, you shouldn't experience in pregnancy,\" she added. \nOn 16 April, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK health departments, said pregnant women should get the coronavirus vaccine at the same time as the rest of the population, based on their age and any underlying health conditions. \nThere is no evidence to suggest other vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women but more research is needed. \nReal-world data from the US shows around 90,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated, mainly with mRNA vaccines such as the Pfizer and Modern jabs, without any safety concerns being raised. \nBased on this data, the JCVI says it is preferable for pregnant women in the UK to be offered the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines where available.\nThey are also encouraged to discuss the risks and benefits of the vaccines with their doctor before making the appointment.\nAn NHS England spokesman said: \"Following the updated guidance set out by the JCVI, the NHS immediately communicated the advice to GPs. \n\"If you're pregnant, or think you might be, speak to your maternity team or GP surgery to discuss your vaccine appointment so that it can be arranged at a site offering the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, which is preferable for pregnant women.\"\nAlthough pregnant women are at no greater risk of being infected by the virus, they are more likely to have complications from Covid-19.\nData shows that one in five pregnant women who become unwell with Covid needs to have her baby delivered early."

      "text": "The single-use carrier bag charge will rise from 5p to 10p and be extended to all businesses in England from 21 May.\nThe government said all stores, including corner shops, will now have to apply the charge from that date.\nThe 5p levy on plastic bags was introduced in England in 2015. Since then their use has fallen by over 95%.\nThe average person in England now buys just four single-use carrier bags a year from the main supermarkets, compared with 140 in 2014.\n\"The introduction of the 5p charge has been a phenomenal success,\" said Environment Minister Rebecca Pow.\nBy extending the charge to all retailers, the government hopes the use of single-use carrier bags will fall by 70-80% in small and medium-sized businesses.\n\"We know we must go further to protect our natural environment and oceans, which is why we are now extending this charge to all businesses,\" said Ms Pow.\n\"Over the next couple of weeks I urge all retailers of all sizes to make sure they are ready for the changes, as we work together to build back greener and strengthen our world-leading action to combat the scourge of plastic waste.\"\nAssociation of Convenience Stores chief executive, James Lowman, said: \"We strongly welcome the inclusion of local shops and other small businesses into the successful plastic bag charging scheme, which not only helps the environment, but is also a great way for retailers to raise money for local and national charities.\"\nJohn Lewis said it was trialling the removal of single-use bags from its Cheltenham, Kingston and Leeds stores from 21 May.\nCustomers will be asked to bring their own bags or buy a reusable bag made from 100% recyclable material costing 50p for a medium size and 75p for a large size.\nMarija Rompani, director of ethics and sustainability for the John Lewis Partnership, said: \"It has become the norm to take our own bags when we go food shopping but we have a different mindset when shopping for clothes, beauty and home products.\n\"We expect our customers will be supportive of this change and will be listening to their feedback.\"\n\"Plastic pollution is one of the most visible symptoms of the environmental crisis, damaging natural habitats and putting precious wildlife at risk,\" sasid Paula Chin, sustainable materials specialist at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). \n\"Measures to reduce plastics consumption need to go much further. The UK government must consider a complete ban on single-use bags and make sure this is not undermined by the sale of 'bags for life', which are currently cheaply available and all too often end up as single-use items.\"\nThe Co-op became the latest supermarket chain to say it will stop selling plastic \"bags for life\" last month.\nThe retailer, which has 2,600 shops, said many people only used the 10p bags once before throwing them away.\nThe Co-op said its move would take 29.5 million bags for life, or about 870 tonnes of plastic, out of circulation every year.\nEarlier last month Morrisons said it would switch from offering plastic \"bags for life\" to a paper alternative.\nIn recent years, all supermarkets have tried to cut plastics use.\nWaitrose is currently trialling the removal of its 10p bags for life from several of its stores.\nSainsbury's has said its bags for life cost 20p to encourage customers to re-use them and are made from 100% recycled plastic.\nTesco increased the price of its bags for life to 20p in September 2020 and doesn't sell single-use bags.

      "tags": "Crowborough,Food",
      "text": "The family of a teenager who died after unwittingly eating food he was allergic to at a Byron Burger restaurant say they do not feel properly compensated.\nOwen Carey, who had a dairy allergy, ordered skinny grilled chicken at Byron's O2 Arena branch in London for his 18th birthday in April 2017.\nHe informed staff about his allergy but was not told buttermilk was included. He collapsed and died shortly later.\nByron said it has since improved all allergen procedures.\nA coroner ruled in 2019 that Mr Carey, from Crowborough, Sussex, was not told about allergens that led to his death.\nThe Carey family are now working to change the law. They received a letter from Byron's chief executive apologising for \"all the pain\" the family had suffered. \nBut Mr Carey's father Paul has now told Victoria Derbyshire on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show that the family have not been awarded damages or specific compensation for their pain or suffering.\n\"Byron's insurers refused to pay any damages and only offered to pay a proportion of the legal and funeral costs,\" he said, describing the decision as \"pathetic\". \nHe added: \"We weren't looking to profit from Owen's death - we would have donated the money to the charity the Anaphylaxis Campaign which supports people at risk from serious allergies. \n\"You can't quantify in monetary terms how much we miss Owen. But we're not doing this for money, we just want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.\"\nThe family are now officially launching their campaign for \"Owen's Law\", which would require clear, specific allergen labelling on every restaurant menu. \nLast month, they met the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and wrote to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which has responsibility for food safety calling for a change in the law. They are yet to receive a response.\nPaul Carey said: \"The buttermilk marinade wasn't stated on the menu and was not conveyed by the waiter. \n\"Some customers, young customers, might even be afraid to ask about allergens. If you write in words or symbols on the menu what the allergens are for each dish, nobody has to ask.\"\nThe family believe Mr Carey's death should never have happened and the current regulations leave too much room for error. \nHis sister Emma Kocher said the FSA seemed \"positive\" about helping them. \"I think the general public doesn't appreciate how difficult it is for people with allergies,\" she said.\n\"If the word allergic is used, then people need to take it seriously because allergies can kill.\"\nMr Carey's mother Moira said after her son's inquest in 2019 that \"hundreds of thousands\" of allergy sufferers were scared to eat out in restaurants because that was \"the key place where they are at risk\". \nThe inquest heard there had been about 150 deaths like Mr Carey's in the UK in the past 25 years.\nByron has updated its menu which originally stated \"Chicken - choose yours grilled or fried\", to \"Chicken - marinated in buttermilk, choose yours grilled or fried\". \nIn a statement, its CEO Simon Wilkinson said: \"Even though this happened two years before I was employed by Byron, I have personally taken the responsibility to improve all allergen procedures... I am very supportive of any improvements or changes that can be made across the industry to prevent further tragic accidental deaths from occurring and will work with the family accordingly.\"\nLast year, Natasha's Law was introduced, requiring foods pre-packaged on site, such as sandwiches, to carry a full list of ingredients. \nIt comes after 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died from having an allergic reaction to a baguette bought from Pret-a-Manger.\nThe law, which will apply to England, Wales and Northern Ireland, is set to come into force by the summer of 2021.\nVictoria Derbyshire interviewed the Carey family as part of her week covering the Jeremy Vine Show on BBC Radio 2. You can hear the full interview during today's show 12:00 BST to 14:00 - or anytime after on BBC Sounds.\nEarlier this week, Victoria Derbyshire spoke to professional dancer Abbie Quinnen who suffered burns after a social media stunt went wrong. Quinnen revealed some of the \"horrific\" abuse she has received on social media since her accident in mid-January.\nRead more: Dancer reveals 'horrible' abuse over burns"

      "text": "Scots have cast their ballots in the Holyrood election, but don't need to stay up all night as Covid-19 restrictions have put paid to the usual overnight count. With votes to be tallied across Friday and Saturday, when will you know the result in your local area - and when will the overall winners be declared?\nCounting will kick off from 09:00 on Friday morning, with the Electoral Management Board projecting 48 of the 73 constituencies to be tallied that day.\nThe full lists can be found here, or you can look up your local results here: \nFriday's constituencies include both the most marginal and safest seats from 2016, and eight of the SNP's top 10 target seats.\nThese include the Labour defences of Dumbarton, Edinburgh Southern and East Lothian, none of which have a majority exceeding 3%, and the Conservative seats in Ayr, Edinburgh Central, Dumfriesshire and Eastwood.\nIf the SNP manage to pick off the lion's share of these seats, they will feel good about going into Saturday and winning a majority.\nThis will particularly be the case if they can gain ground without suffering defeats in any of their own more marginal seats - Angus North & Mearns, Moray and Perthshire North are those with single-digit majorities.\nThe reverse is also true of course - if the SNP struggle to gain many of these marginal seats or lose some of their own, the path to a majority narrows.\nBy the end of Friday, it should be fairly clear which way the wind is blowing - but there will still be plenty to play for on Saturday.\nIf all goes well on Friday, the remaining 25 constituencies will count on Saturday - with the most marginal contests being between the SNP and Conservatives.\nThe most marginal constituencies to count on Saturday are again SNP-Tory contests, with the SNP hoping to pick off Aberdeenshire West and Galloway&West Dumfries, both with majorities under 5%.\nThere are a few chances for the Tories to fight back too, with the SNP defences of Perthshire South& Kinross-shire, Edinburgh Pentlands and Aberdeen South and North Kincardine all having single-digit majorities.\nOnce each region has declared all of its constituencies, we will also start to get results from the regional lists - which could be pivotal for the overall result, as well as questions over who claims second place and the fate of smaller parties.\nBefore we turn to the regional results, a quick note on how they are worked out.\nScotland is divided into eight electoral regions, with the 73 constituency seats scattered across them. Each region elects an extra seven MSPs from lists submitted by the parties - voted for via the peach ballot paper - giving a total of 129.\nThe idea of the list system is to make the outcome of the election more proportional. \nOnce the constituency results have been declared, you divide the number of list votes each party has won by the number of seats they have already won in that region, plus one. So if a party has won nine seats in an area already, their list vote tally is divided by 10 - making it 10 times harder for them to win a seat from the lists.\nThere has been particular focus on the list system in 2021 thanks to the emergence of some list-only parties which encourage tactical voting, leading to a debate over whether this is \"gaming the system\" or simply testing the limits of the rules.\nTimings for the counts remain very much up in the air, given we don't yet know how difficult it will prove to stack up ballots in line with Covid-19 restrictions.\nBut under current plans, with the exception of the big centres of Glasgow and Edinburgh, most of the count centres only have one constituency to finish off on the Saturday. \nThis means they could well finish up quickly - and indeed simultaneously, if there are similar numbers of ballots to count in each constituency.\nWhich regions will declare first?\nIt is hard to say, but the Highlands and Islands - normally one of the last regions to come back in an overnight count due to the vast and varied geography of the area - only has one seat to count on Saturday.\nSimilarly there will only be one seat left to count from the West Scotland region - so it is possible these two will be able to declare their full regional lists first.\nOther regions have at least a couple of constituencies still to polish off before they can run the equations and calculate list seats. Mid Scotland and Fife could be next in line with three seats to count, all at separate locations.\nHowever, this is largely guesswork, and a lot will depend on how the Covid-safe procedures play out at count centres. There will be four constituencies counting at the Emirates Area in Glasgow on Saturday, and three at Ingliston for the Lothian region.\nSouth Scotland also has four counts still to run on Saturday, as does North East Scotland - with two of the latter at P&J Live in Aberdeen, which may delay matters from a logistical standpoint."

      "text": "Germany has voiced opposition to a US-backed proposal to waive patents on Covid-19 vaccines, saying they were not hindering production of the jabs.\nIts government said \"the protection of intellectual property is a source of innovation and must remain so\".\nThe European Union earlier said it was ready to talk about the proposal, and some states gave it their full backing.\nSupporters of the plan say it will allow more manufactures to produce the life-saving vaccines. \nThey argue that this will increase access to jabs in poorer countries.\nBut opponents, including drug makers, say it may not have the desired effect.\nThe idea was originally proposed by India and South Africa, who have been leading a group of about 60 countries at the World Trade Organization (WTO) - an intergovernmental body that promotes global commerce. The group is pushing for the temporary removal of intellectual property protections on vaccines.\nThe proposal was met with strong opposition from the previous US administration of Donald Trump, as well as the UK and the EU. \nBut it gained momentum this week after the US backed it.\nWTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told the BBC's Newshour programme that she welcomed US support for the waiver. She said members should negotiate a pragmatic agreement over vaccine production because the current inequity was \"not right\".\nMs Okonjo-Iweala acknowledged the shortage of raw materials and technical expertise required on the ground, but said they would need to start somewhere to boost global supplies. \nMeanwhile in Germany, Health Minister Jens Spahn said the country would allow the AstraZeneca vaccine to be administered to all adults, reversing a previous decision to restrict the shot to people over the age of 60 because of concerns over rare blood clots seen in a tiny number of recipients.\u00a0\nIn a statement on Thursday, the German government said the US-backed proposal would have \"significant implications for vaccine production as a whole\".\n\"The limiting factors in the production of vaccines are the production capacities and the high quality standards and not patents,\" it said, adding that pharmaceutical companies were already working with partners to ramp up manufacturing.\nGermany is the EU's biggest economic power and home to a major pharmaceutical sector, including BioNTech which developed one of the most widely-used coronavirus vaccines.\nThe remarks by the German government came after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was \"ready to discuss\" the proposal on waiving patents. \nMs von der Leyen has previously spoken about her opposition to lifting intellectual property rights, telling the New York Times just weeks ago that she was \"not at all a friend of releasing patents\".\nMeanwhile, officials in other member states such as France and Italy gave the proposal their full backing.\nThe issue is reportedly set to be on the agenda at a two-day EU meeting this week.\nOutside of the EU, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he supported the idea of a waiver.\nThe UK government said it was \"working with WTO members to resolve this issue\" and was \"in discussions with the US and WTO members to facilitate increased production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines\". \nIntellectual property describes creations, such as inventions, which are protected by patents, copyrights and trademarks. These prevent copying and allow the originator to be financially rewarded.\nPatents give innovating firms a short-term monopoly on production to cover the costs of development and encourage investment.\nBiotech firms argue that such protection has provided incentives to produce Covid vaccines in record times.\nMany developing countries have argued that rules requiring countries to protect patents and other forms of intellectual property are an obstacle to increasing the production of vaccines and other products needed to tackle the pandemic.\nCalls for a vaccine patent waiver come as lower income countries face acute vaccine shortages.\nBut opponents, particularly from the industry, have said it will not solve the problem. \nThe head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Thomas Cueni, told the BBC's Today programme he was \"deeply concerned\" that \"you could compromise the quality and safety of vaccines which we see now\".\n\"It is shortages and scarcity in the supply chains, which need to be addressed. And it is also right now the disappointing unwillingness of rich countries to early share doses with the poor countries,\" he said. \nSome experts say pharmaceutical companies would also need to share know-how, such as production techniques, with poorer countries to have any real beneficial effect.\nNobody is protected until everyone's protected: on that world and business leaders are agreed.\nBut pharmaceutical companies have called the decision by the US to back the sharing of secret recipes for vaccinations shortsighted, claiming it is understanding the production process that is the real challenge. It is, they say, akin to handing out a recipe without sharing the method or the ingredients, and could lead to quality issues and less efficient production\nInstead, the UK and the EU have favoured a system of licensing, whereby knowhow is shared and there is more oversight. It is already being done on some cases on a voluntary basis - such as the tie up between Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India. And that licensing can be made compulsory, although the pharmaceutical companies could then be eligible for compensation. \nSome trade specialists have speculated that the US might be hoping that, by backing a lifting of patents, manufacturers might be more open to sharing expertise voluntarily - or at least, for a reduced charge.

      "text": "The UK's services sector rebounded in April with growth climbing to a seven-year high as lockdown restrictions were eased, according to an influential survey. \nThe sector, which accounts for 80% of the UK economy, had the fastest rise in output since October 2013. \nThe purchasing managers' index from IHS Markit/CIPS climbed to 61 for April, up from 56.3 in March. \nAny figure above 50 shows growth in the sector.\n\"April data illustrates that a surge of pent-up demand has started to flow through the UK economy, following the loosening of pandemic restrictions, which lifted private sector growth to its highest since October 2013,\" said Tim Moore, economics director at survey compiler IHS Markit. \nHe said the road map for reopening leisure, hospitality and other customer-facing activities \"resulted in a sharp increase in forward bookings and new project starts across the service sector\". \nHe added that if the rebound in order books continues along its recent trajectory during the rest of the second quarter, \"then service sector output growth looks very likely to surpass the survey-record high seen back in April 1997\". \n\"Service sector companies were creating jobs at a level last seen since in October 2015 and paying more in wages to get the best talent; a sign of ever-increasing confidence about the year ahead,\" said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply. \nHe said the positive trend in recovery is likely to accelerate in the coming months, but warned that stretched supply chains remain a sticking point, along with inflation potentially biting chunks out of wages and business margins. \nThat threatens \"to put a brake on this fast track to economic normality\", he added.

      "text": "The US secretary of state has told Russia to cease all \"reckless and aggressive actions\" towards Ukraine.\nAntony Blinken made the comments during a trip to Kyiv on Thursday where he met top Ukrainian officials.\nSpeaking alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky, he said the US was looking to strengthen security co-operation and assistance between the two countries.\nThe visit comes just weeks after Russia deployed thousands of soldiers close to the Ukrainian border.\n\"We are aware that Russia has withdrawn some forces from the border... but we also see that significant forces remain there [and] significant equipment remains there,\" Mr Blinken said.\nThe top US diplomat said Washington was \"monitoring the situation very, very closely\".\nHe did not provide further details of any additional security support the US was considering.\nBarbara Plett Usher, the BBC's State Department correspondent, says the visit was intended to signal that Ukraine is a high foreign policy priority for President Joe Biden's administration.\nMr Blinken travelled to Ukraine following a meeting of foreign ministers of the G7 group of industrialised nations in London earlier this week.\nA statement issued after the two-day talks criticised Moscow for its \"irresponsible and destabilising behaviour\", particularly against Ukraine, and for cyber-attacks.\nMr Blinken echoed those sentiments on Thursday while appearing alongside President Zelensky, who said his country was under threat from Russian troops massed near its border.\nThe US and Russia have been long-term adversaries and remain far apart on major issues.\nIn February, US President Joe Biden said he had made it clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin \"that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions [were] over\".\nBut Mr Biden's predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, said during his presidential campaign that he would get along with Mr Putin. He sought to improve ties while in office, a stance at odds with traditional Republican party policy.\nBy Jonah Fisher, BBC Ukraine correspondent\nAfter the intrigue, phone calls and blackmail that dominated the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine - the presidency of Mr Biden was what many Ukrainians wanted. They are hoping for a steady and dependable ally.\nMr Trump was impeached in 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. He was acquitted, but the saga certainly strained US-Ukraine relations.\nMr Blinken has promised to reinvigorate the relationship. He has been keen to stress that the US stood with Ukraine against Russian aggression, and has said that he is looking at ways of strengthening security co-operation.\nTo enhance its security, Ukraine would like to become a member of Nato - a military alliance of countries from Europe and North America. But there was little encouragement on that front, and Mr Blinken simply said that those aspirations had been discussed.\nMr Blinken told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that the US would prefer a \"more stable and predictable relationship\" with Russia, but would respond to reckless or aggressive acts.\nHe said Washington was focused on actions such as the treatment of opposition figure Alexei Navalny, the Solar Winds hack and election interference.\nHe touched on a number of other policy areas in his BBC interview, including Iran and the planned troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. \nMr Blinken insisted that the Biden administration was not trying to hold China back on the world stage, but he stressed that Washington was in favour of upholding a rules-based international system.\nOn Afghanistan, Mr Blinken insisted that the US was \"staying in the game\" and would remain engaged with the country despite an earlier announcement that its soldiers would leave by September.\nMr Blinken said regional powers might have to \"step up\" and use their influence and try to keep the country on a positive path.\nAsked about a possible trade deal with the UK and the situation in Northern Ireland, Mr Blinken said the administration remained very focused on peace in Ireland. \nThe secretary of state said that for President Biden it was important that \"whatever is done, whatever we do, the gains of the Good Friday Agreement are sustained and we have the political and economic well-being of Northern Ireland in mind\".\nJoe Biden has previously said that Brexit must not endanger the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which effectively ended Northern Ireland's \"Troubles\".\nPost-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland have led to tensions there and contributed to the recent resignation of First Minister Arlene Foster."

      "text": "Taoiseach (Irish PM) Mich\u00e9al Martin has warned the UK that any unilateral move around Troubles-related prosecutions of veterans would be a \"breach of trust\".\nIt comes amid reports that the UK intends to ban future prosecutions of British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland.\nIt has been reported that the move would also apply to former paramilitaries.\nThe plan has also sparked anger from politicians in Northern Ireland.\nThe Daily Telegraph and The Times reported legislation will be announced in the Queen's Speech on Tuesday.\nThe Irish government said it \"strongly advised\" the UK not to take \"unilateral action on sensitive issues\". \nMr Martin added: \"For us the victims are the priority and the victims will remain the priority.\"\nA UK government spokesperson said it had \"clear objectives for addressing the legacy of the Troubles\".\nIt is understood the proposed legislation would see limits placed on prosecutions for offences committed before the signing of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.\nThe reports were leaked on the eve of polling day for elections in England, Scotland and Wales. \nSinn F\u00e9in president Mary Lou McDonald said the move was an \"attack on the rule of law\". \nShe said what the British government was doing was \"an attempt to put British soldiers above the law and prevent investigations into murder, torture, shoot to kill and collusion involving British forces in Ireland\".\n\"Let's be clear, this is not about dealing with the legacy of our past, this is about continuing the decades long cover-ups and frustrating families in their efforts to get truth and justice.\"\nDUP MP Gavin Robinson said it was \"appalling\" the proposal had been released to the media, and his party had not been given any of the detail. \n\"I would say I have some concerns about what I have read today,\" he said. \n\"You know our position, we are against an amnesty. There should not be an amnesty, there should be no evaporation of justice for victims out there.\"\nHe said his party \"will want to see very quickly from the government what they are planning to do\" and that the proposed move was \"a cop out\". \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he plans to speak to the British and Irish governments later, adding the plan would over run the 2014 Stormont House Agreement, which included proposed measures to deal with the past. \nHe described the reported plans as \"the biggest betrayal of victims by the British government\" and said it would \"put a huge obstacle in the way of true reconciliation\".\n\"It is the most shabby government I have ever come across, they are so cynical and so untrustworthy, I don't think anybody would trust them,\" Mr Eastwood told BBC Radio Foyle.\n\"Society needs to move on but on the basis of truth and justice. You cannot do it by hiding the past and this government is more concerned with backbench Tory MPs with military constituencies than actually looking after the victims of the past.\"\nHe added the current government was \"the most unprincipled and cynical\" in many years. \nI don't think we should be surprised by this development. \nIt was the direction of travel that the government has been on since March of last year when it announced that it wanted to shut down the majority of investigations, close them, for good. \nThis was the mechanism by which the Conservative Party would honour its manifesto commitment to end prosecutions of veterans who served in Northern Ireland. \nWhat has become clear over recent weeks is that in order to do this, the government would have to apply some type of mechanism across the board. \nSo, as well as restricting or banning further prosecutions of veterans, this new piece of legislation would mean former paramilitaries would not be prosecuted either. \nIt remains to be seen what will emerge by way of legislation. \nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) MLA Doug Beattie said this was an amnesty for all. \n\"Everybody will get away with this. This is a line under the sand,\" he said. He said the UUP was not in favour of an amnesty. \nThe legislation was also criticised by the Alliance Party leader, Naomi Long, who said on Twitter that the lack of communication on it \"typifies the contempt with which Govt are treating victims\".\nTraditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said that if the reports are correct, \"then amnesty for terrorist murder is shamefully on its way\".\n\"Amnesty for terrorists in the tailwind of action to protect veterans is not acceptable, either by reason of the equivalence it embraces or the disproportionate advantage to terrorists,\" he said. \nIn D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish parliament) on Thursday, Mr Varadkar said the reports \"fly in the face\" of both the Stormont House Agreement and New Decade, New Approach.\n\"It's something that we will not support as a government. We support the victims,\" Mr Varadkar said. \n\"We stand with the families bereaved and damaged as a consequences of these actions. They have a right to know what happened. They have a right to justice, regardless of whether the murderers were British soldiers, republicans or loyalists.\"\nNorthern Ireland Veterans' Commissioner Danny Kinahan said the reports contain nothing new from what was previously reported on UK government plans to deal with the past. \nHe said veterans wanted clarity on what would happen regarding potential cases involving them.\n\"An amnesty is a really hard one for everybody. If you can't investigate why are we spending fortunes on lawyers to get no prosecutions?,\" he said on Good Morning Ulster.\n\"We should be concentrating on the families and reconciliation and finding a way forward instead of taking things to court.\"\nIn a statement on Thursday night, he said the collapse of the trial of soldiers A and C this week was proof that the system did not work. \nHe said veterans wanted an end to the \"moral equivalence\" between themselves and those who carried out terrorism.\n\"I want to see veterans treated with the respect they deserve, as they bore the brunt of terrorism and all its horrors, and did so on behalf of us all,\" he added.\nSecretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis met Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney on Wednesday in Dublin.\nA spokesman for his department confirmed that Mr Coveney was given no advance knowledge of any such proposal.\nIn a statement, the Irish government added: \"We reiterated that only through a collective approach can we deal with these issues comprehensively and fairly in a way that responds to the needs of victims, survivors and society as a whole.\n\"Victims and their families are the only priority.\"\nA UK government spokesperson added: \"We want to deal with the past in a way that helps society in Northern Ireland to look forward rather than back. \n\"It is clear to all that the current system for dealing with the legacy of the Troubles is not working for anyone, failing to bring satisfactory outcomes for families, placing a heavy burden on the criminal justice system, and leaving society in Northern Ireland hamstrung by its past.\"\nSpeaking on BBC NI's The View, former victims' commissioner Judith Thompson said the a move would bring more legal challenges, and more suffering.\n\"Everybody, including victims and survivors, want to move forward into a better future,\" she said.\n\"But you don't deal with something by saying 'that's it, line drawn'. We've tried that again, and again. It does not work.\n\"You need due process that actually engages with families, shows them that someone cares to properly investigate the truth of what happened to them.\"\nAmnesty International said no one can be above the law or beyond accountability. \n\"This reported plan is an insult to victims on all sides and the latest gross betrayal of victims who remain determined to seek the truth, justice and accountability to which they are entitled,\" said Grainne Teggart, the organisation's Northern Ireland campaign manager.\n\"We urge the government to abandon this offensive plan and revert to the UK's commitments to deliver mechanisms capable of vindicating the rights of victims.\"\nFour former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles are currently facing prosecution.\nIn 2019, the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) in Northern Ireland said of 32 \"legacy cases\" it had ruled on since 2012, 17 related to republicans, eight to loyalists, and five were connected to the Army."

      "text": "Childish Gambino is being sued for copyright infringement over his Grammy Award-winning rap song This Is America.\nEmelike Nwosuocha, a rapper who performs as Kidd Wes, claims the song copied his track Made In America, which was released two years earlier.\nThe \"lyrical theme, content and structure\" of the two songs' choruses are \"glaringly similar\", he said in court documents filed in New York.\nChildish Gambino, aka Donald Glover, has yet to respond to the claims.\nIn 2019, This Is America made history by becoming the first rap track to win song of the year at the Grammy Awards.\nOne of the most-discussed and powerful songs of the year, it delivered a scathing message about racial inequality, police brutality and gun violence, which was amplified by its provocative music video.\nHowever, in court documents, Nwosuocha said there was a \"substantial similarity\" between Glover's track and his own.\nHe claimed the songs shared a \"distinct and unique vocal cadence, delivery, rhythm, timing [and] phrasing\", and noted how the choruses of Made In America and This Is America were written in the same metre.\nNwosuocha alleged that the similarity in lyrical content and delivery was \"striking to an extent beyond coincidence\" and \"audible to the average lay person\". \nThe rapper also employed a musicologist to compare the two tracks, who concluded that \"these similarities are likely not coincidences\", the court documents said.\nNwosuocha is demanding a trial and is seeking damages including lost profits and opportunities. While no sum is mentioned, he claimed that Glover and his co-writers made \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" from This Is America.\nHis legal case also named Childish Gambino's record label, RCA, Roc Nation and Young Thug, who performed backing vocals on the track.\nHowever, it is not the first time that Glover has been accused of plagiarising This Is America.\nIn 2018, a hip-hop blogger named Akademiks noted a similarity between the song and American Pharaoh by New York rapper Jase Harley.\nHowever, Harley said he had no interest in pursuing legal action. \"I feel extremely humbled to be recognised and labelled as one of, or the original inspiration, for one of the most important pieces of music and visual art of our time,\" he posted on Instagram.\n\"I appreciate all the love and support! But please don't let this controversy dilute the message me and Childish Gambino are trying to convey.\"\nChildish Gambino's manager Fam Udeorji rejected the claims of plagiarism, saying his client's song actually dated back to 2015, \"and we have the Pro Tools [computer] files to prove it\".\nIf so, the song would also pre-date Nwosuocha's Made In America, which he first posted on SoundCloud in September 2016.\nThe BBC has contacted Childish Gambino's team for a response.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Prices for international travel are set to rise this year due to pent-up demand and fewer aeroplanes in service, a travel boss has warned.\nBooking.com's chief executive Glenn Fogel told the BBC that holiday \"prices are already going up\". \nMany airlines have significantly reduced the number of flights they operate due to travel restrictions.\nHowever, Tui's UK boss Andrew Flintham said it would be \"a long time\" before holiday firms try to boost profits.\nMr Fogel said that despite huge demand, uncertainty makes it hard for airlines to plan bringing more planes back into service.\n\"There's so much pent-up demand,\" said Mr Fogel. \"Everybody wants to go travelling, but we all want to do it safely.\"\nJohn Grant, an aviation analyst with global travel data provider OAG said this will have a knock-on impact on air fares as travel restrictions are eased. \n\"That will, in the short term, create a rush of pent-up demand and revenge spending,\" he said.\n\"In turn, the airline algorithms will detect an uptick in demand and move prices up accordingly\".\nThe government will shortly announce which foreign destinations holidaymakers from England can visit from 17 May without needing to quarantine on their return.\nAir fares to Portugal - which is expected to be on the green list - have already started to rise as airlines respond to higher demand.\nAccording to PA, British Airways is charging \u00a3530 for a flight from Heathrow to the Algarve on 17 May, compared with \u00a3276 two days earlier.\nA Ryanair flight from Stansted to Lisbon costs \u00a3262 on 19 May, PA found, more than double the price of \u00a3128 on 14 May.\nBut Tui's managing director for the UK and Ireland, Andrew Flintham, told BBC Breakfast travel firms were unlikely to push up prices anytime soon.\n\"Our prices are very, very stable. They're pretty much like for like, flat, year over year. There isn't a big increase in there.\n\"We've got plenty of holidays to sell. I think everybody in the industry has.\n\"It'll be a long time before the idea of trying to increase prices to make more money. We want to get people away on holiday, having a great time, because we think they genuinely all deserve it.\"\nA lack of clarity about how governments will go about recognising vaccine and testing statuses from other countries is troubling the travel industry, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.\nMr Fogel believes a single system would be helpful: \"So many different people in so many different governments are talking about different programmes, but right now, there is nothing out there that is unified, so it's very confusing. \n\"I listened to the prime minister of Italy saying how they want to let people into Italy soon and you just have to prove that you have a vaccine and it'd be great. \n\"And my thinking is, well, I have my vaccine myself, but how do I prove it? Do I just bring my little white card that I got in the US that said I got it, is that going to be good enough? We need some clarifications.\"\nSeveral systems are being explored, including the International Air Transport Association (IATA)'s travel pass, which is being trialled by a number of airlines.\nMeanwhile, the European Union is working on having a digital pass ready in time for the summer holidays.\nThe idea of a scheme that allows passengers who have had the vaccine to travel has proved divisive.  \nThe UK equality watchdog recently warned it could create a \"two-tier society, whereby only certain groups are able to fully enjoy their rights\". \nThat's a view supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) but Mr Fogel disagrees.\n\"It's true that if you're not vaccinated, you may not be able to enter a country under this type of a system,\" he said.\n\"But I'm okay with that. Because the alternative is what - nobody gets to go in? That doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\" \nHe added that there are countries that people cannot go into if they don't have proof of vaccination against yellow fever, for example. \n\"There's nothing wrong with using technology to prove you are a safe traveller that can help get the industry up faster,\" said Mr Fogel.\nThe lack of clarity has hurt the finances of Booking.com's US owner Booking Holdings, which also owns Kayak and rentalcars.com. \nRevenues for the three months to the end of March fell to $1.1bn (\u00a3790m) - 50% lower than the same period a year ago.\nFigures from the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) reflect a similar picture across the industry, showing tourism's value to the global economy fell from nearly $9.2tn in 2019 to $4.7tn in 2020.  \nAs a share of the global economy that equates to a fall from 10.4% to just 5.5%.\nBut Mr Fogel, who is chief executive of both the Dutch-based Booking.com and its parent firm Booking Holdings, told investors that there is still reason to be optimistic things will improve.\n\"While the pace of vaccine distribution remains frustratingly slow in most places around the world, Israel, the UK and the US are benefiting from successful vaccine distribution programs,\" he said.\n\"In each of these countries, we have seen encouraging booking trends, which supports our view that vaccine distribution is key to unlocking pent-up travel demand.\""

      "text": "A father and a student campaigner are seeking a High Court hearing to consider whether the government should tighten youngsters' access to porn.\nIoannis Dekas and Ava Vakil want the government to implement proof of age for access to pornography promised in the 2017 Digital Economy Act.\nIt comes as new research suggests the majority of 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK have recently seen pornography.\nThe government is currently preparing a new Online Harms Bill.\nThis bill would go further than the Digital Economy Act, giving the watchdog, Ofcom, powers to block access to online services - including social media platforms and search engines - which fail to do enough to protect children. \nIt is expected to be put before Parliament later this year.\nIoannis Dekas, a father of four sons, became concerned after he found one of his boys had accessed pornography.\nHe said this was a wake-up call for him and his wife as parents, making them confront the potential danger to their son and the impact on them all as a family.\n\"In the two weeks leading up to this moment, we'd noticed a drastic change in his behaviour, withdrawal, a sense of anger towards his siblings, we could sense frustration in his life.\"\nWhen he and his wife talked to their son, they found he was under peer pressure to be familiar with the language of porn.\n\"What I don't often hear is how to deal with this. What happens in your household when this happens? With the availability, it's not a matter of if, but of when.\"\nMr Dekas wants the government to put in place the age verification requirements set out in part three of the Digital Economy Act - a law that was passed in 2017.\nHowever, in 2019, the then Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan said the measures would no longer go ahead, with efforts instead focused on the government's wider Online Harms Bill.\nBut Mr Dekas says that this bill still has to be brought before Parliament, and may be delayed if detailed regulations need to be drawn up.\nIn the meantime, children are being exposed to pornography, he says, when they could be protected using the Digital Economy Act's full powers.\nMr Dekas is bringing the challenge jointly with 20-year-old University of Oxford student Ava Vakil, whose letter about what she described as a culture of sexual violence in some schools went viral online.\nMs Vakil told the BBC: \"I think porn is everywhere, and growing up as a young woman I've seen the influence of that. \n\"I think young men are ingesting pornography online to an extent that people aren't aware of.\n\"I'm sure everyone, and particularly young women, can look back on so many conversations they've had with boyfriends and male friends and think 100% it was impacted by porn.\"\nThe Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it would not be appropriate to comment on legal proceedings.\nA spokesman said the government was committed to protecting children from harmful content.\nThe legal action comes as research from City, University of London found many teenagers had seen porn. \nProf Neil Thurman conducted a survey of more than 1,000 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK, using a panel from the specialist market research company Youthsite.\nWhile 63% said they came across porn on social media, 47% said they had also visited porn websites. \nThe research suggests the government's approach of widening the range of legislation to more platforms is right, Prof Thurman said. \nMore worryingly, 46% had used technology that disguises identity when browsing online, such as a virtual private network, and which could allow evasion of age verification.\nHowever, Prof Thurman said this was not a reason not to regulate access.\n\"It doesn't mean we shouldn't bring in legislation,\" he said. \"Firstly I think it would reduce accidental exposure, particularly for younger children and teenagers, and it does send a signal, not present at the moment, that they are accessing something inappropriate for their age group.\"\nVanessa Morse, head of the Centre to End All Sexual Exploitation, said there was a \"wealth of evidence\" to show that viewing pornography led to harmful sexual attitudes and behaviours. \n\"The government's own research, which it published this year, showed an association between porn consumption and real world violence against women. It's no surprise considering one in eight porn videos contains sexual violence,\" she said. \n\"Pornography has made violent acts in sex completely normalised.\"\nA new report by the internet safety body, Internet Matters, looking at children's use of technology during lockdown has found that although the internet had a positive impact on how children learn and socialise, parents also reported a rise in the amount of online harms children experienced. \nA survey of 2,000 parents in the UK in March this year suggests a 39% increase in the sharing of sexual images among children since January 2020. \nPsychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos, ambassador of Internet Matters, says \"as children have come to rely on technology more than ever during the pandemic, and therefore spending sometimes several hours a day online, it also gives them increased exposure to all of the risks that go with it.\"\n"

      "text": "Almost all of 50 of the UK's biggest employers questioned by the BBC have said they do not plan to bring staff back to the office full-time.\nSome 43 of the firms said they would embrace a mix of home and office working, with staff encouraged to work from home two to three days a week. \nFour firms said they were keeping the idea of hybrid working, working from home some of the time, under review.\nCurrently, people who can work from home are still advised to do so.\nHowever, that is likely to change in June when the government hopes to end all social distancing restrictions. \n\"We're never going to go back to working the way we used to work,\" said Mark Read, chief executive of advertising firm WPP.\nBut the new ways of using the office require careful planning, he told the BBC. \n\"People are working from home three to four days a week so we probably need 20% less space, but we're not going to do that if everyone's working from home on Mondays and Fridays.\" \nOther companies cite \"smart working\" and \"flexibility\" as reasons for introducing hybrid working, with many suggesting that workers would be able to make their own choices about how often they come into the office. \nDanny Harmer, chief people officer at insurance giant Aviva - which has 16,000 UK workers - said 95% of its workers said they would like to be able to spend some of their time working flexibly and remotely in different locations.\nBut she said the company had to be mindful that many staff appreciate being in an office, such as those who live alone or do not have a suitable place to work.\nRecruitment firm Adecco, which has 34,000 workers, said about four-fifths of its staff now work remotely. \n\"Rather than having pre-set rules we are encouraging our leaders to engage with colleagues to implement strategies that work for their business,\" it said. \nThe BBC questioned 50 big employers, ranging from banks to retailers, to get an idea of when workers may return to the office. \nThe firms contacted by the BBC covered 1.1 million workers in the UK.  \nBusinesses that depend on custom from office workers - such as cafes and restaurants - are keen for them to return as soon as possible. \n\"We rely really heavily on the office trade,\" Joao Almeida, of Panda Cup Coffee in London's Blackfriars, told the BBC. He was one of millions of people unable to work from home during the pandemic.\n\"There are locations that have 5,000 people, but only 140 come to the building with most working from home or maybe once a week coming in. That makes it really difficult.\" \nCarl Forder, who owns the Pottergate Pantry sandwich shop in Norwich. saw an 80% drop in business when workers, including 5,000 at the nearby Aviva office, were told to work from home where possible.\n\"We really hope a lot more office workers return to Norwich when it's safe for them to do so.\n\"It affects a lot of businesses, from the cleaners who clean the offices, right through to coffee shops and sandwich bars. We want that buzz back again.\"\nBut in the financial services industry it can be a problem if people work from home, reckons Andrew Monk, chief executive of investment bank VSA Capital. \n\"People working from home don't realise it but they're gradually getting slower and slower whereas the people in the office aren't,\" he told BBC Radio Five Live. \n\"In the financial services industry you need to discuss ideas and discuss what's going on. People working from home miss out on an awful lot of the activity in the office because we don't have time to tell them.\" \nBut there may not be a deluge of workers returning this month.  \nThe companies told the BBC they were opening offices \"in line with government guidance\", which means many plan to reopen offices from 21 June. \nSome have already reopened their offices to a limited number of workers. \nInvestment firm JP Morgan and recruiter Michael Page allowed workers to return from 29 March, while Adecco, recruiter Hays Group and WPP reopened offices on 12 April. \nInvestment firm Rathbones has allowed workers to return \"if they wish\", subject to a 25% capacity. \nWPP reopened its UK offices at a 30% capacity, but is increasing that to 50% this month. \nMany have given workers the choice, with Michael Page saying staff could return to the office \"should they choose to do so\". \nBut some other companies are delaying their office re-opening plans. \nOutsourcing giant Capita said workers have been told they will work from home until at least the end of June, while Lloyds Bank has asked staff to stay at home until at least the summer. \nTom, who works in property, is not looking forward to going back to the office. The commute is long, expensive, uncomfortable and unnecessary, he told the BBC. \n\"My office is modern and seemingly comfortable. But the culture can be difficult and the false familiarity is suffocating. It's a petri dish of anxiety and breeding ground of mental health issues.\" \nHe says working at home is more comfortable.  \n\"The technology enables a more inclusive mode of working where information is shared more easily and talent can shine. There's also more time for family and more time for real friends.\" \nIn contrast, David Kimberley said he \"couldn't wait\". He returned to the stockbroker's office he works at two weeks ago.\n\"There's something healthy about having a psychological separation between your work and home life. I find that hard to do when I'm working from home,\" he told the BBC. \n\"There's something quite gloomy, especially in winter, about working from home, and it's depressing waking up and commuting to your kitchen. \n\"It also makes it much harder to collaborate. I work closely with another member of the team and in the office we can sort things out in seconds, When working from home it can take 10 minutes to get a response, and you have no real idea about how they're feeling as you can't see them to gauge their emotions.\" \nOnly a few of the companies surveyed by the BBC have been shutting offices, with some saying they will wait until leases run out. \nCapita has closed 49 out of 294 of its offices since the start of the pandemic while accountants Deloitte has closed offices at Gatwick, Liverpool, Nottingham and Southampton. \nLloyds Bank said it planned to close 20% of its offices over the next three years while NatWest closed its Regent House, London office last summer, in a move that had been planned, but speeded up by the pandemic. \nNewspaper group Reach has closed its district offices as part of a move to a hub-based model. Meanwhile, Welsh Water closed its head office last year. \nBut not all are keen on the move away from offices.  \nWPP boss Mark Read says he worries about the long-term impact on the company's culture and training.\n\"Advertising and creative industries are something you learn from your colleagues and you can only do that, really, if you're around them in an office.\" \nAccounting software firm Sage has just opened a new office - planned before the pandemic - which has space for 1,800 people.\nSage's chief people officer Amanda Cusdin says that despite using a mix of home and office working going forward, the office will still be needed.\n\"We know for a lot of people maybe don't have a quiet space to work at home and would rather do it in the office.\""

      "text": "Nine babies born to a Malian woman will need to spend \"two to three months\" in incubators, a director of the clinic where they were born has said.\nProfessor Youssef Alaoui of the Ain Borja clinic in Casablanca, Morocco, told the AFP news agency that the case was \"extremely rare\" and \"exceptional\".\nThe mother, Halima Ciss\u00e9, 25, and her nonuplets - five girls and four boys - are said to be doing well.\nThe babies weighed between 500g and 1kg (1.1lb and 2.2lb) when they were born.\nMedical director Prof Alaoui said that Ms Ciss\u00e9 was 25 weeks pregnant when she was admitted and his team managed to extend her term to 30 weeks. Ten doctors and 25 paramedics assisted at the delivery.\nAs far as he was aware Ms Ciss\u00e9 had not used any fertility treatments, Prof Alaoui told the Associated Press.\nHe told BBC Arabic that she had been in a serious condition to begin with because of heavy bleeding, which was brought under control.\n\"The mother is now in a good condition she's not in danger any more. We wish her and the babies a speedy recovery,\" he said.\nDoctors in Mali conducted ultrasounds and initially believed that she was expecting seven babies. They sent her to Morocco where there are better medical facilities. \nAfter five weeks at the Moroccan clinic, she gave birth by Caesarean section on Tuesday, Fanta Siby, Mali's health minister said.\nThe minister congratulated the medical teams in Mali and Morocco for the \"happy outcome\".\nMs Ciss\u00e9's husband, Adjudant Kader Arby, is still in Mali with the couple's older daughter. He says he has been in touch with his wife in Morocco and is not worried about the family's future.\n\"God gave us these children. He is the one to decide what will happen to them. I'm not worried about that. When the almighty does something, he knows why,\" he told BBC Afrique.\nTwo sets of nonuplets have previously been recorded - one born to a woman in Australia in 1971 and another to a woman in Malaysia in 1999 - but none of the babies survived more than a few days.\nA woman who had eight babies in the US in 2009 holds the Guinness World Record for the most children delivered at a single birth to survive. Nadya Suleman's octuplets have grown up and are now 12 years old. She conceived them through in vitro fertilisation."

      "tags": "India coronavirus lockdown,Narendra Modi,Oxygen,Delhi,India,International aid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "As India's devastating Covid-19 crisis mounted last month, countries around the world began sending emergency medical supplies to help stem the surge.\nPlaneloads of ventilators, medicines and oxygen equipment began pouring into India, from countries including the UK and the US, at the start of last week. By Sunday, some 300 tonnes of supplies on 25 flights had arrived at Delhi International Airport alone.\nBut - as cases continue to reach record levels across the country - concerns are mounting about delays in supplying the aid to those most in need.\nFor several days, much of the cargo sat in airport hangars as hospitals called for more support. The supplies did not begin being distributed until as late as Monday evening - more than a week after the first batch of emergency assistance arrived, state officials have told local media.\nThe Indian government has strongly denied there is a delay, issuing a statement on Tuesday evening saying it had introduced a \"streamlined and systematic mechanism\" for distributing the supplies. The health ministry said in the statement it was \"working 24x7 to fast track and clear the goods\".\nBut on the ground, officials in some of India's worst-hit states told the BBC that they had still not received any supplies.\nKerala - which recorded a record 37,190 new Covid cases earlier this week - had still not received any aid by Wednesday evening, the state's health secretary, Dr Rajan Khobragade, told the BBC.\nKerala's chief minister, Prinarayi Vijayan, separately called on India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi to \"urgently\" send Kerala some of the country's much-needed oxygen imports. \nHe asked that the equipment \"be allotted to Kerala on a priority basis, considering the fact that Kerala has one of the highest active case loads in the country\", in an open letter to Mr Modi on Wednesday.\nSome healthcare officials claim there has been little to no communication from the central government on how or when they would receive supplies.\n\"There's still no information about where it is being distributed,\" said Dr Harsh Mahajan, the president of the Healthcare Federation of India, which represents some of the country's biggest private hospitals. \n\"It seems people don't know - I've tried two or three places and been unable to find out,\" he added. \"It's still not clear.\"\nSome non-governmental groups involved in responding to the crisis also say they are frustrated by an apparent lack of information.\n\"I don't think anybody has any clarity on where aid is going,\" Pankaj Anand, Oxfam India's director of programme and advocacy, told the BBC. \"There is no tracker on any website giving you an answer.\"\nAn alleged absence of information about the relief distribution effort is raising questions - even in foreign donor countries - about where the aid is going.\nOn Friday, the issue was raised at a US state department briefing, when a reporter demanded \"accountability for the US taxpayers' money\" being sent to India, and asked if the US government was tracking the aid's whereabouts. \n\"Rest assured that the United States is committed to making sure that our partners in India are taken care of in this crisis,\" the state department's spokesperson said in response.\nThe BBC asked the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office if it had any knowledge of where the country's aid - including its shipments of more than 1,000 ventilators - had been distributed.  \nIn response the FCDO said \"the UK has been working with the Indian Red Cross and Government of India to ensure transfer of medical equipment from the UK is as efficient as possible\". \n\"Distribution processes and decisions on exactly where support provided by the UK will be deployed are matters for the Government of India.\"\nOpposition politicians in India have also called for the government to release more information about how its relief effort is going.\"We request and demand from the government... Share it with every Indian: Where has this aid come from, and where is it going?\" said Pawan Khera, a spokesperson for the opposition Congress party. \"You owe it to the public.\"\nIt took the Indian government seven days to create a \"streamlined mechanism\" to distribute supplies to states, according to the health ministry. \nIt began work on the plan on 26 April, and issued its Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) - guidelines on how to distribute aid - on 2 May, it said in a press release. It did not say when aid distribution began.\nEven when shipments land in India, the distribution process is complex - involving various stages, ministries and outside agencies.\nAfter relief flights arrive, aid is received by the Indian Red Cross Society, which is responsible for taking it through customs, according to the government's statement. The shipments are then handed over to another agency, HLL Lifecare, which handles the goods and subsequently transports them across the country. \nBecause supplies are arriving in various forms, authorities have to \"unpack [and] repack\" them before they can be dispatched, further slowing the process, the government admits.\n\"The materials from abroad are currently coming in different numbers, specifications and at different times,\" the government said. \"In many cases the items received are not as per the list, or the quantities differ, which needs reconciling at the airport.\"\nOnce the materials are repacked, they are allocated to areas where \"critical care patients load is high and where the need is highest\".\nDespite the logistical challenges, India's central government says it is \"working 24x7\" to send supplies to strained areas. It said aid had been dispatched to some 38 institutions in 31 states by Tuesday evening.\nOne badly-hit state, Punjab, has received 100 oxygen concentrators and 2,500 doses of the life-saving drug remdesivir, a state official told the BBC on Wednesday.\nThe air force airlifted the \"first batch\" of 450 oxygen cylinders from the UK to Chennai (Madras) in southern Tamil Nadu state on Tuesday, the city's customs authority said on Twitter.\nOf 1,088 oxygen concentrators flown in from Hong Kong, some 738 remained in Delhi while 350 had been sent on Mumbai, a government minister said on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, trainloads of oxygen - nicknamed the \"Oxygen Express\" by officials - are being rushed to Delhi to help ease shortages in its hospitals.\nDespite these efforts, India's hospitals are still in dire need of fresh medical supplies - and above all of oxygen.\nThe country reported a record 412,262 new daily coronavirus cases on Thursday and 3,980 virus-related deaths, the health ministry said. India accounted for nearly half of all reported Covid infections across the world last week, and a quarter of all deaths, according to the World Health Organization.\nYet some healthcare professionals say what they need most urgently are not the foreign donations, but more on-site oxygen production facilities to be built at hospitals.\n\"Right now our only problem is oxygen,\" says Dr Mahajan. \"Even if this aid comes or doesn't come, I don't think it's going to make a substantial difference. The oxygen generators will make the difference. That's what is most essential right now.\"\nTwo freshly installed medical oxygen plants - producing 1,000 litres per minute - would begin pumping supplies to hundreds of Covid-19 patients in Delhi on Wednesday evening, the health ministry said in a tweet.\nBut for many of those on the frontline of India's healthcare emergency, the wait for desperately needed support continues.\n\"It is frustrating,\" Dr Mahajan says. \"We are overwhelmed... this wave has hit us, the incline has hit us - [and] it's like a jet taking off.\"\nAdditional reporting by the BBC's Soutik Biswas and Andrew Clarance in Delhi "

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus vaccines,World Trade Organization,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The US has thrown its support behind a move at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to temporarily lift patent protections for coronavirus vaccines.\nAdvocates of the move say it would increase global vaccine production, but drugs manufacturers argue it will not have the desired effect.\nCritics say it strips financial rewards from cutting-edge drug developers. \nThe decision by US President Joe Biden comes amid pressure from Democrats in his party to remove patent protections.\nIn announcing the new policy, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said that \"extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures\". \nMs Tai said the US would now embark on negotiations at the WTO to try to secure the waiver, but warned this could take time.\nIndia and South Africa were the leading voices in a group of about 60 countries which for the last six months has been trying to get the patents on vaccines set aside. \nOne hundred of the WTO's 164 states are said to be in favour, and a panel on intellectual property is expected to discuss the issue next month. \nIf approved, supporters say, the waiver would allow production of vaccines to be ramped up and provide more affordable doses for less wealthy countries.\nThe countries in favour of the move met with strong opposition from the previous US administration of Donald Trump, the UK and the EU. Mr Biden had proposed a waiver during the 2020 presidential election campaign. \nIntellectual property describes creations, such as inventions, which are protected by patents, copyrights and trademarks. These prevent copying and allow the originator to be financially rewarded.    \nPatents give innovating firms a short-term monopoly on production to cover the costs of development and encourage investment.\nBiotech firms argue that such protection has provided incentives to produce Covid vaccines in record times.\nMany developing countries have argued that rules requiring countries to protect patents and other forms of intellectual property are an obstacle to increasing the production of vaccines and other products needed to tackle the pandemic.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, called the US decision \"historic\" and said it marked \"a monumental moment in the fight against Covid-19\".\nThe medical NGO, MSF - Doctors Without Borders - said the move would \"increase sufficient and timely access to these lifesaving medical tools as Covid-19 continues to ravage countries across the globe.\"\nCalls for a vaccine patent waiver come as lower income countries face acute vaccine shortages.\nMSF points out that many of the low-income states where it operates \"only received 0.3 percent of global Covid-19 vaccine supply while the US has secured enough doses to protect its entire population\".\nIndia, which was shipping vaccines to other countries, has now had to cancel exports as it grapples with surging coronavirus cases and falls behind on its vaccination targets.\nBut pharmaceutical companies have voiced their opposition to a waiver, insisting that patents are not the primary obstacle, and cautioned that the move could stifle innovation.\nThe head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Thomas Cueni, told the BBC's Today programme that technology transfer should not be enforced. \n\"I'm deeply concerned if you hand this over and allow companies to try to get it done the right way, safe and high quality, you could compromise the quality and safety of vaccines which we see now and it would be disruptive.\"\nHe said Western pharmaceutical companies were already sharing technology on a voluntary basis. \n\"The bottlenecks right now are trade barriers, preventing companies from moving their goods from one country to another. It is shortages and scarcity in the supply chains, which need to be addressed. And it is also right now the disappointing unwillingness of rich countries to early share doses with the poor countries. \n\"None of this is addressed with the patent waiver.\" \nDr Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the Reuters news agency that the waiver \"amounts to the expropriation of the property of the pharmaceutical companies whose innovation and financial investments made the development of Covid-19 vaccines possible in the first place\".\nNobody is protected until everyone's protected: on that world and business leaders are agreed.\nBut pharmaceutical companies have called the decision by the US to back the sharing of secret recipes for vaccinations short-sighted, claiming it is understanding the production process that is the real challenge, particularly when it comes to the new breed of mRNA vaccines - such as Pfizer and Moderna - as well as the availability of raw materials. \nIt is, they say, akin to handing out a recipe without sharing the method or the ingredients, and could lead to quality issues and less efficient production.\nInstead, the UK and the EU have favoured a system of licensing, whereby know-how is shared and there is more oversight. It is already being done on some cases on a voluntary basis - such as the tie up between Oxford AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India. And that licensing can be made compulsory, although the pharmaceutical companies could then be eligible for compensation. \nSome trade specialists have speculated that the US might be hoping that, by backing a lifting of patents, manufacturers might be more open to sharing expertise voluntarily - or at least, for a reduced charge. \nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"the EU is also ready to discuss any proposals that address the crisis in an effective and pragmatic manner\".\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has changed his position, now saying he is \"absolutely in favour\".  \nA UK government spokesperson said the UK was \"working with WTO members to resolve this issue\" and was \"in discussions with the US and WTO members to facilitate increased production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines\". \nThe head of the World Health Organization called the US announcement a \"monumental moment\" in the fight against Covid-19. \nThe prospect of a waiver hit shares in the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax. \nSome experts say pharmaceutical companies would also need to share know-how, such as production techniques, with poorer countries to have any real beneficial effect. \nLicensing agreements are another way of boosting production. \nOne of the largest Covid vaccine producers is the Serum Institute of India which manufactures the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab under a licensing agreement with the Anglo-Swedish company.

      "tags": "Elgin,Lossiemouth,Coronavirus testing,Buckie,Coronavirus pandemic,Keith",
      "text": "Moray is experiencing \"uncontrolled, sustained community transmission\" of Covid-19, public health officials have warned.\nChris Littlejohn, deputy director of public health at NHS Grampian, said the situation was \"rapidly deteriorating\".\nThe region currently has an infection rate of more than 81 cases per 100,000 - four times the Scotland-wide level.\nMr Littlejohn said there would be deaths if the outbreak could not be controlled.\nCovid hospital admissions in NHS Grampian have been mainly rising since mid-April.\n\"We are urging everyone to protect Moray and get tested, even if they have no symptoms,\" Mr Littlejohn said.\n\"We hope that by intervening further now we can avoid the possibility of further restrictions or a continuation of level three in Moray - but we need to act now and we need the people of Moray to act with us.\"\nMr Littlejohn said the current Covid restrictions in Moray were not working to contain the number of cases.\n\"We are seeing hospitalisations from this - including in the under 50s - and we will see deaths, if the situation is not brought under control,\" he said.\nAll of Scotland is due to move to level two on 17 May, but Moray could remain in level three if cases do not begin to go down.\nThe situation in Moray is a test of Scotland's much enhanced Test and Protect system.  Mobile units and surge testing have been used in other areas but here they are dealing with a series of unrelated clusters and community transmission. \nActively encouraging people to come forward will root out cases in asymptomatic people that may previously have gone undetected. It does mean the numbers in Moray are likely to remain higher for a while longer. \nThe key will be how much pressure does it put on hospitals? The vaccine has proven to be effective but there are still many people to get either a first or second dose. Officials will be watching carefully. \nOn Wednesday there were 17 Covid patients in NHS Grampian hospitals - higher than any other health board - though this figure dropped to 11 on Thursday.\nHealth officials have pinpointed Elgin as the \"epicentre\" of the outbreak, but rising levels are also being seen in Lossiemouth, Buckie and Keith.\nMobile testing units are being sent to the area and door-to-door testing is being considered in Elgin.\nMr Littlejohn added: \"Since 10 April we have seen 210 cases in Moray. More than half of those have come in the last eight days alone. This is a rapidly accelerating situation. \n\"Test positivity in Moray is at 3.2% - across Scotland that figure is close to just 1% - and the R-rate in Moray is at 1.8, so every person in Moray that becomes infected is, on average, passing it on to two other people.\"\n\"Analytics have shown us many people in the region have returned to their workplaces, rather than working from home. It remains the advice people should work from home where possible and we really need people to do that, where they can.\"\nOn Wednesday, NHS Grampian announced that 48 Covid cases were being linked to Elgin Academy, but parents were assured that it was still safe to send their children there. \nJillian Evans, the head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said the health board was expecting cases to rise still further in the coming days.\nShe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the cases were not the result of just \"one or two people\" not following the guidelines.\n\"This is something much more widespread in the community which is why we need such targeted action and people to really to take up their guard, to try to do their best particularly as we start to think about easing restrictions further,\" she said.\n\"When you see a big drop in infection rates it's usually the result of a lockdown situation. We're not talking about doing that, of course not, but we are thinking very carefully about what this means for easing restrictions further.\n\"It would seem wrong to consider moving down a level while you've got infection rates that continue to rise.\"\nDr Evans also confirmed that a number of the recent NHS Grampian hospital admissions were Moray residents and that the increase in admissions was \"more than we would expect\".\nThe Moray Chamber of Commerce said the rise in Covid cases was \"worrying\" as businesses in the area were looking forward to a further easing of restrictions.\nIn a statement, the chamber added: \"It is crucial that everyone follows the guidelines to protect the NHS and help to contain and bring the case numbers down so we can move to level two along with the rest of Scotland.\n\"Being able to trade brings a glimmer of hope that together we can push through this towards something resembling normality.\""

      "tags": "Scottish Parliament election 2021,Scottish Parliament",
      "text": "The SNP has won three key seats but its hopes of securing an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament election remain on a knife edge. \nThe party has taken both Edinburgh Central - where former MP Angus Robertson was standing for the SNP - and Ayr from the Conservatives.\nIt also won the East Lothian seat from Labour.\nBut it fell short in other targets, with counting in the remaining seats due to resume on Saturday.\nNo other constituencies have changed hands so far, with the SNP currently on 39 seats, the Liberal Democrats four, Tories two and Labour one.\nBut the opposition parties will see their number of seats increase dramatically once the regional list results are finalised on Saturday.\nPolling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said it was now unlikely, but not impossible, that the SNP would achieve an overall majority in the new Holyrood parliament.\nAnd he said there were clear signs that tactical voting by pro-UK voters in some parts of the country had been successful. \nThe Alba Party, which was founded by former first minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond, looks unlikely to win any seats.\nClick or tap to explore results\nAs the count resumed on Saturday, Aberdeenshire East was first to declare with the SNP's Gillian Martin holding her seat with a reduced majority of 1,889 over the Scottish Conservatives - who increased their vote share by 11%. \nFriday's results included First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - the SNP leader - easily holding off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency. \nMs Sturgeon won by 9,456 votes, only marginally lower than the 9,593 she won by in 2016.\nTurnout has been higher than anticipated in many areas, with the SNP's share of the vote falling in many of the early constituencies to declare but increasing in others. \nMs Sturgeon said that the SNP \"appears to be on course for a fourth consecutive election victory and to be on course to have the privilege of forming a government again\".\nShe pledged to \"get back to work immediately\" and lead the country's Covid recovery.\n\"And then, when the time is right, to offer this country the choice of a better future,\" she added.\nIt comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested he would reject any calls for a second independence referendum, saying it would be \"irresponsible and reckless\" right now.\nAsked if an SNP majority would mean there was a mandate for another vote, he told the Daily Telegraph: \"I think that count is still taking place and we'll have to see what happens. I listened to the Scottish election carefully. My impression was that they [the SNP] moved away from the idea of a referendum, and I think very wisely. \n\"I don't think this is anything like the time to have more constitutional wrangling, to be talking about ripping our country apart, when actually people want to heal our economy and bounce forward together. That's what people want.\"\nHowever deputy first minister John Swinney told BBC Breakfast that his party would legislate for a second referendum if Mr Johnson were to block one.\nHe said: \"We've said we will take forward legislation to have a legal referendum - we already have put in place some of the legislative arrangements for that process. We will embark on such an agenda should there be a majority for such a proposition in the Scottish Parliament.\"\nMr Swinney said that although he was waiting to see the \"electoral arithmetic\" of the final results, he was \"very confident\" there would be a majority of candidates \"elected on a programme to deliver a referendum on independence\".\nThis election has a long way to go with a further 26 constituencies and all 56 regional list seats still to declare. \nWhile the SNP is on course to finish as the largest party, there are only limited opportunities left for them to do so with an overall majority. \nTo achieve that they really need to hold all they have and pick up an additional constituency seat like Aberdeenshire West, where the Conservatives are defending a majority of 900 votes. \nThere is also a possible pathway if they do better than expected on the regional lists which are very hard to predict because of the proportional voting system. \nIf the SNP fall short of that outright majority they could enter a fourth term in office as a minority government (as they are now) or seek a more formal arrangement with another party - most likely the Greens. \nTogether the SNP and the Greens will almost certainly have a pro-independence majority at Holyrood - committed to holding another referendum that the UK government seems determined to resist. \nA big wrangle over indyref2 is coming and it could end up in the UK Supreme Court. \nThe constituencies that declared on Friday included eight of the SNP's top 10 target seats.\nThe Conservatives held Dumfriesshire, which had been one of the SNP's goals, with Oliver Mundell increasing his majority, while Jackson Carlaw held the marginal Eastwood seat for the Tories from the SNP.\nAnd Labour's Daniel Johnson held off the SNP challenge in Edinburgh Southern and the party's deputy leader Jackie Baillie increased her majority over the SNP in Dumbarton. \nThe election is seen as being crucial to the future of the UK as the result could impact on whether or not there is a second referendum on Scottish independence.\nThe SNP - which has formed the devolved Scottish government since 2007 -  will once again finish as the largest party, but is seeking to win an overall majority to strengthen the case for indyref2.\nAlthough it is not yet clear that it will win a majority by itself, there is likely to be a pro-independence majority in the parliament once the Scottish Greens are allocated regional list seats on Saturday.\nThe coronavirus pandemic meant that traditional overnight counting was impossible, with the results instead being announced over the course of Friday and Saturday.\nA record number of people had already cast their ballots by post before the polls opened on Thursday morning - with more than a million having registered  for postal ballots.\nOther elections also took place across the UK on Thursday, including for the Welsh Parliament, 143 English councils and 13 local mayors, as well as a by-election for the Westminster seat of Hartlepool in the north east of England - which was won by the Conservatives from Labour.\nSIGN UP FOR SCOTLAND ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage"

We'll have another update for you on Friday morning.\nThe UK economy is set to expand at the fastest rate since World War Two as Covid-19 restrictions are lifted, the Bank of England says. It is expected to grow by 7.25% this year, with extra government spending helping limit job losses. It follows a contraction of 9.9% in 2020, the biggest for 300 years. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey says while the growth is \"good news\" it is \"more of a bounce back\" than a boom and will only see the economy recover to 2019 levels.\nThe NHS is revising the booking system for Covid-19 jabs in England after complaints that it could reveal individuals' vaccination status. By entering details such as a person's name, date of birth and postcode it may be possible to work out how many doses they have had as the website gives a different result. NHS Digital said the system had no direct access to medical records but privacy campaigners Big Brother Watch called it a \"shocking failure\".\nDuring England's coronavirus vaccine programme an inequality has shown itself, with black people less likely to have had the jab than any other group. By April, 64% of black over-50s had been vaccinated compared with 93% of white people of the same age. The reasons for this are complex with unethical medical treatment in the past, ongoing discrimination and personal experiences of insensitive treatment by the NHS all believed to play a part. Doctors, researchers and campaigners who spoke to the BBC said they feared black communities were being blamed. You can read more on this issue here.\nThe world's oldest person will not take part in the Olympic torch relay because she is worried about spreading Covid-19 to others in her nursing home. Kane Tanaka, 118, was supposed to take part in the relay for Tokyo 2020 in Fukuoka, southern Japan, on 11 May. She has joined several others in pulling out of the relay, which started in March, over concerns about the virus. The event, which builds up to the start of the Games, has been hit by a coronavirus outbreak with eight cases linked to it.\nMany of us took on lockdown projects over the past year but not many can claim to have uncovered a lost golf course. That's what Chris Powell did when he started clearing bracken on common land near Rhayader, Powys. The nine-hole golf course was designed in 1920s by Dr Alister MacKenzie, who was also responsible for courses including Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, and had been unused for decades. Mr Powell said he spent the \"best part of 1,000 hours\" playing or clearing the course.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nAnd with companies starting to think about getting workers back into the office you might want to know whether you can ask to keep working from home and if it is safe to return to the commute.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos is now ready to take people into space.\nThe US entrepreneur's Blue Origin company says it will launch a crew aboard its New Shepard rocket and capsule system on 20 July.\nThe astronauts are likely to include company personnel, but one seat is being auctioned online.\nNew Shepard's flights are sub-orbital. They're designed to take passengers on a straight up-and-down trip that briefly goes above 100km (62 miles).\nThis is the so-called K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Line, which has been designated by broad international agreement as the starting point of space.\n\"Only 569 people have ever been over the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Line. With our New Shepard vehicle, we're about to change that and change it dramatically,\" said Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin's director of astronaut sales.\nShe declined to comment on whether Mr Bezos himself might be on the 20 July flight. \nBlue Origin's announcement is further evidence of a resurgence in space tourism after a gap of almost 12 years.\nMr Bezos's proposition is just one of several now open to the super wealthy. Rival businessman Elon Musk is expected to launch one of his SpaceX Dragonships in the autumn with an all-civilian crew aboard. It will go orbital; the capsule will stay up for several days.\nAt 18m in height and 4m wide, New Shepard is a fully reusable, vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) space vehicle. \nIt operates from desert land in Van Horn in West Texas.\nDuring a flight, the booster unit lifts the pressurised passenger vessel to about 76km in altitude, where the pair then separate.\nMomentum carries the capsule on upwards into space, before dropping back down to the ground under three parachutes. The booster also comes home in a controlled manner, making a propulsive landing on a concrete pad. \nBlue Origin is hoping the New Shepard experience will prove a big draw. Passengers will experience about three minutes of weightlessness at the top of the climb. They'll also get to see the blackness of space and Earth's curved horizon.\nFor the moment, the company is not discussing future pricing options - just the details of the public auction for one seat on that first mission in two months' time. Blue Origin says the cash raised from this particular sale will go to its foundation that promotes science and technology education. \nBut long-term, the company could expect to earn perhaps $200,000 (\u00a3143,780) per seat, maybe even more initially.  \n\"This is a nascent market,\" said Ms Cornell. \"We're opening the doors and look forward to seeing what the market says. \n\"I personally think people are going to see what a cool experience this is and are going to want to do it themselves. And then, as hopefully the prices come down, the scale goes up.\" \nThroughout the 2000s a number of high-value individuals paid to visit the International Space Station (ISS). But this tourism, organised under the patronage of the Russian space agency, ceased in 2009.\nNow, it seems, the sector is being rekindled. As well as the initiatives from Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson continues to push his Virgin Galactic rocket plane concept. There are also those who want to launch private space stations this decade. Among these is Axiom, a company started by a former Nasa ISS programme manager.\nBlue Origin's announcement was timed to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the first spaceflight made by an American astronaut - Alan Shepard, in whose honour the new tourist vehicle is named.\nAlan Shepard conducted a 15-minute sub-orbital flight in his Project Mercury Freedom-7 capsule on 5 May, 1961."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPolls have opened on what is the Britain's biggest voting day since the 2019 general election. Many of the elections - on what has been dubbed \"Super Thursday\" - were due to be held last year but the pandemic forced their delay, meaning that more than usual are taking place this time. Elections for the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Senedd, and 143 councils and 13 mayors in England are happening. A Westminster by-election is also taking place in Hartlepool.\nThe US has thrown its support behind an initiative at the World Trade Organization to waive intellectual property protections for coronavirus vaccines. India and South Africa put forward the proposal to set aside patents on vaccines six months ago, arguing it would increase production around the world. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said \"extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures\". But pharmaceutical companies insist patents are not the primary obstacle, and cautioned that the move could stifle innovation. \nAlmost all of 50 of the UK's biggest employers questioned by the BBC have said they do not plan to bring staff back to the office full-time. Some 43 of the firms said they would embrace a mix of home and office working, with staff encouraged to work from home two to three days a week. Four firms said they were keeping the idea of hybrid working, working from home some of the time, under review. Currently, people who can work from home are still advised to do so.\nAs the pandemic starts to ease, Dr Dan Gearon and many other doctors across the country are voicing the need to have better mental health services for medics. He created the charity, You Okay, Doc? after his cousin Liz, who was an anaesthetist at King's College London, took her own life in 2016.\nLike many people, Chloe Dickenson's travel plans ground to a halt last year when the world was thrown into lockdown. A so-called \"digital nomad\", the 22-year-old was living and working from her laptop overseas. With improved wi-fi and flexible workspaces across the globe, digital nomadism has boomed over recent years. And while the global travel restrictions have temporarily grounded many such nomads, longer term the movement is expected to grow much further.

      "tags": "Companies,Flexible working,KPMG",
      "text": "Accountancy giant KPMG has told its 16,000 staff they can leave early one day a week as part of a move towards more flexible working after lockdown.\nIt said staff will work at KPMG offices four days each fortnight, with the rest of the time at home or client sites.\nStaff will also get an extra two-and-a-half-hours off per week in the summer to \"promote wellbeing\" if they complete their normal 35 hours of work. \nKPMG's move is another example of big firms overhauling home-office life.  \nJon Holt, chief executive at KPMG UK, said: \"We trust our people. Our new way of working will empower them and enable them to design their own working week. The pandemic has proven it's not about where you work, but how you work.  \n\"We have listened to our people and designed this strategy around our staff and how they can best support our clients.\"  \nKPMG UK head Bill Michael resigned in February after reports that he told staff to \"stop moaning\" about the impact of Covid-19 on their lives. He was replaced by Mr Holt.\nKPMG said the plan is being introduced in response to feedback from staff who have said that they would feel comfortable spending most of their time at home.  \nIn a staff\u202fsurvey\u202fconducted in\u202fMarch,\u202f87% of respondents said they liked\u202fnot having to commute, 76% enjoyed\u202fthe greater flexibility working from home offers, and 65% felt\u202fthey now had a better work-life balance.\u202f \nEmployees who have to attend offices for work, meetings or training that need to be held in person, will not have to stay for the whole day. \nKPMG said it would spend \u00a344m during 2021 on new home-working technology and introducing more collaborative spaces at offices.\nMr Holt added:\u202f \"Our offices will become a place people go to collaborate\u202fand learn.\u202fThe consequence of the pandemic means we\u202fhave a whole\u202fcohort\u202fof people who have never been in the office\u202fand\u202fnever been coached face-to-face\u202f-\u202fwe need to get those connections back.\u202f\u202f \n\"Our new\u202fstrategy for the future of work\u202fwill enable\u202four people to\u202freconnect and test our new ways of hybrid working. This is all about flexibility.\"\nSeveral big UK employers are introducing flexible working, including HSBC, British Airways and BP. In March, Nationwide building society said it would allow its 13,000 office staff to \"choose where they work\" - offices, homes or High Street branches.\nSome 36% of employees in Britain did at least some work from home last year as the coronavirus outbreak closed many workplaces, a jump from around 26% in 2019, the Office for National Statistics said in April."

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon was involved in a tense confrontation with a far-right candidate as she visited a polling station in the south of Glasgow.\nThe SNP leader was praised on social media for how she handled an approach from a former deputy leader of Britain First.\nJayda Fransen accused Ms Sturgeon of \"flooding\" the country with immigrants.\nFootage posted online showed the first minister call Ms Fransen \"a fascist and a racist\".\nMs Fransen, who has convictions for religiously aggravated harassment, is an independent candidate in Glasgow Southside, the same constituency  as Nicola Sturgeon.\nOn Thursday evening, a video was widely shared on social media showing Ms Fransen approach Ms Sturgeon in the street. \nShe said: \"What are you sorry for? Mass immigration, Marxism?\n\"I'm not a fascist. I've been on the ground speaking to locals who say you are an absolute disgrace ...\"\nMs Sturgeon said: \"We'll see what the locals' view is later on.\"\nMs Fransen said: \"The locals, what the ones you have flooded from other countries?\n\"The decent people of Scotland don't want it flooded with immigrants.\"\nMs Sturgeon then told her: \"You are a fascist, you are a racist and the southside of Glasgow will reject you.\"\nThe first minister then walked away with party members as Ms Fransen pursued her, talking about \"mass immigration\" and \"Marxism\".\nMs Fransen later told an SNP supporter who asked her who she was: \"I'm not fascist, just a normal, decent unionist patriot. My grandfather fought the Nazis.\"\nIn a piece to camera uploaded afterwards by the British Freedom Party, she accused Ms Sturgeon of \"running away like a coward\", adding: \"Of course if you flood a constituency with foreigners and hardline republicans who absolutely hate Britain, hate the Union, they are going to secure their votes.\n\"The unionist community are no longer unrepresented and we are coming for you.\"\nMs Fransen has previously been pictured outside the constituency office of Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf holding a sign saying \"it's okay to be white\" and has said she is running against the \"SNP commie, Marxists, naughty people\".\nShe has previously been convicted of a number of religiously aggravated crimes, including harassment in both 2016 and 2018 - the latter of which saw her sentenced to 36 weeks in prison.\nAlthough a member of the British Freedom Party, documents from Glasgow City Council show Ms Fransen is running as an independent. \nThe video was shared by Nicola Sturgeon, who said: \"Glasgow Southside is the most diverse and multi-cultural constituency in Scotland - one of the many things that makes it so brilliant. I am confident it will unite today to utterly reject these fascists.\""

He was one of millions of people unable to work from home during the pandemic.\n\"There are locations that have 5,000 people, but only 140 come to the building with most working from home or maybe once a week coming in. That makes it really difficult.\" \nCarl Forder, who owns the Pottergate Pantry sandwich shop in Norwich. saw an 80% drop in business when workers, including 5,000 at the nearby Aviva office, were told to work from home where possible.\n\"We really hope a lot more office workers return to Norwich when it's safe for them to do so.\n\"It affects a lot of businesses, from the cleaners who clean the offices, right through to coffee shops and sandwich bars. We want that buzz back again.\"\nBut in the financial services industry it can be a problem if people work from home, reckons Andrew Monk, chief executive of investment bank VSA Capital. \n\"People working from home don't realise it but they're gradually getting slower and slower whereas the people in the office aren't,\" he told BBC Radio Five Live. \n\"In the financial services industry you need to discuss ideas and discuss what's going on. People working from home miss out on an awful lot of the activity in the office because we don't have time to tell them.\" \nBut there may not be a deluge of workers returning this month.  \nThe companies told the BBC they were opening offices \"in line with government guidance\", which means many plan to reopen offices from 21 June. \nSome have already reopened their offices to a limited number of workers. \nInvestment firm JP Morgan and recruiter Michael Page allowed workers to return from 29 March, while Adecco, recruiter Hays Group and WPP reopened offices on 12 April. \nInvestment firm Rathbones has allowed workers to return \"if they wish\", subject to a 25% capacity. \nWPP reopened its UK offices at a 30% capacity, but is increasing that to 50% this month. \nMany have given workers the choice, with Michael Page saying staff could return to the office \"should they choose to do so\". \nBut some other companies are delaying their office re-opening plans. \nOutsourcing giant Capita said workers have been told they will work from home until at least the end of June, while Lloyds Bank has asked staff to stay at home until at least the summer. \nTom, who works in property, is not looking forward to going back to the office. The commute is long, expensive, uncomfortable and unnecessary, he told the BBC. \n\"My office is modern and seemingly comfortable. But the culture can be difficult and the false familiarity is suffocating. It's a petri dish of anxiety and breeding ground of mental health issues.\" \nHe says working at home is more comfortable.  \n\"The technology enables a more inclusive mode of working where information is shared more easily and talent can shine. There's also more time for family and more time for real friends.\" \nIn contrast, David Kimberley said he \"couldn't wait\". He returned to the stockbroker's office he works at two weeks ago.\n\"There's something healthy about having a psychological separation between your work and home life. I find that hard to do when I'm working from home,\" he told the BBC. \n\"There's something quite gloomy, especially in winter, about working from home, and it's depressing waking up and commuting to your kitchen. \n\"It also makes it much harder to collaborate. I work closely with another member of the team and in the office we can sort things out in seconds, When working from home it can take 10 minutes to get a response, and you have no real idea about how they're feeling as you can't see them to gauge their emotions.\" \nOnly a few of the companies surveyed by the BBC have been shutting offices, with some saying they will wait until leases run out. \nCapita has closed 49 out of 294 of its offices since the start of the pandemic while accountants Deloitte has closed offices at Gatwick, Liverpool, Nottingham and Southampton. \nLloyds Bank said it planned to close 20% of its offices over the next three years while NatWest closed its Regent House, London office last summer, in a move that had been planned, but speeded up by the pandemic. \nNewspaper group Reach has closed its district offices as part of a move to a hub-based model. Meanwhile, Welsh Water closed its head office last year. \nBut not all are keen on the move away from offices.  \nWPP boss Mark Read says he worries about the long-term impact on the company's culture and training.\n\"Advertising and creative industries are something you learn from your colleagues and you can only do that, really, if you're around them in an office.\" \nAccounting software firm Sage has just opened a new office - planned before the pandemic - which has space for 1,800 people.\nSage's chief people officer Amanda Cusdin says that despite using a mix of home and office working going forward, the office will still be needed.\n\"We know for a lot of people maybe don't have a quiet space to work at home and would rather do it in the office.\""

      "tags": "Greenhouse gas emissions,Our Planet Now,Carbon dioxide,Greenhouse gas monitoring,COP26,Paris climate agreement,United Nations,Climate change,Natural gas",
      "text": "Reducing emissions of methane gas is vital for tackling climate change in the short-term, a major UN report says.\nMethane is produced when living things decompose; it's also in natural gas.\nIt persists for just a short time in the atmosphere - unlike carbon dioxide - but methane is a much more potent global warming gas than CO2.\nThe report says \"urgent steps\" are necessary in order to reduce methane if global warming is to be kept within a limit laid down in the Paris deal.\nThis agreement, signed by 200 countries, aims to keep the global temperature rise to within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century.\nThe 1.5C target is regarded as the gateway to \"dangerous\" warming, where the planet could experience serious adverse effects of climate change.\nThe report comes as data showed both CO2 and methane (CH4) in the atmosphere reached record highs last year.\nThis happened despite pandemic lockdowns, which massively reduced economic activity.\nThe good news is that the UN report says rapid and significant reductions in the greenhouse gas are possible using existing technologies and a very low cost.\nMethane is also a source for another gas - ozone - in the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere (known as the troposphere)\nIn addition to saving money, cutting methane would yield significant health benefits by reducing the amount of ground-level ozone - a pollutant that's harmful to the human body.\nThe recommendations come from an international team of scientists, who have produced the Global Methane Assessment for the UN Environment Programme (Unep).\nDrew Shindell, the study's lead author, and a professor of Earth science at Duke University in Durham, US, agrees CO2 is the number one target in the fight against climate change, but says cutting methane will have a more rapid impact.\n\"So many aspects of climate change are happening faster than expected\", he said. \"We see more fires, more of the strongest hurricanes, more heatwaves, and methane is the best lever we have to reduce the growth in those over the next 30 years.\"\nScientists regard a temperature rise of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as a gateway to \"dangerous\" warming of the planet. The Paris agreement, signed by nearly 200 countries, aims to keep the increase to within the 1.5C target.\nThe new report says measures available now could reduce emissions from human activities by as much as 180 million tonnes a year by 2030 - 45% of the total per year.\nThe main sources of human-related methane are the fossil fuel industry, which accounts for 34% of total emissions, agriculture which contributes another 40% and the waste sector 20%.\nOne of the difficulties in tackling the methane problem has been knowing precisely where the gas is coming from. But this is changing thanks to an emerging satellite capability that can pinpoint sources. The Canadian company GHGSat has the highest-resolution instrument in orbit currently, able to detect plumes of CH4 down to about 25m across. \nIn the example above, the technology is tracking emissions from a giant landfill area serving the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. The area is outputting 16 tonnes of CH4 every hour, equivalent to nearly 400 tonnes/hr of CO2. \nOn an annualised basis, this is like the greenhouse gas output of 750,000 cars driving for a year. GHGSat's spacecraft are being followed by a fleet of other methane-detecting satellites this decade. Identifying super-emitters is about to get a lot easier.\nThe Unep report says the fossil fuel industry has the greatest potential for low-cost methane cuts.\nPlugging leaks in oil and gas wells and along production and transmission lines would significantly cut methane emissions at little to no cost, it concludes.\nMany of the reductions could quickly pay for themselves because reducing leaks means more gas available for sale.\nBut the report warns the continued expansion of the use of natural gas is not compatible with keeping warming to 1.5C without what it calls \"massive-scale deployment of unproven carbon removal technologies\".\nThe waste sector could cut its methane emissions by improving the disposal of sewage around the world.\nImproving the management of rice paddies has the potential to reduce emissions from agriculture but the report says the biggest generators of agricultural methane - livestock - are harder to abate.\nThere is little scope for technical solutions, it concludes, so the effort needs to be focused on reducing food waste and loss, improving livestock management and encouraging consumers to adopt what the report calls \"healthier diets\" - those with a lower meat and dairy content.\nIf a concerted effort managed to achieve that 45% cut in methane emissions, it would help avoid nearly 0.3C of global warming as early as the 2040s, the report claims.\nBecause of methane's contribution to the formation of ozone, up to a quarter of a million premature deaths could be avoided worldwide under the most aggressive emission abatement efforts.\nThis attempt to focus on the issue of methane is very welcome, said Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at Oxford University, provided it does not distract from the need to reduce CO2 emissions to net zero as soon as possible.\nProf Euan Nisbet, from the greenhouse gas group at Royal Holloway, University of London, said: \"The actions it suggests, like cutting gas leaks and landfill emissions, are sensible, cost-effective and economically realistic. If fully implemented, these relatively inexpensive measures will help avoid nearly 0.3C of warming by mid-century.\"\nFollow Justin on Twitter."

      "text": "Jersey officials are meeting French fishermen, who have been protesting over their post-Brexit rights, in an attempt to resolve the dispute.\nTwo Royal Navy ships and two French vessels are patrolling near Jersey while about 60 French and Jersey boats are at the island's St Helier port.\nFrench fishermen say their rights are unfairly restricted by licences issued by the island under a new system.\nNo 10 said the PM has been in contact with Jersey officials over the row.\nHMS Severn, which has previously been used to shadow Russian navy warships off the English coast, can be seen from the port, sitting off about a mile from the French boats. HMS Tamar is nearby and both ships are maintaining a presence and not making any effort to intervene. \nNo 10 said it sent the two navy vessels to \"monitor the situation\", while the maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the two French patrol vessels were on a public service mission to ensure safety.\nFrance has threatened to cut off electricity to Jersey, the largest Channel Island and a Crown dependency, located 14 miles (22km) off France. Crown dependencies are not part of the UK, but are defended and represented internationally by the UK government.\nThe boats are protesting against new fishing rules - introduced last week by the Jersey government under the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) - which require French boats to show they have a history of fishing in Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice.\nFrench authorities say \"new technical measures\" had not been communicated to the EU, rendering them \"null and void\".\n\"It's really important that we are able to work with those fishermen to help them provide the necessary evidence so that, if required, their licences can be amended,\" Senator Ian Gorst, Jersey's external relations minister, told BBC News.\n\"As I've said, it's important that we respond to threats, but the answer to this solution is to continue to talk and diplomacy.\" \nJersey fisherman Loic Farnham said of his French counterparts: \"They are professional fishermen, the same as we all are, we'd like to keep it all amicable so we can have access to the markets and they can carry on earning a living in our waters.\"\nAn Elys\u00e9e source said France was monitoring the situation \"very closely\", adding that it is \"currently calm and we hope that this will remain the case\".\n\"We want to be able to return to negotiations, that we can obtain the fishing licenses provided for in the agreement.\"\nThe maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the two French vessels, police boat Athos and patroller Themis, were not on military missions.\nIt said the boats' roles were to stay in French waters and to be near to the fisherman in order to ensure safety.\nA European Commission spokeswoman said talks were continuing with the UK. \nBy Freddie Miller, BBC Jersey political reporter\nIn the darkness you could see the lights from boats slowly making their way from the direction of France towards Jersey. They then all gathered outside the St Helier harbour and they stayed there for about half an hour.\nAt about 06:30 BST they started making their way slowly into the harbour. Flares were set off - red flares, orange flares, burning bright. French flags were being flown, there were banners talking about fishing.\nMeanwhile, on the pier-side where I am, islanders had gathered - probably about 30 in total, including a couple of police officers. Jersey flags had been hung to the railings of the pier, some were waving flags.\nThere were also some Jersey boats in support of the French, flying both French and Jersey flags, and also a couple that were there trying to stop the French from coming into the harbour.\nAmidst all of this you've got the two navy vessels in the distance - you can just see the outline shadow of them through the mist, just keeping watch of everything.\nMEP Stephanie Yon-Courtin, a member of the EU fisheries committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said \"all retaliatory measures will be explored\".\nOf the threats to cut off electricity to Jersey, she said \"these are only words we are not ready for war\".\nOn Thursday morning, Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the two Royal Navy vessels would \"remain in place to monitor the situation as a precautionary measure\".\nA statement from the Jersey government read: \"Diplomatic efforts will continue to resolve the outstanding issues relating to fishing licences and to de-escalate the situation.\"\nTheir boats were draped with makeshift banners - which read \"en col\u00e8re\"- we are angry, writes BBC Europe correspondent Jean Mackenzie, who was with the fishermen as they set off from the French coast.\nA handful left this small port on the Normandy coast about 02:30, to be joined by dozens more on the way to Jersey. The fishermen seemed more shocked than angry, that their access to waters they have fished in for decades is being challenged.\nUnder the post-Brexit trade deal, Jersey has to allow European vessels into its waters, but they now need licences - but the fishermen say the permits have come with a long list of restrictions that were never agreed.\nReacting to the French maritime minister's threat to cut off Jersey's electricity in retaliation - the fishermen were pleased.\n\"It's good to know our country is on our side,\" they said\nDimitri Rogoff, head of fisheries for the Normandy region, said the boats would not try to block St Helier and would return to France in the afternoon, AFP reported.\nLabour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the threats were \"completely unreasonable\" and urged the UK government to \"get round the table with French colleagues and authorities in Jersey and sort this issue out\".\nFrench fishermen have complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. \nUnder an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice.\nJersey has the sole power to issue the licences, and as of last week all fishing boats were required to have a licence to operate there.\nOn Friday, the Jersey government granted 41 permits to French fishing vessels that are equipped with technology that allows them to be located.\nBut the French government claimed the list of approved ships came with further demands that \"were not arranged or discussed, and which we were not notified about\".\nChris Le Masurier, who runs Jersey Oyster and Normandy Trader Freight, said the French fisherman were rightly upset by the situation.\nHe said: \"I see it as very much an insult to them and they are extremely upset. The criteria that they were given was to prove they have fished in Jersey waters for 10 days. Nothing about what species were caught, nothing about if you've fished for 20 days or 30 days [and having to] prove that.\" \nBut Don Thompson, from the Jersey Fisherman's Association, said affected French crews have \"had since 1 January\" to comply with the new rules and \"perhaps some of the boats that perhaps didn't qualify are a little bit put-out\".\nThe threat to cut off Jersey's electricity supply - 95% of which is delivered by three underwater cables from France - was made by French Maritime Minister Annick Girardin on Tuesday.\nHMS Severn and HMS Tamar, which are based in Portsmouth, are each crewed by 45 sailors and up to 50 Royal Marines. \nThe ships are routinely used for fisheries protection - with sailors able to board other boats for spot checks.\nUpdate: This story has been amended to clarify the specifications of Royal Navy vessels HMS Severn and HMS Tamar."
