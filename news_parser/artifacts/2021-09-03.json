      "tags": "Pets,RSPCA,Dogs",
      "text": "Pet abduction is to be made a criminal offence in England after a rise in reported thefts during Covid lockdowns.\nTheft of a pet is currently treated as a loss of an owner's property, but ministers want a new law to acknowledge the emotional distress it can cause.\nThe proposal is one of a string of recommendations in a report by the pet theft taskforce - set up to tackle an increase in incidents during lockdown.\nIt found that around 2,000 dogs were reported stolen last year.\nThe taskforce - comprising government officials, police, prosecutors, and local authorities - received evidence from animal welfare groups, campaigners, academics and other experts.\nIts report found that seven in 10 pet thefts recorded by police involved dogs.\nAlthough offences under the Theft Act 1968 carry a maximum term of seven years, ministers say there is little evidence of that being used, because the severity of the sentence is partly determined by the monetary value of the item taken.\nIt is not known what the maximum sentence for a new offence of pet abduction might be.\nQuoting data from animal charity Dogs Trust, the report said the price for five of the UK's most desirable dog breeds grew \"significantly\" during the first nationwide lockdown, with some rising as high as 89%.\nThe taskforce suggested this potentially made dog theft more appealing to criminals seeking to profit from the spike in demand for pets.\nMeanwhile, Google searches for \"buy a puppy\" rose by over 160% in the months between March and August 2020 after England's first nationwide lockdown began.\nThe taskforce's recommendations also included:\nThe taskforce also looked at measures such as requiring proof of identification for all online pet adverts, and allowing owners to register their dogs with police, including photos and DNA as well as contact and microchip information.\nOfficials hope the proposals will make it more difficult for thieves to abduct and sell on pets, make it easier for police to apprehend offenders, and that sentences and penalties handed to offenders will reflect the impact on the animal.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said: \"Stealing a pet is an awful crime which can cause families great emotional distress whilst callous criminals line their pockets.\n\"The new offence of pet abduction acknowledges that animals are far more than just property and will give police an additional tool to bring these sickening individuals to justice.\"\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said reports of a rise in pet thefts had been worrying and that owners should not have to \"live in fear\".\nYou can read more here.\nRSPCA chief executive Chris Sherwood said the new pet abduction offence would recognise the \"seriousness\" of the crime, adding: \"We hope this will encourage courts to hand out much tougher sentences to pet thieves.\"\nHe said simplifying the microchipping database would help tackle pet theft, animal welfare issues and \"irresponsible pet ownership\".\nDiane James, from the Blue Cross animal welfare charity, said the organisation hoped the new sentencing laws were brought in \"swiftly\", adding: \"[We] would still advise owners to continue to be vigilant and follow advice to prevent becoming a victim of this abhorrent crime.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "Heart inflammation is a \"very rare\" side-effect of the Covid vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, according to regulators in Europe. \nThe European Medicines Agency said the side-effects were more common in younger men.\nThe medicines safety body said the benefits of Covid vaccines continue to far outweigh any risks. \nBut doctors and patients have been advised to be aware of the symptoms of heart inflammation. \nThese include chest pain, a feeling of breathlessness and a pounding or fluttering heartbeat. Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor. \nTwo conditions were linked to the vaccines - inflammation of the heart muscle itself, known as myocarditis, and inflammation of the fluid-filled sac the heart sits in, known as pericarditis. \nThe EMA analysis of cases found:\nFive people died. The review said they were all either elderly or had other health conditions. \nThe UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has also been investigating the link. \nIt reported: \"A consistent pattern of cases occurring more frequently in young males and shortly after the second dose of the vaccines.\n\"These reports are extremely rare, and the events are typically mild with individuals usually recovering within a short time with standard treatment and rest,\" it added.\nMost cases are thought to be within 14 days of vaccination.  \nWhile the risk is very rare, it is more likely to develop in young people - who are currently the focus on the vaccination campaign in the UK. \nConcerns about the side-effects have already played into the UK debate around vaccinating children, who are at lower risk of Covid.\nMyocarditis and pericarditis will be officially listed as side-effects in the UK and Europe, mirroring a move by the regulators in the US last month.\n\"The chance of these conditions occurring is very low, but you should be aware of the symptoms so that you can get prompt medical treatment to help recovery and avoid complications,\" the EMA said. \nThe link with heart inflammation was found only in the vaccines that rely on mRNA technology to train the immune system. \nThere was no link found for vaccines such as Oxford-AstraZeneca or Janssen, which use a genetically modified virus.\nHowever, the EMA has advised anyone with a history of capillary leak syndrome should not be given the Janssen vaccine. This is a rare but serious syndrome in which fluid leaks from blood vessels in the body.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Drug legalisation,Nitrous oxide",
      "text": " The unlawful possession of laughing gas could be made a crime in England and Wales.\nMinisters have asked independent advisers to review the harm caused by nitrous oxide.\nUsually sold in small silver canisters and inhaled, it is the second most-used drug among young adults. \nHome Secretary Priti Patel wants the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) to review the harm caused by nitrous oxide.\nShe said was prepared to take \"tough action\" and introduce further restrictions.\nBut drugs experts said the move was \"completely pointless\" and a \"waste of time\".\nSold legally, nitrous oxide is used for medical and commercial uses, such as making whipped cream - but is illegal when sold as a psychoactive drug.\nWhen inhaled, the gas can cause elation and hallucinations.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, there were 36 deaths in Great Britain associated with nitrous oxide between 2001 and 2016.\nMs Patel said: \"Misusing drugs can have a devastating impact on lives and communities. We are determined to do all we can to address this issue and protect the futures of our children and young people.\" \nShe added that if the ACMD recommended further restrictions, she would be \"ready to take tough action\".\n\"Should the expert ACMD recommend further restrictions on this drug, we stand ready to take tough action.\"\nBut former ACMD chairman Professor David Nutt, who was sacked in 2009 after claiming that ecstasy and LSD were less dangerous than alcohol, called the move a \"gimmick\".\nProf Nutt, founder of the charity Drug Science, said it was \"completely symptomatic of the utterly blinkered perspective that this Government has on drugs\".\nHe added: \"This is completely pointless, an utter distraction. This is pretence of doing something about drug problems, but focusing on a drug that has very, very little harm - way less harm than alcohol - and they should be investing their money on people who are dying of drugs like fentanyl and heroin.\"\nAnother leading drugs expert called the move a \"waste of time\" and said criminalising possession \"would likely lead to illicit sales\".\nAdam Winstock, a consultant psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialist, said: \"Asking for evidence is great but the ACMD advice comes framed by the current home secretary's preconceived notion that a problem related to drug use can be successfully addressed by making something illegal.\n\"This is palpably and evidentially false. But making a drug with minimal risk to most users illegal will add the risk of criminality to all.\"\nBut ministers have faced cross-party pressure to tighten the regulations on the sale of nitrous oxide.\nLabour MP Rosie Duffield told a Commons debate in 2020 that recreational use had become \"much more prevalent\" during the pandemic.\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds welcomed the review, saying it was right to \"assess the harm\".\nBut he added: However, this will not be an answer to the terrible impact Conservative cuts to policing have caused.\" "

      "text": "Delays in collecting people's household waste has been blamed on Covid, Brexit and a shortage of lorry drivers.\nCeredigion, Powys, Cardiff and Vale of Glamorgan councils said they were already facing delays or expected further delays. \nResidents said their household or garden waste had been left on the kerbside for weeks.\nBrexit, drivers retiring and Covid have led to the lorry driver shortage, said the Road Haulage Association. \nBeryl Walker said a large pile of refuse sacks had been lying on the pavement at the entrance to her street in the Ceredigion village of Llanarth, between Aberystwyth and Cardigan, for 10 days. \n\"I'm just tired of it being stuck there by my lawn week after week,\" she said. \n\"It's been there at least ten days, and I worry about rats. I'm fed up - everybody pays the rates not just me. It's just not on. \n\"They say they can't get drivers to do the collections. Well if they paid them a decent wage they'd probably get more workers. \n\"I just want them to shift it otherwise it's going to end up in the middle of Cardigan Road.\"\nBusiness owners in the nearby seaside town of New Quay on the west Wales coast have also expressed their frustration. \n\"The problem was we had the tourists leave their rubbish,\" said Trudi Thomas from the Creme Pen Cei ice cream parlour.\n\"They may be leaving the next morning and hadn't got somewhere to leave the rubbish, so they would put it by the bins, and the bins were overflowing with bags around them which the seagulls were breaking into. \n\"It was just a mess, the whole village was a mess, which is a pity because as we know it's very pretty.\"\nMs Thomas added that a lot of visitors had complained about seeing the rubbish everywhere and seagulls had become quite aggressive around the waste. \n\"It's just been a bit of a tarnish to everything,\" she said.\nA spokesperson for Ceredigion County Council apologised for the delays.\n\"There are a number of issues which can cause, or combine to cause, disruptions. \n\"These extend from issues affecting the availability of staff and vehicles through to the amount and profile of the waste being presented for collection. \n\"Covid has brought with it additional pressures which has included the implementation of measures put in place to reduce the risks of transmission locally.\"\nPowys County council also said they have experienced problems, with the north of the county the most affected.  \nA spokesperson for the council said: \"While they have maintained all of its waste and recycling collections throughout the pandemic. \n\"However, like most authorities, the current driver shortage is causing some issues which has meant that on occasions some rounds have had to be completed later in the week than the scheduled collection day.\"\nA shortage of lorry drivers was also said to have contributed to continued garden waste collection delays in Cardiff. \nLast month the council described the situation as \"extremely difficult\", with residents continuing to receive monthly garden waste collections instead of fortnightly. \nGarden waste can continue to be brought to the recycling centres with households allowed to visit up to three times per day, instead of the previous limit of once a day. \nA spokesperson for Neath Port Talbot Council said: \"Although driver resources in particular are being impacted at present by Covid along with other sickness, we've only had a small number of issues.\n\"But through a number of 'catch-ups' by our staff at weekends we've been able to manage the position with minimal impact on the public.\"\nIn the Vale of Glamorgan, residents have complained of delays to their garden waste collection. \nThe council said that while some green waste collections were missed during August due to staffing issues, the department is now up to a full complement of staff and say they should catch up on everything by the end of next week.\nMonmouthshire council blamed Covid for the strain on waste services.\n'Whilst there has been minimal impact on our service delivery, this situation is affecting all sectors and it is clear that the next few months are going to be challenging for us all,\" said councillor Jane Pratt. \n\"But Monmouthshire county council will continue to prioritise collecting waste from our residents, although at times they may see new faces on their round that maybe unfamiliar with their area.\"\nTorfaen council said they had no delays but there were hold-ups in the ordering and delivering of bins because of lorry driver shortages. \nPembrokeshire council also said there have been a number of resourcing difficulties to overcome due to the pandemic and the shortage of lorry drivers.\nConwy council said Covid has brought extra pressure due to staff having tested positive and a shortage of replacement drivers. \nMost other Welsh councils told BBC Wales they have not had delays with their waste collections."

      "title": "Life in Kabul under Taliban: Where is your male escort?",
      "tags": "Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "\"Why are you travelling without a mahram?\" the Taliban guard asks a young Afghan woman about her missing male escort. \nShe sits on her own in the back of a beat-up Kabul yellow taxi as it pulls up to the checkpoint marked, like all the others, by the white Taliban flag with black script. \nWhat is allowed now in Kabul, and what is not?  \nThe turbaned Talib, rifle slung over shoulder, tells her to call her husband. When she explains she doesn't have a phone, he instructs another taxi driver to take her home to get her husband and bring them back. Once completed, all is resolved. \nKabul is still a city of a grinding traffic gridlock, wooden market carts groaning with Afghan green grapes and deep purple plums, and street kids in tattered tunics threading through the melee. \nOn the surface, the city seems much the same. It's not.  \nIt's a capital governed by Taliban statements, and some Taliban on the streets. \n\"Be careful in how you deal with your people. This nation has suffered a lot. Be gentle,\" urged spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid in an impromptu press conference, flanked by fighters in full combat gear, the first day after the last US soldier flew home. \nSome things don't need saying. As soon as the Taliban swept, with surprising speed, into Kabul last month, Afghans knew what to do during Taliban rule 2.0. Men stopped shaving to allow beards to grow; women switched bright scarves to black ones and checked the length of their dresses and cloaks.  \nSo much else is uncertain, unnerving.  \n\"What should I do?\" many Afghans ask in urgent cries for advice, and assistance to escape, tumbling by the hour onto my phone and computer, and those of countless others around the world. \nMaryam Rajaee knew what to do when Kabul collapsed.  \nOn 15 August, as Taliban fighters surged into the streets, she was conducting a long- awaited workshop for female prosecutors in the attorney general's office. \n\"We must continue,\" her eager students implored her when she flagged the looming threat.  \nBut her class soon resigned itself to this sudden reversal. Since then, Rajaee has been moving from one safe house to the next with her family including two young children.  \nHer three-year-old daughter, Nilofar, already says she wants to be an engineer; her multi-coloured plastic building blocks sit in the corner of a mud-brick room, a late summer sun streams through the windows.  \nNo one is quite sure yet what Taliban leaders mean when they say women and girls will be given \"all their rights within Islam\". \nMany women, including Rajaee, were told in no uncertain terms, \"don't come back to the office\". Many fear they'll never be allowed to return to the life they lived in a city they no longer feel is their own. \n\"It is my right to be educated, to have a good job, to participate in society at a high level,\" Rajaee tells us as she sits next to a pile of textbooks for her university degree, and her work heading a unit on gender and human rights awareness. \n\"All my dreams have been destroyed,\" she reflects, her voice breaking. \nTwo decades of international engagement created a space for new ideas, new identities. Now some lives lived are a liability.   \n\"I have good memories of our Christmas parties, of times we cooked delicious food and we were all so happy,\" reminisces Hameed, who'd been a head chef at the British embassy in Kabul for 13 years. We sit cross-legged on a carpet with his five young children, and a pile of faded photographs and certificates of appreciation for his work.  \nBut Hameed, and some 60 other employees at the embassy were hired through a private contractor. Sources say almost all of the staff directly employed by Britain's foreign office managed to fly out of Kabul before Taliban moved in; contractors were left behind.  \n\"We worked so hard, even during the Covid lockdown. If they don't take us out of here, it is a big betrayal,\" laments Hameed. Britain, like some other Western countries, is promising to find ways to help, in third countries, but for many it's a daunting and dangerous prospect to find new routes out. \nSome have already fled from this city in haste; some now happily rush in.  \nTaliban fighters stream into Kabul from the provinces. A group from Uruzgan, in central Afghanistan, invite us for a chat as we approach the entrance to Kabul airport.  \n\"I haven't been able to visit Kabul for years,\" says 25-year-old Rafiullah, effusive about his \"great happiness\". Asked about the many educated Afghans his own age who feel their future has disappeared, he waves an olive branch. \"We are all Afghans and the country is now moving toward a good path of peace and prosperity.\" \nIn some neighbourhoods, Taliban fighters go house-to-house. There's a knock on the door, a demand to hand over government phones and cars, anything of value from their old job. Sometimes even private cars are seized by Taliban who doubt it could have been afforded without some kind of corruption.  \nIn western Kabul, in neighbourhoods like Dasht-e-Barchi, populated largely by members of the minority Hazara community, residents whisper of house searches, of men being taken away.  \n\"I'm scared,\" says one woman who travels into the centre of the city for her job. \"We are telling the Taliban we are our family's only source of income and we have to go to work.\"  \nIn the heart of Kabul, the queues in front of the banks stretch all the way down the street. Most branches are shut; most have no money.  \n\"It's been a week I have been coming every day to get some money,\" declares one man in the bulging crowd. \"This is a new start just to go backwards.\" \nFrom rural areas, far from this city in so many ways, come comments of relief that American warplanes have finally left the skies, that fighting has gone. For millions of Afghans who live with deepening hunger and hardship, life hasn't changed one jot in their struggle just to survive.  \nIn this time between the collapse of the old order and the creation of the new, many take each day, as it comes.  \n\"Is this history, is this real, I can't believe my eyes what I am seeing,\" says freelance Afghan journalist Ahmed Mangli when we meet by Kabul airport. \nWe talk in a district strewn with rubbish and luggage abandoned during the scramble to board the last military flights during the unprecedented international airlift. Mangli first started working in Kabul when the Taliban were ousted 20 years ago.   \n\"The Taliban spokesman is trying to co-ordinate media but everyone has a weapon, everyone feels they are king,\" he reflects. \"I don't know how long I can take this risk but I want to be part of this history.\"  \nA historic moment unfolds; a historic past is being undone. Billboards with beaming brides in glittering white gowns and racy red lipstick are now being blacked out. The sweeping street murals of the Art Lords team - which told stories of courageous journalists, committed doctors, a yearning for peace after so much war - are being painted over. The first to go was an image, starkly painted in black and white, to mark the signing of a deal last year in Doha between the Taliban and the United States. \nA people of poets now struggles to find words.  \nAn old friend, Masood Khalili, who's fought on so many fronts over so many years, sends me some verse.  \n\"Last night the Writer of Fate whispered in my ear, Our Book of Destiny is filled with smiles and tears.\" "

Well if they paid them a decent wage they'd probably get more workers. \n\"I just want them to shift it otherwise it's going to end up in the middle of Cardigan Road.\"\nBusiness owners in the nearby seaside town of New Quay on the west Wales coast have also expressed their frustration. \n\"The problem was we had the tourists leave their rubbish,\" said Trudi Thomas from the Creme Pen Cei ice cream parlour.\n\"They may be leaving the next morning and hadn't got somewhere to leave the rubbish, so they would put it by the bins, and the bins were overflowing with bags around them which the seagulls were breaking into. \n\"It was just a mess, the whole village was a mess, which is a pity because as we know it's very pretty.\"\nMs Thomas added that a lot of visitors had complained about seeing the rubbish everywhere and seagulls had become quite aggressive around the waste. \n\"It's just been a bit of a tarnish to everything,\" she said.\nA spokesperson for Ceredigion County Council apologised for the delays.\n\"There are a number of issues which can cause, or combine to cause, disruptions. \n\"These extend from issues affecting the availability of staff and vehicles through to the amount and profile of the waste being presented for collection. \n\"Covid has brought with it additional pressures which has included the implementation of measures put in place to reduce the risks of transmission locally.\"\nPowys County council also said they have experienced problems, with the north of the county the most affected.  \nA spokesperson for the council said: \"While they have maintained all of its waste and recycling collections throughout the pandemic. \n\"However, like most authorities, the current driver shortage is causing some issues which has meant that on occasions some rounds have had to be completed later in the week than the scheduled collection day.\"\nA shortage of lorry drivers was also said to have contributed to continued garden waste collection delays in Cardiff. \nLast month the council described the situation as \"extremely difficult\", with residents continuing to receive monthly garden waste collections instead of fortnightly. \nGarden waste can continue to be brought to the recycling centres with households allowed to visit up to three times per day, instead of the previous limit of once a day. \nA spokesperson for Neath Port Talbot Council said: \"Although driver resources in particular are being impacted at present by Covid along with other sickness, we've only had a small number of issues.\n\"But through a number of 'catch-ups' by our staff at weekends we've been able to manage the position with minimal impact on the public.\"\nIn the Vale of Glamorgan, residents have complained of delays to their garden waste collection. \nThe council said that while some green waste collections were missed during August due to staffing issues, the department is now up to a full complement of staff and say they should catch up on everything by the end of next week.\nMonmouthshire council blamed Covid for the strain on waste services.\n'Whilst there has been minimal impact on our service delivery, this situation is affecting all sectors and it is clear that the next few months are going to be challenging for us all,\" said councillor Jane Pratt. \n\"But Monmouthshire county council will continue to prioritise collecting waste from our residents, although at times they may see new faces on their round that maybe unfamiliar with their area.\"\nTorfaen council said they had no delays but there were hold-ups in the ordering and delivering of bins because of lorry driver shortages. \nPembrokeshire council also said there have been a number of resourcing difficulties to overcome due to the pandemic and the shortage of lorry drivers.\nConwy council said Covid has brought extra pressure due to staff having tested positive and a shortage of replacement drivers. \nMost other Welsh councils told BBC Wales they have not had delays with their waste collections."

But it is not yet clear how he plans to achieve this. \nMr Kerry said he aimed to meet Chinese leaders again ahead of the upcoming COP26 UN climate summit in Glasgow this year and push for stronger emission reduction targets. \n\"We have consistently said to China and other countries... to do their best within their given capacity,\" he said on Thursday. \"We think that China can do more.\"\nIf there was to be any sign of progress between the world's two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases you'd expect a nod to it now. \nThis is John Kerry's second trip to China in a matter of months. \nInstead China has refused to accept America's terms. It won't separate talks on climate change from the broader disagreements between Beijing and Washington DC; everything is on the table. \nWhich means John Kerry has - so far - failed in his bid to get just one thing on the table. One thing that's so important, he said, that it shouldn't be overshadowed by tariffs or sanctions or extradition. \nThe question now is will President Joe Biden - a man who has enhanced some of the punitive measures put in place by his predecessor - change tack?"

As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall. \nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio criticised weather experts, saying their forecasts were being \"made a mockery of in a matter of minutes\". He said he had been warned to expect between three and six inches (7.5 and 15cm) of rain over the course of the day. However a record 3.15 inches fell in Central Park in just one hour.\n\"The suddenness, the brutality of storms now, it is different,\" he said, adding that the latest extreme weather was \"the biggest wake-up call\".\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul said: \"We did not know that between 8:50 and 9:50 p.m. last night, that the heavens would literally open up and bring Niagara Falls level of water to the streets of New York.\" \nResidents have been assessing the damage to property. \nOne man in Flushing, New York, said his house was prone to flooding \"but what I saw last night is unimaginable\". \"I have never seen water coming in all directions,\" Tedla Asfaw, 60, told the BBC. \"There's huge damage here. It's a big hit for us.\"\nIn New Jersey, a tornado flattened the state's largest dairy farm, ripping roofs off buildings and toppling several large silos.\nMany cows were trapped under fallen sheds and some died, the owners of Wellacrest Farm wrote on their Facebook page. \"Along with the devastating loss of homes in our neighbourhoods - we, as a community, suffered a great loss with the destruction of our farm.\"\nIn New York, some 835 people had to be rescued from stranded subway trains, police said on Thursday, after social media pictures showed water gushing into underground stations and tunnels.\nOther footage showed cars floating down flooded roads, with cries of \"help\" being heard from inside. Nearly 500 vehicles were abandoned in New York, the Associated Press says.\nPassengers on trains, planes and buses have been describing finding themselves stuck for hours without moving as the flooding made travelling impossible.\nPresident Biden said the unprecedented flooding in the region, along with the destruction brought by Hurricane Ida to Louisiana and Mississippi and wildfires in the West, were \"yet another reminder that these extreme storms in the climate crisis are here\".\nHe said he would be pushing Congress for action on his Build Back Better plan, which would see \"historic investment\" in infrastructure, including modernising roads and bridges and improving energy grids, water and sewage systems.\n\"This destruction is everywhere,\" he said. \"It's a matter of life and death and we are all in this together. This is one of the great challenges of our time but I'm confident we will meet it.\nThe president will visit Louisiana on Friday to assess what is being done to help the state, which became the first to face Hurricane Ida when it made landfall on Sunday.

      "tags": "Tax,Social care,Jeremy Hunt",
      "text": "Social care must be adequately funded, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said, amid reports ministers plan to raise national insurance.\nDowning Street did not deny reports of an increase of at least 1% to improve social care and tackle the NHS backlog.\nThe justice secretary said he would not \"speculate\" but said there should be a \"grown-up conversation\" about how to pay for rising social care costs.\nThe move would break a Tory manifesto commitment at the last election.\n\"The British public are sensible enough to know that when it comes to the issue of social care we have to find some way in which it will be adequately funded,\" Mr Buckland told BBC Breakfast.\nHe said that the Conservative Party had also promised at the 2019 election that it would bring forward sustainable proposals to fund social care.\nThe Daily Telegraph reports that Downing Street favours a 1% rise in the national insurance rate, affecting about 25 million workers and self-employed people, as well as employers. But it says the Treasury is pushing for a 1.25% increase.\nAnd the Times adds that Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid wants a bigger rise of 2%.\nBut a source close to Mr Javid said that 2% figure was incorrect and the BBC understands the health secretary is pushing for a lower figure.\nFor someone on average earnings of \u00a329,536 a year, a 1% increase in national insurance would cost them \u00a3199.68 annually.\nThe Telegraph says the funds will be used to put a cap on the amount an individual has to spend on social care costs over their lifetime.\nIn their manifesto, the Conservatives said: \"The prerequisite of any solution will be a guarantee that no-one needing care has to sell their home to pay for it.\"\nThe government said it was \"committed to bringing forward a long-term plan to reform the social care system\".\nIn a statement, it said proposals would be set out this year. \nBoris Johnson appears to be ready to break one promise in order to keep another. \nHe is considering going against a manifesto commitment not to raise national insurance in order to deliver on his vow to fix social care.  \nIf the plan is put forward it will need a hard sell - to the public, most of whom will still pay large amounts towards care, and to Conservative MPs, for whom raising taxes is repellent.\nHow best to look after the elderly, disabled and others needing care is one of society's most pressing questions. \nHow to persuade the public to pay for it is the government's most pressing problem and a huge political challenge. \nLabour said the NHS and social care needed proper investment but it was wrong to raise national insurance., which would disproportionately hit low-earners, young people and businesses.\n\"Boris Johnson still hasn't come forward with the plan for social care he promised over two years ago, and instead they're proposing a manifesto-breaking tax rise that would hit working people and businesses hard,\" said shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson.\nIt comes as former health secretary Jeremy Hunt wrote in the Daily Telegraph that there should be a new \"health and care premium\" added to tax instead, as he warned against raising national insurance or income tax.\nMr Hunt, who now chairs the Commons health committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government must \"bite the bullet\" and find some way to increase taxes.\n\"The sums are eye-watering, far bigger than a chancellor can find down the back of a Treasury sofa,\" he said.\nBut he said a national insurance increase was the wrong approach because it would not be paid by pensioners. \n\"Since older people are the biggest beneficiaries I think it's only fair that they should make a contribution,\" Mr Hunt said.\nNational insurance is paid on the profits of self-employed people and the earnings of employees when they exceed \u00a39,568 a year.\nThey then pay 12% of their income up to about \u00a350,000 a year, when it drops to 2%.\nThat has raised concerns that any rise to national insurance would affect low earners more than high earners.\nNine challenges facing the social care system\nBoris Johnson has been under increasing pressure to set out his plan for social care reform. \nSpeaking on the steps of Downing Street on his first day as prime minister in 2019, he pledged to \"fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared\". \nBut that plan has yet to be published. \nOn top of long-term funding challenges, the social care sector has also faced extra costs because of the pandemic. \nCouncils, which provide social care, have seen their budgets cut over the last decade. \nThe squeeze on council funding in England means that people who pay for themselves are often propping up the care system.\nIn England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than \u00a323,250 can get help from their council.\nThere is no overall limit on costs, meaning thousands every year end up selling their homes to pay.\nPersonal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs.\nThe Scottish National Party said the UK government at Westminster should guarantee Scottish workers would not pay for an \"England-only policy\".\nSome care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland."

      "text": "The care system helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing, eating and medication.\nIt is under pressure across the UK after past governments failed to reform or fund the council-run system properly.\nThe pressure on social care during the coronavirus pandemic has led to renewed calls for government action.\nOn his first day as prime minister in 2019, Boris Johnson committed to \"fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared\".\nBut that plan has yet to be published - ministers say they will bring forward proposals in 2021.\nThe system is devolved across the four nations, meaning governments need to develop solutions unique to their own region.\nUnlike the NHS, social care is means-tested. To receive help from your local authority, you must have a very high level of need and, in England and Northern Ireland, savings and assets of less than \u00a323,250. In Wales, the threshold is \u00a324,000 for non-residential care but \u00a350,000 for residential care. Scotland operates a different system. \nSince 2010, the number of older people asking for council help has increased, but fewer now qualify for support in their own home or in care homes.  \nThe charity Age UK estimates there are 1.5 million people in England who need some help with day-to-day life, but do not receive it. \nCare home residents accounted for almost a third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales up to January 2021, according to analysis by the PA news agency.\nMeanwhile, staff sickness and problems with personal protective equipment (PPE) supply increased pressure on the care system.\nThe King's Fund says the pandemic has had a \"devastating\" impact on the quality of care.\nDespite increasing demand, spending is still 3% lower than a decade ago. \nThe money councils spend on social care comes from: \nCuts to funding from central government led to a 17% fall in councils' spending on local public services between 2010 and 2019, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. \nLocal authorities have generally tried to protect their spending on adult social care, and the government has put in extra short-term money in recent years. \nThe Local Government Association has said councils are under intense financial pressure, particularly since the start of the pandemic.\nThe fees that local authorities pay for care, both in a person's own home or care homes, vary hugely depending on where you live. \nBut across the country, the companies and charities who provide those services complain that councils are not covering the real cost of care. \nThe squeeze on council funding in England means that people who pay for themselves are often propping up the care system.\nIn 2016, the competition regulator estimated that in care homes, self-funders paid significantly more in fees than a local authority resident.\nIncreasingly, care companies warn they would go out of business without private clients subsidising the system. \nMany of those self-funders will have ended up selling their family home to pay for their care. It is one of the reasons why many view the current system as unfair. \nThe care systems across the UK are increasingly different in the way they operate, with England the least generous. \nFor instance, in Wales, no-one who is eligible for care at home is expected to pay more than \u00a3100 a week towards it. \nThe systems in Northern Ireland and Scotland are different for support at home and residential care.\nIn Northern Ireland, no-one over the age of 75 pays for home care.\nScotland provides free personal care for people who are assessed as needing support at home, whatever their age.\nIn Scottish care homes, people get free care if they have savings or assets of less than \u00a318,000. Those with savings and assets of between \u00a318,000 and \u00a328,750 have to fund part of their care on a sliding scale, while people with more than that have to fund their own care, apart from a \u00a3193.50 a week contribution towards personal care and \u00a387.10 a week towards nursing care.\nThese differences are reflected in the amount of money each nation spends per person on social care. There is no comparable data for Northern Ireland.\nThe UK has an ageing population and the pressures on the care system will only increase. While living longer is considered a positive, many older people will develop health conditions which mean they need help with day-to-day life.\nFor instance, the number of people with dementia in the UK is expected to more than double to 1.6 million by 2040. \nThe Alzheimer's Society has estimated that without local authority help, someone with dementia will typically have to spend \u00a3100,000 on the care they need.\nFor a long time they have called this a \"dementia tax\", as someone who develops the disease will have to cover their own costs until their assets are reduced to \u00a323,250 - the threshold for qualifying for local authority help in England. \nBut the growth in people needing care is fastest among working-age adults, rather than over-65s.  According to the Kings Fund, care for working-age adults is nearly twice as expensive as for older people.\nThere is a knock-on effect for the health service if the care system is supporting fewer people, and only those with the highest needs. \nSomeone struggling to cope on their own is more likely to have a fall or neglect themselves, meaning they end up in hospital emergency departments. \nThen, when they are ready to leave hospital, a lack of social care in the community can lead to them being stuck in a hospital bed for longer than required. \nThis is why experts say the future of the NHS is tied to creating an effective social care system.\nFinding sufficient people willing to take on the challenging, yet rewarding, work of looking after people in their own home, or in care homes, is a continuing problem. \nThe latest official data for England shows there are 112,000 vacancies - over 7% of the social care workforce in England. \nNearly a quarter of the 1.5 million people working in the sector are on zero-hours contracts (when employees are not guaranteed a full working week) and pay is often the minimum wage. \nMany argue that improving the pay and skills of the workforce is vital to encourage people to consider care work as a career. Increasingly, social care workers are carrying out tasks that would once have been done by trained nurses. \nThis article was first published in November 2019 and has been updated to reflect recent statistics."

      "text": "A new study shows that increases in extreme winter weather in parts of the US are linked to accelerated warming of the Arctic. \nThe scientists found that heating in the region ultimately disturbed the circular pattern of winds known as the polar vortex.\nThis allowed colder winter weather to flow down to the US, notably in the Texas cold wave in February. \nThe authors say that warming will see more cold winters in some locations.\nOver the past four decades, satellite records have shown how increasing global temperatures have had a profound effect on the Arctic. \nWarming in the region is far more pronounced than in the rest of the world, and has caused a rapid shrinkage of summer sea ice.\nScientists have long been concerned about the implications of this amplification of global change for the rest of the planet. \nThis new study indicates that the warming in the Arctic is having a significant impact on winter weather in both North America and East Asia. \nThe researchers detail a complex meteorological chain that connects this warmer region to a rotating pattern of cold air known as the polar vortex.\nThe authors show that the melting of ice in the Barents and Kara seas leads to increased snowfall over Siberia and a transfer of excess energy that impacts the swirling winds in the stratosphere above the North Pole. \nThe heat ultimately causes a stretching of the vortex which then enables extremely cold weather to flow down to the US.\nThere has been an increase in these stretching events since satellite observations began in 1979.\nThe scientists believe this vortex stretching process led to the deadly Texas cold wave in February this year. \n\"We're arguing that melting sea ice across Northwest Eurasia, coupled with increased snowfall across Siberia is leading to a strengthening of the temperature difference from west to east across the Eurasian continent,\" explained lead author Dr Judah Cohen, who's a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a director of Atmospheric and Environmental Research, a weather risk management company.  \n\"We know when that temperature difference increases, that leads to more disruptions of the polar vortex. And when it's weakened, that leads to more extreme winter weather such as the Texas cold wave last February.\"\nThe researchers say that their findings are based on both observations and modelling and they show a physical link between climate change in the Arctic, the stretching of the polar vortex and the impacts on ground.\nThe authors believe their work could improve predictions about the onset of extreme cold winter events. \n\"One of the benefits of this study is that if you recognise these precursors and you know the conditions that are favourable for triggering such event, then you get to extend your forecast lead time,\" said Dr Cohen.\n\"In Texas, people could have certainly prepared better with better warnings, some people froze to death in their homes and perhaps they could have gone to seek shelter.\"\nLooking at the bigger picture, the research team believes that their findings will help people understand that global warming is complex and perhaps dispel the idea that colder winters mean climate change isn't happening.  \n\"There has been a long-standing apparent contradiction between the warmer temperatures globally, however, an apparent increase in cold extremes for the United States and in northern Eurasia. And this study helps to resolve this contradiction,\" said fellow author, Prof Chaim Garfinkel from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\"In the past, these cold extremes over the US and Russia have been used to justify not reducing carbon, but there's no longer any excuse to not start reducing emissions right away.\"\nThe study has been published in the journal Science.\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "text": "One of the UK's largest suppliers of seasonal flu vaccines has said there will be a delay in jab deliveries to some GP surgeries due to issues related to a shortage of HGV drivers.\nSeqirus, one of the world's largest flu vaccine companies, said it had told customers about delays of up to a fortnight.\nThe company said it was \"working hard to resolve the delay\".\nNHS England says patients who are affected will be contacted by their GP.\nSeqirus, which supplies vaccines to GP practices and pharmacies in England and Wales, said: \"Due to unforeseen challenges linked with road freight delays, we have informed all our customers of a consequent delay to their scheduled vaccine delivery by a maximum of one to two weeks.\nThe company, which is one of a number of suppliers, said customers would be able to reschedule their flu vaccination clinics.\nThe professional body representing GPs said it would hit practices.\n\"This is news we really didn't want to hear\", said Dr Gary Howsam, vice chairman of the Royal College of GPs.\n\"With more than 36 million people eligible for the flu vaccine on the NHS this year, GPs need the supply chain to run like clockwork.\nDr Howsam said GPs are \"already under enormous pressure and still waiting for details of how the Covid booster campaign will align with everything else they need to do this winter\".\nDoctors meticulously plan jabs each year, he said, adding that it is \"essential that as many people as possible in at-risk groups get their vaccination as early into the flu season as possible\".\n\"A delay of even a couple of weeks is going to have a big impact on practices and their patients, especially when GPs are already dealing with the fallout caused by the shortage of blood test bottles and the anxiety this is causing.\"\n\"General practice and the entire NHS is dependent on the smooth roll-out of the winter flu vaccination programme. It cannot fail,\" he said.\nDoctors are already dealing with a shortage of blood test tube vials due to supply chain issues.\nDr Richard Vautrey, British Medical Association GP committee chairman, said the delay is likely to affect a \"significant proportion\" of practices - and have a \"serious impact\" on practice workloads and patients.\nHe said: \"Many practices will have spent the last few days and weeks meticulously planning for their flu vaccination programme, inviting and booking patients in for their jabs, only now to have to contact them all again to cancel or reschedule appointments.\n\"This causes a huge increase in staff's already unsustainable workloads, and inconvenience and unneeded anxiety for patients who will be keen to be protected ahead of winter.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: \"GPs are at their wits' end, first forced to cancel blood tests because of bottle shortages and now we learn flu vaccines will be delayed.\n\"This has been a summer of crisis for the NHS with patients paying the price.\n\"With winter coming and flu resurgence a huge risk, ministers must urgently get a grip.\""

      "tags": "European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The EU and UK-Swedish drug-maker AstraZeneca have settled a row over a shortfall in coronavirus vaccines that affected the European rollout earlier this year.\nAstraZeneca has agreed to deliver 200 million doses of its vaccine, which had been promised under a contract, to the EU by the end of March 2022.\nThe deal puts an end to the EU's pending action in the Belgian courts.\nThe EU said this week that 70% of adults had been double vaccinated.\nEarlier this year AstraZeneca angered European Commission officials when it said it could only deliver a fraction of the doses agreed for the first three months of 2021. \nThe bitter dispute overshadowed the initial weeks of the vaccine rollout across the EU's 27 countries. The Commission accused the company of breaking an August 2020 advanced purchase deal while AstraZeneca hit back arguing that the contract only required its \"best effort\" to deliver millions of vaccine doses on time.\nAstraZeneca's Covid vaccine, now known as Vaxzevria, has also been hit by age restrictions imposed by several EU countries because of very rare side effects. The EU's medicines agency made clear that the benefits outweighed the risks for all adult groups.\nThe delivery row was set to reach the Brussels courts at the end of September and Rudd Dobber of AstraZeneca said he was \"very pleased that we have been able to reach a common understanding\" with the Commission.\nEU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said there were still \"significant differences in vaccination rates between our member states, and the continued availability of vaccines, including AstraZeneca's, remains crucial\".\nUnder the settlement the two sides agreed that another 60 million doses would be delivered by the end of this month, a further 75 million by the end of December and a final 65 million by the end of March 2022.\nToday's agreement seems to resolve an acrimonious dispute that erupted at the start of the year just after the UK had fully and finally left the EU's rules and regulations. \nAt first, the row over the detailed legal contract wasn't directly linked to Brexit, but soon became part of it, with the European Commission seeking - for a time - to override part of the deal on Northern Ireland because of its perceived unlawful treatment. \nNow the language on both sides is constructive and conciliatory with AstraZeneca promising publicly a partial refund if its impending deliveries to EU countries are late. There will be a 10% rebate for a one-month delay, 25% for two months and 40% for three months. "

      "text": "The health minister has warned of a risk to patients if pharmaceutical firms go ahead with plans to withdraw medicines due to the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nNI gets most of its medicines from distributors in Great Britain, but is still covered by EU medicines rules.\nThat will make exporting medicines from GB to NI more difficult in January when a Protocol \"grace period\" ends.\nThe health department has been notified 910 medicines are due to be withdrawn.\nA further 2,400 are at risk.\nThere is no immediate risk to supplies and the health department has previously said people don't need to change their prescribing behaviour.\nMedicines suppliers must give six months notice when they intend to withdraw a product.\nIn a briefing paper, which has been circulated among ministers and senior officials in recent days, Stormont's Health Minister Robin Swann said he now had \"deep concerns about the risk to patient health and maintaining vital medical supplies\".\nHe is calling for a \"standstill\" which would mean an extension of the grace period.\nThe paper said the planned withdrawals \"cover all classifications of medicines, including prescription-only medicines, pharmacy and general sales list medicines\".\nAlmost 90% of the confirmed withdrawals are classified as high risk, meaning there is the potential for disruption and the need for some form of mitigation.\nThat mitigation could mean using alternative products or seeking alternative sources of supply.\nThe major issues are the need for additional batch testing for medicines moving from GB to NI and continued compliance with the EU's falsified medicines directive.\nEarlier this year the British Generic Manufacturers Association (BGMA) said these issues would make it commercially unviable to sell some products in Northern Ireland.\nThe EU has proposed measures to ease the problem but the UK government is sceptical about whether they are enough.\nInstead the UK has proposed that medicines should be completely removed from the scope of the Protocol with an extension of the grace period until that can be agreed.\nBut the two sides have not yet agreed on a way forward.\nMr Swann supports the UK government proposal to remove medicines from the Protocol but it is not clear if other Northern Ireland Executive parties share that view.\nStormont health committee chairman Colm Gildernew said there were issues of \"huge concern\" that required a \"focused piece of work\".\nWhen asked on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme if he supported Mr Swann's position that the best solution was to remove medicines from the scope of the protocol, Mr Gildernew said he was not clear on the potential impact of a joint position by the Executive but would meet with the minister to discuss the issue.\nHe said he believed the issue was \"too important for unilateral action\" and said he wanted \"dedicated and urgent bilateral negotiations building on the good will that exists\".\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in MLA said no one wanted to see medicines interrupted and that he understood the concerns and the uncertainty around it.\n\"I think this needs to be negotiated in good faith with the European Union. I believe all solutions need to be kept on the table but it is absolutely crucial that good will is maintained,\" he said.\nUlster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said the warning from Robin Swann should be a \"wake-up call\" for the EU and the UK government. \n\"This isn't scaremongering - it is the practical out-workings of the NI Protocol and there is a practical solution,\" he said. \n\"There is no immediate shortage of medicines, but if action isn't taken now that is exactly what we could be facing come the new year.\"\nThe DUP MLA Jonathan Buckley called the situation a \"fiasco\" and said it was \"immoral, unjustifiable and cannot be tolerated.\"\nHe added: \"The imposition of the protocol impacts and harms every single person in Northern Ireland.  It should be opposed by everyone.\"\nCommunity pharmacist Peter Rice, deputy chair of Community Pharmacy Northern Ireland, said he wanted to reassure patients that they did not see an immediate concern with medicine supply.\nHe said the situation was evolving and they were working to ensure Northern Ireland has parity and equal access to medication with the rest of the UK.\nSpeaking on Good Morning Ulster, he said they intended to continue to \"work tirelessly\" so patients do not need to be concerned.\nIt is the deal agreed by the UK and EU to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit.\nIt does this by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods.\nThis means goods don't have to checked as they cross the Irish border, instead some checks and controls are required on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.\nThis has caused difficulties for some businesses and is opposed by unionist parties in Northern Ireland, which say it undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position as part of the UK.\nIn July the UK published a \"command paper\" proposing radical changes to the protocol but the EU says it will not renegotiate."

      "text": "A British woman who reported being gang-raped in Cyprus hopes to have her conviction for lying about the attack overturned.\nThe woman, then 19, told Cypriot police she had been raped by a group of 12 Israeli men in Ayia Napa in July 2019.\nThe Derbyshire teenager retracted the allegation after being held without a lawyer, and was then tried and convicted of causing public mischief.\nHer appeal will now be heard by the Cypriot Supreme Court on 16 September.\nIf the conviction is not overturned her legal team intends to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\"She wants to get on with life, but for her to get on with life she needs to get this conviction overturned,\" said barrister Michael Polak, who is helping the woman in his role as director of the law firm Justice Abroad.\n\"This will be on her record. It means any time she applies to join an association or for a job she will be thinking back to this and what's happened to her.\n\"So it's very important to her, even though she's not in prison now, she's back in the United Kingdom, it's very important for her to overturn the conviction for that reason.\"\nHer case outraged women's rights groups, who protested outside court ahead of the sentencing in January 2020.\nJudge Michalis Papathanasiou gave the teenager a four-month suspended sentence, which meant she could return to the UK.\nShe will not have to return to Cyprus for the appeal hearing.\n\"We will be arguing that the conviction is unsafe for a number of reasons and we are hoping the Supreme Court will set aside the conviction,\" said Mr Polak.\nOne of these arguments will be that the judge did not consider evidence the woman really was raped.\n\"For public mischief you need to be making a false allegation and every time we brought forward evidence that the rape took place he would shout at our female Cypriot lawyers and say 'this is not a rape trial, this is not a rape trial',\" said Mr Polak.\n\"He did it about seven times during the trial process, so in effect he shut out any consideration that the rape had taken place, which meant he didn't properly consider all the elements of the offence.\"\nThe woman's mother said getting the conviction overturned would be \"the first step for my daughter reclaiming her life\".\n\"Imagine being raped then imprisoned because the authorities say you lied, after refusing to hear evidence to the contrary, then having to relive this each time you apply for a job or training course,\" she said.\n\"This is a terrible burden for my daughter, having such a terrible thing happen to her and then carrying a conviction against her name for life.\"\nShe said it was \"difficult to be optimistic about the outcome of the appeal\" given their experience of the courts in Cyprus.\n\"Our daughter was prevented from defending the case properly because of the trial court's unwillingness to hear evidence of the serious sexual offences that she was subjected to,\" she said.\n\"If this is understood then we have some hope that the legal minds in the Cypriot Supreme Court should acquit.\"\nIf that does not happen, she said they would \"take this matter to the European Court where we are certain that the justice will ultimately prevail\".\nAnother argument relates to the woman retracting the rape claim, which her lawyers say she did under pressure from police.\n\"She was there for almost seven hours without a lawyer, without her parents,\" said Mr Polak.\n\"European law is particularly strong on this. There's a case against Cyprus where a young teenager was taken into a police station in Limassol and a confession was taken from him with no lawyer.\n\"So in European law, the European Court of Human Rights has already decided that issue against Cyprus, and so we hope the Supreme Court will take account of that.\"\nMr Polak said the woman would ultimately like the men involved to be prosecuted, but for now her legal team is concentrating on getting her conviction overturned.\n\"It was a really horrendous experience for her and she, of course, would like to see justice done in this case,\" he said.\n\"The most important thing for the moment is to get the conviction overturned so she doesn't have to carry it around for the rest of her life.\n\"We hope the Cypriot Supreme Court will make the right decision when we go there in a few weeks, and we hope we don't have to take it all the way up to the European Court of Human Rights.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

The winner of the leadership election is widely expected to be Japan's leader as the LDP holds a parliamentary majority.\nThe 72-year-old, who was born to a family of strawberry farmers, was first elected to the Yokohama City Council in 1987, and in 1996 he was elected to Japan's Diet for the first time.\nIn 2005, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi appointed him senior vice minister of internal affairs and communication.\nThe following year, Mr Koizumi's successor Shinzo Abe promoted him to minister with three cabinet posts, which he held until 2007."

      "text": "Children aged 12 to 15 are to be offered a second dose of the Covid vaccine.\nIt's in response to concerns about the newly identified Omicron variant.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises the UK governments on vaccines - has said that 12 to 15-year-olds should be offered a second jab - to be given at least 12 weeks after the first.\nIt's one of of a number of measures the JCVI say should be carried out, in case the Omicron variant spreads more easily or is more severe than current types of Covid.\nChildren aged 16 and 17 are already being offered a second dose.\nEngland and Scotland have already said they will act on the JCVI's advice, and it is likely to be accepted in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nNo. When vaccination for 12-15s was first rolled out, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said it would be as an \"offer\".\nHe said young people and their parents needed to be supported, and there should be no stigma attached to their choice.\nHealthy children aged 12 to 17 are advised to wait 12 weeks after testing positive for coronavirus before having their Covid jab.\nA four-week gap applies to children who are deemed at higher risk because of underlying health conditions, or because they live with vulnerable adults.\nAlthough parental consent is being sought, children under 16 who can prove they understand the risks and benefits can ask for the vaccine - or refuse it - if they disagree with their parents.\nThis important legal test of whether a child can consent to treatment is known as \"Gillick competence\". It is named after a famous dispute in which a teenager wanted contraceptive advice without her mother's consent.\nIn practice, it would be extremely unusual for a child under 13 to be judged Gillick-competent.\nTeenagers aged 16 and 17 don't need parental permission, unless there are exceptional circumstances. \nUnder-18s are being given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although the Moderna vaccine has also been authorised for use in children in the UK.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for under-12s in the UK. \nThe MHRA - which regulates medicines in the UK - said today that despite initial concerns about side-effects in under-18s, monitoring and a \"thorough review\" had found the jab to be safe, with \"no new safety issues\". \nEarlier in the year, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were linked to extremely rare cases of heart inflammation in young men. However, the EMA said that the benefits of vaccination still far outweighed the risks. \nAlmost all children and young people are at very low risk from Covid-19. \nData for England suggests about 25 children died from Covid in the first 12 months of the pandemic. \nThe majority of them also had severe health problems, including complex neurodisabilities. \nOnly six had no recorded health conditions. \nIn the year to 31 August 2021, Public Health England statistics suggest there were about 50 deaths among under-19s.\nMany countries are vaccinating children over the age of 12.\nCorrection 21 September 2021: An earlier version of this article wrongly implied that the Gillick competence test was named after a case involving a mother and daughter and this line has been amended."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has launched a \"whole-of-government\" response to oppose a new law in Texas that bans most abortions. \nHe called the Supreme Court's decision not to block the law an \"unprecedented assault\" on women's rights.\nAny individual now has the right to sue anyone involved with providing or facilitating an abortion past six weeks of pregnancy in Texas.\nThis is before many women know they have conceived. \nRights groups had asked the Supreme Court to block the law, but it refused following a 5-4 vote. \nThe judges said their decision was not based on any conclusion about whether the Texas law was constitutional or not, and that the door remained open for legal challenges.\nOne of the liberal Supreme Court judges, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, said those justices who had allowed the law to stand had \"opted to bury their heads in the sand\" over a \"flagrantly unconstitutional law\".\nPresident Biden accused the court of unleashing \"unconstitutional chaos\". \"The highest court of our land will allow millions in Texas in need of critical reproductive care to suffer while courts sift through procedural complexities,\" he said.\nMr Biden said he had asked the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice to see what steps the national government could take to \"insulate women and providers\", but did not provide further details. \nHe said the law violated the landmark Roe v Wade case in 1973, in which the Supreme Court legalised abortion across the US. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that the president had long wanted to see the \"codification\" of Roe v Wade - which would mean Congress voting to make the precedent federal law. \nTexas' Republican Governor Greg Abbott has said his state will \"always defend the right to life\".\nThe ruling was welcomed by Dan Patrick, Texas's Republican lieutenant governor, who tweeted: \"A tremendous #prolife victory! This lifesaving legislation reflects Texas' pro-life beliefs and our continued commitment to protecting the most vulnerable.\"\nAbortion providers in Texas were also looking for ways to challenge the new law, while dealing with its immediate impact.\n\"It has been truly devastating,\" said Andrea Ferrigno of Whole Woman's Health.\nPatients have been \"talking about their despair and how they've felt pressured and rushed to make a decision\", she told the BBC. \nFor people already beyond the six-week deadline, she said Whole Women's Health had been offering information about what they could do next. \nBut she said the company was also \"regrouping and consulting with our legal counsel\" to decide on its next steps. \nIn the city of San Antonio, Planned Parenthood said it had paused its abortion services \"while this plays in the courts\".\nIts director of public affairs, Mara Posada, said they were \"getting calls and having to either let a person know that they cannot get an abortion after six weeks here in Texas, or if they are early enough in their pregnancy, we are referring them to a provider that is currently providing abortion care under the limits\". \nShe added that in the week leading up to the law coming into force, they had seen twice the normal number of patients. \nHope Hanzlik, 21, had an abortion earlier this week, five weeks into her pregnancy. Her abortion provider told her they were having trouble finding appointments for everyone and that she was fortunate to get one. \nThe so-called Texas Heartbeat Act prohibits abortions after what anti-abortion campaigners call a foetal heartbeat.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says the term \"heartbeat\" is misleading, and that what is being detected at this stage is \"a portion of the foetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops\".\nThe Texas law enforces its ban with an uncommon approach: it empowers any private citizen to sue anyone who \"aids and abets\" an illegal abortion. \nThis means that an American may now be able to seek up to $10,000 (\u00a37,200) in damages in a civil court against abortion providers and doctors - and possibly anyone involved in the process. People like clinic staff, family members, or clergy who encourage or support the procedure could, in theory, be sued.\nTurning over enforcement of the Heartbeat Act to private citizens instead of government officials likely means that - in the absence of Supreme Court intervention - the law cannot be challenged until a private citizen seeks damages.\nThe legislation makes an exception in the case of medical emergency, which requires written proof from a doctor, but not for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.\nTexan women who wish to have an abortion after six weeks will need to travel to other states. \nAbortions were made legal across the US in a landmark 1973 Supreme Court judgement, often referred to as the Roe v Wade case.\nBy a vote of seven to two, the court justices ruled that individual state governments lacked the power to prohibit abortions.\nThe court's judgement was based on the decision that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy came under the freedom of personal choice in family matters as protected by the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.\nThe ruling came after a 25-year-old single woman, Norma McCorvey under the pseudonym \"Jane Roe\", challenged the criminal abortion laws in Texas that forbade most abortions.\nHenry Wade was the Texas attorney general who defended the anti-abortion law.\nThe case created the \"trimester\" system that:"

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Vaccine passports",
      "text": "People in Scotland can now download or receive a paper QR code showing their Covid vaccination status.\nThe change comes after plans to require vaccine passports for nightclubs and large events were announced. \nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf said the codes would allow people without smartphones to show they had been vaccinated if the scheme is approved by the Scottish Parliament.\nThe free documents can be downloaded from the NHS Inform website. \nThey can also be posted to people requesting them by phone. \nThe scannable images, or 2D barcodes, are being added to all vaccination records requested from Friday. \nVaccinated children over 12 will only be able to request a copy of their vaccination status by phoning the Covid-19 Status Helpline. \nOn Wednesday, Nicola Sturgeon announced plans for vaccine passports to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from the end of September. \nThe plans, which go before MSPs next week, would apply to indoor and outdoor events.\nWhen similar plans for England were outlined by the UK government over the summer, senior Scottish government figures including Mr Yousaf and Deputy First Minister John Swinney said they did not believe vaccine passports were the way to go in Scotland.\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrats and Scottish Labour have also criticised the proposals ahead of next week's vote in the Scottish Parliament., with Labour leader Anas Sarwar saying the government was using a \"knee-jerk reaction\" to cover for the fact it was losing control of the virus. \nAnd the Scottish Conservatives have accused the government of wasting months that could have been used to plan for the introduction of the scheme, before pulling a \"striking u-turn\" at the last minute that was causing confusion for businesses and the public over how it will work.\nBut the first minister said vaccine passports were needed to help stem the recent surge in the number of cases in Scotland, which she described as \"extremely concerning\".\nLatest figures showed a further 6,107 people had tested positive, with the number of people in hospital doubling in the past 10 days.\nSeveral areas of Scotland are also among the regions with the highest rates of the virus in Europe.\nMr Yousaf told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme on Thursday that he now believed that \"the benefits of a certification scheme, in terms of a public health intervention, in terms of incentivising vaccination, those benefits outweigh the concerns that still remain\".\nHe said adding QR codes to paper or PDF records would resolve the problem of people who did not have smartphones being unable to access the vaccine passports.\nMeanwhile, Mr Swinney told Holyrood's Covid-19 recovery committee earlier this week that the government hoped to increase the uptake of vaccines in younger people. \nLatest estimates for the proportion of 18 to 29-year-olds who are unvaccinated stand at 25.6% in Scotland, but 50.8% of 16 to 17-year-olds have now received their first dose.\n\"What we have to balance that against is the likelihood that unless we take action to further improve vaccination levels, we may have to take action at a later stage which may lead to the application of further restrictions,\" Mr Swinney said. \nHe acknowledged there was a \"pretty fine line\" between some venues being a pub or a nightclub, and said the issue would be discussed with the sector in the coming days.\nA vaccination status record is a document showing proof of vaccination, but it is not yet legally required to gain access to venues within Scotland. \nIt is, however, already required for travel to some countries. Within the UK, it can be used to show Covid-19 status instead of providing a negative PCR or lateral flow test to enter some venues such as theatres. \nWhereas in England and Wales people have been able to use the NHS app to show their vaccination status, those in Scotland have to request a record of vaccination online or by phone. This can be sent in the post or downloaded as a PDF to be printed out or shown on a smartphone. \nOld copies of vaccination status records will still be valid at this stage unless they are to be used in a country that requires the QR codes. \nThe documents can be obtained by anyone over the age of 12 who has been vaccinated in Scotland, although under-16s cannot apply online.\nScottish residents who were vaccinated in other parts of the UK Common Travel area (including the Channel Islands and Ireland), will also be able to request the document. \nThose who moved to or from Scotland between doses will need to request proof of the other dose from the country they were vaccinated in, as they would if they had received two doses in another country. \nRepresentatives of sporting and entertainment venues expecting to be affected by the vaccine passports have questioned their use. \nScottish Professional Football League (SPFL) chief executive Neil Doncaster previously said there would be \"significant unintended consequences\" for clubs.\nAnd Mike Grieve, director of the Night-Time Industries Association Scotland, told the BBC the policy was \"incoherent\" and \"inconsistent\" as, for instance, a large pub could let hundreds of people in without the passports but they would be required at a small nightclub next door.\nThe proposed rules would affect many sporting events in Scotland, particularly football matches, as well as concerts and music festivals.\nPeople over the age of 18 would need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to nightclubs and adult entertainment venues, unseated indoor events with more than 500 people in the audience, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event which has more than 10,000 people in attendance.\nAnyone who has good reasons for not getting fully vaccinated - including children and people with particular medical conditions - would be exempt from supplying a vaccine passport.\nFrance, Italy and Ireland are among the countries that have already introduced certification."

If we find that firms have been misleading customers and failing to provide the service that people have paid for, we stand ready to take action.   \n\"Our actions today are the next steps in our work to ensure the PCR testing market works for consumers and we are preparing to take further action in this sector.\" \nTests cost about \u00a375 per person on average in the UK, but there are reports of some being offered for as little as \u00a320, and others more than \u00a3500.\nThere have also been reports that some government authorised providers have not got full accreditation.\nEarlier this week the government said it was warning 82 firms that they could be removed from its list of authorised providers if they advertise misleading prices."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow.\nThe UK's vaccine advisory body has refused to give the green light to vaccinating healthy children aged 12 to 15 years old on health grounds alone. As children are at such low risk from the virus, they decided that vaccination would offer only \"marginal gain\" and, therefore, there was \"insufficient\" evidence to offer mass vaccination for this age group. But the JCVI said the government could consider wider issues including disruption to schools. Meanwhile, an extra 200,000 teenagers with underlying conditions will now be eligible for two doses.\nThe EU and UK-Swedish drug-maker AstraZeneca have settled a row over a shortfall in coronavirus vaccines that affected the European rollout earlier this year. AstraZeneca has agreed to deliver 200 million doses of its vaccine, which had been promised under a contract, to the EU by the end of March 2022. Earlier this year AstraZeneca angered European Commission officials when it said it could only deliver a fraction of the doses agreed for the first three months of 2021. The commission accused the company of breaking an August 2020 advanced purchase deal while AstraZeneca hit back, arguing that the contract only required its \"best effort\" to deliver millions of vaccine doses on time.\nOfficials have opened an investigation into PCR testing firm Expert Medicals following complaints that Covid test results had not been provided on time or at all. The competition watchdog warned a further 19 firms about advertising misleading prices. It comes after a review that found customers often faced poor service, hidden fees and refund issues.\nAustralia says it has secured an extra four million doses of the Pfizer vaccine from the UK in a swap deal. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the extra vaccines will help his country come out of its lockdowns sooner. About half of Australia's population is currently in lockdown due to outbreaks in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. Under the deal, Australia will send the same number of doses back to the UK later in the year.\nA collection of 51 statues has gone on display as a gesture of thanks to NHS staff and other key workers in the pandemic. The feature, named Gratitude, will remain on show in Manchester's St Peter's Square until 12 September, before it is taken to Edinburgh and London. The statues, each decorated by a different artist, will eventually be auctioned to raise money for NHS Charities Together.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nWith experts recommending a third Covid vaccine for those with severely weakened immune systems who are over 12, here's what you need to know about the vaccine and booster jabs.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Dominic Raab,Afghanistan,Ben Wallace",
      "text": "Evacuation flights from Afghanistan could resume \"in the near future\", the UK's foreign secretary says, after talks with leaders in Qatar.\nDominic Raab is in the country to discuss allowing more British nationals and Afghan allies to leave Afghanistan.\nAsked when Kabul airport could reopen, Mr Raab said: \"that's looking like it may happen at some point in the near future\".\nIt is currently out of action following the withdrawal of US troops last week.\nMr Raab's Qatari counterpart said he hoped for \"good news\" on its reopening \"in the next few days\". \nSheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani added that Qatar was working with the Taliban to ensure it was operational \"as soon as possible\".\nThe Gulf state, which has hosted the Taliban's political office for eight years, is seen as a key link between the West and the group.\nSpeaking after meetings with politicians in Doha, Mr Raab said the UK would not recognise the Taliban \"any time in the foreseeable future\".\nBut he said there was a need for \"direct engagement\" with the group, to ensure UK nationals and Afghan allies could leave Afghanistan.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson later underlined that message, telling reporters that if the Taliban wanted to engage with the West \"then the first priority for them for us is safe passage for those who want to leave\".\nDominic Raab told a news conference that co-operation on border crossings would be an \"important first test\" of the Taliban's relationship with the West.\nAnd he admitted the UK must \"adjust to the new reality\" after their rapid takeover of Afghanistan after the US withdrawal. \nAfter talks with Mr Raab, Sheikh Mohammed said there was not yet a \"clear indication\" of when Kabul airport would reopen. \nBut he told reporters: \"We are working very hard [and] we remain hopeful that we will be able to operate it as soon as possible.\nHe added that Qatar was also in discussions with Turkey, to see if it could provide \"any technical assistance on that front\".\nAt the start of a tour of the region, Mr Raab held talks with Sheikh Mohammed, along with the Emir of Qatar. \nBritish officials have been meeting senior Taliban leaders in Doha and they will brief the foreign secretary on the outcome of those talks. \nThe Foreign Office said the British embassy to Afghanistan, which moved out of Kabul last week, was now up and running in Doha.\nSpeaking to broadcasters, Mr Raab said the UK was working with neighbouring countries to ensure the \"basic logistics\" are in place to allow people to leave Afghanistan.\nThe last UK plane flying people out of Kabul took off on Saturday, with the US following on days later to stick to the 31 August deadline pledged by US President Joe Biden.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Raab said more than 17,000 people had been evacuated by the UK from Afghanistan so far, including over 5,000 UK nationals.\nBut it is feared hundreds eligible for relocation were left behind, although Mr Raab has estimated the number of UK nationals still in Afghanistan was in the \"low hundreds\". \nHe has said he cannot give a precise figure of the number of eligible Afghans who wanted to leave but were unable to get on evacuation flights. \nThese groups include Afghan nationals and their families who worked with British forces during their time in the country and asylum seekers who could be eligible to come to the UK under international law. \nMr Raab's trip to Qatar came after he was grilled by MPs on the Commons foreign affairs committee on Wednesday about the UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan.\nThe foreign secretary defended his handling of the crisis, saying the UK was \"caught out\" by the speed of the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, with intelligence at the time suggesting it would hold out until the end of the year.\nBut the committee's chairman, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, said a Foreign Office risk report from 22 July predicted a \"very real danger of cities collapsing\" after US forces withdrew.\nThe Foreign Office said it was a standard monthly report that did not contain intelligence assessments.\nIts statement added: \"The July document makes clear that our central planning assumption at the time was that the peace process in Afghanistan would run for up to a further six months.\"\nSpeaking later at a military base in Essex, Boris Johnson said: \"I think it's been clear for many months that the situation could be very fast and that has been part of the intelligence briefing. There have also been suggestions as you know that the Afghan National Defence force might hold on for longer, but logically you can see what happened.\" \nHe added that once the Afghan army felt they no longer had American air cover then \"things did go faster\".\nIn an interview in the Spectator published on Wednesday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he had argued as early as July that the previous Afghan government would fall.\n'It was a bit of a shock when [regional city] Herat fell,\" he told the magazine. \n\"Some of these big places had historically been resistant to the Taliban. When they fell, literally without a fight, I think the game was up.\n\"I remember back in July arguing that whatever we think, the game is up and we have to do what we can to accelerate whatever we're doing.\"\nHe added: \"When the actual moment came in Afghanistan, intelligence hadn't failed. It was just limited, as it always is at the very end.\"\nOn Thursday, Mr Raab insisted he and Mr Wallace had been \"taking the same assessment throughout until very late\".\n\"We were all working to the same set of assumptions,\" he added.

Industry bodies estimate there is a shortfall of about 100,000 workers.\nOn Thursday, Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability from the British Retail Consortium told the UK Trade and Business Commission food manufacturing was under severe strain because of shortages of HGV drivers and other supply chain staff, meaning that some production might have to move out of the UK.\nThe British Frozen Food Federation's chief executive, Richard Harrow, told the commission he was concerned that smaller food businesses like wholesalers and catering firms were missing out because haulage companies were having to prioritise bigger customers like supermarkets. \n\"Many wholesalers have seen their businesses close down during the pandemic with the restaurant industry closed, and so they had a very difficult period,\" he said. \"Now they're coming out of that and seeing strong demand, but they're struggling to get drivers and struggling to get deliveries.\n\"If you're a haulage company and you're restricted because of drivers, you're going to go where the work is easiest. If you're then being asked to drop a number of different pallets in different locations to smaller wholesalers, it ticks the 'too difficult to do' box', so I think they will be disproportionately impacted,\" Mr Harrow added. \nHowever, wholesalers point to a number of other factors that are also threatening to push up prices.\nDavid Josephs, owner of All Greens Wholesale, a fruit and vegetable importer and wholesaler in London, said Brexit had been the biggest cause of additional costs for his business.\n\"We have an operation out of Milan, we ship twice a week, and just those two shipments a week coming out of Milan, the paperwork, purely the paperwork, is costing us an additional \u20ac52,000 (\u00a344,650) a year,\" he told the BBC. \n\"But with Covid now as well, growers around Europe have been affected with labour shortages and therefore, goods haven't been picked out of the ground and therefore there is a shortage.\"\nBad weather had also reduced crop yields, he added.\nWeek to 27 August 2021, compared with week to 28 August 2020\nWhich have gone up in price?\nWhich have gone down in price?\nSource: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"

So much love to Richard E Grant and all the family.\"\nActor Jason Watkins, who recently played Harold Wilson in The Crown, also paid tribute, saying: \"I owe her everything.\"\nHe added: \"The incomparable Joan Washington has died. Joan taught me dialects and accents when I trained at Rada and beyond. \n\"I have made my career using accents and dialects. Such a terrible loss to Richard E Grant and us all. Rest in peace.\"\nComedian and actor Chris Addison also worked with Washington. \"What a huge loss to the world,\" he said. \"The wonderful Joan Washington has left us. She lit up many a film set and many a life. \n\"Urbane, funny, unflappable, deeply knowledgeable and wildly talented. The secret sauce in a million performances.\"\nSinger Elaine Paige said the news was \"heartbreaking\", and that \"she was special both as a teacher and as a friend.

It was a privilege to know her and have been in her orbit. And your guys' love story is just an inspiration \u2764\ufe0f\"\nMad Max and The Favourite actor Nicholas Hoult added: \"I can never thank her enough for all her kindness, the lessons she taught me and the memories I'll cherish.\"\nFearne Cotton also expressed her sadness, along with actors David Thewlis and James D'Arcy.\nGrant, who recently appeared in Disney+'s Loki TV series, was Oscar-nominated in 2019 for the film Can You Ever Forgive Me? He met Aberdeen-born Washington in 1982 after she worked with him on a series of regional British dialects. \nIn a joint interview with the Independent in 2011, Grant recalled their first meeting, saying: \"I met her at the Actors' Centre in London. She was wearing a boiler suit and had fairly short, cropped hair and Kicker shoes, and was chain-smoking, which I thought was insane.\n\"She was teaching an accent session with a bunch of actors, and I thought she had the most wonderful voice and huge, sort of monkey eyes. She seemed fairly frenetic. I thought that she was really cute and all that.\"\nThe actor also has a stepson, Tom, who is Washington's son from a previous marriage. "

      "text": "The US Federal Aviation Administration has grounded Virgin Galactic missions as it investigates how Sir Richard Branson's recent space flight drifted off course during its climb skyward.\nThe British billionaire fulfilled a lifetime ambition on 11 July by riding his rocket plane to 86km in altitude.\nBut the New Yorker magazine has revealed how the vehicle flew for a period outside its pre-agreed airspace.\nSir Richard's company has disputed the New Yorker's description of events.\nThe rocket plane, known as Unity or SpaceShipTwo, which carried Sir Richard aloft, landed safely.\nIn a short statement, the FAA said it was overseeing the investigation of the \"July 11 SpaceShipTwo mishap that occurred over Spaceport America, New Mexico.\n\"Virgin Galactic may not return the SpaceShipTwo vehicle to flight until the FAA approves the final mishap investigation report or determines the issues related to the mishap do not affect public safety,\" it added.\nIn response to the FAA announcement, Virgin Galactic told the BBC it was cooperating fully with the aviation administration.\nIt took such issues very seriously, it said, and was working to determine how to prevent trajectory deviations from occurring on future missions. \nThursday saw the company announce details of the next Unity flight - a research outing for the Italian Air Force.\nThis had been scheduled for the end of September or early October, but must now await the results of the FAA probe.\nThe New Yorker article was penned by Nicholas Schmidle, who's written a book about Sir Richard's near two-decade effort to develop a rocket plane capable of taking fare-paying passengers above Earth's atmosphere.\nMr Schmidle's magazine story said the pilots on the 11 July flight - with Sir Richard and three other company employees sitting behind them - received cockpit warnings about the off-course trajectory of their rocket-powered ascent.\nLeft uncorrected, this shallower than planned climb to altitude could have left Unity unable to reach its landing location on the glide back down to Earth. Mr Schmidle claims company protocols for the cockpit warnings would normally have led to the pilots aborting the ascent, but that they pressed on instead.\nVirgin Galactic had earlier on Thursday rejected what it described as \"mischaracterisations\" in the New Yorker's article.\nThe company said its pilots had encountered unexpected winds at high altitude and took the necessary actions to complete a safe climb to space and return to Earth.\n\"Although the flight's ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity to successfully reach space and land safely at our spaceport in New Mexico,\" a company spokesperson told the BBC.\n\"At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory, and at no time did the ship travel above any population centres or cause a hazard to the public.\" \nThe spokesperson said FAA representatives were present in the ground control room during the flight and in the post-flight debriefs.\nThe New Yorker magazine told the BBC it stood by its account of what happened on the day.\nWhen Unity's next mission will now occur is anyone's guess.\nThis is meant to take aloft three Italian nationals - Walter Villadei and Angelo Landolfi from the Italian Air Force; and Pantaleone Carlucci, an Italian national research council engineer. \nThe men plan to conduct 13 scientific experiments during the flight, and in particular during those few minutes of weightlessness they'll experience at the top of Unity's climb.\nUnder the plan, the Italians are to be supervised in the back of the rocket plane by Virgin Galactic's chief astronaut instructor, Beth Moses. If and when it happens, the flight will be her third to the edge of space.\nThe Virgin Galactic pilots up front in the rocket plane are designated to be Michael Masucci and CJ Sturckow. Masucci was also in the cockpit for the 11 July mission, along with the company's chief pilot, David Mackay.\nAfter this next mission, Virgin Galactic is expected to enter an extended period of maintenance and upgrades for both Unity and its carrier/launch plane, known as Eve.\nIf the schedule is not disrupted by the latest FAA ban, these vehicles are expected to resume space missions by the middle of next year. The company said one further test outing would be conducted before full commercial service began, probably in the second half of 2022.\nSome 600 individuals put down deposits a number of years ago to buy seat tickets costing $200,000-250,000. Tickets sales resumed last month with prices from $450,000 (\u00a3325,000) per seat."

      "tags": "Auckland,Islamic State group,Sri Lanka,New Zealand",
      "text": "Police in New Zealand shot and killed a \"violent extremist\" after he stabbed and wounded at least six people in an Auckland supermarket. \nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the incident was a \"terrorist attack\" carried out by a Sri Lankan national who was under police surveillance.\nThe man, who has not been officially named, was a supporter of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group, she said. \nPolice killed the man within 60 seconds of the attack on Friday.\n\"What happened today was despicable, it was hateful it was wrong,\" Ms Ardern said in a news conference. \"It was carried out by an individual, not a faith.\"\nOf the six wounded people, three are in a critical condition and one is in a serious condition, health officials say.\n\"The hospital staff are doing everything they can to preserve their lives,\" Auckland Mayor Phil Goff told the BBC. \n\"We're all horrified by what's happened. But... justice came pretty swiftly for the offender,\" he added.\nIt happened at the Countdown supermarket at LynnMall in the Auckland district of New Lynn on Friday afternoon.\nPolice commissioner Andrew Coster said a surveillance team and a specialist tactics group had followed the man from his home to the supermarket. But while there were concerns about the him, officials said they had no reason to think he was planning an attack on Friday, and the team believed he was going to do his grocery shopping.\nAfter entering the store, however, the attacker got hold of a knife and went on a stabbing spree.\nShopper Michelle Miller told local news outlet Stuff that the man was \"running around like a lunatic\" and attacking people.\n\"All I heard was a lot of screaming,\" she said.\n\"[People were] running out, hysterically, just screaming, yelling, scared,\" another witness said, adding that he saw an elderly man lying on the ground with a stab wound.\nWitnesses also said the attacker had shouted \"Allahu akbar\" (God is greatest). \nMr Coster said police rushed over upon hearing the commotion and shot and killed the attacker when he charged at the officers with the knife.\nFootage from the supermarket shared online showed people fleeing before the sound of gun shots could be heard.\nAnalysis by Phil Mercer, BBC News\nThis callous act in Auckland will stir painful memories of the deadly mosque attacks in Christchurch in 2019.\nIn that attack, a lone gunman - a self-confessed white supremacist - murdered 51 worshippers.  Once again, New Zealand's geographic isolation and peaceful reputation have proved to be no defence against extremism. \nThe assailant had, for years, been identified as a threat to national security and was under 24-hour surveillance. \nThe police acted decisively to prevent further carnage, but they weren't close enough to stop serious injuries.  New terror laws could, however, allow volatile individuals to be detained in the future.  \nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has sent a message of support: Kia Kaha New Zealand, he wrote, using Maori words. Stay strong.\nThe man, whose identity cannot be revealed due to court suppression orders, arrived in New Zealand in October 2011. He became a person of national security interest in 2016.\nHe had been under round-the-clock monitoring and heavy surveillance due to concerns about his ideology. He was known to multiple agencies, and was also on a terror watchlist.\nLocal media reports said the attacker was 32 years old and had recently been sentenced to one year of supervision for possessing IS propaganda.\nProsecutors had accused him of plotting a \"lone wolf\" terror attack using knives, but the judge ruled that planning a terror attack was not in itself an offence under existing laws, the reports said. \nHis internet search history and bookmarks included heroes of Isis, Islamic State dress, and New Zealand prison clothes and food, according to Stuff.\nMs Ardern said that until Friday, he had not committed any offence. When asked about the man's motivations, she said they were \"Isis-inspired\". \nQuestions have been raised about why action against him was not taken before six people were injured - especially since he was under close surveillance. \n\"The reality is, that when you are surveilling someone on a 24/7 basis, it is not possible to be immediately next to them at all times. The staff intervened as quickly as they could and they prevented further injury in what was a terrifying situation,\" said Mr Coster.\nHe added that the attacker was very surveillance-conscious, and that teams needed to maintain a distance to be effective. \nAuthorities are confident the attacker was acting alone and that there is no further danger to the community, according to Mr Coster. \nWere you in the area? Did you witness the incident? If it is safe to do so please share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

      "tags": "Cardiff,Welsh government,Newport,Climate change,Environment,M4 motorway,Pontypridd",
      "text": "The idea of tolls for some drivers on two of Wales' busiest stretches of road has been raised by Welsh government.\nIt asked for the public's views in a survey about some motorists paying to use parts of the M4 motorway and A470 in a bid to tackle air pollution.\nThe survey asked for views on tolls for older cars on the M4 around Newport, Wales' busiest stretch of motorway, and the A470 around Pontypridd. \nBut the survey said a \"clean air zone\" is not proposed \"at this stage\".\nAn air pollution expert said any suggestion would be unlike any other air pollution measure in the UK, which normally charges motorists for driving into cities rather on stretches of road.\nThe Welsh government has declared a climate emergency and has committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.\nThe government survey asked drivers if their commuting or travelling habits would change if some vehicles had to pay to use those stretches of road.\nThe survey discussed a toll for petrol cars registered before 2006 and diesels plated before September 2015.\nIt suggested a charge from January 2023 for the M4 between junctions 25 and 26 through the congestion pinch point at the Brynglas Tunnels in Newport and between Pontypridd and Upper Boat on the A470 in Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nWhile it costs to cross some bridges or use some tunnels in the UK, the only toll road is the M6 toll road north of Birmingham which was built to alleviate traffic congestion on motorways in the West Midlands.\nA clean air zone is already in place in Birmingham, while London has a similar ultra low emission zone scheme.\nRespondents to the Welsh government survey on a possible clean air toll were presented with pricing options ranging from \u00a33 to \u00a38 for cars and from \u00a36 to \u00a312.50 for light goods vehicles.\nIt asked if drivers would switch to public transport, change destination or route, pay the charge, switch cars or not travel at all.\nNon-exempt heavy goods vehicle drivers have been asked for their response to a charge of \u00a350.\nThe survey explained if such a charge was to be implemented, it would be a \"single charge applied on a daily basis\".\nSpeed limits of 50mph (80km/h) are already in place on the two roads in an effort to tackle air pollution.\nRespondents were told that pollution levels at the two areas under discussion were above legal limits, so the Welsh government \"has been assessing potential solutions and packages of measures to improve air quality and protect the health of people\".\n\"This work is necessary as the Welsh government are legally required to improve air quality and reduce harmful levels of nitrogen dioxide in the shortest possible time and whilst at this stage a clean air zone is not proposed at these locations, all potential options must be developed should they be required in the future,\" the survey added.\nAir pollution expert Dr Jordan White of Earthsense said a suggestion to put a clean air or low emissions charge on a stretch of road rather than in a city centre would be unique in the UK.\n\"It's very different from other clean air zones across the UK,\" he said.\n\"More typically it would be to try to stop cars or highly emitting vehicles getting into the city centres, whereas this is for a very very particular roads.\n\"It's a different approach but it comes from good intentions because these two stretches of road are very, very bad, the air quality is poor in these areas.\"\nBut there are concerns such a charge could hit the poorest in society.\nCouncillor Sam Trask, chairman of Rhondda Cynon Taf Conservatives, was one of those asked to complete the survey.\n\"I drive a nine-year-old diesel car and, were I able to afford one, I'd already be driving a less-polluting car.\n\"I feel that if the Welsh government are going to charge me to use a road that I normally use twice a day to go back and forth to work, then they're actually going to put that aspiration even further out of reach and I'm going to be even less likely to be able to afford a better car.\n\"I think if these proposals were to go ahead, they would adversely affect the poorest in our society unfairly because these are the kinds of people who can't afford a more modern electric car.\"\nBusiness leaders have also warned that tolls on roads would \"just move the problem and the pollution problem elsewhere.\"\n\"When you look at tolls on other roads, the M6 for instance, it's an alternative,\" Kevin Ward from Newport Now Business Improvement District told BBC Radio Wales\n\"This wouldn't be an alternative because actually what we'd do is just move the problem and the pollution problem elsewhere.\n\"What we're talking about in Newport is the area around the Brynglas tunnel, the bottleneck on the M4, the area that the M4 relief road was supposed to alleviate and that's now dead in the water.\n\"I almost feel like the Welsh government are flailing around trying to come up with other solutions to that problem and I'm not sure that tolling is the answer.\"\nHe said there needed to be range of solutions including a better public transport system in south Wales with a \u00a3750m metro set to be completed in 2023.\nA Welsh government spokeswoman said there were \"currently no plans for congestion charges\".\n\"In a separate piece of work, in line with our legal obligations to reduce harmful levels of nitrogen dioxide, we have commissioned surveys to gain people's views on clean air zone proposals on the M4 between junctions 25 and 26 in Newport and on the A470 between Upper Boat and Pontypridd,\" she added.\nThe survey ran until 31 August by which time 3,017 responses had been completed."

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All children aged 12 to 15 in the UK are to be offered one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab. \nIt follows a recommendation from the UK's four chief medical officers that vaccinating them would help reduce disruption to their schooling this winter and benefit those growing up in the poorest areas.\nThe UK's advisory body, the JCVI, said there was only a marginal benefit to vaccinating adolescents on health grounds alone and stopped short of recommending it - but it did advise vaccinating children over 12 with specific underlying health conditions who are at greater risk.\nThere is general agreement that this was a really tricky call to make.\nStrong opinions have been expressed on all sides, by scientists, doctors, teachers and parents alike.\nThe JCVI focused squarely on the health benefits of vaccination to children themselves - not on the impact to their schooling or other people.\nChildren's risk from Covid isn't zero but the chances of them becoming seriously ill from Covid are incredibly small. Deaths among healthy children are extremely rare - most have life-limiting health conditions.\nThat means there needs to be a clear and obvious advantage to giving them a jab. \nHowever, a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines has made that calculation a lot more complicated. \nPaul Hunter, professor of medicine at University of East Anglia, says there's been intense pressure on the JCVI and he can understand why they have been cautious.\nResearch on millions of people who've had the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) shows there's a tiny risk of myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, which is more common in young people - and particularly younger boys - after a second dose. It can cause chest pain and a pounding heart, but symptoms usually clear up in days. \nNo vaccine or drug is ever 100% safe, and data from the US shows the numbers of children affected are very small. \nFor every million Pfizer second doses given to 12-17-year-old-boys, around 60 had the condition (compared with eight in a million among girls). The rates in this age group are higher than in older ones - and it's why only one dose for 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK has been recommended, for now.\nBut being infected with Covid has consequences for teenagers' health too - including their hearts - so how big is that risk?\nA recent US study suggests having Covid-19 could be six times more likely to trigger myocarditis in young men than the vaccine, with a rate of about 450 per million infections. \nHowever, the long-term effects of myocarditis after vaccination and the wider health impacts of Covid in children in the short and long-term are still not known.\nJust because countries have access to the same data doesn't mean they will reach the same standpoint on this finely-balanced question.\nCountries are influenced by a variety of different factors - from vaccination rates in adults to political pressure and fears over another wave of Covid. \nThe US, for example, has vaccinated more than 10 million over-12s and concluded that the benefits of protecting against Covid illness and its complications  \"far outweigh\" the small potential risk of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. \nFrance, Italy, Canada, Spain, Israel and many other countries are all vaccinating this age group for the same reason.\nVaccinating secondary-school-age children wouldn't stop the virus circulating in schools or in society more generally.\n\"Even if 100% of people in the UK were vaccinated - and their pets - the virus would still spread,\" Prof Hunter says.\nBut vaccines for teens are still likely to reduce infections in that age group, and could help keep more children in school over winter, although it's unclear how much it would limit wider community spread.\nThe government's scientific advisers recently said that 40-70% of children in secondary schools may already have been infected by the start of term, meaning many have some in-built protection.\nThen there's the question of whether encouraging more over-18s to have a vaccine would be a more productive aim, given their greater risk, with more than 12% still reluctant to even have one? \nIn the end it comes down to choice, and a fine balance between a very rare side-effect from the vaccine, and a very low risk to children themselves from Covid."

The highway remains closed. \nOver eight inches (20cm) of rain fell in the area during Ida, which reached the US mainland as a Category 4 storm on Sunday. \nWhile Ida's speed has slowed, authorities continue to warn of storm surges and heavy rains across the southern US. \nBy Tuesday afternoon, Ida was in Tennessee, soaking the area with intense rain and prompting flash flood warnings.\nLocal officials have urged evacuated residents to delay their return home as more than one million homes and businesses remain without power, including most of New Orleans. \nMayor Cantrell said that she was hopeful \"that we should have some level of transmission\" by Wednesday but \"that does not mean we will immediately see all the lights on in the city.\"\nFederal officials say that some 441,000 people in 17 parishes across the region have no water, and a similar number may be without power for up to a month.\nIt comes as heat advisories have been issued, with some areas expected to reach 95F (35C), according to weather officials say.\nLouisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said some 25,000 line workers were working to restore power but admitted: \"There are an awful lot of unknowns right now.\"\nMeanwhile Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Bill Nungesser has warned the death toll from Ida will likely rise in the coming days. \nIn addition to the two killed during the highway collapse, at least two other people have been reported dead during the storm.\nIn Louisiana, a man died while attempting to drive across a flooded area of New Orleans. Another man died after being struck by a tree near Baton Rouge.\n\"Knowing that so many people stayed behind in places like Grande Isle and Lafitte where flood waters have devastated those areas, we expect there will be more people found who have passed,\" Mr Nungesser said.\nIda is expected to move next to the US northeast, with rain and threat of floods stretching from the Tennessee to the mid-Atlantic. \nWashington, DC, Baltimore and Philadelphia are among the cities now under flash flood watches.\nHow has Hurricane Ida affected you?

      "tags": "Music",
      "text": "Pop legends Abba have surprised and delighted fans by announcing their first studio album for 40 years.\nAbba Voyage will be released in November, before a \"revolutionary\" set of concerts where virtual avatars will play hits like Mamma Mia and Waterloo.\nThe quartet, who split up in 1982, said they ended up back in the recording studio while working on the stage show.\n\"At first it was just two songs, and then we said, 'Well, maybe we should do a few others,'\" said Benny Andersson.\nIn the end, they recorded 10 tracks - two of which were premiered during a globally-streamed press conference on Thursday.\nThe first, I Still Have Faith In You, is an affectionate piano ballad portraying the bond the four band members share.\n\"When Benny played the melody, I just knew it had to be about us,\" said Bjorn Ulvaeus, explaining the song's origins.\n\"It's about realising that it's inconceivable to be where we are. No imagination could dream up that, to release an album after 40 years and still be the best of friends, and still be enjoying each other's company, and have a total loyalty. \n\"Who has experienced that? Nobody.\"\nThe second track, Don't Shut Me Down, is a mini-melodrama in the vein of the Abba classic The Day Before You Came, where a woman returns to her partner years after walking out.\n\"You asked me not to leave, well here I am again - and I love you still,\" sing Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad in their trademark stacked harmonies. \nBoth songs will feature on Abba Voyage when it is released on 5 November, with an eye on the lucrative Christmas market. The record will even include \"a little Christmas tune\", said Benny, as well as \"a number of pop songs\".\nHe added: \"I think it's pretty good. We've done as good as we could, at our age.\"\nThe reunion had, for many years, seemed unlikely. The band reportedly turned down $1bn to tour in 2000.\nIn an interview with the BBC in 2013, Agnetha said she preferred to leave Abba in the past. \"It was such a long time ago, and we are getting older, and we have our different lives,\" she explained.\nIn a statement accompanying Thursday's announcement, the singer said she \"had no idea what to expect\" when they finally reconvened in 2018.\n\"But Benny's recording studio is such a friendly and safe environment, and before I knew it I was really enjoying myself!\"\n\"It was so joyful to be together in the studio again, the four of us, and hearing Frida and Agnetha going for it again,\" added Benny. \nBut the pianist confessed to having nerves ahead of the initial recording session. \n\"Five minutes before they came into the studio, I was thinking, 'I should have asked if they can still sing,'\" he said. \"But they could and they can and you will hear it when you listen to the records.\"\nHowever, neither singer attended the press launch in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. \n\"They should have been here,\" said Bjorn, half-joking, \"but they don't enjoy this [publicity] as much as Benny does.\"\nThe band's new songs will also be played during the band's virtual concert, also titled Abba Voyage, which will open next year in a specially-built arena in east London.\nPlaying six nights a week, it will feature digital versions of Abba's band members, accompanied by a 10-piece live band performing 22 of their greatest hits. Tickets go on sale on 7 September, starting at \u00a321, with the opening night on 27 May.\nThe so-called \"Abba-tars\" were designed by Industrial Light and Magic - the visual effects company founded by Star Wars creator George Lucas.\nMore than 850 people worked on recreating Abba \"in their prime\" using motion capture technology to scan \"every mannerism and every motion\" of the musicians, who are now in their 70s, as they performed.\n\"Agnetha, Frida, Benny and Bjorn got on stage in front of 160 cameras and almost as many VFX geniuses, and they performed every song in this show, to perfection, over five weeks,\" explained producer Ludvig Andersson. \n\"So when you see this show, it is not four people pretending to Abba, it is actually them.\"\nBjorn said the band had chosen London to premiere the show because \"London is the best city to be in when it comes to entertainment, theatre, musicals\u2026 We have always felt that the Brits see us as their own.\"\nAsked what he enjoyed most about being in Abba, Benny replied with refreshing honesty: \"Not having to worry about the money\". \n\"It's been a good thing for all of us,\" he continued. \"You are free to do anything. I just keep on writing music.\"\nHere we are in 2021 with the first new Abba material since ET came out and, I'm happy to report, they haven't messed it up.\nWe join Abba not as the pant-suited disco voyeurs of Voulez-Vous and Dancing Queen, but as they are now - in their 70s, reminiscing about their lives, and looking back at the music they made in their prime.\nThe lead track, I Still Have Faith In You, is an ode to their friendship and to the bonds that have matured and survived despite divorce and heartbreak. \nStarting gently, it builds to an astronomical climax, full of power chords and dazzling harmonies, as the quartet declare: \"Through joy and the sorrow, we have a story and it survived.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The number of breeding seabirds in Scotland has declined by almost half since the 1980s, according to a new report. \nThe figures are included in NatureScot's latest biodiversity indicator, which looked at 11 species of breeding seabirds.\nThe results show that numbers fell by 49% between 1986 and the most recent estimate in 2019.\nArctic skua numbers dropped by 81% and the number of common terns fell by 48%.\nHowever, guillemot numbers have increased by 17% since 2016. \nReductions in the availability of sandworms and increased predation from great skuas are believed to have led to the sharp reduction in Arctic skua numbers.\nNatureScot said other species, including herring gulls, appear to be stabilising, albeit at lower levels than the 1986 baseline year.\nNatureScot's trends and indicator analyst Simon Foster said \"internationally-important\" breeding seabird populations were continuing to decline despite \"some positive signs of stabilisation.\"\nHe said: \"We know that these declines are driven by factors including climate change, fisheries and invasive non-native species.\n\"The Scottish government's forthcoming Scottish seabird conservation strategy will be a crucial step in shedding more light on the pressures and threats that our seabirds face and setting out action to help secure their future.\""

      "text": "Pet abduction is to be made a criminal offence in England after a rise in reported thefts during Covid lockdowns.\nTheft of a pet is currently treated as a loss of an owner's property, but ministers want a new law to acknowledge the emotional distress it can cause.\nThe proposal is one of a string of recommendations in a report by the pet theft taskforce - set up to tackle an increase in incidents during lockdown.\nIt found that around 2,000 dogs were reported stolen last year.\nThe taskforce - comprising government officials, police, prosecutors, and local authorities - received evidence from animal welfare groups, campaigners, academics and other experts.\nIts report found that seven in 10 pet thefts recorded by police involved dogs.\nAlthough offences under the Theft Act 1968 carry a maximum term of seven years, ministers say there is little evidence of that being used, because the severity of the sentence is partly determined by the monetary value of the item taken.\nIt is not known what the maximum sentence for a new offence of pet abduction might be.\nQuoting data from animal charity Dogs Trust, the report said the price for five of the UK's most desirable dog breeds grew \"significantly\" during the first nationwide lockdown, with some rising as high as 89%.\nThe taskforce suggested this potentially made dog theft more appealing to criminals seeking to profit from the spike in demand for pets.\nMeanwhile, Google searches for \"buy a puppy\" rose by over 160% in the months between March and August 2020 after England's first nationwide lockdown began.\nThe taskforce's recommendations also included:\nThe taskforce also looked at measures such as requiring proof of identification for all online pet adverts, and allowing owners to register their dogs with police, including photos and DNA as well as contact and microchip information.\nOfficials hope the proposals will make it more difficult for thieves to abduct and sell on pets, make it easier for police to apprehend offenders, and that sentences and penalties handed to offenders will reflect the impact on the animal.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said: \"Stealing a pet is an awful crime which can cause families great emotional distress whilst callous criminals line their pockets.\n\"The new offence of pet abduction acknowledges that animals are far more than just property and will give police an additional tool to bring these sickening individuals to justice.\"\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said reports of a rise in pet thefts had been worrying and that owners should not have to \"live in fear\".\nYou can read more here.\nRSPCA chief executive Chris Sherwood said the new pet abduction offence would recognise the \"seriousness\" of the crime, adding: \"We hope this will encourage courts to hand out much tougher sentences to pet thieves.\"\nHe said simplifying the microchipping database would help tackle pet theft, animal welfare issues and \"irresponsible pet ownership\".\nDiane James, from the Blue Cross animal welfare charity, said the organisation hoped the new sentencing laws were brought in \"swiftly\", adding: \"[We] would still advise owners to continue to be vigilant and follow advice to prevent becoming a victim of this abhorrent crime.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nWhile our furry friends have helped many of us get through the pandemic, demand for pets has driven up prices and, with them, theft. It became such a problem, the government set up a taskforce which found about 2,000 dogs were stolen last year. It recommended pet abduction be made a specific offence, recognising the emotional distress it causes, and now UK ministers are backing the proposal.\nPeople in Scotland can now download or receive a paper QR code showing their Covid vaccination status, via the NHS Inform website. The change comes after plans to require vaccine passports for nightclubs and large events were announced.\nWhile lockdowns contributed to people holding on to cash three times longer than previously, the use of cash has begun rising as restrictions have eased, according to UK Finance. However, the banking trade body says we're still hoarding an estimated \u00a350m in loose change at home, with little sign of it being spent. It has prompted calls for people to donate their coins to charity, amid reports of a drop in donations last year.\nA man who has spent much of his life restoring and running a windmill says he had to fight people off when demand for flour surged during lockdown. But now Nigel Moon, 69, says he fears for the future of traditional mills, amid the rise of gluten-free food and trends for converting them into luxury homes.\nA 94-year-old who recovered after spending three weeks in hospital with Covid is to have his diary of lockdown life in a care home turned into a book. In Pandemic! My Care Home Diary, former journalist and PR executive Bob Skinner tells of his frustration at seeing society gradually going back to normal while he and his fellow residents at care homes across the country were still \"confined to our rooms\".\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nIf you're confused about when you have to self-isolate, our guide has the latest rules. \nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "\"I now have to get used to being alone all day, no-one to talk to.\"\nThose are the words of 94-year-old Bob Skinner, who has kept a diary of life at a care home during the pandemic.\nThe diary - which has been turned into a book - tells of the isolation felt by a \"forgotten army\" as they were forced to shield from the world, with visits banned.\nMr Skinner also revealed how he needed hospital treatment after catching Covid - but lived to tell the tale.\n\"I was unlucky - I thought it was coming because I had a cold, I really felt very ill,\" he said. \n\"I was in hospital for three weeks, I didn't think I was coming back, but I made it back.\"\nMr Skinner, a former journalist and PR executive, moved into Sunrise, a senior living home in Cardiff two years ago, not long before the outbreak began.\nHe said he started his diary to \"record my thoughts on the current coronavirus emergency\".\nIn Pandemic! My Care Home Diary, Mr Skinner tells of his frustration at seeing society gradually going back to normal while he and his fellow residents at care homes across the country were still \"confined to our rooms\" and banned from seeing their loved ones.\n\"While the rest of the country starts to experience the pleasures of normal life, our freedom is still very limited and, worse, there seems little prospect of change,\" he wrote.\n\"And who is thinking of us, speaking up for us?\"\nThe misery of lockdown turned to joy as he was finally reunited with his son Robert, who drove for five hours for a one-hour visit.\n\"It was more than a happy reunion after those unreal months - proof that brighter days lie ahead,\" wrote Mr Skinner.\n\"I had been looking forward for so long to today and was standing by the window watching for him to arrive.\"\nA former soldier, Mr Skinner likened the days after World War Two to the period emerging from the pandemic.\n\"Those were grim days, but you can see now there is hope coming,\" he said.\n\"But if people look after other people, things are going to get better.\n\"There are huge challenges ahead, vast changes, the pandemic won't disappear. I think it will get better, what it needs now is for an honest review of what can be done and how people can be kept safe.\"\nThere have been 1,680 Covid-19 deaths in care homes up to 20 August, making up 21% of all coronavirus deaths in Wales.\nThere were no registered Covid deaths involving care home residents in the latest week, according to ONS.\nCare Inspectorate Wales said in the latest two weeks, up to 25 August, there had been four reported deaths of care home residents relating to suspected or confirmed Covid.\nIt said there were 80 care homes that have reported cases involving staff or residents in the past week, \"generally increasing\" since the start of June."

      "text": "People in Scotland can now download or receive a paper QR code showing their Covid vaccination status.\nThe change comes after plans to require vaccine passports for nightclubs and large events were announced. \nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf said the codes would allow people without smartphones to show they had been vaccinated if the scheme is approved by the Scottish Parliament.\nThe free documents can be downloaded from the NHS Inform website. \nThey can also be posted to people requesting them by phone. \nThe scannable images, or 2D barcodes, are being added to all vaccination records requested from Friday. \nVaccinated children over 12 will only be able to request a copy of their vaccination status by phoning the Covid-19 Status Helpline. \nOn Wednesday, Nicola Sturgeon announced plans for vaccine passports to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from the end of September. \nThe plans, which go before MSPs next week, would apply to indoor and outdoor events.\nWhen similar plans for England were outlined by the UK government over the summer, senior Scottish government figures including Mr Yousaf and Deputy First Minister John Swinney said they did not believe vaccine passports were the way to go in Scotland.\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrats and Scottish Labour have also criticised the proposals ahead of next week's vote in the Scottish Parliament., with Labour leader Anas Sarwar saying the government was using a \"knee-jerk reaction\" to cover for the fact it was losing control of the virus. \nAnd the Scottish Conservatives have accused the government of wasting months that could have been used to plan for the introduction of the scheme, before pulling a \"striking u-turn\" at the last minute that was causing confusion for businesses and the public over how it will work.\nBut the first minister said vaccine passports were needed to help stem the recent surge in the number of cases in Scotland, which she described as \"extremely concerning\".\nLatest figures showed a further 6,107 people had tested positive, with the number of people in hospital doubling in the past 10 days.\nSeveral areas of Scotland are also among the regions with the highest rates of the virus in Europe.\nMr Yousaf told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme on Thursday that he now believed that \"the benefits of a certification scheme, in terms of a public health intervention, in terms of incentivising vaccination, those benefits outweigh the concerns that still remain\".\nHe said adding QR codes to paper or PDF records would resolve the problem of people who did not have smartphones being unable to access the vaccine passports.\nMeanwhile, Mr Swinney told Holyrood's Covid-19 recovery committee earlier this week that the government hoped to increase the uptake of vaccines in younger people. \nLatest estimates for the proportion of 18 to 29-year-olds who are unvaccinated stand at 25.6% in Scotland, but 50.8% of 16 to 17-year-olds have now received their first dose.\n\"What we have to balance that against is the likelihood that unless we take action to further improve vaccination levels, we may have to take action at a later stage which may lead to the application of further restrictions,\" Mr Swinney said. \nHe acknowledged there was a \"pretty fine line\" between some venues being a pub or a nightclub, and said the issue would be discussed with the sector in the coming days.\nA vaccination status record is a document showing proof of vaccination, but it is not yet legally required to gain access to venues within Scotland. \nIt is, however, already required for travel to some countries. Within the UK, it can be used to show Covid-19 status instead of providing a negative PCR or lateral flow test to enter some venues such as theatres. \nWhereas in England and Wales people have been able to use the NHS app to show their vaccination status, those in Scotland have to request a record of vaccination online or by phone. This can be sent in the post or downloaded as a PDF to be printed out or shown on a smartphone. \nOld copies of vaccination status records will still be valid at this stage unless they are to be used in a country that requires the QR codes. \nThe documents can be obtained by anyone over the age of 12 who has been vaccinated in Scotland, although under-16s cannot apply online.\nScottish residents who were vaccinated in other parts of the UK Common Travel area (including the Channel Islands and Ireland), will also be able to request the document. \nThose who moved to or from Scotland between doses will need to request proof of the other dose from the country they were vaccinated in, as they would if they had received two doses in another country. \nRepresentatives of sporting and entertainment venues expecting to be affected by the vaccine passports have questioned their use. \nScottish Professional Football League (SPFL) chief executive Neil Doncaster previously said there would be \"significant unintended consequences\" for clubs.\nAnd Mike Grieve, director of the Night-Time Industries Association Scotland, told the BBC the policy was \"incoherent\" and \"inconsistent\" as, for instance, a large pub could let hundreds of people in without the passports but they would be required at a small nightclub next door.\nThe proposed rules would affect many sporting events in Scotland, particularly football matches, as well as concerts and music festivals.\nPeople over the age of 18 would need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to nightclubs and adult entertainment venues, unseated indoor events with more than 500 people in the audience, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event which has more than 10,000 people in attendance.\nAnyone who has good reasons for not getting fully vaccinated - including children and people with particular medical conditions - would be exempt from supplying a vaccine passport.\nFrance, Italy and Ireland are among the countries that have already introduced certification."

      "tags": "Companies,Teignbridge District Council,Waste management,Employment,Rubbish collection,Local government,Torbay Council,Haulage",
      "text": "At least 18 councils across the UK confirmed on Thursday that they are experiencing ongoing disruptions to their bin collection services. \nIt is due to staff self-isolating and a lack of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers for bin lorries.\nThe Local Government Association (LGA) told the BBC that the delays were primarily affecting garden waste.\nHowever, some councils are also delaying recycling collections in order to prioritise general waste. \nIt comes as three councils in Devon wrote to Home Secretary Priti Patel on Thursday, asking for the government to grant temporary visas for trained European HGV drivers to ease the shortage.\n\"At the time of writing, North Devon Council are attempting to fill seven [bin lorry driver] vacancies, Torbay Council eight vacancies, and Teignbridge Council 10 vacancies,\" wrote councillors Steve Darling, David Worden and Alistair Dewhirst. \n\"This equates to approximately 20% of the HGV workforce in driver vacancies and it is proving very challenging to fill this resourcing gap given the dynamics of this labour market.\" \nThe UK currently has a shortfall of about 100,000 HGV drivers, after many EU workers returned home following Brexit and during the pandemic. \nMinisters say UK employers should hire locally to fill the gap, but the councils said it would take time to train the next generation of drivers. They also highlighted delays in the current HGV driver recruitment process. \n\"With our efforts to 'grow our own' HGV drivers, we need their DVLA applications to be fast tracked, as for example in Teignbridge, there are five [bin lorry driver] applications in the system which if fast tracked could help partially tackle the challenges we face,\" the councillors stressed. \nThe BBC understands that the DVSA has already increased the number of vocational tests from 2,000 a week to 3,000, and the DVLA are prioritising HGV provisional licence applications and taking about two weeks to issue them.\nWaste management giants Biffa, Veolia and FCC Environment told the BBC they are \"doing everything\" they can to mitigate the driver shortage.\n\"We are working hard to recruit new drivers, offering great rates of pay alongside fantastic benefits, as well as full training,\" said Biffa's human resources director Jane Pateman.\nVeolia said it currently has 180 bin lorry driver vacancies in the UK. In August, it launched a campaign encouraging mothers to consider a new career in driving for the waste management industry. \n\"To meet the industry-wide shortage of drivers, Veolia are offering incentives such as a sign-on bonus for new staff, and a retention bonus for existing drivers in areas where we are most affected,\" said Veolia UK and Ireland's chief human resources officer Beth Whittaker.\n\"We are also up-skilling existing staff and utilising our extensive apprenticeship scheme.\"\nThe councils confirmed to be experiencing ongoing bin collection delays are:\nRecycling and waste management firm FCC Environment said it too was trying to attract more workers to the profession. \n\"We are focused on actively recruiting drivers across the country, offering local people local employment with job security in the waste and recycling sector, and an attractive package that includes flexible, part-time hours with no overnight stays, fitting around family life and helping work/life balance,\" said FCC Environment's operations director Steve Longdon. \n\"In the short-term in some areas, working in close agreement with our local authority partners, we have prioritised waste and recycling collections - enabling these to continue by temporarily suspending other services, such as garden waste collections, to allow us to reallocate drivers.\"\nHowever the LGA said that the haulage industry was causing part of the problem: \"Fast inflating HGV driver salaries in the private sector risks exacerbating issues in the public sector, with the rises potentially creating a retention as well as a recruitment problem for councils and their contractors.\"\nOn Thursday, the LGA released a report showing 46% of councils in England and Wales experienced disruptions to their bin collection services in July.\nDr Adam Read, director of external affairs at Suez Recycling & Recovery UK, told BBC Breakfast that chronic driver shortages had been going on for about 10 to 12 weeks.\nHe set out what he sees as the benefits to working as an HGV driver in waste management: \"You might start early, but you finish early and you get to pick the kids up. \n\"You're not working long shifts and certainly not driving long distances, a lot of it is close to where you live - so there are some upsides to the sector.\"\nHe did concede, however, that waste collection firms do not typically pay as well as delivery agencies or supermarkets.\n\"In some geographies, we've seen some staff start to have their head turned by slightly better pay conditions,\" he added.\nIn a bid to tackle the wider HGV driver shortage, supermarkets such as Tesco and Aldi have increased wages or started to offer sign-on bonuses for delivery drivers.\nBefore the pandemic, there was a shortage of an estimated 60,000 HGV drivers, according to the Road Haulage Association, but that's now risen to 100,000.\nSince Brexit, many European drivers who worked in the UK have returned to their home countries or decided to work elsewhere due to the additional paperwork required at borders. It slows them down and costs them money, as they are often paid by distance covered rather than per hour.\nPandemic travel restrictions and a lack of Covid tests for drivers have also played a part.\nThousands of lorry drivers were forced to spend Christmas in their cabs in December, after France closed its border with the UK due to a backlog in coronavirus testing.\nAbout 4,000 lorries had to park at Manston Airport in Kent, with another 2,300 held on the M20, creating a long tailback.

      "tags": "Music",
      "text": "Pop legends Abba have surprised and delighted fans by announcing their first studio album for 40 years.\nAbba Voyage will be released in November, before a \"revolutionary\" set of concerts where virtual avatars will play hits like Mamma Mia and Waterloo.\nThe quartet, who split up in 1982, said they ended up back in the recording studio while working on the stage show.\n\"At first it was just two songs, and then we said, 'Well, maybe we should do a few others,'\" said Benny Andersson.\nIn the end, they recorded 10 tracks - two of which were premiered during a globally-streamed press conference on Thursday.\nThe first, I Still Have Faith In You, is an affectionate piano ballad portraying the bond the four band members share.\n\"When Benny played the melody, I just knew it had to be about us,\" said Bjorn Ulvaeus, explaining the song's origins.\n\"It's about realising that it's inconceivable to be where we are. No imagination could dream up that, to release an album after 40 years and still be the best of friends, and still be enjoying each other's company, and have a total loyalty. \n\"Who has experienced that? Nobody.\"\nThe second track, Don't Shut Me Down, is a mini-melodrama in the vein of the Abba classic The Day Before You Came, where a woman returns to her partner years after walking out.\n\"You asked me not to leave, well here I am again - and I love you still,\" sing Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad in their trademark stacked harmonies. \nBoth songs will feature on Abba Voyage when it is released on 5 November, with an eye on the lucrative Christmas market. The record will even include \"a little Christmas tune\", said Benny, as well as \"a number of pop songs\".\nHe added: \"I think it's pretty good. We've done as good as we could, at our age.\"\nThe reunion had, for many years, seemed unlikely. The band reportedly turned down $1bn to tour in 2000.\nIn an interview with the BBC in 2013, Agnetha said she preferred to leave Abba in the past. \"It was such a long time ago, and we are getting older, and we have our different lives,\" she explained.\nIn a statement accompanying Thursday's announcement, the singer said she \"had no idea what to expect\" when they finally reconvened in 2018.\n\"But Benny's recording studio is such a friendly and safe environment, and before I knew it I was really enjoying myself!\"\n\"It was so joyful to be together in the studio again, the four of us, and hearing Frida and Agnetha going for it again,\" added Benny. \nBut the pianist confessed to having nerves ahead of the initial recording session. \n\"Five minutes before they came into the studio, I was thinking, 'I should have asked if they can still sing,'\" he said. \"But they could and they can and you will hear it when you listen to the records.\"\nHowever, neither singer attended the press launch in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. \n\"They should have been here,\" said Bjorn, half-joking, \"but they don't enjoy this [publicity] as much as Benny does.\"\nThe band's new songs will also be played during the band's virtual concert, also titled Abba Voyage, which will open next year in a specially-built arena in east London.\nPlaying six nights a week, it will feature digital versions of Abba's band members, accompanied by a 10-piece live band performing 22 of their greatest hits. Tickets go on sale on 7 September, starting at \u00a321, with the opening night on 27 May.\nThe so-called \"Abba-tars\" were designed by Industrial Light and Magic - the visual effects company founded by Star Wars creator George Lucas.\nMore than 850 people worked on recreating Abba \"in their prime\" using motion capture technology to scan \"every mannerism and every motion\" of the musicians, who are now in their 70s, as they performed.\n\"Agnetha, Frida, Benny and Bjorn got on stage in front of 160 cameras and almost as many VFX geniuses, and they performed every song in this show, to perfection, over five weeks,\" explained producer Ludvig Andersson. \n\"So when you see this show, it is not four people pretending to Abba, it is actually them.\"\nBjorn said the band had chosen London to premiere the show because \"London is the best city to be in when it comes to entertainment, theatre, musicals\u2026 We have always felt that the Brits see us as their own.\"\nAsked what he enjoyed most about being in Abba, Benny replied with refreshing honesty: \"Not having to worry about the money\". \n\"It's been a good thing for all of us,\" he continued. \"You are free to do anything. I just keep on writing music.\"\nHere we are in 2021 with the first new Abba material since ET came out and, I'm happy to report, they haven't messed it up.\nWe join Abba not as the pant-suited disco voyeurs of Voulez-Vous and Dancing Queen, but as they are now - in their 70s, reminiscing about their lives, and looking back at the music they made in their prime.\nThe lead track, I Still Have Faith In You, is an ode to their friendship and to the bonds that have matured and survived despite divorce and heartbreak. \nStarting gently, it builds to an astronomical climax, full of power chords and dazzling harmonies, as the quartet declare: \"Through joy and the sorrow, we have a story and it survived.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Covid: What Israel tells us about the way out of the pandemic",
      "tags": "Israel,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination",
      "text": "Israel's booster vaccination programme - offering a third shot to over-40s - has begun to show signs of success.\nBut the country's recent spike in cases has ignited debate about the future of the vaccination programme and the ongoing pandemic.\nIt had virtually returned to normal life by this spring, cases stayed low and it looked like vaccination had more or less quashed Covid. \nFrom July, though, cases started to rise again. \nSince Israel surged ahead in immunising its population last winter, the rest of the vaccinated world has turned to it to understand what might be in store in the coming weeks and months. \nThe country's own health leaders will be keeping a watchful eye on cases after schools reopened on 1 September, while next week, Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, will see groups gathering. \nAlthough the country rolled out jabs quickly and take-up was relatively high, there are still a million people out of its roughly nine million overall population who are eligible for the vaccine and haven't taken it up.\nIsrael is also a relatively young country, with about a third of its population under the age of 14. Under-12s are not eligible for the vaccine unless they have particular health conditions. \nThat means, despite high take-up, only 60% of the total population is fully vaccinated with two doses.\nBut even without these groups being vaccinated, back in spring the level of coverage appeared to be enough to keep a lid on cases - so what changed?\nThe more infectious Delta variant seems to have evaded part of the vaccine's protection against infection, although it is still highly effective against severe illness. \nBut scientists monitoring the data believe a major factor in the recent spike in cases is waning immunity from the Pfizer vaccine, which was initially the only one given in the country.  \nProf Eran Segal, who advises the Israeli government on Covid matters, said by month five or six after vaccination, people are probably only 30-40% protected, compared with more than 90% when protection first kicks in. \n\"That's what was driving the wave,\" he said - a conclusion drawn from careful analysis of the rates of infection in people vaccinated in different months. \nDespite this fall, vaccination still prevents a substantial amount of sickness, with the unvaccinated becoming severely ill with Covid about nine times as often in over-60s, and twice as often in younger people. \nIsrael is responding to the dip in protection against infection by rolling out a booster programme, offering a third jab first to over-60s and more recently to the over-40s. \nThe boosters for older people began to be offered just over a month ago, and they appear to be now taking effect, with hospital admissions levelling off in that group.\n\"This is leading to a halt in the Delta wave,\" Prof Segal said. \nEarly data suggests a tenfold increase in protection from infection and severe disease after the third jab, compared with after two. \nDr Anat Ekka Zohar, who is leading the booster programme study, said three doses were \"highly protective, against both infection and severe illness\". \nShe added: \"The triple dose is the solution to curbing the current infection outbreak.\" \nThere are fierce debates over whether booster programmes should be rolled out when so many people around the world haven't even had one vaccine.\nAnd some have questioned whether it is sustainable to top up the vaccines every six months, or once a year as is the case with the flu jab. \nWhile we've built up a large amount of evidence to show the Covid vaccines are safe and effective for almost everyone, there are still areas where we need more information. One of those areas is exactly how long immunity lasts, and whether a third booster shot will provide much more durable protection. \nIt could be that a three-shot schedule is what's needed, as in the case of the hepatitis B vaccine, where three doses result in more or less lifelong protection for most.\nOr it could be that two jabs plus natural immunity will be enough. \nPeople can get good natural protection after catching the virus, but, without a vaccine, that comes with the risk of becoming very ill, developing long-term complications or dying. \nWith the vaccines now protecting against most of the worst disease, people may still catch milder versions of Covid and boost their vaccine-derived immunity that way. \nScientists have hypothesised that repeated exposure to the Covid infection, now with the protection of the vaccine and natural immunity from past infection rendering it less risky, could over time turn the virus into a potentially recurring, but relatively untroublesome illness.\nBut others fear there may be a high cost to this, as breakthrough infections can still reach the most vulnerable and the eventual toll of \"long Covid\" remains unknown.  \nAt the least, Israel's booster programme might provide more answers to some of these remaining questions.

One estimate suggested 90% of homes had suffered serious damage.\nThe local police chief said at least 400 people had chosen not to leave ahead of the storm - and dozens needed rescuing from attics and rooftops. \nAerial images show whole neighbourhoods submerged.

Trees and power lines were also brought down.\nAcross the region, many continue to be without power, after the winds downed power lines and other infrastructure.\nNight-time imagery from Nasa captured the extent of blackouts across the affected area after the storm, with lights knocked out in many places, including New Orleans.\nEnergy companies say they are working to restore power, but residents are being warned it could take weeks in some areas.\nMuch of New Orleans has been plunged into darkness, with only emergency lighting seen in many areas.\nHurricane Ida lingered over southern Louisiana for most of 29 August, bringing rainfall and floods before moving north and east into Mississippi and Alabama the following day.\nThe storm arrived in New Orleans 16 years after Hurricane Katrina followed a similar path in 2005, killing 1,800 people."

      "text": "The health minister has warned of a risk to patients if pharmaceutical firms go ahead with plans to withdraw medicines due to the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nNI gets most of its medicines from distributors in Great Britain, but is still covered by EU medicines rules.\nThat will make exporting medicines from GB to NI more difficult in January when a Protocol \"grace period\" ends.\nThe health department has been notified 910 medicines are due to be withdrawn.\nA further 2,400 are at risk.\nThere is no immediate risk to supplies and the health department has previously said people don't need to change their prescribing behaviour.\nMedicines suppliers must give six months notice when they intend to withdraw a product.\nIn a briefing paper, which has been circulated among ministers and senior officials in recent days, Stormont's Health Minister Robin Swann said he now had \"deep concerns about the risk to patient health and maintaining vital medical supplies\".\nHe is calling for a \"standstill\" which would mean an extension of the grace period.\nThe paper said the planned withdrawals \"cover all classifications of medicines, including prescription-only medicines, pharmacy and general sales list medicines\".\nAlmost 90% of the confirmed withdrawals are classified as high risk, meaning there is the potential for disruption and the need for some form of mitigation.\nThat mitigation could mean using alternative products or seeking alternative sources of supply.\nThe major issues are the need for additional batch testing for medicines moving from GB to NI and continued compliance with the EU's falsified medicines directive.\nEarlier this year the British Generic Manufacturers Association (BGMA) said these issues would make it commercially unviable to sell some products in Northern Ireland.\nThe EU has proposed measures to ease the problem but the UK government is sceptical about whether they are enough.\nInstead the UK has proposed that medicines should be completely removed from the scope of the Protocol with an extension of the grace period until that can be agreed.\nBut the two sides have not yet agreed on a way forward.\nMr Swann supports the UK government proposal to remove medicines from the Protocol but it is not clear if other Northern Ireland Executive parties share that view.\nStormont health committee chairman Colm Gildernew said there were issues of \"huge concern\" that required a \"focused piece of work\".\nWhen asked on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme if he supported Mr Swann's position that the best solution was to remove medicines from the scope of the protocol, Mr Gildernew said he was not clear on the potential impact of a joint position by the Executive but would meet with the minister to discuss the issue.\nHe said he believed the issue was \"too important for unilateral action\" and said he wanted \"dedicated and urgent bilateral negotiations building on the good will that exists\".\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in MLA said no one wanted to see medicines interrupted and that he understood the concerns and the uncertainty around it.\n\"I think this needs to be negotiated in good faith with the European Union. I believe all solutions need to be kept on the table but it is absolutely crucial that good will is maintained,\" he said.\nUlster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said the warning from Robin Swann should be a \"wake-up call\" for the EU and the UK government. \n\"This isn't scaremongering - it is the practical out-workings of the NI Protocol and there is a practical solution,\" he said. \n\"There is no immediate shortage of medicines, but if action isn't taken now that is exactly what we could be facing come the new year.\"\nThe DUP MLA Jonathan Buckley called the situation a \"fiasco\" and said it was \"immoral, unjustifiable and cannot be tolerated.\"\nHe added: \"The imposition of the protocol impacts and harms every single person in Northern Ireland.  It should be opposed by everyone.\"\nCommunity pharmacist Peter Rice, deputy chair of Community Pharmacy Northern Ireland, said he wanted to reassure patients that they did not see an immediate concern with medicine supply.\nHe said the situation was evolving and they were working to ensure Northern Ireland has parity and equal access to medication with the rest of the UK.\nSpeaking on Good Morning Ulster, he said they intended to continue to \"work tirelessly\" so patients do not need to be concerned.\nIt is the deal agreed by the UK and EU to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit.\nIt does this by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods.\nThis means goods don't have to checked as they cross the Irish border, instead some checks and controls are required on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.\nThis has caused difficulties for some businesses and is opposed by unionist parties in Northern Ireland, which say it undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position as part of the UK.\nIn July the UK published a \"command paper\" proposing radical changes to the protocol but the EU says it will not renegotiate."

      "tags": "Common Travel Area (CTA),Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A security flaw which allows people to edit Covid vaccination status certificates has not been fixed - three months after it was first identified. \nBBC Scotland reported in May how vaccination status details could be altered using popular computer software programmes.\nA fix was implemented which meant people could only request the document be sent to them by post.\nThe certificates are available to download again and are still editable.\nThe development comes on the first day people can download a QR code showing their Covid vaccination status.\nThe Scottish government said that while the document can be changed, the security contained within the QR codes in the certificate cannot be edited.\nBBC Scotland was able to download a certificate and edit it to include a false name, date of birth and the address of the BBC's Glasgow headquarters.\nOn Wednesday, Nicola Sturgeon announced plans for vaccine passports to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from the end of September.\nThe plans, which go before MSPs next week, would apply to indoor and outdoor events and would require people to present the QR code from their vaccine certificate. \nThe full details of how the plan will work have still to be announced.\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"While the PDFs can be changed, the security contained within the QR codes cannot be edited and can only be scanned by recognised verifier apps that have been developed in line with the EU's Covid Green Pass scheme.  \n\"The PDFs are designed for international travel purposes and are meant to be accompanied by your passport - border control will check the data on the QR code matches that of your passport, and will quickly identify those who have attempted to fraudulently claim a certificate as theirs when it is not.\"\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the fact the glitch remained three months after it was first spotted \"casts further doubt on this government's ability to competently manage the vaccine passport scheme\".\nThe party's Murdo Fraser said: \"Not only is our system currently open to abuse, but these security issues have some very worrying implications for how the scheme will be applied in practice.\n\"Once again, the SNP government is pressing ahead with confusing and half-baked measures that do not work for the Scottish people.\n\"If the SNP cannot fix a technical flaw that they have known about for three months, how are we to trust that they will be able to roll out a functioning vaccine passport scheme in three weeks?\"\nA vaccination status record is a document showing proof of vaccination, but it is not yet legally required to gain access to venues within Scotland. \nIt is, however, already required for travel to some countries. Within the UK, it can be used to show Covid-19 status instead of providing a negative PCR or lateral flow test to enter some venues such as theatres. \nWhereas in England and Wales people have been able to use the NHS app to show their vaccination status, those in Scotland have to request a record of vaccination online or by phone. This can be sent in the post or downloaded as a PDF to be printed out or shown on a smartphone. \nOld copies of vaccination status records will still be valid at this stage unless they are to be used in a country that requires the QR codes. \nThe documents can be obtained by anyone over the age of 12 who has been vaccinated in Scotland, although under-16s cannot apply online.\nScottish residents who were vaccinated in other parts of the UK Common Travel area (including the Channel Islands and Ireland), will also be able to request the document. \nThose who moved to or from Scotland between doses will need to request proof of the other dose from the country they were vaccinated in, as they would if they had received two doses in another country.

      "tags": "Cardiff,Welsh government,Newport,Climate change,Environment,M4 motorway,Pontypridd",
      "text": "The idea of tolls for some drivers on two of Wales' busiest stretches of road has been raised by Welsh government.\nIt asked for the public's views in a survey about some motorists paying to use parts of the M4 motorway and A470 in a bid to tackle air pollution.\nThe survey asked for views on tolls for older cars on the M4 around Newport, Wales' busiest stretch of motorway, and the A470 around Pontypridd. \nBut the survey said a \"clean air zone\" is not proposed \"at this stage\".\nAn air pollution expert said any suggestion would be unlike any other air pollution measure in the UK, which normally charges motorists for driving into cities rather on stretches of road.\nThe Welsh government has declared a climate emergency and has committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.\nThe government survey asked drivers if their commuting or travelling habits would change if some vehicles had to pay to use those stretches of road.\nThe survey discussed a toll for petrol cars registered before 2006 and diesels plated before September 2015.\nIt suggested a charge from January 2023 for the M4 between junctions 25 and 26 through the congestion pinch point at the Brynglas Tunnels in Newport and between Pontypridd and Upper Boat on the A470 in Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nWhile it costs to cross some bridges or use some tunnels in the UK, the only toll road is the M6 toll road north of Birmingham which was built to alleviate traffic congestion on motorways in the West Midlands.\nA clean air zone is already in place in Birmingham, while London has a similar ultra low emission zone scheme.\nRespondents to the Welsh government survey on a possible clean air toll were presented with pricing options ranging from \u00a33 to \u00a38 for cars and from \u00a36 to \u00a312.50 for light goods vehicles.\nIt asked if drivers would switch to public transport, change destination or route, pay the charge, switch cars or not travel at all.\nNon-exempt heavy goods vehicle drivers have been asked for their response to a charge of \u00a350.\nThe survey explained if such a charge was to be implemented, it would be a \"single charge applied on a daily basis\".\nSpeed limits of 50mph (80km/h) are already in place on the two roads in an effort to tackle air pollution.\nRespondents were told that pollution levels at the two areas under discussion were above legal limits, so the Welsh government \"has been assessing potential solutions and packages of measures to improve air quality and protect the health of people\".\n\"This work is necessary as the Welsh government are legally required to improve air quality and reduce harmful levels of nitrogen dioxide in the shortest possible time and whilst at this stage a clean air zone is not proposed at these locations, all potential options must be developed should they be required in the future,\" the survey added.\nAir pollution expert Dr Jordan White of Earthsense said a suggestion to put a clean air or low emissions charge on a stretch of road rather than in a city centre would be unique in the UK.\n\"It's very different from other clean air zones across the UK,\" he said.\n\"More typically it would be to try to stop cars or highly emitting vehicles getting into the city centres, whereas this is for a very very particular roads.\n\"It's a different approach but it comes from good intentions because these two stretches of road are very, very bad, the air quality is poor in these areas.\"\nBut there are concerns such a charge could hit the poorest in society.\nCouncillor Sam Trask, chairman of Rhondda Cynon Taf Conservatives, was one of those asked to complete the survey.\n\"I drive a nine-year-old diesel car and, were I able to afford one, I'd already be driving a less-polluting car.\n\"I feel that if the Welsh government are going to charge me to use a road that I normally use twice a day to go back and forth to work, then they're actually going to put that aspiration even further out of reach and I'm going to be even less likely to be able to afford a better car.\n\"I think if these proposals were to go ahead, they would adversely affect the poorest in our society unfairly because these are the kinds of people who can't afford a more modern electric car.\"\nBusiness leaders have also warned that tolls on roads would \"just move the problem and the pollution problem elsewhere.\"\n\"When you look at tolls on other roads, the M6 for instance, it's an alternative,\" Kevin Ward from Newport Now Business Improvement District told BBC Radio Wales\n\"This wouldn't be an alternative because actually what we'd do is just move the problem and the pollution problem elsewhere.\n\"What we're talking about in Newport is the area around the Brynglas tunnel, the bottleneck on the M4, the area that the M4 relief road was supposed to alleviate and that's now dead in the water.\n\"I almost feel like the Welsh government are flailing around trying to come up with other solutions to that problem and I'm not sure that tolling is the answer.\"\nHe said there needed to be range of solutions including a better public transport system in south Wales with a \u00a3750m metro set to be completed in 2023.\nA Welsh government spokeswoman said there were \"currently no plans for congestion charges\".\n\"In a separate piece of work, in line with our legal obligations to reduce harmful levels of nitrogen dioxide, we have commissioned surveys to gain people's views on clean air zone proposals on the M4 between junctions 25 and 26 in Newport and on the A470 between Upper Boat and Pontypridd,\" she added.\nThe survey ran until 31 August by which time 3,017 responses had been completed."

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "The UK's vaccine advisory body has refused to give the green light to vaccinating healthy children aged 12-15 years on health grounds alone.\nThe JCVI said children were at such a low risk from the virus that jabs would offer only a marginal benefit.\nThe UK's four chief medical officers have now been asked to have the final say, and to consider the wider impact on schools and society.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said a decision would be made shortly.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation did advise widening the existing vaccine programme to include an extra 200,000 teenagers with specific underlying conditions.\nDoctors identified that children with chronic heart, lung and liver conditions were at much higher risk of Covid than healthy children. \nThe decision not to recommend the vaccine to all healthy children was based on concern over an extremely rare side effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines which causes heart inflammation, and can lead to palpitations and chest pain.\nData from the US, where millions of young teenagers have been vaccinated, suggests there are 60 cases of the heart condition for every million second doses given to 12 to 17-year-old boys (compared to eight in one million girls). \nFrance, Italy, Israel and Ireland are also offering the vaccine to all children in this age group.\nBut as children are at such low risk from the virus, the JCVI decided that vaccination would offer only \"marginal gain\" and, therefore, there was \"insufficient\" evidence to offer mass vaccination to this age group.\nThe JCVI said it was difficult to factor in long Covid in its advice because of the uncertainty over how common it is in children, although it appears to be less prevalent than in adults.  \nThe vaccine advisers have been under huge pressure.\nMinisters have let it be known they are very keen on getting this age group vaccinated - both through their public pronouncements and privately behind the scenes.\nThis has caused frustration among JCVI members - with some complaining about the habit of government officials sitting in on meetings.\nDespite this, the JCVI has stood firm. Taking into account the impact on school disruption might make a difference.\nBut even then it's not clear-cut. Vaccinating kids will cause disruption in itself, with children having to leave class to get jabbed and then maybe needing time off to recover from the common side effects, such as fever.\nAnother argument put forward is that it could help reduce the wider spread of the virus - although encouraging the 6 million adults who have not even taken up the offer a jab yet could arguably make more of a difference.\nClearly though it would have some impact - although the emergence of the Delta variant means the vaccines offer less protection against infection than they did previously.\nWhat's more, around half of children in this age group are thought to have had Covid, providing them with natural immunity anyway.\nThe judgement call remains very tough.\nProf Wei Shen Lim, chairman of Covid immunisation for the JCVI said it was \"taking a precautionary approach\".\n\"The margin of benefit is considered too small to support universal Covid-19 vaccination for this age group at this time. \n\"The committee will continue to review safety data as they emerge,\" he added.\nPaediatricians say that healthy children with Covid end up in intensive care at a rate of two in one million, but this rises to 100 in one million for children with certain health problems.\nAs a result, the JCVI's advice is that a larger group of at-risk children aged 12 to 15 should be offered a vaccine.\nThey include children with the following conditions:\nChildren with poorly-controlled asthma and other respiratory conditions which can result in severe illness from Covid should also be offered the vaccine, the JCVI said.\nA group of 150,000 children with conditions such as severe neurodisabilities, Down's syndrome and severely weakened immune systems as well as those living with vulnerable adults are already eligible. \nThere are three million children in total in this age group across the UK.\nMr Javid said he had written to the chief medical officers in the UK's four nations to ask them to consider the vaccination of all 12-15 year olds \"from a broader perspective\".\nThey will look at the effects of Covid on children's education and pupil absences from school, which the JCVI is not qualified to consider.\nSenior leaders in clinical and public health will be involved in the discussions and help to inform a final decision on a rollout to all 12-15 year olds.\n\"We will then consider the advice, building on the advice from the JCVI, before making a decision shortly,\" Mr Javid said.\nOn Friday, 42,076 cases of coronavirus were reported in the UK and 121 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nWhat questions do you have about the decision not to recommend vaccination for healthy children aged 12-15 years on health grounds?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Pat Hume has been described as the most \"extraordinarily strong woman, with the softest, most gentle manner\".\nThe widow of the late SDLP leader and Nobel prize winner John Hume died on Thursday after a short illness, aged 83.\nFormer Irish President Mary McAleese paid tribute to Mrs Hume saying she was \"the perfect partner\" to John Hume.\nMrs Hume worked alongside her husband from the beginning of the civil rights movement in Londonderry in the 1960s.\nHer death comes just over a year after the death of her husband.\n\"She was a nurturer, she was a coper,\" said Dr McAleese, who recently spent a day with Mrs Hume.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Hume family said they were \"heartbroken\", adding that she \"died as she lived - surrounded by family, peacefully and generous to the end\". \nThe family paid tribute to the medical staff who cared for their mother in her final days.\nSpeaking to Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster, Dr McAleese said John relied on Pat for her \"wisdom and advice\".\n\"Pat was an extravagantly wise woman, she had a huge wisdom,\" she added.\n\"I don't know anybody who I have met in my life who was more rounded and more grounded than Pat.\n\"She was able to synthesise common sense, compassion, political nous in a way that was really, really special and absolutely essential to John.\"\nDr McAleese said Mrs Hume \"never looked for the limelight... but boy is she deserving of a mountain of praise.\"\nFoyle MP and current SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Mrs Hume has left \"a tremendous legacy for everyone in Derry and across Ireland\".\n\"John always said: 'I'm the parcel and Pat delivers me.' \n\"That was true,\" he added.\n\"I genuinely don't believe any of the of the things John achieved would have been possible without Pat.\n\"She just had such strength and also belief in what they were doing, she was as driven to bring about a peaceful, and just Ireland as he was.\"\n\"The people of Derry and the people of Ireland owe them both a great debt.\"\nPat Hume was, according to her husband John, his rock and key adviser throughout his long political career. \nAs a journalist in the north west, you were always very keen to get Pat Hume's insight into current political developments. \nHer brain was so sharp and she was able to cut through a lot of the spin and nonsense - delivering lines you wouldn't hear from politicians.\nI always found her very frustrating, but very frustrating in a nice way. \nThe more I tried to question her, and get advice and a steer from her, the more she would ask me about my family, my career and how things were going for me. \nYou always came away from meeting her having unburdened yourself, without having gleaned the information you were hoping to get.\nLike her husband John, she was always interested in people and that cut to the core of what they were about as a couple. \nThey were very much rooted in the Derry community and were more interested in the people around them, than mixing with the great and the good. \nPat Hume's name never appeared on an election ballot paper, but her influence on the political path in Northern Ireland stretched far beyond many politicians. \nPaying tribute to Mrs Hume on Friday, former US President Bill Clinton said that she \"played an enormous role\" in helping to achieve peace in Northern Ireland. \n\"All of us who were blessed by the way she lived her life and advanced her cause with such grace and good humour will be forever grateful,\" he said.\nHillary Clinton, former US secretary of state and presidential candidate, described her as \"a gracious, determined force behind the achievement of peace in Ireland\". \nMrs Clinton added that the Humes \"made the world a better place and set an example for us all\".\nFormer Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin said Pat Hume was \"one of the bedrocks of the peace process who kept her nerve at the worst of times\".\n\"She didn't flinch, John Hume didn't flinch and they prevailed in the end,\" the former Sinn F\u00e9in Foyle MLA said.\nWhen talks with the Sinn F\u00e9in leadership were held at the Humes' home in Derry, Pat \"set the atmosphere for constructive and calm conversation\".\nHe added: \"Unfailingly, no matter the circumstances, Pat Hume was always steady, steadfast, she clearly was across all the discussions. \n\"She was always focused on finding ways through the disagreements and I think John Hume was benefitting from her advice on an ongoing basis. I think republicans benefitted as well, I know I certainly did.\" \nUlster Unionist MLA Mike Nesbitt, a trustee of the John and Pat Hume Foundation, said the Hume's shared a view of Northern Ireland politics that was ahead of its time.\n\"Everybody else was talking about a divided society and the negativity of that, John and Pat were talking in a very positive way about the benefits of the fact we have a very diverse society,\" he told BBC Radio Foyle.\nHe said she was \"more than just John's rock\" and along with Daphne Trimble, wife of former Ulster Unionist party leader Lord Trimble, had played a key role in supporting victims and survivors of the Troubles. \nLady Trimble said she shared a \"warm friendship\" with Mrs Hume.\n\"She was one of the best, simply one of the best people I have ever met,\" she said.\nHer friend will be sorely missed, she added. \nMrs Hume's work continued during the Troubles, through to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.\nShe ran her husband's Foyle constituency office dealing with community issues, housing and poverty in Derry.\nMrs Hume, a former teacher, was awarded the Irish Red Cross Lifetime Achievement award in 2018.\nA foundation honouring John and Pat Hume's peace and reconciliation work was launched in November last year. \nA book of condolence has opened in the main hall of Derry's Guildhall.\nThe city's Mayor Graham Warke said it would allow people to \"offer the people the chance to pay their respects and say thank you to a remarkable and courageous woman\".\nMrs Hume's funeral Mass will be held at St Eugene's Cathedral in Derry at 11:00 BST on Monday.\nMembers of the public are invited to watch the service live via webcam."

      "tags": "Tax,Social care,Jeremy Hunt",
      "text": "Social care must be adequately funded, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said, amid reports ministers plan to raise national insurance.\nDowning Street did not deny reports of an increase of at least 1% to improve social care and tackle the NHS backlog.\nThe justice secretary said he would not \"speculate\" but said there should be a \"grown-up conversation\" about how to pay for rising social care costs.\nThe move would break a Tory manifesto commitment at the last election.\n\"The British public are sensible enough to know that when it comes to the issue of social care we have to find some way in which it will be adequately funded,\" Mr Buckland told BBC Breakfast.\nHe said that the Conservative Party had also promised at the 2019 election that it would bring forward sustainable proposals to fund social care.\nThe Daily Telegraph reports that Downing Street favours a 1% rise in the national insurance rate, affecting about 25 million workers and self-employed people, as well as employers. But it says the Treasury is pushing for a 1.25% increase.\nAnd the Times adds that Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid wants a bigger rise of 2%.\nBut a source close to Mr Javid said that 2% figure was incorrect and the BBC understands the health secretary is pushing for a lower figure.\nFor someone on average earnings of \u00a329,536 a year, a 1% increase in national insurance would cost them \u00a3199.68 annually.\nThe Telegraph says the funds will be used to put a cap on the amount an individual has to spend on social care costs over their lifetime.\nIn their manifesto, the Conservatives said: \"The prerequisite of any solution will be a guarantee that no-one needing care has to sell their home to pay for it.\"\nThe government said it was \"committed to bringing forward a long-term plan to reform the social care system\".\nIn a statement, it said proposals would be set out this year. \nBoris Johnson appears to be ready to break one promise in order to keep another. \nHe is considering going against a manifesto commitment not to raise national insurance in order to deliver on his vow to fix social care.  \nIf the plan is put forward it will need a hard sell - to the public, most of whom will still pay large amounts towards care, and to Conservative MPs, for whom raising taxes is repellent.\nHow best to look after the elderly, disabled and others needing care is one of society's most pressing questions. \nHow to persuade the public to pay for it is the government's most pressing problem and a huge political challenge. \nLabour said the NHS and social care needed proper investment but it was wrong to raise national insurance., which would disproportionately hit low-earners, young people and businesses.\n\"Boris Johnson still hasn't come forward with the plan for social care he promised over two years ago, and instead they're proposing a manifesto-breaking tax rise that would hit working people and businesses hard,\" said shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson.\nIt comes as former health secretary Jeremy Hunt wrote in the Daily Telegraph that there should be a new \"health and care premium\" added to tax instead, as he warned against raising national insurance or income tax.\nMr Hunt, who now chairs the Commons health committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government must \"bite the bullet\" and find some way to increase taxes.\n\"The sums are eye-watering, far bigger than a chancellor can find down the back of a Treasury sofa,\" he said.\nBut he said a national insurance increase was the wrong approach because it would not be paid by pensioners. \n\"Since older people are the biggest beneficiaries I think it's only fair that they should make a contribution,\" Mr Hunt said.\nNational insurance is paid on the profits of self-employed people and the earnings of employees when they exceed \u00a39,568 a year.\nThey then pay 12% of their income up to about \u00a350,000 a year, when it drops to 2%.\nThat has raised concerns that any rise to national insurance would affect low earners more than high earners.\nNine challenges facing the social care system\nBoris Johnson has been under increasing pressure to set out his plan for social care reform. \nSpeaking on the steps of Downing Street on his first day as prime minister in 2019, he pledged to \"fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared\". \nBut that plan has yet to be published. \nOn top of long-term funding challenges, the social care sector has also faced extra costs because of the pandemic. \nCouncils, which provide social care, have seen their budgets cut over the last decade. \nThe squeeze on council funding in England means that people who pay for themselves are often propping up the care system.\nIn England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than \u00a323,250 can get help from their council.\nThere is no overall limit on costs, meaning thousands every year end up selling their homes to pay.\nPersonal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs.\nThe Scottish National Party said the UK government at Westminster should guarantee Scottish workers would not pay for an \"England-only policy\".\nSome care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland."

      "text": "Heavy fighting is reported between Taliban forces and resistance fighters in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley.\nThe Taliban said they had taken some territory and inflicted \"heavy\" losses on the National Resistance Front (NRF).\nBut the NRF said it had control of all entrances to the valley, and the Taliban had lost hundreds of fighters.\nPanjshir is the only province that has not fallen to the Islamist group and thousands of opposition fighters are believed to have massed there.\nThe resistance - which includes former Vice-President Amrullah Saleh, former Afghan security force members and local militias - is led by local tribal leader Ahmad Massoud. Massoud's father held off the Soviets in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s.\nMeanwhile US President Joe Biden visited troops who were injured in a devastating bomb attack at Kabul airport as they helped to evacuate Americans and Afghans from the country. Thirteen US soldiers were among some 170 people killed.\nHe made the visit four days after the last American soldiers left Afghanistan, where the Western-backed government had crumbled in the face of a Taliban offensive this summer.\nBiden is inside a military hospital here in Maryland, visiting the wounded. I travelled with him in the motorcade, along with about a dozen other journalists who are part of a press pool. \nNo-one was allowed to say where the president was going, and his visit remained a secret until until we arrived at the hospital. Now that he is here, the news of his visit can be disclosed. \nBiden has been criticised for his decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and for the way that he has overseen the events of the past few weeks.\nHis visit to the hospital is a way for him to pay tribute to the sacrifices that people have made. It is also a reminder of the cost of war, and why he said the US should leave Afghanistan. \nWhite House officials carried big bouquets of flowers inside the hospital, to help brighten the rooms of the injured men and women.\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that fighters had moved into the Panjshir Valley after negotiations failed, Reuters news agency reports.\nTalks failed because the two sides held very different positions, BBC Persian quoted NRF spokesman Fahim Dashti as saying.  \nHe said they were fighting the Taliban on two fronts and that 350 Taliban fighters had been killed and a number captured.\nClaims from either side are difficult to verify.\nReports of Taliban fighters searching for, and killing, people such as senior police officials and government officials  contradict the more moderate image the group sought to portray when it took control of the country.\nAre you a British national in Afghanistan or did you work for the UK government in Afghanistan?

      "text": "Jordan has been chased by debt collection agencies after falling behind on payments for clothes.\nThe 23-year-old bought a winter coat using Buy Now Pay Later when employed, but then lost his job.\nAccording to Citizens Advice, one in 10 shoppers who use this type of credit end up being pursued by debt collectors.\nThe Treasury said it was \"stepping in and regulating\" the market so people \"are treated fairly\".\nJordan started using Buy Now Pay Later after seeing it advertised on social media apps and on the iPhone app store. He decided to use it to buy a coat for \u00a3200.\n\"It was quite cold, it was the winter, and at that point I didn't have a lot of clothes,\" he said. \"I was in a job, and I was able to pay it, but I ended up being quite unfortunate and losing that job.\"\nHe bought some other items including a hat, but fell behind with the payments to firms including Laybuy and Klarna.\n\"It was quite difficult for me to keep on top of it. I went through a lot of anxiety and depression,\" he said, and began to be chased by debt collection agencies.\n\"They don't give any leeway or ease with it at all,\" he says. \"They call up quite a bit [and email]. It does make me stressed when I'm being constantly called and badgered about it.\"\n\"I think [Buy Now Pay Later] is quite dangerous, to be honest,\" Jordan says. \"Especially on the advertising. They make it out to be such a good thing... but that's only condoning debt.\"\nJordan has recently moved to Bristol to start a new job, and will be in a position to pay off the debt.\nLaybuy said: \"Laybuy only refers a customer to a debt collector as a last resort, and only after other attempts to collect the outstanding payment have been exhausted.\n\"When a debt is referred to a debt collector, we only ever refer outstanding purchase price of the product.\n\"Late fees, which are limited to a maximum of \u00a324 for a single order, are never passed to a debt collector. Laybuy also pays all the cost for debt collection.\"\nAlex Marsh, head of Klarna UK, said: \"At Klarna we only ever use debt collection agencies to help us contact customers we are unable to reach and we do this on fewer than 1% of orders.\n\"The debt collection agencies we work with are all Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)-authorised and will only contact customers by telephone or email and do not use bailiffs.\n\"We encourage any of our customers whose circumstances have changed, to please get in touch so we can help you with a plan to get back on track.\"\nBuy Now Pay Later options often appear at checkouts on retailers' websites, and can help spread the cost of purchases, interest-free, potentially avoiding expensive credit.\nBut Citizens Advice said that for many people Buy Now Pay Later can be \"a slippery slope into debt\".\nIt added that it \"fears shoppers have been left unprotected and ill-informed during the rapid expansion of the sector\".\n\"Not one of the BNPL checkouts on leading retailers' websites warned people they could be referred to debt collectors for missed payments,\" the advice service said.\nShoppers were charged \u00a339m in late fees in the past year, it estimated.\nOf those who were referred to a debt collector for missed payments, 96% said there had been negative consequences.\nMillions of online shoppers have being clicking the buttons to spread the payments, but as the number of users has grown, so have the criticisms. \nBuy Now Pay Later arrangements aren't viewed as a normal loan by credit reference agencies and other lenders. \nIt becomes a kind of invisible debt to the safety net system, so people with lots of little Buy Now Pay Later debts can get in a mess trying to juggle those payments alongside other loans and interest at the same time.\nFears are growing that younger people are being saddled with unnecessary debt, and that those who are already vulnerable are slipping further down the debt spiral. \nAlthough the government said in February that they will regulate the sector, they haven't done so yet. \nThese included sleepless nights, ignoring texts, emails and letters in case they were about debts, avoiding answering the door, borrowing money to repay the debt, or deteriorating mental health.\nCitizens Advice said that a woman aged in her 60s was trying to buy plants online, but struggled to find the postage cost at the checkout and decided to abandon her purchase.\nThe keen gardener was surprised to receive an email saying she had signed up to a buy now pay later agreement, and tried to cancel her order.\nShe told Citizens Advice: \"I really don't understand how I ended up paying for my plants through buy now, pay later.\n\"I didn't understand what it was. Then I get these threatening emails saying they're going to contact debt collectors, and then I got a letter from a debt collector.\n\"I couldn't sleep, I lay awake worrying that someone was going to turn up to my house and start taking things. I have a number of health issues and I was worried this was going to make me ill again. It was eventually resolved, but at great stress to me.\"\nMillie Harris, a debt adviser at Citizens Advice East Devon, said: \"My concern is that people aren't processing the fact that buy now pay later is credit. They don't realise there are going to be consequences if they don't pay - it gives them a false sense of security.\n\"I've seen people using it for their kids' clothes and shoes that they would otherwise never be able to afford. They are taking out what is effectively a loan, but they don't see it as one.\n\"For example, I helped someone who has tens of thousands of pounds of debt, but they don't see buy now pay later as part of that total.\n\"It's almost under-the-radar debt.\"\nDame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, agrees: \"A seamless buy now pay later checkout process should not mean shoppers have to dig around in the small print to find out they're taking out a credit agreement, and could be referred to debt collectors if they can't pay. The warnings should be unmissable.\"\nCitizens Advice is urging anyone who has been contacted by debt collectors to get free, independent debt advice.\nA Treasury spokesperson said: \"Buy Now Pay Later can be a helpful way to manage your finances but it's important that consumers are protected as these agreements become more popular.\n\"By stepping in and regulating, we're making sure people are treated fairly and only offered agreements they can afford.\"\nOn 2 February, the government announced it would to bring unregulated interest-free Buy Now Pay Later products into regulation.

If only one [some] councils are coming forward... then the government have got to step in and make sure it does happen.\"\nOne refugee, Ahmed, whose real name is not being used, arrived in the UK from Kabul with his wife and six children in July. \nHe told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme this week about the challenges his family faced.\n\"We have been living in hotels for quite a while now in larger groups and it's becoming tougher and tougher, so it's time for us to move to a proper house,\" he said.\n\"That is the overarching concern we are having, because we can't have a bank account.\"\nSchemes for people fleeing the country include the existing Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) for Afghans who worked with the UK government and a new Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) for vulnerable people. \nFunding models for the resettlement schemes are still being developed, but initial proposals suggested the figures would be based on 5,000 Afghans arriving under the ACRS scheme per year (capped at 20,000 people) at a cost of \u00a3715m, 5,000 arriving under the UK Resettlement Scheme each year at a cost of \u00a31.65bn, and 7,000 arriving under the ARAP scheme in 2021-2 at a cost of \u00a3190m. \nThe document also suggested that while some refugees would require more support than others, local authorities should be given a set amount per person housed to make their funding easier to plan. \nIt recommended local authorities should be given \u00a320,520 per person split over three years, plus more for education costs.\nIt also recommended extra healthcare funding of \u00a33,200 per person and \u00a315m funding per year to \"international partners\" to support resettlement in third countries.\nThese initial funding proposals suggest the costs would reach \u00a3187m in 2021/2 and \u00a3975m over the course of this spending review period - which lasts until 2024/5. \nBut the document said that with just under \u00a3400m of this funding already committed, there would be a shortfall of approximately \u00a3557m, so confirmation of further funding from the Treasury will be required \"urgently\".\nLabour's Mr Thomas-Symonds accused ministers of being \"disastrously complacent\" throughout the crisis in Afghanistan.\nHe said: \"Councils across the country want to do the right thing, so it's deeply worrying that the UK government is failing to step up and play its role in providing national coordination, leadership and support.\"\nThe shadow home secretary called on the prime minister to urgently set out details on how promised funding would be spent to \"allow Afghan people who have been through hellish experiences rebuild their lives here\".\nA spokesperson from the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said that the government was calling on all councils who had not yet offered, to come forward with offers of support. \n\"Thanks to the efforts of nearly a third of Britain's councils and vital delivery partners, hundreds of Afghan nationals who have worked alongside our Armed Forces and diplomats in Afghanistan, risking their lives supporting us, have already been warmly welcomed to the country,\" they said.\n\"Councils in England, Scotland and Wales will have access to a share of an additional \u00a35m to help them provide the necessary housing and support to Afghans who have worked for this country in Afghanistan, but who now face threats of persecution or worse.\""

It is not yet clear whether Elsheikh has reached a plea deal with authorities.\nThe two men were flown from US custody in Iraq last year to face the charges, which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.\nOriginally from west London, their alleged IS gang was given its Beatles nickname by hostages due to their British accents. They were stripped of their UK nationality in 2018.\nSome of the victims were beheaded, with their deaths filmed and broadcast on social media. The high-profile killings triggered outrage around the world.\nThe group's alleged ringleader, Mohammed Emwazi, known as \"Jihadi John\", was killed in a drone strike in 2015.\nAnother gang member, Aine Davis, was arrested and imprisoned in Turkey.\nKotey and Elsheikh remained at large until they were captured in 2018 by Syrian Kurds fighting IS.\nThe US government had wanted to put them on trial but was lacking evidence.\nThe men were in a legal limbo for several months, held by the US military in Iraq where the US attorney general threatened to hand them over to local courts, known for their summary justice and executions.\nBut the US said it would not carry out the death penalty if the men were convicted in a US court.\nBritish counter-terrorism officials have since shared crucial evidence with US officials.\nElsheikh is scheduled to go on trial in January.\nKotey's plea deal, meanwhile, carries a minimum sentence of life without parole. But after 15 years he would be eligible to be transferred to the UK to face any possible charges there.\nHis sentencing is due to take place in March next year."

      "text": "The national shortage of lorry drivers could lead to a rise in food prices, wholesalers have warned.\nDarren Labbett, managing director of Woods Foodservice, told the BBC that his industry was facing a \"perfect storm\" of adverse effects.\n\"We've got the Brexit situation and the after-effects of the pandemic coming together at the same time,\" he added.\nMr Labbett said the cost of vegetable oil was at a 30-year high because of higher shipping costs and demand.\n\"As we came out of lockdown, the demand for everything went through the roof overnight,\" he said.\nMr Labbett added that wholesalers were \"trying our utmost\" to absorb the extra costs instead of passing them on, \"but we can't absorb those price increases forever\".\nJames Bielby, chief executive of the Federation of Wholesale Distributors, which represents about 600 firms in the wholesale sector, said there were \"chronic\" staff shortages throughout the food and drink supply chain, with up to half a million vacancies.\n\"That means all businesses - growers, processers, wholesalers and manufacturers - having to offer incentives to retain and recruit staff, and costs are rising as a result,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Under these circumstances, it is inevitable that some of these cost increases will be passed through the supply chain, which will lead to food price inflation.\"\nMany businesses have been complaining about the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, which continues to cause serious supply chain problems.\nThe coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes have all contributed to a lack of qualified drivers. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortfall of about 100,000 workers.\nOn Thursday, Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability from the British Retail Consortium told the UK Trade and Business Commission food manufacturing was under severe strain because of shortages of HGV drivers and other supply chain staff, meaning that some production might have to move out of the UK.\nThe British Frozen Food Federation's chief executive, Richard Harrow, told the commission he was concerned that smaller food businesses like wholesalers and catering firms were missing out because haulage companies were having to prioritise bigger customers like supermarkets. \n\"Many wholesalers have seen their businesses close down during the pandemic with the restaurant industry closed, and so they had a very difficult period,\" he said. \"Now they're coming out of that and seeing strong demand, but they're struggling to get drivers and struggling to get deliveries.\n\"If you're a haulage company and you're restricted because of drivers, you're going to go where the work is easiest. If you're then being asked to drop a number of different pallets in different locations to smaller wholesalers, it ticks the 'too difficult to do' box', so I think they will be disproportionately impacted,\" Mr Harrow added. \nHowever, wholesalers point to a number of other factors that are also threatening to push up prices.\nDavid Josephs, owner of All Greens Wholesale, a fruit and vegetable importer and wholesaler in London, said Brexit had been the biggest cause of additional costs for his business.\n\"We have an operation out of Milan, we ship twice a week, and just those two shipments a week coming out of Milan, the paperwork, purely the paperwork, is costing us an additional \u20ac52,000 (\u00a344,650) a year,\" he told the BBC. \n\"But with Covid now as well, growers around Europe have been affected with labour shortages and therefore, goods haven't been picked out of the ground and therefore there is a shortage.\"\nBad weather had also reduced crop yields, he added.\nWeek to 27 August 2021, compared with week to 28 August 2020\nWhich have gone up in price?\nWhich have gone down in price?\nSource: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"

      "text": "One of the UK's largest suppliers of seasonal flu vaccines has said there will be a delay in jab deliveries to some GP surgeries due to issues related to a shortage of HGV drivers.\nSeqirus, one of the world's largest flu vaccine companies, said it had told customers about delays of up to a fortnight.\nThe company said it was \"working hard to resolve the delay\".\nNHS England says patients who are affected will be contacted by their GP.\nSeqirus, which supplies vaccines to GP practices and pharmacies in England and Wales, said: \"Due to unforeseen challenges linked with road freight delays, we have informed all our customers of a consequent delay to their scheduled vaccine delivery by a maximum of one to two weeks.\nThe company, which is one of a number of suppliers, said customers would be able to reschedule their flu vaccination clinics.\nThe professional body representing GPs said it would hit practices.\n\"This is news we really didn't want to hear\", said Dr Gary Howsam, vice chairman of the Royal College of GPs.\n\"With more than 36 million people eligible for the flu vaccine on the NHS this year, GPs need the supply chain to run like clockwork.\nDr Howsam said GPs are \"already under enormous pressure and still waiting for details of how the Covid booster campaign will align with everything else they need to do this winter\".\nDoctors meticulously plan jabs each year, he said, adding that it is \"essential that as many people as possible in at-risk groups get their vaccination as early into the flu season as possible\".\n\"A delay of even a couple of weeks is going to have a big impact on practices and their patients, especially when GPs are already dealing with the fallout caused by the shortage of blood test bottles and the anxiety this is causing.\"\n\"General practice and the entire NHS is dependent on the smooth roll-out of the winter flu vaccination programme. It cannot fail,\" he said.\nDoctors are already dealing with a shortage of blood test tube vials due to supply chain issues.\nDr Richard Vautrey, British Medical Association GP committee chairman, said the delay is likely to affect a \"significant proportion\" of practices - and have a \"serious impact\" on practice workloads and patients.\nHe said: \"Many practices will have spent the last few days and weeks meticulously planning for their flu vaccination programme, inviting and booking patients in for their jabs, only now to have to contact them all again to cancel or reschedule appointments.\n\"This causes a huge increase in staff's already unsustainable workloads, and inconvenience and unneeded anxiety for patients who will be keen to be protected ahead of winter.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: \"GPs are at their wits' end, first forced to cancel blood tests because of bottle shortages and now we learn flu vaccines will be delayed.\n\"This has been a summer of crisis for the NHS with patients paying the price.\n\"With winter coming and flu resurgence a huge risk, ministers must urgently get a grip.\""

      "text": "A former BBC reporter who claims she was sexually assaulted while working undercover to expose abuse in the fashion industry has given a statement to French police. \nLisa Brinkworth posed as a model in a documentary for the BBC's Donal McIntyre Investigates series in 1998. \nShe alleges she was sexually assaulted by one of the world's biggest model agents, Gerald Marie, during filming.\nAlong with 13 other former models, she is giving details of her alleged assault to French authorities who have begun a preliminary investigation.\n\"I would very much like to see justice for them. And particularly because they were just so young and powerless at the time. \n\"When it happened to me... I was much older, I was working as a journalist, but when I think about them, at 16 or 17 [years old] in some cases, and completely powerless on their own with him, that's what gives me the drive to carry on.\"\nGerald Marie, who was the former European head of Elite Models, through his lawyer, issued a statement saying he \"refutes with dismay these false and defamatory allegations\". \n\"He shall be withholding his eventual statements until speaking to the competent authorities.\"\nAccording to a report in the Guardian newspaper, the investigation is being led by a specialist child protection unit in France.\nLisa says that after a dinner with other models and Marie's business friends, she accompanied a small group, including Marie, to a club, where he pinned her down to a chair and sexually assaulted her. She said the incident was witnessed by a number of people, including her colleague Donal MacIntyre.\nAfterwards, she recorded her account of the assault on camera, but did not go to the police.\n\"I was directed not to at the time, because it would have cut short the investigation. At that time, we were working very intensively undercover. I was working 20 hour days, I think we were exhausted. We were so focused on the story. I didn't question that wisdom. And I know now I should have done.\n\"And then of course, in retrospect, I wish I had. It's only recently when I decided to look at this again, and I started to investigate and I started to revisit this, and women were prepared to speak out.\"\nAfter the documentary aired in November 1999, Elite Models sued the BBC alleging misrepresentation. \nThey reached a confidential settlement which included the BBC not airing the documentary ever again. The BBC also told Lisa that the settlement agreement prevented it providing footage to her.\n\"It just seems so, so wrong to me that these women have gone through some decades really carrying this trauma,\" Lisa says.\n\"I feel responsibility myself because I started doing that work. And I feel that the settlement with Elite sort of halted progress.\"\nUnder French law, all of the women have exhausted their statute of limitation -  the time in which they could have pursued a criminal case against Gerald Marie. \nBut Anne-Claire Lejeune, Lisa's lawyer, says she argued with the Paris prosecutor that Lisa was prevented at the time from being able to seek criminal justice and therefore her statute of limitations should be paused in order for an investigation to begin. \nShe says that argument, combined with the number of women making similar accusations against Marie, ultimately convinced the prosecutor to give the go-ahead for a preliminary investigation. \n\"I had four victims who contacted me last September, who told me their stories, that they were raped - when they were a minor, for some of them, and for others when they were 20 or 22, and they wanted to press charges against Gerald Marie. \n\"So we submitted their testimonies to the French Prosecutor and he decided to open a preliminary investigation against Gerald Marie for rapes and sexual assault.\"\nAnne-Claire says she has so far spoken with 31 women who have detailed similar accusations against Gerald Marie. She confirms that 14 will be interviewed by French authorities, but the rest are \"not ready to talk officially right now\".\n\"For women who don't feel ready to talk, they can give their testimony without giving their names. They can stay anonymous during the investigation. They can write to me and I'll submit it to the prosecutor or they can write to the prosecutor directly.\"\nLisa believes the undercover recordings she gathered for the BBC documentary are evidence of her assault and has requested the footage from her former employer. So far, she says, they have refused to pass it on to her.\nAccording to the New York Times, ex model Carrie Otis has launched a separate legal action against Gerald Marie, accusing him of repeatedly raping her in Paris when she was 17.\nCatherine Donaldson is also going to Paris to give an account of her sexual assault accusation against Gerald Marie. She says in 1985, when she was an aspiring model, he invited her to his apartment after convincing her he was having a party. No-one else turned up, she claims, and Marie offered her drugs, which she declined, before he \"pounced on her\", sexually assaulting her.\n\"My agent in England knew that this could potentially happen to me in Paris, but as she said, she thought I could handle it,\" says Catherine. \n\"It was recognised, enough people knew he was doing that. He was allowed.\"\nShe later went on to make a film called Couch, which was a fictionalised version, she says of her experience with Gerald Marie.\nLaurie Marsden, who lives in Australia, claims in that 1982, Gerald Marie pushed her onto a bed and attempted to rape her after a party at his flat in Paris. \n\"One of the questions that people ask is, well, why didn't you report it at the time? And I say that is the wrong question. The question is, why did it take so long for women to be heard, for women to feel comfortable to come forward and tell their stories, for women to be believed and not to be victim blamed?\"\nIn a statement, the BBC said it was \"doing everything\" it could to assist Lisa with her complaint.\n\"We take these matters very seriously and we know this is distressing for Lisa Brinkworth. We are doing everything we can to help Lisa pursue her complaint with the French authorities. \n\"Our lawyers have provided documents to the French investigators and to Lisa and we are in continuing discussions with Lisa and her lawyers on how we can help further as the legal process progresses.\"\nAnne-Claire says she believes there are potentially more women, within the statute of limitations, who can contribute to the investigation, but who are unaware that one is being conducted.\n\"That's why my clients want to send a message saying if you have been a victim then please come forward.\"\nHave you been personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "text": "UK residents are hoarding an estimated \u00a350m in loose change, with little sign of it all being spent as Covid restrictions ease.\nNearly six in 10 people are holding coins at home, according to a survey by banking trade body UK Finance.\nPeople tend to hold on to 1p, 2p, 5p and 10p coins.\nThe findings have prompted pleas for this money to be given to charity, as cash donations dropped during the Covid crisis.\nUK Finance data suggests that people have been holding on to cash three times longer than they used to owing, in part, to the coronavirus lockdowns.\nMany retailers and entertainment venues were shut, and some shops have encouraged the use of contactless payments over cash.\nThe research said that cash use had risen - notably among 35 to 54-year-olds - as restrictions were eased.\n\"It is clear that with the reopening of the economy there has been some degree of revival in cash transactions,\" it said.\nAdrian Buckle, head of research at UK Finance, told the BBC that when people received a high-value coin in change, such as a \u00a31 or \u00a32 coin, they tended to carry it with them and spend it.\nHowever, when it came to a low-value coin, \"seven out of 10 of us will drop it in a pot at home and we forget about them\".\nWith those coins disappearing from circulation, more had to be manufactured to replace them, with the cost reaching \u00a350m last year, he said.\nThe stash of low-value coins in people's homes still showed little chance of being spent in the next two or three months, the report suggested.\nAmong the 1,000 people surveyed, most tended to hoard cash primarily for security, but also to pay friends and neighbours for shopping, for gifts and for pocket money.\nAlthough the amounts held tended to be below \u00a3100, this could have an impact on the way cash flowed around the economy, the report said.\nUK Finance said this raised questions about the mix of coins in circulation in the UK. Two years ago, the Treasury said that 1p and 2p coins would continue to be used \"for years to come\".\n\"Industry and policymakers may need to actively encourage greater recycling of hoarded cash to avoid significant wastage to the UK economy,\" the report said.\nOne way to do that was by urging people to give loose change to charity, it said.\nThe Charities Aid\u00a0Foundation found that more than half the charities they\u00a0spoke to\u00a0last year\u00a0had seen a drop in donations.\u00a0That coincided with four in 10 charities reporting increased demand for help from those in need.\u00a0 \n\"Cash donations to charities, normally the country's most popular way of giving, saw a substantial decline during 2020 and remain at very low levels compared to previous years,\" said Neil Heslop, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation.\n\"As charities struggle to resume fundraising, while continuing to work on the frontlines of the response to the pandemic, donating spare loose change would be a huge show of much-needed support at a critical time.\"\nEric Leenders, managing director of personal finance at UK Finance said:\u00a0 \"Putting your pennies in a charity box is a great way to help those in need.\"\u00a0"

      "text": "Fresh fighting has been reported in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remains out of the hands of the Taliban.\nOne of the resistance leaders in the valley, Amrullah Saleh, dismissed reports that the Taliban had captured it as \"baseless\".\nBut he admitted conditions are difficult, with the Taliban closing phone, internet and electricity lines. \nThe fighting comes with the Taliban set to finalise a government. \nPanjshir Valley, north of the capital Kabul, is one of Afghanistan's smallest provinces and the only one not to have fallen to the Taliban.\nThe traditional anti-Taliban stronghold is home to somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 people, and is hidden behind mountain peaks. \nThe resistance - which includes former Afghan security force members and local militias - is led by local tribal leader Ahmad Massoud. His father successfully fought the Soviets who invaded in the 1980s, and the Taliban in the 1990s.\nIn a video message sent to the BBC, Mr Saleh, a former vice-president of Afghanistan, said there had been casualties on both sides. \n\"There is no doubt we are in a difficult situation. We are under invasion by the Taliban,\" he said, adding that his forces would not surrender.\nBut resistance leaders concede that some districts have fallen to the Taliban, while pro-Taliban social media showed clips seeming to show their fighters with captured tanks and other military gear.  \nRumours that the Taliban had captured Panjshir prompted celebratory gunfire to ring out in Kabul and other cities, reportedly killing a number of people.\nA Taliban spokesman said fighters should \"avoid firing in the air and thank God instead\".\nBy Yalda Hakim, BBC News\nBoth sides see the next few weeks as crucial to determining the fate of the anti-Taliban resistance. \nThe Taliban leadership want to crush Saleh and his group before announcing a new government. \nBut if they fail to do so by late October, the harsh winter months are likely to prevent further large-scale offensives. \nSaleh's National Resistance Front, on the other hand, are playing for time. If the anti-Taliban fighters can hold ground for another few weeks, that will give them at least five months to remobilise and try to persuade foreign powers to aid their cause.\nWith the Taliban expected to announce a new government in the coming days, foreign powers are adapting to the new reality of dealing with a Taliban administration.\nThe head of Pakistan's intelligence agency, Faiz Hameed, is in Kabul for talks. An official told Reuters earlier this week he could help the Taliban reorganise the Afghan military. \nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken is travelling to Qatar on Sunday. The country plays a key mediating role in Afghanistan, but he is not expected to meet anyone from the Taliban. \nThe European Union and UK on Friday joined the US in saying they will deal with the Islamist group, but won't recognise them as Afghanistan's government.\nThe BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet, who is in Kabul, says that while the Taliban are seeking international acceptance, they are seeking it on their terms. \nIf the West does not want to deal with them, there are other powers such as China, Russia and Pakistan they can turn to, our correspondent adds."

      "text": "Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says the UK and Pakistan have a \"shared interest\" in securing a \"stable and peaceful future for Afghanistan\".\nMr Raab has met his Pakistani counterpart and the country's prime minister as part of his regional tour.\nThe foreign secretary's visit is part of efforts to secure safe passage for Britons and others trying to leave Afghanistan. \nIt comes as the UK announced \u00a330m in aid to bordering countries.\nThe funding will help provide shelter and sanitation for the tens of thousands of refugees expected to flee the Taliban regime.\nMr Raab promised the UK would be \"shouldering our humanitarian responsibilities\" to help Afghans, as well as neighbouring countries who are taking in the majority of refugees. \nMeanwhile, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee - which questioned Mr Raab earlier this week - has announced it will hold an inquiry on UK policy towards Afghanistan. \nIts chair, Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, said \"big questions remain\" over the UK's withdrawal from the country and its future approach to the region.\nHe added: \"The true extent of the damage done will only become clear in the coming months and years. However, it is already clear that the world has become more dangerous and unstable.\" \nIn his first visit to Pakistan as foreign secretary, Mr Raab met the country's foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, before holding talks with Prime Minister Imran Khan.\nIn a joint press conference with Mr Qureshi, the foreign secretary said the UK would be \"supporting those countries who face greatest demands from those who may be displaced in the weeks ahead\".\nPakistan, which shares a border with Afghanistan, is a key player in the crisis and already hosts about three million Afghan refugees. \nMr Raab said \"no-one wants to see the economic and social fabric of Afghanistan collapse\", but the UK wanted to work with humanitarian agencies to help, rather than the Taliban itself.\nThe two-days of discussions were also expected to focus on how to encourage the Taliban to allow safe passage for refugees and prevent Afghanistan becoming a hub for terrorist groups. \nThe Foreign Office has already sent officials to help process those crossing the border. \nBut Mr Raab has been criticised by MPs for not focusing more on the country. \nThis week, he has been visiting the region to build a coalition with neighbouring countries to \"exert the maximum moderating influence\" on the Taliban. \nAfter talks with leaders in Qatar on Thursday, the foreign secretary said evacuations may be able to resume from Kabul airport \"in the near future\". \nThe Afghan capital's airport is out of action following the withdrawal of US troops last week.\nAnd on Thursday evening he said he had spoken to Tajikistan foreign minister Sirojiddin Muhriddin about \"how our countries can help maintain stability in the region, and tackle the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan\".\nOf the \u00a330m in aid offered to neighbouring countries, Mr Raab said \u00a310m would be made available immediately to humanitarian organisations in order to get supplies to Afghanistan's borders.\nCountries predicted to experience a significant increase in refugees will also receive \u00a320m to help with processing new arrivals and to provide essential services and supplies.\nUNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has estimated a worst-case scenario of more than 500,000 refugees fleeing Afghanistan to Pakistan, Tajikistan, Iran, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan in the coming months.\nMr Raab said: \"It is vital that we help those fleeing Afghanistan and do not allow the crisis there to undermine regional stability.\"\nHe added that the aid showed the UK's \"commitment to shoulder our humanitarian responsibility\".\nMore than 15,000 people have been evacuated by the UK from Afghanistan so far, including more than 5,000 British nationals,.\nThe last British plane flying people out of Kabul took off on Saturday, as the remaining foreign troops withdrew from the country.\nIt is feared thousands of people eligible for relocation, including Afghans who worked for the British and their families, have been left behind. \nMr Raab has estimated the number of UK nationals still in the country is in the \"low hundreds\" but he was unable to give a precise figure of the number of eligible Afghans who were unable to get on evacuation flights.\nLast month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced an increase in aid to Afghanistan to \u00a3286m, amid a policy to cut spending on overseas assistance.\nThe UK sent \u00a3290m of aid to Afghanistan in 2019, according to a briefing from the House of Commons Library, and the government pledged \u00a3155m in aid for 2021 at the Afghanistan Conference in November 2020. \nAre you a British national in Afghanistan or did you work for the UK government in Afghanistan?
