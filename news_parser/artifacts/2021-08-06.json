      "tags": "September 11 attacks,Saudi Arabia,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Family members of the victims of the 11 September 2001 terror attacks have called on President Joe Biden to stay away from memorial events unless he declassifies files about the attacks.\nNearly 1,800 people signed a letter calling on him to release documents that they believe implicate officials from Saudi Arabia in the plot. \nThey say that if he refuses, he should not attend ceremonies next month to commemorate the 20th anniversary.\nNearly 3,000 people died on 9/11.\nThe attacks were committed by the Al Qaeda terror group, investigators say, and triggered the US invasion of Afghanistan. Fifteen of the 19 plane hijackers were Saudi nationals.\n\"We cannot in good faith, and with veneration to those lost, sick, and injured, welcome the president to our hallowed grounds until he fulfils his commitment,\" says the letter from family members, first responders and survivors.\nThey call on President Biden to stay away from the three sites where the attacks took place - in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania.\nThe families have long argued that Saudi officials had advance knowledge of the attack, and did nothing to stop it. They have sued the government of Saudi Arabia, which has denied being involved.\nLast month, the lawsuit saw several top former Saudi officials questioned under oath. The depositions remain sealed, further upsetting families.\n\"Since the conclusion of the 9/11 Commission in 2004 much investigative evidence has been uncovered implicating Saudi government officials in supporting the attacks,\" the families' statement continues.\n\"Through multiple administrations, the Department of Justice and the FBI have actively sought to keep this information secret and prevent the American people from learning the full truth about the 9/11 attacks.\"\nThe administrations of George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump also declined to declassify the documents, citing national security concerns.\n\"Twenty years later, there is simply no reason - unmerited claims of 'national security' or otherwise - to keep this information secret,\" the group writes. \"But if President Biden reneges on his commitment and sides with the Saudi government, we would be compelled to publicly stand in objection to any participation by his administration in any memorial ceremony of 9/11.\""

      "text": "Apple has announced details of a system to find child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on US customers' devices. \nBefore an image is stored onto iCloud Photos, the technology will search for matches of already known CSAM.\nApple said that if a match is found a human reviewer will then assess and report the user to law enforcement. \nHowever there are privacy concerns that the technology could be expanded to scan phones for prohibited content or even political speech. \nExperts worry that the technology could be used by authoritarian governments to spy on its citizens. \nApple said that new versions of iOS and iPadOS - due to be released later this year - will have \"new applications of cryptography to help limit the spread of CSAM online, while designing for user privacy\".\nThe system works by comparing pictures to a database of known child sexual abuse images compiled by the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and other child safety organisations. \nThose images are translated into \"hashes\", numerical codes that can be \"matched\" to an image on an Apple device. \nApple says the technology will also catch edited but similar versions of original images. \n\"Before an image is stored in iCloud Photos, an on-device matching process is performed for that image against the known CSAM hashes,\" Apple said. \nThe company claimed the system had an \"extremely high level of accuracy and ensures less than a one in one trillion chance per year of incorrectly flagging a given account\".\nApple says that it will manually review each report to confirm there is a match. It can then take steps to disable a user's account and report to law enforcement. \nThe company says that the new technology offers \"significant\" privacy benefits over existing techniques - as Apple only learns about users' photos if they have a collection of known CSAM in their iCloud Photos account.\nHowever some privacy experts have voiced concerns. \n\"Regardless of what Apple's long term plans are, they've sent a very clear signal. In their (very influential) opinion, it is safe to build systems that scan users' phones for prohibited content,\" Matthew Green, a security researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said.\n\"Whether they turn out to be right or wrong on that point hardly matters. This will break the dam \u2014 governments will demand it from everyone.\""

      "tags": "Margaret Thatcher,Coal mining",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has been urged to apologise for \"offensive\" comments about Margaret Thatcher helping the environment by closing coal mines.\nThe PM said the closures gave the UK \"a big early start\" in the fight against climate change.\nHe was speaking on a visit to an offshore wind farm in the Moray Firth.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the remarks were \"crass and deeply insensitive\" to mining communities.\nShe tweeted: \"Lives and communities in Scotland were utterly devastated by Thatcher's destruction of the coal industry (which had zero to do with any concern she had for the planet).\"\nLabour said he should apologise for the \"shameful\" comments.\nThe party's Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The damage done to Welsh coal mining areas 30 years ago was incalculable and here we are 30 years later the Tories are still celebrating what they did.\"\nOn Thursday, during a two-day visit to Scotland, Mr Johnson was quizzed about preparations for the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November.\nPushed on whether he would set a deadline for ending the extraction of fossil fuels, he said the UK had already transitioned away from coal in his lifetime, and he suggested Mrs Thatcher had inadvertently got the ball rolling.\nHe said: \"Thanks to Margaret Thatcher, who closed so many coal mines across the country, we had a big early start and we're now moving rapidly away from coal altogether.\"\nHe is reported to have laughed and told reporters: \"I thought that would get you going.\" \nBoris Johnson may be ill-advised to summon the ghost of Lady T to support his climate policies - but he has a point. \nIn 1989, the Iron Lady riveted the United Nations by warning that greenhouse gases were \"changing the environment of our planet in damaging and dangerous ways\".\nShe continued: \"The result is that change in future is likely to be more fundamental and more widespread than anything we have known hitherto.\" \nHer pit closures were not part of a green policy, but they did fortuitously show the UK could prosper without coal. \nThis made Britain a global leader on climate change. But it crushed communities.\nPoliticians don't want to repeat the mistake, so they aim to create jobs in the environment sector. \nBut so far, the PM's climate advisors say his policies on green jobs are running behind his rhetoric.\nMr Johnson said there was a \"massive opportunity\" to increase the use of more environmentally friendly technologies.\nBut he also stressed that there needed to be a \"smooth and sensible\" transition from oil and gas to greener forms of power.\nIn 1984, there were 170 working collieries in Britain, employing more than 190,000 people - but by 2015, they had all closed. \nMrs Thatcher's announcement that she planned to close 20 of them, led to the year-long miners' dispute.\nMillions of people protested against pit closures and throughout the summer of 1984 there were violent clashes between striking miners and police, whose numbers often ran into several hundred at each confrontation.\nViolence led to widespread use of the breach of the peace charge.\nIn October, it was announced that miners convicted during the strike would be pardoned by the Scottish government following an independent review.\nResponding to Mr Johnson's comments, SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, tweeted that Mrs Thatcher had \"devastated communities across Scotland\". \nHe wrote: \"Many still bear the scars of brutal Tory cuts.\"\nBBC Political Correspondent, Nick Eardley, tweeted on Thursday that \"a few Scottish Tories have their head in their hands tonight after what they thought had been a decent first trip to Scotland since January\".\nHe added they had described the comments as an  \"unforced error\", \"not helpful\" and \"crass\". \nLabour is opposed to the opening of new coal mines, saying they are not compatible with the UK wanting to be a world leader in reducing carbon emissions. \nBut Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, tweeted that Mr Johnson's comments were \"shameful\". \nHe wrote: \"Brushing off the devastating impact on those communities with a laugh, shows just how out of touch he is with working people\".\nAnd in a statement, shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the prime minister should apologise.\nShe said the remarks \"reveal the Conservative party's utter disregard for the communities still scarred by Thatcher's closure of the mines and failure to deliver good jobs in their place\".\n\"It is vital that a green transition is a fair transition\" she added.

      "title": "Covid cases and hospital admissions down - is it over?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "When the government in England announced it was lifting nearly all remaining restrictions, it was branded a \"dangerous\" and \"unethical\" experiment by critical scientists. \nBut - just two weeks on from the 19 July unlocking - both infections and now hospital admissions are falling.\nA similar pattern is emerging elsewhere in the UK where restrictions have also been eased - albeit not quite as much as in England. Has the gamble paid off?\nIt is important to remember that despite the warnings government modellers had always suggested this scenario was possible.\nAt the start of July they were talking about a peak of between 1,000 and 2,000 hospital admissions a day - although there was a large degree of uncertainty. \nThe hardest thing for them to predict was people's behaviour. At the start of July the number of contacts people were having was still much lower than pre-pandemic - four a day compared with 10 previously.\nThe scientists predicted if there was a gradual return to normal, hospital admissions would not go above 1,000 - exactly what seems to have happened.\n\"If it was a gamble, it was a calculated one,\" says one of the modellers. \"This is not some unexpected accident.\"\nIt is true, though, that ministers and government scientists did express concerns that the situation might have got much worse than it has. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said cases could reach 100,000 a day, while Prof Neil Ferguson, one of the key modellers, said there could even be 200,000 cases.\nThese scenarios were possible - at the time infection rates were doubling every 10 days - but they were at the upper end of the modelling scenarios.\nBut there was a reason why the figures were put forward so publicly. It was, in part, to influence behaviour.\n\"We messed up the communication about masks,\" said one government source. \"We had ministers claiming they were ditching them - it was giving the wrong impression when we needed the public to remain cautious. \n\"We knew we had to rein things back again.\"\nThe falls are, of course, very encouraging. There have been a lot of theories put forward as to why - from the European Championship football tournament ending, to the sheer numbers of people being \"pinged\" and being asked to isolate. \nWhen it comes down to it, two things basically influence the spread of the virus - the levels of immunity in the population and the contacts we are having.\nProf Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, says it is clear we have reached some sort of \"equilibrium\" and a further surge in cases related to 19 July is now unlikely, given what is happening.\nAnd by equilibrium he means a situation where the virus is kept in check without the huge surges of the past year and instead ebbs and flows much like we see with other respiratory infections.\nBut the big unknown is what will happen in the autumn when the weather turns, people are indoors more, are back in the office and children are at school.\nThis equilibrium is not a fixed state. \nWaning immunity and increasing contacts, particularly inside, could easily lead to a rise. Although that could well be offset by a Covid booster campaign for the most vulnerable groups that looks likely to be announced soon, and the continued rollout of second doses to some of the younger age groups over the next two months.\nProf Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage and one of the signatories of the letter which branded the unlocking dangerous and unethical, says she is very concerned about what the autumn will bring. \n\"Covid is so unpredictable. I acknowledge I was wrong on what was going to happen, but that doesn't mean it's over. We need to get cases down even further - if we go into autumn with 20,000 cases a day I would be very worried.\"\nA number of government modellers have told the BBC they expect to see another rise at some point, as it is so easy to flip between rising and falling cases.\nBut Prof Mike Tildesley, one of the modellers from the University of Warwick, says he would not expect this to be \"a significant resurgence\" unless there is a new variant. \n\"August is a really odd month in terms of contact patterns, but given the success of the vaccination programme I think we can be pretty confident,\" he says.\nIndeed, what this summer has proved is just how effective the Covid vaccines are and how close we are to living with the virus. Despite infections reaching a similar level to that of previous waves, the number of deaths has been much, much lower. \nAt the moment there are fewer than 100 a day on average. To put that into context, during a bad flu season there can be more than 100 deaths and around 1,000 hospital admissions every day for months on end. \nAnd therein lies the problem. Lockdowns and social distancing meant flu and other respiratory infections were hardly present last winter, meaning there is likely to be lower immunity in the population than normal.\n\"If they return on the scale we expect we could see really major pressures build on the NHS that could raise some very difficult questions,\" says Dr Tildesley.\nThe worst of Covid may be behind us, but huge challenges still remain.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "tags": "Electricity pricing,Companies,Resolution Foundation,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Universal Credit",
      "text": "Energy prices will rise for millions of people across the UK in October, right at the start of the cold weather.\nRegulator Ofgem said the price cap for default domestic energy deals would be raised to cover suppliers' extra costs.\nThe typical gas and electricity customer is likely to see their bill go up by \u00a3139 to \u00a31,277 a year. \nCharities warned the timing would hit struggling families hard, who already face losing an extra \u00a320 a week from Universal Credit in October.\nPrepayment customers will see an increase of \u00a3153, from \u00a31,156 to \u00a31309, the regulator said.\nOfgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley told the BBC: \"The reason the price cap is going up is there has been a record increase in energy prices across the board, not just in gas and electricity but in petrol and diesel.\"\nHe urged customers to shop around for the best tariffs, saying there were big savings to be made by switching. \n\"You don't have to live with this tariff. The price cap is a backstop. We'd encourage any customer, particularly those struggling to pay their bills, to contact their supplier, and get access to a wide-range of help and support,\" he said.\n\"This is a devastating increase,\" said Peter Smith, director of policy and advocacy at fuel poverty charity National Energy Action.\n\"Millions of household budgets are already stretched to the limit and this massive increase could not be coming at a worse time.\"\nOfgem said rising wholesale costs were behind the increase, adding that the existence of the price cap meant households would save between \u00a375-\u00a3100 a year.\nThe watchdog also pointed out energy users could switch to a better deal to save up to \u00a3200.\nHowever, the Resolution Foundation says policymakers need to do more to help families who are close to the poverty line.\nJonathan Marshall, senior economist, said the government must focus on widening the current warm homes discount scheme, as well as reversing the planned removal of the \u00a320 Universal Credit uplift. There should also be more targeted support for families at risk of falling into fuel poverty.\n\"A rise in in energy prices will disproportionately impact those who are already struggling,\" said Mr Marshall. \nThe price cap, set twice a year by the regulator, affects 11 million households in England, Wales and Scotland who have never switched suppliers or whose discounted deals have expired. Northern Ireland sets its own cap.\nThat accounts for about half of all UK households. The remainder are on so-called fixed deals, which will not be affected.\nAround four million prepayment meter customers will also be affected.\nThe cap sets the prices that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, but that does not mean there is a limit to how much people can pay. \nThe more gas and electricity you use, the higher the bill.\n\"Finding an extra \u00a320 a month for energy bills will leave me with a stark choice of paying for either food or fuel,\" says Anthony Lyman of Northampton. \nThe 35-year-old autistic single father of two adds: \"We may have to have a cold house to have a full belly.\" \nAnthony lost his job at a special needs school through ill-health at the start of the pandemic and has since been relying on Universal Credit and help with managing his finances from debt charity Christians Against Poverty, as well as being forced to turn to food banks. \n\"We've been relying on the Universal Credit uplift money to get by but the prospect of losing that \u00a320 a week in October and having to pay more for gas and electricity will leave me on a financial knife-edge.\" \nThe energy industry has said there's plenty of help for vulnerable people like Anthony but he says in practice it's almost impossible to get it. \n\"We haven't been able to get in touch with anybody from our suppliers during the pandemic. You can only seem to talk to a computer and it's very difficult to tell a computer I'm struggling.\" \nHow will a rise in energy prices affect you? haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch in the following ways:\nDomestic energy bills are linked to wholesale prices, the price at which energy businesses have to pay for gas and electricity.\nWholesale prices have risen after gas prices soared to a record high as many economies recovered strongly from the Covid-19 crisis, prompting a surge in demand for energy.\nWhen wholesale prices fell last summer following the first lockdown, Ofgem reduced the level of the cap by \u00a384 for last winter.\nBut in February it increased the cap by \u00a396 as wholesale costs rose. \nSince then the wholesale cost of energy - which account for 40% of domestic bills - has climbed by more than 50%, which has led to the latest increase.\nEDF, one of the UK's biggest energy providers, said the \"unprecedented rate\" at which wholesale prices were rising meant that customers would \"at some point see the impact of this global trend\". \nA spokesman said: \"We know this will be worrying news for customers of all suppliers - we will be directing financial assistance to those most in need through a \u00a31.9m support fund, helping customers reduce their bills, manage their debt and even helping with costs for things like more energy efficient white goods.\"\nThe industry's trade body, Energy UK, said people worried about their bills should \"pick up the phone and talk to your supplier\".\nChief executive Emma Pinchbeck told the BBC's Today radio programme: \"There's help and assistance available, particularly for those that are vulnerable and fuel poor.\" She also urged people to consider switching supplier, calling it a \"straightforward\" process. \nThe government also advised people to shop around for the cheapest tariffs, adding that it had simplified the process.\nA spokesperson for the Business Department said: \"To help consumers further, we plan to trial automatic switching for customers on expensive default tariffs to cheaper deals, and are extending the Warm Home Discount so an extra 750,000 households get \u00a3150 knocked off their bill each year.\"\nWhen the energy price cap was introduced three years ago, it was hailed as a shield for customers against unscrupulous energy companies charging sky-high prices. \nBut this October, the cap will rise to its highest ever level, so is it working?\nThe cap applies to a company's default tariff, impacting people who never or rarely change their deal, and also those on pre-payment meters who often have less choice. \nWhile it restricted expensive prices at some companies, there have been accusations that the cap gave other firms an excuse to raise their prices up to same level as the cap. \nWhen fixing the cap point, the regulator says it must consider the wholesale price of gas and electricity so that companies can still make a profit. That's what they describe as setting a fair price.\nThe result is that we've seen more standardised pricing across energy companies at those top rates, but not necessarily a market that's cheaper for most customers. \nWith many people continuing to work from home through the autumn and winter months, and other budgets already being stretched with reductions to Universal Credit, this big jump in utility bills will be an unwelcome extra pressure. \nEnergy users on variable tariffs could move to a different cheaper deal with their existing supplier or switch to another one to save up to hundreds of pounds.\nSwitching online is relatively simple: just use an energy comparison site and all you'll need is your postcode, the name of your current supplier, and the name of your current tariff.\nBut some vulnerable people may not be able to switch, warns National Energy Action.\n\"For some customers, switching is impossible due to levels of debt, or because pre-pay customers have far fewer options to switch supplier or tariff,\" added Mr Smith.\nThe charity has called on Ofgem to provide deeper protection for the most vulnerable customers. \n\"The UK government can also directly help reduce energy arrears as well as maintaining investment to reduce needless energy waste in our homes,\" he said.\nEnergy users can save hundreds by switching to a lower-priced fixed deal.\nAll suppliers have fixed-rate deals, so the simplest way to save is to contact your existing supplier and ask to be moved to its lowest-priced fixed deal.\nBut you could probably save more by switching to a rival, Ofgem says.\nIt's simple to switch using an energy comparison site - all you'll need is your postcode, the name of your current supplier, and the name of your current tariff.\nCitizens Advice has a useful guide to choosing the right tariff. Ofgem also sets out the steps you should take to switch energy supplier and shop for a better deal. "

      "text": "The return of a small fish in large numbers could signal an improvement in the ecosystem of the Clyde.\nThe tiny fish live in open water and are a food source of other marine species.\nResearchers at the University of Aberdeen have discovered massive schools of sprat in the Clyde sea, some more than 2km (1.2 miles) long and over 30m (100ft) deep.\nThe study found numbers had increased 100-fold since the late 1980s. \nThe Clyde was once a thriving marine ecosystem with large fisheries for herring and other species such as cod and haddock.\nHowever, these fisheries disappeared, largely due to overexploitation in the latter part of the 20th Century, although a sustainable prawn fishery now operates. \nHerring fishing, in particular, disappeared in the late 1990s.   \nThis new Aberdeen-led study, published in the journal Current Biology, has shown that although herring are still present, the sprat population, a related species, is 100 times more numerous.\nThe last time herring and sprat were measured in the 1980s, the combined biomass - or weight - was a quarter of what it is now.\nThe authors worked with Marine Scotland Science on the vessel Alba na Mara, using scientific sonar equipment to detect the schools of fish.\nThey then used advanced sonar processing techniques to estimate the numbers of each species over three years from 2014 to 2016. \nThe total weight of sprat in 2016 was estimated at over 70,000 tonnes, equivalent to a population size of 23 billion individuals.  \nDr Joshua Lawrence led the study which was funded by the Marine Alliance for Science and Technology Scotland (Masts).\nHe was surprised at the results.\nHe said: \"The Clyde is famous for its herring, but although there has been virtually no fishing pressure on herring in over 20 years, it is the sprat population that has bounced back, not the herring. \n\"We can only speculate as to why this has happened - perhaps it is the warming seas, which may favour the sprat, or their more favourable reproduction strategy, as herring need particular gravel beds to spawn, whereas sprat do not. \n\"We also found a large concentrations of krill in the Clyde - a major food source for the fish and for other larger animals such as minke whales which are known to visit the area. So there are large populations at various levels of the marine food chain, which tells us that the Clyde's marine ecosystem is faring better than previously thought, despite centuries of overexploitation.\"  \nProf Paul Fernandes, fisheries scientist at the University's School of Biological Sciences, said: \"Sprat form a critical part of the marine food chain, and are vital for other larger fish such as cod and whiting, as well as other animals further up the food chain such as seabirds, whales, dolphins, and sharks. \n\"It is fantastic to see these parts of the food chain recover. This should, in time, lead to recovery of the populations of the larger animals that feed on them.\" \nHe said the findings now presented a dilemma to fisheries managers and the local seafaring community.\nHe said a sprat fishery could operate in the river, but a more sustainable and more lucrative opportunity could present itself through whale watching. \nAnecdotal reports suggest more whales and dolphins appearing in the Clyde, and the university detected large numbers of porpoises in the area in a related study.\nProf Fernandes said: \"As these whale populations themselves recover, they may find their way into these rich feeding grounds, much as they once did, and I am sure people would pay to see them, as they do in other parts of the world where marine ecosystems have recovered.  \n\"The key will be to do this responsibly to ensure a long-term future for the Clyde's historic seafaring community.\"   "

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

They then rose more than 2% to 278p in lunchtime trading, higher than the new Fortress offer and a sign that some investors think the bidding war might not be over.\nUnder the UK's takeover rules, CDR has until 9 August to table any new offer.\nMajor Morrisons shareholders include Silchester, which has more than 15%, as well as money managers M&G and JO Hambro.\nAll shareholders in Morrisons are due to vote on the Fortress bid on 16 August.

      "text": "Boris Johnson has declined to apologise amid a backlash over his remarks about coal mine closures under former premier Margaret Thatcher.\nThe PM has faced demands to say sorry after claiming the shutdowns in the 1980s gave the UK a \"big early start\" in fighting climate change.\nOpposition MPs have called the comments offensive to former mining communities.\nThe PM's spokesman said he recognises the \"huge impact and pain\" of closures, but did not offer an apology. \nVisiting a Scottish wind farm on Thursday, Mr Johnson told reporters: \"Thanks to Margaret Thatcher, who closed so many coal mines across the country, we had a big early start and we're now moving rapidly away from coal altogether.\"\nHe is reported to have laughed and added: \"I thought that would get you going.\"\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Johnson's remarks were \"crass and deeply insensitive\" to mining communities.\nShe tweeted: \"Lives and communities in Scotland were utterly devastated by Thatcher's destruction of the coal industry (which had zero to do with any concern she had for the planet).\"\nLabour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy had called for an apology on Thursday, calling the PM's comments \"shameful\".\nAsked on Friday if the PM would be apologising, his official spokesman said: \"The prime minister recognises the huge impact and pain closing coal mines had in communities across the UK.\n\"This government has an ambitious plan to tackle the critical issue of climate change, which includes reducing reliance on coal and other non-renewable energy sources.\"\nShortly afterwards, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer issued a statement repeating the party's demands for an apology, adding the remarks had shown Mr Johnson's \"true colours\".\n\"For Boris Johnson to laugh when talking about the closure of the coal mines is a slap in the face for communities still suffering from the devastating effects of Margaret Thatcher's callous actions,\" he added. \nIn 1984, there were 170 working collieries in Britain, employing more than 190,000 people - but by 2015, they had all closed. \nMrs Thatcher's announcement that she planned to close 20 of them, led to the year-long miners' dispute.\nMillions of people protested against pit closures and throughout the summer of 1984 there were violent clashes between striking miners and police, whose numbers often ran into several hundred at each confrontation.\nViolence led to widespread use of the breach of the peace charge.\nIn October, it was announced that miners convicted during the strike would be pardoned by the Scottish government following an independent review.\nGrahame Morris, Labour MP for the former County Durham mining community of Easington, said: \"Pushing Thatcher as some sort of eco-warrior for closing coal mines is a rewriting of history.\"\n\"Closing coal mines had nothing to do with saving the environment,\" he added. \n\"It was an assault on a way of life, on trade unions and on communities that did not fit with Thatcher's free market brand of conservatism.\"\nTory MP Brendan Clarke-Smith, who represents the former coal mining area of Bassetlaw, said the PM's remark had \"clearly been made in jest\" and was \"said in the context of the move away from fossil fuels\".\n\"That said, I wouldn't have made the joke myself, and I think we all know that when an industry closes down in a community it can have a hugely detrimental effect on the local economy,\" he said.\nHe added he found it \"remarkable\" that \"the same people\" criticising the PM were also \"expecting everybody to cut out fossil fuels immediately and drive electric cars\", adding: \"They can't have it both ways.\"\nLabour is opposed to the opening of new coal mines, saying they are not compatible with the UK wanting to be a world leader in reducing carbon emissions. \nBut Labour's Alex Davies-Jones, who represents a former coalmining seat in south Wales, said closures had wrought long-lasting economic damage on such areas and Mr Johnson's remarks were \"appalling\".\nThe MP, whose father and grandfather were miners, added: \"He's clearly forgotten the devastation that these job losses caused for communities like mine\"."

      "text": "A-level results next week in England, Wales and Northern Ireland could see high levels of top grades, according to an annual analysis of exam trends.\nProf Alan Smithers, at the University of Buckingham, is predicting a \"bumper crop\" of A* and A grades, in results for exams cancelled by the pandemic.\nBut he warns against allowing \"grade inflation\" to become the norm.\nThe University of East Anglia (UEA) is also reporting early signs that it could be a \"record year for grades\".\nThere have been suggestions that if more pupils receive high grades - which are being submitted by teachers for a second year in a row - there will be a crush for places at the most sought-after universities and courses.\nThere is also pressure from record numbers applying, with more than 680,000 seeking university places.\nProf Smithers said some universities could consider introducing their own exams to help them choose between students.\nThere have already been reports of oversubscribed medicine courses trying to get applicants to defer for a year - such as at the University of Exeter, where students were offered \u00a310,000 to delay.\nBut Richard Harvey, director of admissions at UEA, reassured students that even if grades are higher than last year's record high levels, there is capacity in the university system.\n\"Of course that will cause pressure in certain subjects, mostly medical ones, and in certain universities. At UEA, medicine and related subjects look a bit pressured, but in other subjects I do hope we can continue to welcome people, so I'd encourage people to get in touch,\" he said.\nUniversities get an advance sight of whether applicants have achieved their required grades, and will be going through their admission decisions ahead of the official release of results next week.\nThere is expected to be particular pressure on places for medical and dentistry courses - with a 20% increase in applications and more students expected to get the required grades this year.\nThe Department for Education says it will create more places and flexibility - allowing \"over 9,000 places\" - but with no fixed numbers for an increase. Last year, there was an intake of almost 9,300 for these medicine and dentistry courses.\nNick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was much harder to create more places for medicine because of the high cost of training doctors, the length of the course and the need for hospital placements. \nMr Hillman said he was \"a little bit uncomfortable\" with the suggestion that students could be asked if they wanted to shift to other medical schools with more capacity.\n\"If you've had your sights set on one particular medical school from the moment you applied or even the moment you started your A-levels, it's quite a big mental jump to decide you're going to go somewhere else,\" he said. \nThis will be the second year in which results will be decided without pupils taking the usual set of exam papers.\nSchools submitted grades for pupils, based on a range of evidence, including mini-exams, mock exams and coursework, and next week will see the final results issued by exam boards.\nLast year saw huge controversy after an initial downgrading of many pupils' grades - which was then reversed in a U-turn which saw the highest-ever proportion of A* and A grades.\nAlmost two in five A-levels, 38.5%, were awarded an A* or A last year after the U-turn, up from 25.5% for pupils in 2019.\nProf Smithers, in his annual pre-results report, suggests results are once again going to be very high, or even higher, to compensate for the disruption facing pupils.\n\"While logically there is no reason why A-level standards should not be restored to what they were in 2019, my fear is that the various pressures will cause the government to allow what they became in 2020 to stand,\" he said.\nHe warned that issuing so many top grades makes it hard for universities to distinguish between students.\n\"Leading universities could be forced to set their own tests to help them distinguish between the many prospective students awarded straight As,\" said Prof Smithers.\nBut Prof Graham Galbraith, vice chancellor of the University of Portsmouth, rejected the focus on grade inflation.\n\"These young people have had a very difficult time since March 2020. How their grades compare with other years is of secondary importance. We should prioritise this year's students and treat this year as the extreme exception it obviously is,\" he said.\nTom Middlehurst, of the ASCL head teachers' union, said speculation about grades was \"unhelpful\" and said that if grades were higher this year \"it would be a reflection of the system devised by the government and [regulator] Ofqual\" rather than a decision by teachers.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson, promising extra places for medical courses, said: \"Students have worked incredibly hard over the past 18 months and we have continued to put their best interests first to ensure they can progress on to the next stage of their education training or career.\" \nAre you waiting for your A-level results and hoping to get into medical school?

      "text": "A Chinese state media interview with an Olympic gold medallist asking when she would get married and have children has sparked backlash online. \nThe CCTV segment with Gong Lijiao, who won the women's shot put final on Sunday, also described her as a \"manly woman\".\nNetizens have criticised the interview calling it sexist and narrow-minded.\nThey discussed it online with the hashtag: \"Is marriage the only thing that can be talked about women?\"\nThe questions have led many to object to what they see as ingrained expectations of Chinese women as well as outdated ideals of beauty and femininity.\nThe clip, filmed on the sidelines of the Tokyo Olympics, begins with a female CCTV journalist telling the camera that Gong \"gave me the impression that she is a manly woman, until one breakthrough moment\". \nIt then cuts to the interview:\nGong: I may look like a manly woman on the outside, but inside I'm still more of a girl.\nCCTV reporter: Do you have any plans for a woman's life?\nGong: (surprised) Woman's life?\nAnother female reporter: Since you used to be a manly woman for shot put, do you feel you can be yourself from now on?\nGong: Um... maybe I'll look at my plans. If I don't train then perhaps I will lose weight, get married and have children. Yes, it's the path one must take in life.\nThe CCTV journalist goes on to describe Gong as \"giving a bashful smile\" while asked about her personal life.\nGong is then asked whether she has a boyfriend, what kind of man she is looking for, and whether she would arm-wrestle a boyfriend. \nThe interview ends with Gong laughing and saying: \"I don't arm-wrestle. I'm very gentle.\"\nThousands on social media have criticised the questions posed to Gong, with the marriage hashtag on microblogging platform Weibo getting more than 300 million views.\n\"Won an Olympic gold medal, still can't shut up this group of nosy women,\" complained one commenter on review site Douban. Others said the questions were discriminatory and body-shamed Gong.\nOn Weibo, a cartoon mocking the interview questions has begun trending. Part of it shows a female gymnast being asked \"how do you balance work and family\" while a female boxer is asked \"can your boyfriend beat you [in a match]?\".\nMany have rallied behind Gong, leaving hundreds of supportive messages on her Weibo page.\n\"It's not that she can't get married, it's that no man is her match... when we talk about women, it's not just about marriage or looks, but also dreams and achievements,\" read one popular post on Weibo.\nGong herself responded to the post, saying: \"This totally expresses what I feel! Thank you!\" \nA heightened awareness of women's rights, fuelled by the #MeToo movement of 2018, has led to strong pushback online against traditional expectations of women.\nChinese beauty standards, which particularly prize women who are slim and fair, have also come under scrutiny in recent years as the country sees a boom in cosmetic surgery.\nIn 2016, the BBC visited a private cosmetic surgery clinic in Beijing."

And the sad thing is, they'll realise that only when he's dead and they've carried out a post-mortem on him, and then it's too late.\"\nDefra has defended its methods after it was revealed the tests have never been trialled for their accuracy in detecting bovine tuberculosis in alpacas, and that Geronimo had tested negative on four occasions in New Zealand.\nChief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said she was aware of the devastation that TB caused, but they needed to follow the scientific advice by culling animals that test positive to minimise the spread of \"the biggest threat to animal health in this country\".\n\"The tests used on Geronimo were developed for use on alpacas and are highly specific - the chances of a false positive are significantly less than one per cent and we have tested him twice. \n\"Not just for the benefit of our farming industry but to avoid more TB cases in humans, our disease control measures must be applied,\" she added. \nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "A long-distance couple who have been separated by pandemic travel rules for 18 months have been granted an exemption to get married in England.\nSince March last year, Australia has banned its citizens from leaving the country as part of its Covid strategy. \nBut Australian Chris Quealy, 72, now has dispensation to leave the country, after he proposed to Penny Steven, 69, over Zoom this year.\n\"I am on cloud nine,\" says Penny, from Amersham. \"It is a dream come true.\" \nAustralia's tough border rules have been controversial - but the government says its measures aim to reduce the risk of Covid entering the country, as it grapples with its worst outbreaks in a year.\nIn May 2015 mum-of-four Penny met Chris, who is from the Gold Coast, during a solo adventure to walk the Camino de Santiago in Spain, and the pair fell in love.\nOver the next five years, the couple regularly travelled the 10,000 or so miles between their home countries to spend time together.\nPenny returned from her last visit to Australia on 3 February 2020 and Chris was supposed to follow soon after - but lockdowns came in March, separating the couple. \nIt's been a \"very tough\" 18 months for couple, says Penny, adding that they have twice-daily phone conversations to keep in touch. \"It has made us stronger,\" she says.\nTheir story captured the hearts of listeners of BBC Radio 2's Zoe Ball Breakfast Show earlier this year, when the couple explained that failed visa attempts meant there appeared to be no end of their separation in sight.\nStrictly Come Dancing star Anton du Beke even came on air to speak to Penny, who is a huge fan of the BBC One show.\n\"At some stage down the line you're going to need a first dance. I'd be honoured if I could be the choreographer of your first dance at some stage in the future.\"\nBut the marriage looked out of reach until Thursday, when Penny says an email from the Australian government finally confirmed that Chris could leave the country.\n\"I couldn't quite believe it when he let me know. I was in a daze yesterday,\" she says. \nNow the couple have to book a wedding and apply for a UK marriage visa before grandfather-of-two Chris can book his flight to England, but they can begin to look forward to their reunion at the airport.\n\"I imagine it all the time. It is going to be wonderful,\" says Penny, who is hoping for a November wedding.\n\"Whenever we meet up at airports I always imagine running in to each other's arms, but actually one of us is always tired, so it doesn't happen.\"\nIt will be a long time coming for a couple who found love on their travels - during which Penny met the \"Mr Perfect\" man she had prayed for.\n\"I got a message from my vicar saying we have been praying for you to meet a Bruce Willis look-a-like,\" Penny says. \"I said 'can you make it Bryan Ferry?'\n\"I said 'OK God can you find me somebody?' I went though this great shopping list.\n\"Ten minutes later I met Chris and he ticked every box.\""

      "text": "Thousands of tourists and residents have been evacuated from towns north of the Greek capital, Athens, as wildfires spread across the country.\nStrong winds and high temperatures are making it difficult to control the blazes, which have killed at least two people, including a firefighter.\nHuge clouds of smoke and ash near Athens has meant some people there have also been urged to leave their homes.\nMore than 150 fires have been reported. Six areas have been put on high alert.\nGreece, like many parts of Europe, has been grappling with extreme weather this summer. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the fires showed \"the reality of climate change\". \nHundreds of firefighters are trying to control the fires with about 20 water-bombing aircraft. Extra firefighters and planes are being sent in from countries including the UK, France and the US.\nThe UK government said Home Secretary Priti Patel was sending \"experienced firefighters\"  after witnessing the \"devastating effect\" of the fires while in Greece earlier this week.\nFanned by unpredictable winds, the worst blazes are around the north of Athens. A 38-year-old volunteer firefighter was killed by a falling electricity pole in a suburb of the city.\nThe other victim was the president of the Athens Chamber of Commerce, Konstantinos Michalos. He was found unconscious in a factory close to where a fire was raging. \nA further 20 people have been injured. \nThe fires are expected to continue to burn and spread on Saturday, despite a drop in temperatures to around 35C (95F) from above 40C earlier this week. \nThousands of people were earlier ordered to leave their homes outside Athens as the blaze tore through houses, cars and businesses.\nFires have also been raging on the nearby island of Evia, and areas close to ancient Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympic Games.\nGovernment minister Nikos Hardalias said firefighters were facing extremely dangerous conditions.\n\"Wildfires of unprecedented intensity and spread, all our forces are fighting the battle day and night to save lives, together with volunteers,\" he said.\nHundreds of residents and tourists on Evia have been evacuated using ferries and fishing boats, as wildfires closed in on its shores.\n\"We're talking about the apocalypse, I don't know how to describe it,\" Sotiris Danikas, a coastguard official on the island, told broadcaster ERT.\nBy Bethany Bell BBC News, Athens\nThe air in northern Athens is full of the smell of smoke, and there is a thin layer of ash on the ground. People from some of the outer suburbs have been evacuated from their homes. \nLast night, one man stared in horror as the flames headed down the mountainside towards his house. \nPlanes and helicopters carrying water to drop on the flames flew overhead, but emergency crews are struggling to stop the wildfires from spreading. \nThe strong, hot winds are not helping. Greece, like much of the rest of Europe, has been grappling with extreme weather this summer.\nIn neighbouring Turkey, authorities are battling the country's worst-ever wildfires.\nEight people have been killed and tens of thousands evacuated along the southern coast. Six more neighbourhoods near a power station were evacuated on Friday. \nClimate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires. \nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions."

Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

      "text": "Aaliyah's biggest albums are to be made available on streaming services, after being out of circulation for most of the last two decades.\nThe late R&B star's final two records, One in a Million and Aaliyah, have been in limbo for years - a result of legal issues and uneasiness in her family. \nNow, as the 20th anniversary of her death approaches, a deal has been struck to reissue the records.\nThe rollout begins on 20 August with the release of One in a Million.\nNew titles will be released throughout the rest of the year, including the soundtracks to the film Romeo Must Die, in which Aaliyah co-starred, as well as the compilations Ultimate Aaliyah and I Care 4 U. \nThe long out-of-print CD and vinyl versions, which currently fetch hundreds of dollars on the second-hand market, will also be reissued. \nThe news was announced by Aaliyah's uncle and former manager Barry Hankerson, whose Blackground Records owned the rights to the star's back catalogue - with the exception of her debut album, Age Ain't Nothing But A Number, which is currently her only album available on streaming services.\nHankerson said he had entered a new partnership with music distribution company Empire, \"to introduce Aaliyah and Blackground's legacy to a new audience\".\nIt will also enable the label to release albums by Timbaland, Toni Braxton and JoJo which have also been absent from streaming services.\nBut JoJo, who eventually re-recorded her Blackground albums after a decade-long legal battle with the label, told fans she wouldn't make money from the re-releases.\n\"Just so you know - a stream of the re-recorded 2018 version supports me and helps me continue to do what I love,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"Streaming the original unfortunately does not.\"\nAaliyah died in 2001, after a plane she was travelling in crashed and burst into flames shortly after taking off in the Bahamas.\nThe star had been visiting the island to record a music video for her single, Rock The Boat. She was killed along with eight other passengers, including video director Douglas Kratz and record label executive Gina Smith.\nAn investigation by America's National Transportation Safety Board later concluded the plane had been overloaded at the time of take off.\nAlthough she was only 22, the star had already left an indelible imprint on R&B, with sleek, futuristic songs like We Need A Resolution, More Than A Woman and Are You That Somebody? \nHer influence can still be heard in the music of Rihanna, Drake, Alicia Keys and Beyonc\u00e9. \nThe star's uncle said the family's grief had been partly responsible for keeping her music out of circulation, after Blackground's distribution deals with Universal Music petered out in the early 2000s.\nAaliyah's mother, in particular, was against the idea of re-releasing the music.\n\"There was a conversation we had that she didn't want the music out, and whatever my sister told me, I tried to do what she wanted me to do,\" he told Billboard magazine. \n\"As a parent, I would understand if she did not want the music out. Because who wants to hear the voice of your daughter who's gone? So when she said that to me, I said, 'OK, we're not putting it out. I don't know when, but one day we will.' We literally packed everything up and went on to something else.\"\nThe turning point came last August, on the 19th anniversary of Aaliyah's death, when the star's estate released a statement addressed to \"our loyal fans\".\n\"We are excited to announce that communication has commenced between the estate and various record labels about the status of Aaliyah's music catalogue, as well as its availability on streaming platforms in the near future,\" it read. \"Thank you for your continued love and support. More updates to come!\"\nHankerson took that as a green light and began negotiating the deal that will result in her music being restored.\nHowever, shortly after an announcement teasing the releases appeared online, the star's estate issued a statement apparently disapproving of the move.\n\"We have always been confused as to why there is such a tenacity in causing more pain alongside what we already have to cope with for the rest of our lives,\" it read. \n\"This unscrupulous endeavour to release Aaliyah's music without any transparency or full accounting to the estate compels our hearts to express a word - forgiveness.\n\"Ultimately, we desire closure and a modicum of peace so we can facilitate the growth of the Aaliyah Memorial Fund and other creative projects that embody Aaliyah's true essence, which is to inspire strength and positivity for people of all creeds, races and cultures around the world.\"\nFor now, however, the release plans appear to be going ahead. \nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Go to them in your head,\" he says repeatedly. \nJurors also heard from an imam during the trial that the Ruqya was considered a valid practice but would never involve drugs or sedation.\nMetwally was arrested after Ms Wilson fell into a coma on 4 July 2019. She was on the brink of a cardiac arrest and was taken to hospital that afternoon.\nDuring investigations police found a \"vast stock of drugs\" at his home, including ketamine, propofol, fentanyl and Diazemuls.\nFollowing Metwally's conviction on Thursday, Judge Jeremy Richardson QC said he had \"never been involved in a more bizarre case\".\nAfter lifting reporting restrictions on Friday, Judge Richardson told Metwally, who worked at Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust (NLGNFT): \"It is a shocking circumstance that a doctor, a medical professional, should find himself in the dock awaiting sentence on such a serious criminal charge.\"\nMetwally, who qualified in his native Egypt, also worked in Saudi Arabia before practising in the UK. He moved to Grimsby in 1999, three years after arriving in the country, the court heard.\nThe pair met when Ms Wilson, now 33, was training to be a nurse in 2015. She worked at Metwally's private pain clinic and later moved in with him at his home in Laceby Road.\nJurors heard the former nurse was lonely, had a history of depression and suffered a catalogue of illnesses which resulted her in quitting her job. \nProsecutor John Elvidge QC said the medic was secretly giving various drugs to Ms Wilson including fentanyl and ketamine, and had \"knowingly fed her addiction\" for drugs.\nMetwally was found guilty of endangering Ms Wilson's life by administering anaesthetic drugs to sedate Ms Wilson; the supply of various controlled drugs or medicines and the possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply.\nHe was also found guilty of one count of fraud.\nIt took the jury less than 90 minutes to reach unanimous verdicts on the charges.\nReporting restrictions were lifted after he also admitted two unrelated voyeurism offences.\nJudge Richardson told Metwally a prison term \"of some substance\" would be inevitable at his sentencing hearing on 20 September.\nDr Kate Wood, medical director at NLGNFT, said Metwally was \"immediately excluded\" from working at the trust when the allegations came to light and reported to the General Medical Council.\nChris Hartley from the Crown Prosecution Service said Metwally was a \"dangerous\" man who had \"cruelly and deliberately\" exploited Ms Wilson.\n\"By administering powerful anaesthetic and sedative drugs outside the safety of a hospital setting he was not only deliberately injuring Ms Wilson; he was endangering her life,\" he said.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

      "tags": "Belarus",
      "text": "Two Belarusian coaches have lost their Olympic accreditations after allegedly attempting to force an athlete to leave the Games in Tokyo.\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed that Artur Shimak and Yury Maisevich had left the Olympic Village. An investigation is under way.\nThe case of Krystina Timanovskaya caught global attention after she refused her team's orders to fly home.\nShe is now in Poland, where she has been granted a humanitarian visa.\nThe case has again put the spotlight on Belarus, which has been ruled by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko since 1994. Last year, nationwide protests over his disputed re-election were violently repressed by the security forces.\nBelarus says Ms Timanovskaya was removed from the national team because of her emotional state. But the 24-year-old says this is not true, saying she was removed because she spoke on Instagram about the \"negligence of [her] coaches\".\nIn a statement, the IOC said it had removed the accreditations of the two coaches \"as a provisional measure... in the interest of the wellbeing of the athletes of the National Olympic Committee of Belarus who are still in Tokyo\".\nThe body said a disciplinary commission had been established to investigate the incident and that both coaches would be \"offered an opportunity to be heard\".\nThe Belarusian Olympic committee released its own statement on Friday, reported by state news agency Belta. It said it was working with the IOC to \"clarify\" the reasons behind their decision, and vowed to protect its team from \"any forms of discrimination\".\nThe body confirmed the coaches would return to Belarus soon, but said they \"reserve the right to appeal this decision\".\nIOC President Thomas Bach said at a press conference on Friday the committee was \"happy\" Ms Timanovskaya was safely in Poland, and called what happened to her \"deplorable\", Reuters news agency reported.\nJapan's foreign ministry said it was \"unjust\" and \"not acceptable\" that Belarusian authorities had pressured the sprinter to fly home, Reuters reported. \nMs Timanovskaya's removal came after the sprinter complained on social media about being entered into the 4x400m relay race at short notice, after some team-mates were found to be ineligible to compete.\nThe video led to criticism in state media, with one television channel saying she lacked team spirit.\nMs Timanovskaya said two coaches came into her room and told her to pack her bags immediately, ready to return home. She was told to say that she had been injured.\nIn an interview with the BBC, she said she was on her way to the airport last week when her grandmother warned her it was not safe to return, after watching local news reports on the situation.\nAt the airport, Ms Timanovskaya showed officers a translated plea for help on her phone in an effort to avoid being put on a plane home.\nShe was then given police protection before being moved to the Polish embassy in Tokyo. She travelled to Poland on Wednesday.\nThe mass protests that gripped Belarus last year saw security forces often use violence to break up the demonstrations and thousands of people arrested.\nSome of the protesters were national-level athletes, who were then stripped of funding, cut from national teams and detained.\nBut Ms Timanovskaya insists that she is \"not a political girl\" and just wants to focus on her sporting career.\n\"I don't know anything about politics. I never was in politics,\" she said.\nThe sprinter told the BBC she wanted to return to Belarus, but that it was too dangerous at the moment.\nHer husband has also fled Belarus and has been given a visa for Poland, but her relatives remain in the country."

      "tags": "Israel,Iran,Drones,US Armed Forces",
      "text": "The US military's Central Command has announced the results of its forensic investigation into last week's fatal drone attack on a merchant tanker off Oman. \nIt says explosives experts concluded that the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was produced in Iran. \nThe evidence has been shared with explosives experts in Britain and Israel who concurred with the findings.\nThe attack on the MT Mercer Street killed two people.\nThe vessel is managed by the London-based Zodiac Maritime, a company owned by Israeli shipping magnate Eyal Ofer.\nA British security guard, Adrian Underwood, and the ship's Romanian captain lost their lives as the ship sailed past the Omani island of Masirah. \nBritain, the US, Israel and Romania, were quick to blame Iran which has denied any involvement. It said if there was any proof then it should be made public. \nNow a statement from Centcom has shed some light on what it says its investigation has revealed. \nThroughout the past week an explosive investigations team from the US Navy's aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan has been examining the evidence left behind by the drone attack. \nAfter interviewing the survivors and studying the explosive residue they have concluded that the ship was targeted by three drones in all. \nThe first two, launched at the ship on the evening of Thursday 29 July, missed their target. But the third drone, launched early on Friday 30 July and loaded with a military grade explosive, hit the pilot house and exploded, killing the two men and leaving a 2-metre diameter hole. \nInvestigators say explosive chemical tests had identified the residue as RDX, a nitrate-based explosive, indicating that the UAV was rigged to cause injury and destruction.\nThe investigators also recovered part of the drone's wing and after further testing they concluded that the drone was produced in Iran. A joint statement issued by all the G7 nations on Friday condemned Iran's actions and said its actions threatened peace and stability.  \nIran and Israel have been engaged in an undeclared and so-called \"shadow war\" for some time now. \nIsrael is widely assumed to be behind a series of sabotage acts on Iran's nuclear programme, including the assassination of key scientists. It has also attacked Iranian ships suspected of carrying oil to Syria that is destined for Iran's militia ally in Lebanon, Hezbullah. \nIran has been targeting Israeli-linked shipping with limpet mines, something which the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps train intensively for. But last week's deadly drone attack marked a major escalation, killing some of those onboard and dragging in a major western power.\nDays later there was a second attack on shipping with armed men briefly seizing control of another merchant tanker, the MV Asphalt Princess, before leaving it to go on its way. \nThe incidents come at a time of heightened tension in the region as the new, hardline President Ebrahim Raisi takes power in Iran and talks aimed at reviving the moribund deal to curb Iran's suspect nuclear programme falter in Vienna."

It is also a great relief.

      "text": "After the withdrawal of US troops, battles between the Taliban and government forces are raging across Afghanistan. But how are the families of British soldiers who died in Afghanistan coping now? The BBC spoke to one soldier's mother.\n\"Hello family. Please don't cry Mum. I'm not here now, I'm in a better place.\"\nThose were the words of Corporal Jake Hartley to his mum Nathalie in his last letter - the message written by soldiers to be opened in the event of their death. \nJake was 20 when he died in Afghanistan in 2012, and his mother has struggled to cope ever since. \"It makes me angry,\" says Nathalie. \"Jake gave his life for Queen and country.\"\nJake grew up with his mum and younger brother Ethan, whom he adored, in a village called New Mill near Holmfirth in West Yorkshire. Jake and his mother were inseparable.\n\"He could just walk in a room and if you were feeling sad or down he would just make you laugh,\" says Nathalie. \"He was just a lovely character. And he joked all the time, he could make anybody laugh, he was such a lovable person.\"\nNathalie had no idea that Jake wanted to be a soldier. When he was younger, he planned on becoming a plumber.\nBut a visit to an air show changed his life, and his heart was set on a career in the military - specifically, the Yorkshire Regiment. After joining the Army, he thrived, and quickly rose to become a corporal. \nJake first toured Helmand in 2009, before returning to Afghanistan in 2012. His family were incredibly proud, and he loved life in the regiment. \nBut in March that year, there was a knock at the door of the family home in New Mill that changed everything. \n\"When they knocked on the door, I was just in shock,\" says Nathalie. \n\"I just slammed the door when I saw them in uniform. I knew it, I had a really bad feeling that there was something wrong. I collapsed, and I can still hear my cry, a scream like a cry.\"\nCpl Jake Hartley was one of six servicemen killed when an improvised explosive device exploded under their Warrior armoured vehicle. At the time it was the biggest single loss of life in combat suffered by the British in the war. \n(In 2006, 14 British servicemen were killed when a Nimrod plane exploded in Afghanistan shortly after air-to-air refuelling - the cause was a fuel leak).\nNathalie says: \"They were in the Warrior and the six of them were going to do a patrol,\" says Nathalie. \"They got lost and they went off track. They didn't know that IEDs were planted there.\"\nNathalie is 49 now, and her home is full of pictures of Jake - images from his Army career and youth. It's a shrine to his memory; a life cut short just before his 21st birthday.  \n\"I light a candle and I touch his picture,\" she says. \"I say good morning, good night Jake. I can hear laughter in the house. I'll talk to him, it's like he is here.\n\"I still charge his old phone and keep his wallet on the microwave, that's where he plonked them, with money and items like cinema and Blockbusters tickets.\n\"I've got his best clothes, I polish his boots, his buckle and I still have his shoes in the shoe rack. It's just little comforts, but it might seem crazy to some people.\"\nFor Nathalie, this is her way of coping with grief and pain that has lasted nearly a decade. Since losing Jake, life has been a struggle.  \n\"I've had issues with alcohol. And it's been my worst nightmare, my worst enemy. But I've learned how to deal with that, to live with the pain.\n\"Some days are harder than other days and there are triggers - things can happen within my day that can take me back to that moment.\" \nSome days, Nathalie has been consumed with guilt and has wanted to end her own life. She still sees Jake's friends - some are 30 years old, married with children. \n\"I have depression - there's been times in my life that I've hit rock bottom,\" she says.\n\"Losing Jake has caused so much pain. I've not wanted to be here... it's like I just wanted to go to him and I wanted the pain and everything to just go away, I just didn't want to feel.\"\nAfter two decades of intervention and conflict, it has taken just weeks for the Taliban to seize control of large areas of Afghanistan after US forces left. It's been hard for Nathalie to watch.\n\"I don't think we should go back or have any involvement whatsoever; we've done what we can and it's cost too many lives. It makes me angry, Jake gave his life for Queen and country and for us to be safe.\"\nThe Ministry of Defence says 457 British military personnel lost their lives during the conflict in Afghanistan. \nJake was a highly commended soldier, and Nathalie believes he would have gone on to achieve his ambition of being selected for the SAS. She also says he would have loved to have settled down and start a family.\n\"Jake paid the ultimate sacrifice, but so do the families - we have definitely been forgotten about,\" she says,\n\"It's just a waste, it does feel like a waste but I think that there is no comeback. There is nothing we can do.\""

It launched the visa after China imposed the security law.\nThe British government estimates 5.4 million Hong Kong residents are eligible for the scheme, and expects 300,000 people to take up the offer in the first five years.\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab welcomed Mr Biden's announcement as a \"big-hearted decision\"."

The Taliban said he had been \"punished for his deeds\". \nTaliban militants continue to make rapid advances in Afghanistan, taking swathes of countryside and targeting key cities, following the decisions by US and Nato forces to leave the country.\nLocal officials said insurgents had captured the city of Zaranj, in Nimroz province, on Friday afternoon, in a significant blow to government forces.\nAlso on Friday, the UK government advised all UK nationals to leave Afghanistan due to the \"worsening security situation\".\nThe Foreign and Development Office has updated its travel advice to urge Britons to leave by commercial means, and to make the British embassy in Kabul aware of their plans.\nMr Raab's letter follows a plea from a group of newspapers and broadcasters who wrote to the UK government to urge that Afghan journalists, translators and fixers be treated the same as interpreters who worked for the British armed forces. \nSince 2013, some Afghan interpreters who had put their lives at risk by working with the British military have been permitted to relocate to the UK, with their families.\nMr Raab wrote that the \"freedom\" of global media outlets was a \"priority\" for the government.\nHe added: \"The vibrant Afghan media is one of the greatest successes in Afghanistan in the last 19 years, and it should be celebrated and protected. \n\"Your letter highlighted the threat faced by Afghan staff who have worked for your media organisations in Afghanistan, in particular the risk of reprisals they face from the Taliban from their association with the UK.\n\"Under existing schemes, we are able to consider individual cases for relocation on an exceptional basis, where there is evidence they are under imminent threat due to the nature of their engagement with the UK. \n\"Journalists (and those supporting them) can be eligible for our support, depending on the individual circumstances that apply.\"\nEarlier this year plans to relocate hundreds more Afghan interpreters and their family members were announced, with more than 3,000 expected to be allowed to settle.\nOn Thursday a flight of 104 people, made up of interpreters and their family members, arrived at a Midlands airport as part of the UK's ongoing relocation programme.\nOne interpreter, called H, said that while he was happy for his wife and children to be in Britain he was sad to have left his family behind.\nLast month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all British troops assigned to Nato's mission in Afghanistan would be returning home, and most had already left.\nThe US has said it will withdraw all forces by 11 September.\nBut Britain's most senior general, General Nick Carter, warned Afghanistan could slide into civil war once foreign troops leave."

      "text": "Most of Wales' remaining Covid rules will be lifted as the nation enters the \"final lap\" of the pandemic, the first minister has said.\nSocial distancing laws and rules on who can meet indoors will end on Saturday, almost 17 months after the first lockdown.\nHowever, rules will remain tighter than in England, with face masks still required by law in many public places.\nMark Drakeford said they will likely be needed for the rest of the year.\nHe warned the changes did not mean a \"free-for-all\".\nWales will move to alert level zero - the lowest level of restrictions seen so far - from 06:00 BST on Saturday.\nMr Drakeford said as the case rate had steadily declined for the past three weeks and vaccinations had increased, most rules could now be scrapped.\nHe told a press briefing that the easing of restrictions was a \"significant moment for all of us\" and a \"big step closer to life before the pandemic started\". \nIn response to the news, Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives said it was time for a Wales-specific inquiry into the way the pandemic had been handled in Wales.\nThe first minister urged people to be sensible, to continue to practise social distancing, think about who they meet and where, and not behave as if the \"virus has disappeared\".\n\"Most people in Wales want to go on acting carefully to protect their health and the health of others,\" he said.\nMr Drakeford said with such major changes to rules, the impact on case rates needed to be seen and so no further relaxation was expected to be made for \"at least six weeks\". \nMr Drakeford said while he did not expect Wales to have to return to tight restrictions such as lockdown measures, he could not rule anything out if there was a \"sudden change for the worse\".\nHowever, he said: \"Provided we do not see further unexpected turns in the course of the virus, then I think we can have confidence that we are on the final lap of emerging from the pandemic.\"\nUnder the changes from Saturday:\nHowever companies will still be expected to take measures to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted on their premises.\nIt will be the law to wear face masks in indoor public places including shops, buses and trains, and in health and social care settings, but not in venues where food and drink is served, such as pubs.\nMr Drakeford told BBC Wales face coverings were \"likely\" to play a part in helping tackle coronavirus \"for the rest of this year\".\nWhile the changes will see most of Wales' rules lifted, more restrictions remain in place than across the border in England, where they were scrapped on so-called \"freedom day\" on 18 July.\nMost restrictions in Scotland will come to an end on Monday - and with face masks still required in shops, the rules will be similar to here in Wales.\nMeanwhile, in Northern Ireland rules on who you can meet and where remain in place.\nLaws on who you can meet indoors have existed since the start of the lockdown in March 2020.\nCurrent restrictions  - to be scrapped on Saturday - say only six people are able to meet in private homes.\nPeople will continue to have to self-isolate by law for 10 days if they get Covid, while the Welsh government advice will be to continue to work from home where possible.\nHowever, those who are fully vaccinated and are found to be a close contact of a positive Covid case will not need to self-isolate from Saturday.\nThe decision to lift the social distancing duty on businesses means firms will instead be expected to put in place measures to keep people safe and draw up risk assessments.\nThat could see them continuing to require social distancing, face masks, or use other measures such as ventilation or a combination of these, with the first minister saying he did not expect \"large crowds of people\" would be seen at bars as businesses tried to keep punters safe.\nSome pub and bar owners have said while they were pleased to be able to \"throw away the measuring tape\", the onus on businesses to set their own rules was unfair.\nJoanne Cooney, owner of Cooney's Bar in Llandudno, said with rules being different in England, some places had reported issues with tourists refusing to wear masks and stay apart, and having different rules in different businesses could make it worse.\n\"We are having to try and figure out very confusing guidance... people think everything's gone back to normal, but it's not, they've just said 'it's all on you now'\", she told BBC Radio Wales.\nMs Cooney said the guidance setting out what businesses should do from Saturday was \"unclear\", and called for clarity from the Welsh government.\nResponding to the concerns, Mr Drakeford said the guidance was clear, and the measures were to make sure staff and customers were \"properly protected\" and give people confidence they could go out.\nWedding receptions have been subject to restrictions since March 2020 - but from Saturday those will be lifted.\nJordan and Emily Burns, from Buckley in Flintshire, should have been married in April 2020 - two weeks after lockdown began. \nThey have rearranged their ceremony four times since and had a small, legal marriage ceremony four months ago. \nOn Saturday, however, they will have the big wedding they always wanted at Ty'n Dwr Hall in Llangollen.\nMrs Burns said: \"It's been only six to a table in weddings - our tables will have 24 people, which just seems crazy doesn't it? \n\"We're able to have the ceremony indoors so we're not worried with the weather. It just takes so much pressure off us as well and we can just look forward to it, be excited and just enjoy the day.\"\nStacey Alford, a DJ from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said the pandemic \"pulled the plug\" on her career.\nShe said the music community was excited to see Wales moving to alert level zero, but was aware of the need for caution.\n\"The general consensus is 'get us in there, we can't wait' - but obviously we want everyone to just take it slowly, enjoy themselves but not be silly.\"\nThe changes mean there will be fewer Covid rules to police.\nBut Mark Jones, general secretary of the North Wales Police Federation, fears a return to normality for the public will put pressure on officers.\n\"We're seeing the first time in near enough two summers where freedom is there, so a lot of people will be coming to visit north Wales and we're anticipating demands on policing, which means that the thin blue line is going to be stretched even further and further,\" he said.\nExactly 500 days after telling us to stay home, Mark Drakeford has confirmed an end to the rules on who and where we meet.\nHe has deliberately avoided repeating Boris Johnson's assurance that we are on an \"irreversible\" path out.\nBut the success of the vaccination programme means the bar for \"re-imposing severe restrictions will be higher\", the Welsh government says.\nThe next step is to provide booster jabs. Some people will get one with their annual flu jab in the autumn.\nIn a clear signal about the ongoing threat of the pandemic, ministers say they are worried about a \"perfect storm\" of Covid and flu this winter.\nFollowing the announcement, opposition parties called for people to act responsibly, and pressed again for a Wales-only inquiry into the handling of Covid by the Welsh government.\nMore than 7,900 have died since the pandemic began.\nPlaid Cymru said it wanted \"reassurance from government that lessons have been learnt\", and the Tories said those who have suffered should be given justice.\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said that as Wales moved forward people had to \"take responsibility\" to stop cases rising.\n\"We are going to have to learn to live with Covid, because we can't afford to go back into the lockdowns that have blighted our lives in the past 15, 16 months,\" he said.\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman, Rhun ap Iorwerth, welcomed the move forward, but said the ministers must be ready to take a step back if necessary.\n\"Now what we want as these freedoms come back is to see in clear evidence terms that government is honing its early-warning systems even more, is even more vigilant about any curveballs sent in our direction,\" he said.\nHowever, Mr Drakeford, who has already agreed to a UK-wide inquiry, said a Wales specific inquiry would not give a \"proper understanding\" of how the pandemic was handled.\nWales has seen a third wave of coronavirus cases in recent months - but it peaked on 16 July and has been decreasing ever since.\nLatest figures published on Friday showed Wales' case rate had fallen slightly, to 132.4 per 100,000 people over a seven-day period.\nThey also showed 66% of Wales' total population was fully vaccinated, with health boards now inviting 16 and 17-year-olds for their jabs.\nMr Drakeford said health boards were ready to start offering booster jabs from September, but the government were waiting for advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation."

      "text": "All teenagers aged 16 and 17 in Wales will be offered Covid-19 vaccinations, the Welsh government has confirmed.\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said work was under way to expand the vaccination programme.\nIt follows new advice to offer 16 and 17-year-olds a first dose of the jab from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nThere are 67,142 teenagers in the age bracket in Wales - some have already been eligible for the jab.\nMs Morgan said: \"In line with the other nations of the UK, the Welsh government welcomes the latest JCVI advice and thanks them for their expertise and considered judgement on such important issues.  \n\"We are now working with the NHS on the arrangements needed to offer the vaccination to all 16 and 17-year-olds in line with the JCVI advice.\"\nThe JCVI said advice on when to offer the second dose will come later.\nIt is not clear when the Welsh NHS will begin to offer the vaccinations. A spokesperson said the details are being finalised and arrangements will be confirmed \"very shortly\".\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said he hoped ministers would \"act quickly to roll out those vaccines\", and said schools need to be made as \"safe as possible\" ahead of their reopening in September.\nThe Welsh Conservatives said the roll out was \"great news and only made possible through the British government's procurement of plenty of vaccines\".\nThe only vaccine approved for use in the UK for under-18s is the Pfizer-BioNTech jab.\nUntil now children aged 12 or older have been offered jabs if they have health conditions that make them vulnerable to coronavirus, they live with others who are at high risk or are near to having their 18th birthday.\nIn Wales 9,618 16-17 year olds have already had a first dose.\nOther countries, such as the US and France, have already been vaccinating children over the age of 12.\nLaura Doel, director of NAHT Cymru, said the headteaching union would \"continue to urge ministers to ensure that alternative safety measures are put in place\" in schools \"such as better ventilation and a properly functioning test and trace system that takes into account how schools function\".\nThe JCVI has effectively set much of the UK's vaccine policy throughout the pandemic, although it is up to the Welsh government and other UK nations to decide if they follow the advice.\nSupplies have been purchased by the UK government, and distributed by the different NHS bodies in the four nations.\nThe committee said it expected one dose of the vaccine to give good protection against severe illness and hospitalisation in the 16 and 17 age group.\nRecent figures show that 75% of 18 to 29-year-olds have had their first jab in Wales.\nThe Covid case rate fell on Wednesday to 136.3 new infections per 100,000 people. \nMost lockdown rules are set to be eased this weekend, with social distancing laws set to be scrapped, and legal limits on who you can meet set to end."

and yes there are still people in hospital who had both jabs. \nBut the way vaccines are rapidly transforming the pandemic - at least in wealthier countries - is incredible.\nOn Friday 31,808 new cases of Covid were reported across the UK along with a further 92 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nProf Sir Ian Diamond, the UK's national statistician, told the BBC the UK was seeing evidence of a decline in Covid infections across the country.\nHe said rates were still relatively high in many areas, but he expected to see a \"continued decline\" over the next four or five weeks.\nHe warned that he did not think \"we're in a position to say we have reached the end of Covid\" and said people should not stop showing a degree of caution.\nThe R number - which represents the average number of people one infected person will pass the virus on to - has also fallen in England to between 0.8 and 1.1, according to the latest government figures. \nLast week it was estimated as between 1.1 and 1.4. \nWhen the R number is above one, the number of cases keeps increasing.

      "text": "The Scottish government has announced a further easing of the Covid rules.\nGuidance urging people to work from home wherever possible is to be relaxed in favour of a \"hybrid\" system of office and remote working from Monday 31 January.\nRestrictions on large outdoor events came to an end on 17 January, then rules on indoor events and venues, including the need for table service in hospitality premises, were lifted on 24 January.\nNew guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday 31 January.\nThis will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.\nBusinesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.\nThe requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings - like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties - will be reduced from 2m to 1m from 31 January.\nAnd face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.\nFrom Friday 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to take a test after they arrive in Scotland.\nThose who are not fully vaccinated will still have to take a pre-departure test no more than two days before they travel, then take a PCR test on or before day two after their arrival.\nA raft of new measures introduced in December in response to the spread of the Omicron variant have already been removed.\nThese included limits on the number of people who could attend large public events; restrictions in pubs, restaurants and other indoor public places; and the closure of nightclubs.\nAdults and children aged 12 and over still have to wear face coverings in all the same indoor settings as before, such as shops, hospitality venues and public transport.\nBusinesses are legally required to take steps to reduce the spread of Covid, including physical distancing and screens.\nIn hospitality, face coverings can be removed while dancing, drinking and dining. Indoor venues are required to reduce crowding and collect the contact details of customers to help with Test and Protect.\nRetail and other sectors also have to ensure social distancing and manage customer flow.\nThe two-metre distancing rule remains in healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists.\nA vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year for entry to:\nUnder the scheme, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or a negative lateral flow test.\nIf it is more than four months since your second jab you will need to show proof of a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. The app has been updated to include boosters.\nProof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later. \nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 and four months old and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\nHowever, people returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. \nInstead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online so that Test and Protect can start the contact tracing process.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said no changes to the guidance for schools were being recommended at this stage - although this was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nPupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the one-metre social distancing rule is still in place.\nMs Sturgeon said young people wanted to see the back of masks as soon as possible, but that many understood they provided \"important protection\". She said the issue \"requires and will receive careful consideration\".\nAll secondary school children are being asked to take a lateral flow test twice a week. \nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\nUniversity and college students are being asked to test twice a week and before socialising with other households.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "tags": "HM Treasury,Live music,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "UK music festivals and other live events are to be protected by a government-backed insurance scheme if they have to cancel because of Covid.\nIt will begin next month with a \u00a3750m budget to cover cancellation costs if events are legally unable to happen due to government Covid restrictions.\nThe live events industry, which has repeatedly called for such a plan, broadly welcomed the announcement.\nMore than half of all music festivals have been cancelled this summer.\nAnd several events, including the Boomtown and Womad festivals, have cited an inability to obtain cancellation insurance as a factor in their decision. \nThe new scheme will see insurance companies provide cover for live events, with the government agreeing to act as a reinsurer - guaranteeing that any pay-outs will be funded.\nJulian Knight MP, who chairs the House of Commons culture select committee, said: \"Though it is a shame that it has come too late for some this summer, this scheme will provide the confidence the sector needs to plan and invest in future events.\"\nPromoter Live Nation UK called it a \"vital intervention\" that would give the sector \"certainty\".\nHowever, there are concerns that it will just pay out if events are banned by another lockdown. The Musicians' Union said \"the major problem\" with the scheme is that it does not cover events that would become uneconomical if social distancing came back into force.\nThe Association of Independent Festivals welcomed the scheme, but said it doesn't \"cover a festival needing to reduce capacity or cancel due to social distancing restrictions being reintroduced\".\nGreg Parmley, chief executive of industry association Live, said the scheme was \"good news\" but \"the devil is very much in the detail\". \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the association wanted to work with government to ensure it covered cancellations due to the reintroduction of social distancing making an event financially unviable and artists being forced to self-isolate after catching the virus. \nHe added that these situations were \"far more likely\" to cause events to be cancelled in the coming months than another lockdown. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak said the lack of \"the right kind\" of insurance had proved \"a problem\" for the UK's live events industry.\n\"As the economy reopens I want to do everything I can to help events providers and small businesses plan with confidence right through to next year,\" he said.\nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden called it \"an important next step\" for the live events sector, and said it would give organisers \"the confidence they need to plan for a brighter future\".\nThe development comes after the government's \u00a31.8bn Culture Recovery Fund was set up to provide grants for arts organisations and heritage sites affected by the pandemic.\nJamie Njoku-Goodwin, head of trade body UK Music, said: \"We are extremely grateful to government for listening to the calls of the sector and delivering a solution to the market failure in the insurance industry.\"\nMichael Kill, the CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, said:  \"I am extremely pleased the government has decided to introduce an insurance scheme for the events and festival sector, it stands testament to a government that is starting to acknowledge the varying issues within the sector and through engagement, take the appropriate action to protect businesses and jobs.\"\nBut, he added: \"It is devastating that the timings of this scheme could not have been earlier, as we have already lost many amazing festivals and events to the uncertainty that this pandemic represents.\nLabour said the funding was a \"bare minimum\" and promoters would still be taking risks by staging events.\nShadow culture secretary Jo Stevens described the scheme as \"a solution that doesn't address the problem\".\nThe government also published endorsements from the Events Industry Alliance, the Meetings Industry Association and the organisers of Southampton International Boat Show.\nEvents companies will be able to purchase the cover from next month, with the scheme set to run until September 2022.\nBut the events industry is not the only sector currently calling for more government support.\nThe travel industry has urged the Treasury to extend the furlough support scheme to protect jobs.\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, said despite the latest changes to the UK's traffic light system it was one of the \"few sectors that cannot reopen properly\".\n\"We've now had two summers of precious little revenue and we're at the limit of what we can borrow,\" he said. \"Tens of thousands of jobs are at stake and without furlough it will be very tough.\"\nThe government said it was providing an \"unprecedented package\" of support to protect jobs and businesses, and the airlines sector would have received about \u00a37bn by the end of September.\nOn Thursday 30,215 new Covid cases were reported across the UK, along with a further 86 deaths within 28 days of a positive test."

Taliban insurgents were photographed inside the local airport and posing at the entrance to the city. \nThe militants made a sustained bid to seize the city after capturing surrounding districts. \nBut Nimroz's Deputy Governor Roh Gul Khairzad told reporters that Zaranj had fallen \"without a fight\".\nShe and other local officials complained of a lack of reinforcements from the Afghan government.\n\"The city was under threat for a while, but no one from the central government listened to us,\" Ms Khairzad said.\nThe last time the Taliban captured a provincial capital was in 2016, when they briefly held the northern city of Kunduz.\nThe militants launched a major military campaign in May, to coincide with the phased withdrawal of US and Nato forces after 20 years of military operations. The capture of Zaranj will add to their momentum, analysts say.\nOvernight, US and Afghan forces launched air strikes on the group's positions in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province. \nGovernment troops have vowed not to lose the strategically significant city, and fighting there has been fierce. Officials have urged civilians to evacuate, with thousands trapped or fleeing for their lives.\nIn Herat, people have also been fleeing their homes in anticipation of a government offensive against Taliban positions. \n\"We have nothing left and we do not know where to go,\" one resident told AFP news agency. \nEarlier on Friday, the director of Afghanistan's government media centre was assassinated by Taliban militants in the capital, Kabul. Dawa Khan Menapal was shot dead as he left a mosque in his car.\nThe Taliban said he had been \"punished for his deeds\".\nAfghan government colleagues condemned the killing as shocking and cowardly.  \nUS Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires to Afghanistan Ross Wilson tweeted that he was \"saddened and disgusted\" by the killing, adding: \"These murders are an affront to Afghans' human rights and freedom of speech.\"\nDays earlier, an attack on the Afghan defence minister's house in Kabul left at least eight people dead. The minister, Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, was not at home at the time. \nAt a UN Security Council meeting on Friday, representatives voiced concerns over the growing bloodshed.\nAfghanistan's envoy Ghulam Isaczai called on the Security Council to take action to pressure the militants to halt their attacks and take part in meaningful peace talks. \n\"It is our collective responsibility to stop them from destroying Afghanistan and threatening the world community,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, the chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission told the BBC that countries within the region in particular needed to tell the Taliban that coming to power through violence would mean that their government would not be recognised."

They then rose more than 2% to 278p in lunchtime trading, higher than the new Fortress offer and a sign that some investors think the bidding war might not be over.\nUnder the UK's takeover rules, CDR has until 9 August to table any new offer.\nMajor Morrisons shareholders include Silchester, which has more than 15%, as well as money managers M&G and JO Hambro.\nAll shareholders in Morrisons are due to vote on the Fortress bid on 16 August. It needs at least 75% approval to pass. \nIf shareholders agree, it will be the second major UK supermarket to change ownership this year.\nIn June, regulators approved the takeover of Leeds-based Asda from US retail giant Walmart for \u00a36.8bn by the billionaire Issa Brothers, who were backed by private equity firm  TDR Capital.\nMorrisons started life as a market stall in Bradford in 1899, but it was not until 1961 that the first supermarket store opened under the name.\nIn 2004, the group bought rival grocer Safeway for \u00a33bn, giving it a bigger slice of the market in southern England.

It's shameful that they should be allowed to do this.\n\"They're sacrificing Welsh land for the benefit of the rich in England.\"\nThe Foresight Group owns four farms in Wales - Frongoch, Brynglas, Esgair Hir and Banc - and confirmed that it intended to use the land for afforestation.   \nThe company said: \"Sustainability is central to Foresight's business and we believe it is right to invest responsibly in forestry sites around the UK. \n\"A key focus of our approach is to ensure that any land use change is done in as sensitive way as possible. As part of any new scheme, we always engage and consult with local communities.\"  \nThe company added it targeted less fertile land for afforestation projects and confirmed it intended to apply for Welsh government grants.\nSusan Price, who lives on a farm near Llanwrtyd Wells in Powys, said there were three farms in the area which had been recently sold to companies from outside Wales to plant trees.  \nShe said taking fertile land out of food production into forestry was harmful for the local agricultural industry and damaged the local culture and language.  \n\"I feel quite bitter because it's part of our heritage,\" added Ms Price.\n\"When our livelihoods are taken away from us, then our heritage and our communities and our language disappear and I think it's very sad.\nShe said large companies bought land as investment, \"outpricing local families\", and the Welsh government was \"making it so easy for them\" through its grant system.\n\"I don't suppose you can blame them - it's here for them on a plate and they're going to take it up, but unfortunately, we have to lose things because of it,\" she said.\nDai Dyer, an agricultural consultant in the Tywi Valley, Carmarthenshire, has researched the buying and selling of farms in mid and south-west Wales.\nHe warned the buying up of farms for tree planting became \"a trend that might not be able to be stopped\", turning \"fruitful, productive farms that also house families\" into \"a house surrounded by trees\". \nHe added the grant scheme should only be offered to those living in Wales and the amount of planting on anyone holding restricted to 10%.\nThe Welsh government said: \"The Woodland Investment Grant Scheme is not a land purchase scheme.\n\"It is unlikely investors buying land for planting trees on a large scale will apply to the scheme, unless they are aiming to create a woodland area for local communities.\"  \nThe Welsh government added a formal consultation on the National Forest scheme would be launched shortly to engage with local communities and farmers.

      "text": "A mother has been convicted alongside her then boyfriend of killing her three-year-old daughter, days after threatening to do so in a text message. \nKaylee-Jayde Priest was found dead at the flat in Solihull where she lived with her mother, Nicola Priest, 23, on 9 August last year.\nPriest and lover Callum Redfern, 22, were cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter.\nThe youngster died from serious chest and abdominal injuries.\nThe child's mother rang 999 but a jury convicted Priest after hearing the youngster had been \"dead before the call was made\".\nMedical examinations later showed she had also suffered historical injuries including broken ribs, lower leg fractures and a broken sternum, Birmingham Crown Court heard.\nPriest and Redfern were at the time in a \"close sexual relationship\".\nJurors had heard how the mother would hit Kaylee around the head, while the youngster was also heard crying \"in a fearful tone\".\nOn one occasion, neighbours in a flat below at Kingshurst House, Solihull, recalled hearing a bang above and then the girl crying, before allegedly hearing Priest say: \"I'll just say she fell off the bed.\"\nThe same residents claimed they noticed that \"when Kaylee cried, the response appeared to be to drown out her crying with music\".\nIn a text message exchange on 24 July last year, days before the youngster's death, Priest told Redfern: \"I'm gonna kill her... because she keeps leaving the living room or going in the kitchen, so I've paled [hit] her one and smacked her for [dirtying] her nappy.\"\nRedfern said: \"Good - give her one from me.\"\nPriest replied: \"I will, babe.\"\nFrom the time the mother moved in to the flat in mid-2019, neighbours heard her \"shouting with real regularity\" at Kaylee, including comments like \"Shut up\", \"Go away\" or \"Leave me alone\" - and \"never anything positive or kind\".\nIn CCTV played to court, the girl and Priest were seen together, hours before the youngster's fatal collapse, using a lift at the block of flats where they lived.\nAt no point in the footage was there any physical contact between the pair, with the mother neglecting to reach out to hold her daughter's hand.\nPriest, of Poplar Avenue, Edgbaston, Birmingham, and Redfern, of Temple Street, Dudley, will be sentenced on Friday. \nThe mother was also found guilty of cruelty to a child, relating to the youngster's historical injuries, but Redfern was cleared of that charge.\nIn a statement released through police after the verdicts, Kaylee's grandmother, Debbie Windmill, said she could \"never stop staring at the smile on her beautiful face\".\nThe grandmother added preparing to buy her first grandchild her pre-school uniform \"was something that filled me with such happiness\".\nShe said: \"I couldn't wait to see her in it, but this opportunity was stolen from me in the most brutal of ways.\"\nSpeaking afterwards, Det Insp Adam Jobson, said he did not think \"we will ever fully know what has happened\".\nHe added: \"One thing is clear, Nicky Priest has failed her daughter, she's failed to protect her and she should be - being a mother to that little girl - the one person who should have been able to protect her.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Welsh government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Most of Wales' remaining Covid rules will be lifted as the nation enters the \"final lap\" of the pandemic, the first minister has said.\nSocial distancing laws and rules on who can meet indoors will end on Saturday, almost 17 months after the first lockdown.\nHowever, rules will remain tighter than in England, with face masks still required by law in many public places.\nMark Drakeford said they will likely be needed for the rest of the year.\nHe warned the changes did not mean a \"free-for-all\".\nWales will move to alert level zero - the lowest level of restrictions seen so far - from 06:00 BST on Saturday.\nMr Drakeford said as the case rate had steadily declined for the past three weeks and vaccinations had increased, most rules could now be scrapped.\nHe told a press briefing that the easing of restrictions was a \"significant moment for all of us\" and a \"big step closer to life before the pandemic started\". \nIn response to the news, Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives said it was time for a Wales-specific inquiry into the way the pandemic had been handled in Wales.\nThe first minister urged people to be sensible, to continue to practise social distancing, think about who they meet and where, and not behave as if the \"virus has disappeared\".\n\"Most people in Wales want to go on acting carefully to protect their health and the health of others,\" he said.\nMr Drakeford said with such major changes to rules, the impact on case rates needed to be seen and so no further relaxation was expected to be made for \"at least six weeks\". \nMr Drakeford said while he did not expect Wales to have to return to tight restrictions such as lockdown measures, he could not rule anything out if there was a \"sudden change for the worse\".\nHowever, he said: \"Provided we do not see further unexpected turns in the course of the virus, then I think we can have confidence that we are on the final lap of emerging from the pandemic.\"\nUnder the changes from Saturday:\nHowever companies will still be expected to take measures to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted on their premises.\nIt will be the law to wear face masks in indoor public places including shops, buses and trains, and in health and social care settings, but not in venues where food and drink is served, such as pubs.\nMr Drakeford told BBC Wales face coverings were \"likely\" to play a part in helping tackle coronavirus \"for the rest of this year\".\nWhile the changes will see most of Wales' rules lifted, more restrictions remain in place than across the border in England, where they were scrapped on so-called \"freedom day\" on 18 July.\nMost restrictions in Scotland will come to an end on Monday - and with face masks still required in shops, the rules will be similar to here in Wales.\nMeanwhile, in Northern Ireland rules on who you can meet and where remain in place.\nLaws on who you can meet indoors have existed since the start of the lockdown in March 2020.\nCurrent restrictions  - to be scrapped on Saturday - say only six people are able to meet in private homes.\nPeople will continue to have to self-isolate by law for 10 days if they get Covid, while the Welsh government advice will be to continue to work from home where possible.\nHowever, those who are fully vaccinated and are found to be a close contact of a positive Covid case will not need to self-isolate from Saturday.\nThe decision to lift the social distancing duty on businesses means firms will instead be expected to put in place measures to keep people safe and draw up risk assessments.\nThat could see them continuing to require social distancing, face masks, or use other measures such as ventilation or a combination of these, with the first minister saying he did not expect \"large crowds of people\" would be seen at bars as businesses tried to keep punters safe.\nSome pub and bar owners have said while they were pleased to be able to \"throw away the measuring tape\", the onus on businesses to set their own rules was unfair.\nJoanne Cooney, owner of Cooney's Bar in Llandudno, said with rules being different in England, some places had reported issues with tourists refusing to wear masks and stay apart, and having different rules in different businesses could make it worse.\n\"We are having to try and figure out very confusing guidance... people think everything's gone back to normal, but it's not, they've just said 'it's all on you now'\", she told BBC Radio Wales.\nMs Cooney said the guidance setting out what businesses should do from Saturday was \"unclear\", and called for clarity from the Welsh government.\nResponding to the concerns, Mr Drakeford said the guidance was clear, and the measures were to make sure staff and customers were \"properly protected\" and give people confidence they could go out.\nWedding receptions have been subject to restrictions since March 2020 - but from Saturday those will be lifted.\nJordan and Emily Burns, from Buckley in Flintshire, should have been married in April 2020 - two weeks after lockdown began. \nThey have rearranged their ceremony four times since and had a small, legal marriage ceremony four months ago. \nOn Saturday, however, they will have the big wedding they always wanted at Ty'n Dwr Hall in Llangollen.\nMrs Burns said: \"It's been only six to a table in weddings - our tables will have 24 people, which just seems crazy doesn't it? \n\"We're able to have the ceremony indoors so we're not worried with the weather. It just takes so much pressure off us as well and we can just look forward to it, be excited and just enjoy the day.\"\nStacey Alford, a DJ from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said the pandemic \"pulled the plug\" on her career.\nShe said the music community was excited to see Wales moving to alert level zero, but was aware of the need for caution.\n\"The general consensus is 'get us in there, we can't wait' - but obviously we want everyone to just take it slowly, enjoy themselves but not be silly.\"\nThe changes mean there will be fewer Covid rules to police.\nBut Mark Jones, general secretary of the North Wales Police Federation, fears a return to normality for the public will put pressure on officers.\n\"We're seeing the first time in near enough two summers where freedom is there, so a lot of people will be coming to visit north Wales and we're anticipating demands on policing, which means that the thin blue line is going to be stretched even further and further,\" he said.\nExactly 500 days after telling us to stay home, Mark Drakeford has confirmed an end to the rules on who and where we meet.\nHe has deliberately avoided repeating Boris Johnson's assurance that we are on an \"irreversible\" path out.\nBut the success of the vaccination programme means the bar for \"re-imposing severe restrictions will be higher\", the Welsh government says.\nThe next step is to provide booster jabs. Some people will get one with their annual flu jab in the autumn.\nIn a clear signal about the ongoing threat of the pandemic, ministers say they are worried about a \"perfect storm\" of Covid and flu this winter.\nFollowing the announcement, opposition parties called for people to act responsibly, and pressed again for a Wales-only inquiry into the handling of Covid by the Welsh government.\nMore than 7,900 have died since the pandemic began.\nPlaid Cymru said it wanted \"reassurance from government that lessons have been learnt\", and the Tories said those who have suffered should be given justice.\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said that as Wales moved forward people had to \"take responsibility\" to stop cases rising.\n\"We are going to have to learn to live with Covid, because we can't afford to go back into the lockdowns that have blighted our lives in the past 15, 16 months,\" he said.\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman, Rhun ap Iorwerth, welcomed the move forward, but said the ministers must be ready to take a step back if necessary.\n\"Now what we want as these freedoms come back is to see in clear evidence terms that government is honing its early-warning systems even more, is even more vigilant about any curveballs sent in our direction,\" he said.\nHowever, Mr Drakeford, who has already agreed to a UK-wide inquiry, said a Wales specific inquiry would not give a \"proper understanding\" of how the pandemic was handled.\nWales has seen a third wave of coronavirus cases in recent months - but it peaked on 16 July and has been decreasing ever since.\nLatest figures published on Friday showed Wales' case rate had fallen slightly, to 132.4 per 100,000 people over a seven-day period.\nThey also showed 66% of Wales' total population was fully vaccinated, with health boards now inviting 16 and 17-year-olds for their jabs.\nMr Drakeford said health boards were ready to start offering booster jabs from September, but the government were waiting for advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation."

      "text": "Job starting salaries are rising at record rates due to shortages in candidates, according to KPMG.\nRising demand for staff to fill vacancies resulted in the sharpest salary inflation rate in almost 24 years of data collection, its jobs survey found.\nHowever, ongoing uncertainty over job security concerns caused a \"severe drop\" in candidates in July, it said.\nCandidate numbers fell at the second-fastest rate in the survey's history.\nThe lack of available candidates continued to decline rapidly in July, driven by \"concerns over job security due to the pandemic, a lack of European workers due to Brexit, and a generally low unemployment rate\", the report by KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said.\nThe BBC has approached the Home Office for comment.\nClaire Warnes, partner and head of education, skills and productivity at KPMG UK, said job seekers should be \"taking advantage\" of the bounce in salaries for new recruits.\nCompanies were wanting to invest in their businesses now coronavirus restrictions had been eased but demand for new staff outstripped supply, she added.\n\"We know that reskilling and upskilling is needed to help people move between sectors, and there's no doubt the 'pingdemic' has added an extra dimension to the recruitment challenge,\" said Ms Warnes.\n\"Plus, with furlough due to end soon, there may be a downward pressure on pay to come.\"\nKate Shoesmith, deputy chief executive of the REC, said the data confirmed that it was now a \"good time to be looking for a new job\".\n\"Employers are desperate to find good candidates for the many jobs on offer and this is reflected in starting salaries rising at the sharpest rate since the survey began in 1997,\" she said.\n\"This will likely motivate more people to be on the lookout for new opportunities. The same goes for those on temporary contracts which are also seeing increased pay.\"\nSeveral industries, including the hospitality and haulage sectors, are experiencing chronic shortages in workers.\nSome of the many skilled jobs in short supply include chefs, software engineers, technicians and carers.\nThe report found latest vacancy data indicated faster increases in demand for both permanent and temporary workers in July. \nThe report said the removal of Covid restrictions had led to a \"sharp increase\" in the number of people employed into permanent job roles, while the upturn in temporary vacancies was the steepest since November 1997. \nJuly survey data signalled an upturn in demand for temporary workers as well. So-called \"blue collar\" workers remained at the top of the rankings, followed closely by hotel and catering staff. \nJobs in IT and computing, hotel and catering and engineering were in high demand for permanent roles, while retail vacancies were the least in demand.\nIn the private sector, demand for permanent staff expanded at a slightly quicker pace than for temporary workers. In contrast, short-term vacancies rose more quickly than permanent roles in the public sector.\nHowever, Ms Shoesmith warned pay increases alone won't meet the demand built up over recent months.\n\"We need an immigration system that flexes to meet demand as was promised, and business and government need a long-term plan for skilling up workers,\" she said.\n\"Skills shortages have been with us for a while and as our data shows are getting worse.\""

      "text": "Jennifer Aniston has expanded on why she has cut off some of her friends who have refused to be vaccinated.\nEarlier this week, the Friends actress said she had \"lost a few people from [her] weekly routine\" who had decided against having a Covid jab.\nSome of her Instagram followers have since asked why she was so worried, given that she had been vaccinated.\n\"Because if you have the variant, you are still able to give it to me,\" she posted on Thursday.\n\"I may get slightly sick but I will not be admitted to a hospital and or die.\n\"But I can give it to someone else who does not have the vaccine and whose health is compromised (or has a previous existing condition) - and therefore I would put their lives at risk.\"\nThe actress made the comments on her Instagram story, which allows users to post pictures, videos and messages which only stay live for 24 hours. \nIn her interview with InStyle, published on Tuesday, Aniston said: \"There's still a large group of people who are anti-vaxxers or just don't listen to the facts. It's a real shame. \n\"I've just lost a few people in my weekly routine who have refused or did not disclose [whether or not they had been vaccinated], and it was unfortunate. I feel it's your moral and professional obligation to inform, since we're not all podded up and being tested every single day.\"\nShe added: \"It's tricky because everyone is entitled to their own opinion - but a lot of opinions don't feel based in anything except fear or propaganda.\"\nAniston is one of the most famous actresses in the world, thanks in large part to her portrayal of Rachel on the US sitcom Friends. \nEarlier this year, the cast of the show hit the headlines when they reunited on screen for the first time in 17 years.\nAniston broke an Instagram record (which has since been beaten) when she joined the social media platform in 2019, and now has 37 million followers.\nEarlier this week, US news network CNN sacked three employees for returning to work unvaccinated. CNN boss Jeff Zucker said the company had \"a zero tolerance policy on this\".\nIn the UK on Thursday, the new NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard urged unvaccinated young adults to get jabbed, saying it is \"so important\".\nMore than 46 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine - part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched.\nThese high vaccination levels have created a \"protective wall\", the government has said, sufficient to end legal restrictions on social contact.\nFirst vaccines are now being offered to everyone aged 16 and above as well as children over the age of 12 who are at higher risk from Covid.\nThe NHS website states that vaccines are \"the best way to protect yourself and others\" against Covid, noting how they reduce the risk of people getting seriously ill or dying from the virus, while also lessening the chances of them catching or spreading it.\nHowever, they also note that vaccinated people can still catch and spread coronavirus.\nWhile mild side effects are common, they say, more serious ones such as allergic reactions or blood clotting are rare.\nAniston may have publicly championed vaccines, but other entertainment stars including Stone Roses singer Ian Brown, Van Morrison and Eric Clapton have expressed concerns.\nClapton described his experience of taking the vaccine as \"disastrous\", and blamed \"propaganda\" for overstating its safety.\nHe, Brown and Richard Ashcroft have all pulled out of a festival appearances over their refusal to play events that require vaccination proof as a condition of entry.\nFrom the end of September, the government hopes to introduce a law requiring two jabs to go to nightclubs and some other venues in England.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Electricity pricing,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry",
      "text": "Energy prices will rise for millions of people across the UK in April, at a time when finances are squeezed.\nRegulator Ofgem said the price cap for default domestic energy deals would be raised to cover suppliers' extra costs.\nThe typical gas and electricity customer is likely to see their bill go up by \u00a396 to \u00a31,138 a year.\nCharities say the timing is a \"double whammy\", coming at a time when the government's Covid-related support schemes are due to be wound down.\nOfgem said rising wholesale costs were behind the increase, adding that the existence of the price cap meant households saved \u00a3100 a year, and they could also switch to a better deal.\nJonathan Brearley, chief executive of the regulator, said:\u202f \"Energy bill increases are never welcome, especially as many households are struggling with the impact of the pandemic. We have carefully scrutinised these changes to ensure that customers only pay a fair price for their energy.  \n\"As the UK still faces challenges around Covid-19, during this exceptional time I expect suppliers to set their prices competitively, treat all customers fairly and ensure that any household in financial distress is given access to the support they need.\"\nHe said a rise in spring, when less energy was used, was better than waiting until the autumn.\nPeter Earl, head of energy at price comparison website Comparethemarket.com, said: \"Raising energy costs for millions of households by an average of \u00a396 is an extraordinary move in the current environment. \n\"It calls into question the whole point of a price cap which was designed to protect the most vulnerable households.\"\nThe price cap, set twice a year by the regulator, affects 11 million households in England, Wales and Scotland who have never switched suppliers or whose discounted deals have expired. Northern Ireland sets its own cap.\nThat accounts for about half of all UK households. The remainder are on so-called fixed deals, which will not be affected.\nThe cap for prepayment meter customers will go up by \u00a387\u202f to \u00a31,156, affecting another four million customers.\nThe caps set the prices that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, but that does not mean there is a limit to how much people can pay. The more gas and electricity you use, the higher the bill.\nLockdown life means Lyn Clark, like so many others, has been spending a lot more time at home. Her energy bills have been rising as a result.\n\"I'm trying not to switch on heaters in the rooms that are not being used,\" she said.\nWhile prices are capped on default tariffs, the amount people pay in total is likely to have risen during more time at home.\nMrs Clark said she had been doing her best to keep the costs down.\n\"I find myself putting on extra layers,\" she said. \"I also go for a walk each lunchtime to make sure I'm warmer.\"\nIn October, Ofgem lowered the price cap by \u00a384, but it has now more than reversed that with the rise scheduled for April.\nThe extra allowance for suppliers to raise prices is the result of greater costs on the wholesale markets.\nIt also includes an allowance to charge an extra \u00a323 a year to cover bills that have not been paid. Ofgem said a further delay in recouping these costs would only create greater costs next winter.\nCharities point out that raising prices for everyone on these tariffs is likely to increase the number of people unable to pay.\nCitizens Advice said its research in December indicated that 2.1 million households were behind on their energy bills, a rise of 600,000 compared with before the pandemic.\nIt was concerned that the planned removing of assistance for recipients of universal credit, as well as other government financial support schemes being wound down, meant there were serious worries over debt.\nAlistair Cromwell, acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"This increase will be a heavy blow to a lot of households. For many people on universal credit it will come at the same time as the \u00a320 a week increase to the benefit is set to end.\n\"With a tough jobs market and essential bills rising, now is not the time for the government to cut this vital lifeline\". \nAdam Scorer, of National Energy Action, which has also warned of financial pressures on households, said: \"People on the lowest incomes and in the worst housing are always hit hardest. \n\"Heating a poorly insulated home costs around \u00a350 a month more than a decent home. If bills rise by \u00a396, millions of households have two stark choices; stay cold or fall further into debt.\"\nHe argued that prepayment meter customers should not have been included in the cap as they found it difficult to switch.\nEven if households do switch, the cost of so-called fixed-rate deals has also been rising. The cheapest on the market rose by more than \u00a350 in the last three months of the year to \u00a3851.\nEmma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, a trade body for energy suppliers, said the price cap was set to be fair to customers and suppliers.\n\"Today's rise reflects that the cost of buying energy - by far the biggest part of the bill - has risen significantly over the last few months,\" she said.\n\"It also includes a greater allowance for debt given the difficulties many customers are facing in paying bills at present.\""

The source said fighting was still happening around the National Directorate of Security office.\nThe reports have not been officially confirmed. \nMenapal's killing came days after the Taliban assaulted the defence minister's home in Kabul. \nAfter the attack on Wednesday - the first major bombing by militants in the city for nearly a year - the Taliban warned of further attacks on government figures.\n\"Unfortunately, the savage terrorists have committed a cowardly act once again and martyred a patriotic Afghan,\" interior ministry spokesman Mirwais Stanikzai said.\nUS Charge d'Affaires to Afghanistan Ross Wilson tweeted that he was \"saddened and disgusted\" by the killing, adding: \"These murders are an affront to Afghans' human rights and freedom of speech.\"\nThe UN Security Council has called an open meeting for Friday on the situation in Afghanistan amid worsening violence.\nTaliban militants have captured large swathes of the countryside and are now attacking key cities including Kandahar in the south, economically important Herat, and Lashkar Gar - capital of Helmand Province.\nIt comes after US and other international forces announced their withdrawal following two decades of operations.\nDiplomats said Afghan government officials requested the meeting in view of the growing unrest. It is set to start at 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT) in New York, diplomats said. \nOn Thursday night US and Afghan forces launched air strikes on Taliban positions in Lashkar Gah. \nGovernment troops have vowed not to lose the strategically significant town, and fighting there has been fierce. Officials have urged civilians to evacuate, with thousands trapped or fleeing for their lives.\nNeighbouring nations are also set to discuss the situation in Afghanistan on Friday.\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have sent diplomats to Turkmenistan's town of Avaza on the Caspian Sea for annual talks. \nTurkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov called Afghanistan \"the question that worries us all\" on Wednesday during a state television broadcast, AFP news agency reports.\nRussia meanwhile has held military drills with Uzbek forces this week, amid growing concerns about security in the region - including the capture of key Afghan border crossings in the past month.\nOn Thursday the European Union called for \"an urgent, comprehensive and permanent ceasefire\" in Afghanistan as the \"senseless violence\" escalates."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow.  \nSixteen and 17-year-olds across the UK are now being invited to book their coronavirus vaccine. GPs in England have been told they can contact this age group, while invites will also be sent out in Wales. In Northern Ireland, walk-in centres are now open to older teenagers, and in Scotland they can register their interest online. Meanwhile, new Public Health England data shows most patients in hospital with Covid in England continue to be unvaccinated. PHE said that of the 1,467 people hospitalised with the Delta variant since 19 July, 808 (55.1%) were unvaccinated, while 512 (34.9%) had received both doses. \nA long-distance couple separated by pandemic travel rules for 18 months have been granted an exemption to get married in England. Australian Chris Quealy, 72, proposed to Penny Steven, 69, from Amersham, over Zoom this year, as strict Covid border rules in Australia kept the couple apart. But on Thursday, the pair - who met in 2015 during a hike of Spain's Camino de Santiago - finally received confirmation of Chris's dispensation to leave Australia. \"I am on cloud nine,\" says Penny, from Amersham. \"It is a dream come true.\"\nItaly has become the latest EU country to introduce a digital Covid certificate scheme for access to some services and venues, in a bid to curb infections. The \"green pass\" will allow access for people who have had at least one jab, have recovered from Covid or who have tested negative within the previous 48 hours. From Friday, anyone over 12 at venues such as gyms, bars, cinemas museums and restaurants must show their pass. You can read more here.\nJennifer Aniston has explained on Instagram why she has cut off unvaccinated friends - after telling a media outlet that she had \"lost a few people from [her] weekly routine\" who had refused the jab. Asked by followers on the social media platform why she was so worried given she was vaccinated, the Friends actress said there was a chance she could still catch the virus and give it to someone who was unvaccinated or medically vulnerable.

But at a fraction of the size and with no posters, flyers or pop-up performances, this year's socially-distanced Fringe feels like a different sort of festival, says Pauline McLean, BBC Scotland's Arts correspondent.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Local media suggest it was a stone.\nSt Vincent and the Grenadines, which lies in the south Caribbean, is made up of more than 32 islands.\nThe country has recorded 2,298 coronavirus cases and 12 deaths since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Almost 9% of the population has been fully vaccinated, the university says.\nIts tourism industry has been badly impacted by the pandemic, and thousands of people were forced to leave their homes following a volcanic eruption in April."

      "text": "Australians living overseas could be \"trapped\" in Australia if they return, after the nation's government tightened its border rules without notice.\nSince March last year, the country has banned its citizens from leaving the country as part of its Covid strategy.\nThat restriction has not previously applied to Australians who usually live in other countries.\nBut they will now need to apply for an exemption for outbound travel - in line with rules for other Australians.\nAustralia's tough border rules have been controversial. Critics say this change - in effect from 11 August - will further punish families and deter citizens from returning.\nThe government said the measure aimed to reduce the risk of Covid cases entering the country, as it grapples with its worst outbreaks in a year.\nAustralia already has a weekly limit on incoming travellers and bans foreigners from entry unless they have an exemption. Its policies are among the strictest globally.\nLast month,  it halved the number of permitted arrivals due to Delta variant outbreaks.\nMany Australians have expressed outrage at the latest move, branded by some as barbaric.\nAlexandra Phelan, who lives in the US, tweeted she was \"waking up to news that I'm effectively exiled from my country\". \nWhile the closed-border policy has been mostly supported in Australia, many have also criticised its impact on citizens. \nThe BBC has been told of cases in the past year where Australians have been unable to leave to care for sick or dying loved ones, or to retrieve their children from relatives.\nLegal experts have questioned whether Australia's rules breach constitutional rights by effectively preventing some citizens from being able to return.\nThe government has said Australia will not re-open until at least 80% of its population is vaccinated, likely to be sometime next year. The current total is 19%.\nMore than half of Australia's 26 million people are currently in lockdown, due to Delta outbreaks in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.\nSydney - the worst-hit city - has recorded over 4,300 cases in its outbreak. \nOn Friday, New South Wales state reported 291 new cases - its highest daily number in the pandemic so far."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Women,Birmingham,Hotels,Travel & leisure industry,Sexual harassment,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Another woman has been sexually harassed in hotel quarantine despite new rules designed to prevent it.\nLast month the government said female guests would get female guards.\nHowever, Lorna Farmer, 28, walked out of the Hilton Garden Inn at Birmingham airport a week ago, after a guard offered to \"entertain\" her in her room.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care now says it will introduce a new phone line for women to report harassment confidentially.\nEighteen women have now reported harassment to the BBC - two of them since the DHSC took steps to fix the problem in July.\nThe new measures included a new dedicated complaints system and extra training for guards on how to behave around lone women, as well as the plan for women to be supervised by female guards \"when available\".\nLorna Farmer says, however, that she was only escorted outside on exercise breaks by male guards. \nShe says she began receiving unwanted attention from a security guard employed by the company, Mitie, soon after arriving at the Hilton Garden Inn on Sunday 25 July.\nHe asked to see her in her pyjamas, and asked to enter her room, she says - knocking repeatedly on her door and sometimes sitting on the floor outside it. \nWhat are the rules for travelling to green, amber and red-list countries?\nOn one occasion, when she was cleaning her room, he said: \"Why don't you put that Hoover down and I'll come in and entertain you.\" \nMs Farmer says he repeated this another five times within the space of 10 minutes.\nWhen she complained to the head of the security team in the hotel, from the company Mitie, the guard was removed. \nBut Ms Farmer says a different guard had also made lewd comments to female guests during their exercise break, so she still felt unsafe and got her father to come and drive her home.\nShe then reported the harassment to police in Northamptonshire, where she is from.\nMitie said: \"Should a complaint be raised by a guest a full investigation is carried out. In this case, the investigation found that the officer had not followed our procedures and therefore is no longer working on the contract.\"\nAsked whether he was still working for Mitie, and whether he might now be working at a different quarantine hotel, a spokesperson said she could not share personal information about staff.\nThe Hilton Garden Inn emphasised that security firms were contracted by the DHSC and fell outside its responsibility.\nThe DHSC said: \"Sexual harassment or abuse is completely unacceptable and totally abhorrent. We take all such allegations extremely seriously and we expect providers to take firm action - including suspending staff or reporting them to the police where appropriate - as has happened in this case.\"\nIt said the new confidential reporting line for lone female guests would be staffed by recently retired and trained police officers.\nAnother woman, who is still in quarantine, says that a male security guard knocked on her door twice in one evening, giving a transparently bogus reason for wanting to talk to her. \nShe said she was not reporting the incident because she felt unsafe and was not leaving her room.\nMs Farmer told the BBC that when she went outside for exercise at the Hilton Garden Inn, she was always escorted by a single male guard, despite the DHSC's intention that lone female guests should get female guards. \nThree other women quarantining since the rule change have told the BBC that they too had male guards. \nOthers have said that they have mostly had female guards, though one added that \"once you're outside it's like being a walking exhibit with male guards sitting all around the parking lot like it's a gallery and looking you up and down as you walk\".\nIn July, the government said that if female guards were unavailable, lone women should be escorted by two male guards, \"with each guard chaperoning the other to ensure appropriate behaviour\". \nThis idea was sharply criticised by some women's safety campaigners and, judging from the reports of women in quarantine, appears to have been rarely adopted in practice.\nAfter walking out of the Hilton Garden Inn on Friday and spending the weekend at home, Lorna Farmer was called on Tuesday by an official who told her that West Midlands Police were looking for her, and that she could be arrested and fined \u00a310,000 if she didn't return to quarantine.\nShe says she felt very uneasy when two men then arrived in a van with darkened windows to accompany her to another quarantine hotel, the Crowne Plaza NEC. Here she was escorted outside for exercise by a female security guard, but says she only saw male guards on her corridor.\nMitie says there was a female guard on her floor at all times, and that at least two female officers were always on shift at each hotel, in line with DHSC guidance. The company added that it was taking active steps to increase the number of female officers working in quarantine hotels.\nAccording to the Security Industry Authority only 10% of licenced security guards in the UK are women.\nCarolyn Pearson, founder of Maiden-Voyage.com\nMs Farmer says she thinks it is \"ridiculous\" for lone women to be forced to quarantine in hotels when their safety cannot be guaranteed.\n\"The woman from public health said, 'Lorna, are you aware that West Midlands Police are looking for you, that they've put you down as absconded?' I was like, 'No, I spoke to Northamptonshire Police and reported everything that's happened, and they are absolutely happy with me being home.' \n\"And she was like, 'You have to come back today, otherwise we will come and get you and you'll be prosecuted and fined.' And I was like, 'Are you serious? After everything that's happened?'\"\nMs Farmer was allowed to leave the hotel on Thursday, 11 days after she arrived in the UK from Dubai.\nWest Midlands Victims' Commissioner Nicky Brennan said she was \"disgusted\" to hear how women were being treated by security staff in quarantine hotels.\n\"The government who have given the contract and the security company need to investigate the practices, training and conduct of staff with urgency. People who are quarantining in hotels at the orders of the government should not have to feel unsafe when following those rules.\n\"This would appear to be a problem across the country with security staff in these hotels. It's worrying for anybody, especially lone women that they could be treated in this way. They should not be put in this position by a government which is meant to be keeping them safe.\"\nFollow  Sue Mitchell and Sarah McDermott on Twitter"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "text": "Snickers in Spain has pulled a controversial TV advert that was heavily criticised for being homophobic.\nThe 20-second commercial shows Spanish influencer Aless Gibaja transform into a bearded man with a low voice after eating a Snickers ice cream.\nThe video went viral this week, with some calling for a boycott of Snickers.\nThe chocolate brand has now apologised for any \"misunderstanding that may have been caused\" by the film.\nIn it, Mr Gibaja is at a beach bar with a friend where he asks a waiter for a \"sexy orange juice with vitamins A, B and C\".\nThe waiter, looking confused, offers him the Snickers ice cream. After taking a bite, Mr Gibaja appears to transform into a bearded man.\n\"Better?\" the friend asks. \"Better,\" replies the man. A slogan reads: \"You're not yourself when you're hungry.\"\nThe advert unleashed a wave of accusations on social media that the brand was insulting gay men.\n\"It is shameful and regrettable that at this point there are companies that continue to perpetuate stereotypes and promote homophobia,\" the State Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Trans and Bisexuals tweeted.\nSpain's equality minister, Irene Montero, also joined the criticism.\n\"I wonder to whom it might seem like a good idea to use homophobia as a business strategy,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\"Our society is diverse and tolerant. Hopefully those who have the power to make decisions about what we see and hear in commercials and TV shows will learn to be too.\"\nThe left-wing party Podemos noted how the advert had followed a slew of homophobic hate crimes in Spain in recent months.\n\"In the face of a wave of LGBTI-phobia, including attacks and even murders, Snickers can't think of a better idea than to create a trashy commercial that tells you that you are not yourself if you are effeminate,\" it said on Twitter.\nIn May, five gay men were injured in three attacks during a single weekend in Barcelona.\nOn Thursday, Snickers Spain said it was deleting the advert and apologised for \"any misunderstanding\" it may have caused.\n\"In this specific campaign, the aim was to convey in a friendly and casual way that hunger can change your character,\" it said in a statement posted online.\n\"At no time has it been intended to stigmatize or offend any person or group.\"\nA spokesperson for parent company Mars Wrigley said the firm wholeheartedly apologised for any harm caused by the advert and recognised that it \"got it wrong\".\n\"We take equal rights and inclusion seriously, we want a world where everybody is free to be themselves and we believe that as an employer and advertiser we have a role and a responsibility to play our part in creating that world,\" the firm's spokesperson added.\nIn 2008, a Snickers advert that featured the A-Team's Mr T calling a speed walker a \"disgrace to the man race\" was pulled after accusations it was offensive to gay people.\nCorrection 24 August 2021: An earlier version of this article omitted trans when translating the Federaci\u00f3n Estatal LGTB into English and this line has been amended."

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The prime minister and transport secretary have defended changes to the UK's traffic light travel system, as an airline has scheduled extra flights to return Britons from red-listed Mexico.\nUp to 6,000 British tourists are currently in the country, and those who want to avoid quarantine will need to return before 04:00 BST on Sunday. \nThe change was announced on Wednesday.\nGrant Shapps said a new plan to review restrictions every three weeks will make for a \"simplified system\".\nBoris Johnson said that the government wanted people to be able to travel but had to balance that desire with the \"need to protect us against new variants\".\nAsked whether he would book a holiday to Spain, the prime minister said the government was trying to make travel as simple as possible by lengthening the gap between changes to guidance.\nTransport secretary Mr Shapps said this meant people would be able to travel \"without looking over their shoulders\". \nThe travel list changes apply for passengers returning to England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nThe Welsh government said on Thursday evening that it would follow the changes, due to sharing an open border with England, but said it was \"extremely disappointed\" and would continue to advise against non-essential international travel. \nCountries have their own rules about allowing visitors - so being on the UK's green list does not guarantee travellers can visit.\nOn Thursday 30,215 new Covid cases were reported across the UK, along with a further 86 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nThe latest widespread changes to Covid travel rules also see fully vaccinated passengers arriving from France no longer needing to quarantine and Spain remaining on the amber list.\nBut the Department for Transport has now said that \"arrivals from Spain and all its islands are advised to use a PCR test as their pre-departure test wherever possible\" instead of the cheaper lateral flow tests.\nTravel agents and operators said they had seen a \"surge\" in bookings - Brittany Ferries and Eurostar having a strong increase for France and other countries reporting increased demand for holidays to Spain, the Greek Islands, and the Canaries.\nMoving from amber to green: Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway\nMoving from red to amber: India, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE\nMoving from amber to red: Georgia, Mexico, La Reunion and Mayotte\nMoving from amber-plus to amber: France\nRead more on what the colours mean for testing and quarantine, here.\nOn Thursday, Mr Shapps sought to reassure British holidaymakers that the traffic light system would now be reviewed every three weeks - compared with once a week last summer and more recent ad-hoc changes - because of the number of people in the UK and abroad who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I hope people will be able to go away under this simplified system, enjoy their breaks and not be looking over their shoulders the whole time.\"\nMr Shapps said that between 5,000 and 6,000 British holidaymakers are in Mexico currently and would be \"making arrangements to come home\". \nFrom 12 August, the cost of hotel quarantine will increase, with the price for single adult travellers rising from \u00a31,750 to \u00a32,285 and a second adult paying \u00a31,430. \nThe government has said this better reflects the costs involved, including transport, security and PCR tests.\nChildren aged 5-12 will still cost \u00a3325; it is free for children aged under five.\nBritish Airways said its teams had been \"working through the night\" to arrange additional seats out of Mexico and had added four additional flights to London over the next three days, as well as rearranging another flight to land ahead of the deadline.\nIt said customers could re-book their flights from Mexico \"at no additional cost\" ahead of the deadline.\nRobin and Viv Silverthorne, from Worthing in Sussex, were flying to Cancun, Mexico, yesterday when they found out mid-air that the country was being placed on the red list.\nRobin says the couple spent hours on the phone trying to speak to their airline \"without success\" before making the decision to come home after just a day to avoid paying for a quarantine hotel.\nHe told the BBC: \"It's not just us, there was a plane full of holidaymakers in the same boat, some with children who will now have to pay thousands to quarantine on return. \n\"We have only just secured a return flight via Miami tomorrow. We have essentially paid a total of \u00a38,000 for a day trip to Mexico.\"\nHe says the couple had done their research and just wanted a \"nice holiday\" - but that the latest changes to the rules had left Viv in tears.\nAlso in Mexico are Claudia Rattray and her daughters Ivana and Summer who travelled to Mexico City to visit her family only to find out that the country had been added to the red list when they arrived.\n\"I decided to enjoy the time here with my family and I am going to see if in three weeks the government reviews this list,\" she said. \"But I think if not I am going to stay here in Mexico because I can't afford to pay for a quarantine hotel.\"\nShe added that they were lucky that they were staying with family and so had the option of staying for longer.\nAsked about the advice on PCR tests for arrivals from Spain, Mr Shapps insisted the government was \"not changing the rules\", as in Spain's case, \"virtually everyone is taking a PCR\" to meet the government's performance standards for the pre-departure test.\nBut in a series of tweets Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chairman of the Commons Transport Select Committee, said PCR tests for travel were an \"unnecessary rip-off\" and a \"barrier to affordable travel\".\nMr Shapps also said he believes full vaccination will be increasingly important for future travel. \"Most countries, probably all countries, will require full vaccination in order for you to enter\", he said.\nLabour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon criticised the government for \"flip-flopping over France\" and reiterated calls for data upon which travel list decisions are made to be published. \nGrant Shapps told the Today Programme that the government's advice to those returning to the UK from Spain to use a PCR test as their pre-departure test wherever possible, was \"not actually a change\".\nThis does not appear to be the case.\nThe existing guidance applying to Spain tells people returning to the UK that they need to take a private test in the three days before travelling. The guidance says that could be a PCR test or a (cheaper) lateral flow test as long as it meets UK requirements.\nMany travellers order a lateral flow test in the UK and take it with them to use in Spain. The travel operator Tui told Reality Check that more than 90% of its customers buy a package with their holiday that includes that sort of test.\nMr Shapps also said that \"virtually everyone is taking a PCR\" to meet the government's performance standards for the pre-departure test.\nBut we've spoken to several people who have used lateral flow tests in Spain in recent weeks and had no trouble using them to return to the UK.  \nIf you have been in a red list country in the last 10 days, you can only enter the UK if you are a UK or Irish national or UK resident, and you must stay at a quarantine hotel on your return. \nThe total number of countries or territories on the green list - from which all travellers can return without having to quarantine - rises from 29 to 36 when the changes come into effect.\nThe UK government sets the red, amber and green lists for England, while the other nations are in charge of their own lists. \nThe travel industry has welcomed France's addition to the amber list but trade association Abta said the speed at which countries were being added to the green list was at a \"snail's pace\", with the seven added not being traditional holiday destinations.\nBA boss Sean Doyle said that the UK's travel sector was \"lagging behind Europe\" due to \"more stringent testing requirements\" and a red list \"significantly broader than our European peers\".\nIndustry body Airlines UK has warned \"tens of thousands of jobs are at stake\" as it called for the furlough scheme to be extended. The government acknowledged it was a difficult time for the sector but said it was providing \"an unprecedented package of support\". \nAre you in Mexico?

      "tags": "Belarus,Alexander Lukashenko",
      "text": "A sprinter from Belarus who refused her team's orders to fly home early from the Olympics has revealed she decided to flee after her grandmother warned her it was not safe to return. \nKrystina Timanovskaya told the BBC she was being driven to the airport when her grandmother called, saying: \"Do not come back.\"\nThe athlete had been ordered to return home after criticising her coaches. \nShe is now in Poland, where she has been given a humanitarian visa.\nBelarus says she was removed from the national team because of her emotional state. But the 24-year-old says this is not true.\nThe case has again put the spotlight on Belarus, which has been ruled by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko since 1994. Last year, nationwide protests over his disputed re-election were violently repressed by the security forces.\nMs Timanovskaya's removal came after the sprinter complained on social media about being entered into the 4x400m relay race at short notice, after some teammates were found to be ineligible to compete.\nThe video led to criticism in state media, with one television channel saying she lacked team spirit.\nMs Timanovskaya said two coaches came into her room and told her to pack her bags immediately, ready to return home. She was told to say that she had been injured. \nThe sprinter revealed her grandmother said she was concerned that something bad might happen, after watching local news reports on the situation.\n\"I couldn't believe [that my grandmother would tell me not to come home] but I asked, 'Are you sure?' And she said, 'Yes. I'm sure. Do not come back,'\" she recalled. \n\"That was the reason why I went to the police.\"\nAt the airport, Ms Timanovskaya showed officers a translated plea for help on her phone in an effort to avoid being put on a plane home. \nShe was then given police protection before being moved to the Polish embassy in Tokyo. She travelled to Poland on Wednesday. \nThe mass protests that gripped Belarus last year saw security forces often use violence to break up the demonstrations and thousands of people arrested.\nSome of the protesters were national-level athletes, who were then stripped of funding, cut from national teams and detained.\nBut Ms Timanovskaya insists that she is \"not a political girl\" and just wants to focus on her sporting career.\n\"I don't know anything about politics. I never was in politics,\" she said. \nThe sprinter told the BBC she wanted to return to Belarus, but that it was too dangerous at the moment.\nHer husband has also fled Belarus and has been given a visa for Poland, but her relatives remain in the country.\nShe said her parents were \"OK, just a little bit nervous\", and trying to avoid watching TV reports about their daughter.\n\"They know me and they know the truth and they know what's happened,\" she said. \nShe added that the support she had received from people around the world had made her stronger. \nIn a separate case, two Belarusian opposition figures have gone on trial this week, charged with incitement to undermine national security.\nAnd on Tuesday, Vitaly Shishov, the head of an organisation helping Belarusians fleeing abroad, was found dead near his home in neighbouring Ukraine. He had reportedly been followed recently.\nAsked about her hopes for Belarus, Ms Timanovskaya said: \"I want people in my country not to be afraid anymore\". "

      "tags": "Alok Sharma,COP26,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The president of the UK's upcoming climate change conference is under fire for travelling to more than 30 countries in seven months.\nSeveral places visited by Alok Sharma were on the Covid red list - but he used an exemption for ministers to avoid quarantine on his return.\nThe government said face-to-face meetings were \"crucial\" ahead of the COP26 climate summit.\nBut opposition parties have accused Mr Sharma of hypocrisy.\nWales' First Minister Mark Drakeford called his itinerary - which was all published on government websites - \"inexplicable\".\nHe said government ministers should \"demonstrate that we too mean business\" in tackling climate change if they want the public to follow suit.\nLiberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine said it was \"completely and utterly irresponsible\" for the minister to come back from red list countries without quarantining. \nThe Daily Mail - which first reported the story - also claimed Mr Sharma held a meeting with Prince Charles days after returning from Bangladesh - a red list country - before going on a visit to a primary school.\nMr Sharma tweeted pictures of his meeting with the prince, including one showing participants sitting inside without wearing masks. \nHe is currently in Brazil -  also a red list country - and has tweeted that he is having \"constructive meetings\".\nMr Sharma left his post as business secretary in January to take over the presidency of COP26 - the United Nations climate change conference due to take place in Glasgow in November.\nSince then, he has met with dignitaries across the globe to discuss climate commitments ahead of the conference - despite the ongoing pandemic. \nAsked by the BBC's Nick Robinson in June how he defended his air travel when he is leading on environmental policy, he said it was \"really important\" to meet other governments to discuss plans and the visits had been \"targeted\".\nBut Mr Drakeford said ministers \"couldn't exempt themselves\" from changes required to tackle climate change.\nHe told BBC News: \"I accept that there are some crucial meetings where being in the same room with other people does bring a new dimension to your ability to make progress. \n\"[But] was that necessary 30 times in the lead up to COP26? That, I think, is a completely different matter.\n\"We need to maximise the way in which we avoid travel, and we avoid adding to the emissions that creates and we need to lead by example, and I am afraid that is not what we are seeing.\"\nThe Green Party's Baroness Jones also said she \"despaired at the inability of Tory ministers to grasp their hypocrisy of talking about our climate emergency then behaving as normal.\"\nBut Conservative Culture Minister, Caroline Dinenage, said Mr Sharma had a \"huge job\" with the upcoming conference and success could \"only be achieved by these really strong collaborative conversations that [he] has been pursuing around the world\". \nAnd Allegra Stratton, the PM's spokeswoman for COP26, said Mr Sharma had travelled to \"meet key players and negotiate success for us all,\" and was doing \"vital work\". \nA government spokesman added: \"Helping the world tackle the climate emergency is an international priority for the government. \n\"Virtual meetings play a large part, however face-to-face meetings are key to success in the climate negotiations the UK is leading as hosts of COP26 and are crucial to understanding first-hand the opportunities and challenges other countries are facing in the fight against climate change.\"\nIt is also understood the government plans to offset the emissions associated with travel by Mr Sharma and other UK officials in the run up to COP26.\nAlok Sharma is not alone in clocking up the air miles. \nUS Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry has made official visits to Bangladesh, Belgium, China, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the UK and the UAE this year.\nFrans Timmermans is the EU executive vice president for the European Green Deal.\nHe seems to have been travelling less, having been in South Korea and Singapore in July, with visits to the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy and the UK earlier in the year. \nMr Sharma is also facing further criticism for not quarantining on his return from the trips, including from red list countries, such as Bangladesh and Turkey. \nUK citizens are advised not to travel to red list countries \"except in the most extreme of circumstances\" - but if they do, they are required by law to quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days at a cost of \u00a32,285 for one adult. \nBreaking this law can result in a fine of up to \u00a310,000. \nHowever, government ministers can claim an exemption from this rule to carry out \"essential government work\". \nOther groups can claim the exemption, including elite sportspeople, certain business executives, diplomats, lorry drivers, and border officials. \nSpeaking to the BBC, the Lib Dem's Ms Jardine said the government was showing \"yet again [that] there is one rule for them and a different rule for the rest of us\".\nShe added: \"Again this government is making up a rule to suit this government and not other people. What about all the families who would love to be in the room for the christening of a grandchild or the wedding of a relative across the world? They would love to be in the room and they are not there. \n\"The rest of us the rest of the time have learned to make use of the electronic facilities that are there, the advances in technology.\n\"This government is losing touch completely with what the actual needs, demands and priorities of the ordinary people in this country are.\" "

Greece has had a week of temperatures above 40C (107 Fahrenheit) and vegetation is bone-dry.\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\nIn Kourkoloi on the island of Evia, resident Ioannis Aslanis told AFP news agency, \"it's a disaster, everything burnt in the village\".\nWildfires are also raging in Albania and Bulgaria, where they began spreading in late July. North Macedonia has declared a state of emergency over its own blazes. \nAnd in south-western Turkey, the heatwave has made local wildfires the most intense on record. Eight people have died and several hundred have been injured, with thousands of residents and tourists forced to flee.\nOn Thursday Turkish firefighters managed to prevent the flames reaching a coal-fired power station at Kemerkoy, in the southern Mugla province. The province, which includes the resort of Marmaris, has seen 55,000 hectares of forest engulfed by flames. \nCritics have accused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government of failing to prepare adequately for such a disaster. They say Turkey's response was too slow and firefighters were under-resourced.\nMr Erdogan described these as Turkey's worst-ever wildfires. He blamed the lack of resources on the Turkish Aeronautical Association, saying it had failed to provide an adequate number of aircraft to tackle the blazes."

      "text": "Young doctors who have witnessed severe Covid illness in patients their own age have urged young Scots to get vaccinated.\nSix medics in their 20s and 30s have written an open letter appealing to young people to take up their jabs and reject misinformation on social media.\nLatest stats show 72.8% of 18-29 year-olds had had a first dose, while it was 81% among people in their 30s.\nNinety-one people aged 20-39 were in hospital last Monday with Covid-19.\nDr Adelina McLeod, a trainee physician in Edinburgh, has put her name to the plea.\nShe told BBC Scotland News: \"We are still seeing patients of all ages admitted with coronavirus and it is particularly difficult when you see peers the same age as you becoming significantly unwell with the virus.\n\"To be honest I feel quite anxious for them. Everybody thinks it is not going to happen to them until it does and that is my experience with people I have treated.\n\"They underestimated how significant this could be.\"\nThe letter begins: \"We would all love the Covid-19 pandemic to be over, but unfortunately, it's not.\"\nIt continues: \"As young medics in our 20s and 30s, we are very concerned to witness this happening to people our age. It all seems so unnecessary.\"\nThey said that the best way out of the pandemic and getting back to normal was through vaccination.\nAnd it addressed concerns over potential side-effects.\n\"There's a lot of misinformation on social media at the moment and that leads to mistrust,\" they wrote. \"But side effects are normally very mild - symptoms like a sore head, a sore arm, or tiredness normally last for just a couple of days.\n\"That's better than the symptoms of Covid-19 itself, or long Covid - which can go on for months and be much worse.\"\nSarah Cooper, 27, has not taken up her offer of the Covid vaccine.\nShe says she is not against the vaccine - it's just \"not for me\".\nShe told BBC Scotland News her grandmother, who has the respiratory disease COPD was gravely ill with Covid, and she understands how severe it can be, but she does not feel it is necessary for her to get it.\nThe mother-of-one from Paisley said: \"If I was older I might have had a different view. I don't get the flu jab every year. I have been lucky enough not to have Covid but other family members have.\n\"My partner and all my family have had the vaccine. But I have given it a lot of thought and feel the government is putting a lot of pressure on getting it and that tends to put me off more.\"\nShe added: \"I don't think there is any amount of evidence or trials that could persuade me and everybody's body reacts differently. It's more my fears of something I could get. And they might never reverse any damage it does to my body.\n\"It's my body and my choice. I just want people to know I have experienced coronavirus, I don't believe I am being selfish. I do believe the vaccination will help people but I just believe it is not right for me.\"\nThe group of doctors, which included GP and surgical trainees, extended their vaccination plea to 16 and 17-year-olds and pregnant women.\nAbout one in 10 pregnant women admitted to hospital with Covid-19 requires intensive care and one in five gives birth prematurely, they said, citing data from the University of Oxford.\nThe letter adds: \"Like many of you, younger medics are tired of the pandemic. But we must keep fighting on.\n\"The quicker that everyone is vaccinated, the quicker we can get back to a normal life; to doing the things that we all love.\"\nThe plea was endorsed by Scottish Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties (SAMRCF) chairman Dr Miles Mack, who said: \"Speaking to medical trainees, it struck me that they are troubled and concerned that very sick people in their age group are being admitted to hospital with Covid-19.\n\"I plead with people to listen to these young medics.\n\"They have been on the front line of the pandemic. They have seen the serious illness that Covid-19 can cause in people of all ages.\n\"Please follow the young medics' advice and get vaccinated as soon as possible.\"\nWe want to hear from young people about their views on vaccination.

If we slow transmission down it will stop it creeping up into more vulnerable groups.\"\nDr Tom Black, chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, said young people \"take a very small risk for a huge benefit\" by getting the vaccine and will not only protect themselves but \"protect others\" too.\nHe said they should \"take the example\" of older generations who have experience of vaccinations helping to prevent the spread of other health concerns.\n\"It's just so important that we keep the pressure on here, we keep persuading and convincing people that they need to get their vaccination,\" he told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster.\nThe regional vaccination centres are:\n\u2022SSE Arena, 2 Queens Quay, Belfast \n\u2022Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast \n\u2022Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Trostan Avenue, Ballymena \n\u2022South Lake Leisure Centre, 1 Lake Road, Craigavon \n\u2022The Foyle Arena, 2 Limavady Road, Londonderry \n\u2022Omagh Leisure Centre, Old Mountfield Road, Omagh \n\u2022Lakeland Forum, Broadmeadow, Enniskillen \nDetails of the latest walk-in clinics are listed here."

Many lower-income residents and tenants pay for their electricity and gas via prepayment meters often online, but possibly by buying credit at shops and post offices.\nIts report. published on Tuesday, suggested families with the oldest prepayment meters faced extra difficulty during the Covid crisis to keep the lights on and to keep homes warm. Some had to go out to shops, when they would have otherwise stayed at home, to pay to top-up meters.\n\"There is clear evidence vulnerable energy customers with older pay-as-you-go meters were put at needless risk during pandemic,\" said Frazer Scott, chief executive of Energy Action Scotland and co-author of the report.\nHe said replacing these meters should be the priority for the smart meter roll-out, as well as capping how much these customers paid.\nThe introduction of smart meters into British households has not been smooth, with concerns raised over missed targets, faulty technology and concerns for some customers switching suppliers.\nHowever, the move has been marketed as an opportunity to make the system more efficient, by ending manual meter readings, and to save customers money.\nRobert Cheesewright, from Smart Energy GB - which promotes the technology, said: \"Getting smart prepayment meters can be life changing for households. We must make sure low-income, vulnerable and prepay customers benefit from smart meters and the roll-out.\"\nThe report comes shortly after advice charity Citizens Advice warned that gas and electricity customers were still being plagued by inaccurate bills from the UK's worst-rated suppliers."

      "text": "The first young people aged 16 and 17 in Northern Ireland have received a vaccination against Covid-19.\nIt is the first part of the UK to give jabs to teenagers in this age group with no underlying health conditions.\nThe move follows a recommendation by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nMore than 180 vaccinations were administered to 16 and 17-year-olds at the SSE arena in Belfast on Friday morning.\nConfirming the number, lead nurse at the regional vaccination centre Pauline Wilson said there was a sense of excitement among young people in line for their jab.\n\"The general feedback is that they're pleased to be here and they're looking forward to things opening up again,\" she said.\n\"It's their turn and they are keen to get their vaccinations.\"\nBethany Holden, 16, was among those to receive the vaccine at the SSE Arena in Belfast on Friday.\nShe said she \"just wanted to get it done really\".\n\"I'm glad to get it done to get back to school, just so I'm more protected and protecting other people as well,\" she added.\nRegional vaccination centres in Northern Ireland are providing a walk-in service for first doses of Pfizer vaccines for those aged 16 and 17.\nFor those who prefer to book, an online booking platform will be available in the coming days.\nThe first vaccination will also be available at pop-up walk-in clinics across Northern Ireland.\nID and proof of date of birth are required when attending either a regional vaccination centre or walk-in vaccination clinic.\nSome examples of ID include exam and birth certificates, school bus passes, work ID and provisional driving licences.\nBBC News NI understands that staff want young people to receive their jab and will be flexible about what type of ID is brought. \nOne dose will provide some protection for young people as they return to school in September. \nHealth authorities are encouraging an early take up so that it is more effective when the new term starts.  \nSignalling the move to extend the vaccination programme, Health Minister Robin Swann welcomed the latest advice.\n\"When formulating advice in relation to childhood immunisations, JCVI has consistently held that the main focus of its decision should be the benefit to children and young people themselves, weighed against any potential harms from vaccination to children and young people,\" he said.\nQueen's University Belfast virologist Connor Bamford said a high vaccine uptake among 16 and 17 year-olds was key to making \"the winter safer for all of us\".\n\"Upwards of 80% is what we would like, that is realistic,\" he told BBC Radio Foyle.\n\"For their own health it is very good for them to get the vaccine, it is certainly safer than getting Covid.\n\"And on the other hand it will help stop and slow down transmission, particularly for that older group who are socialising more. If we slow transmission down it will stop it creeping up into more vulnerable groups.\"\nDr Tom Black, chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, said young people \"take a very small risk for a huge benefit\" by getting the vaccine and will not only protect themselves but \"protect others\" too.\nHe said they should \"take the example\" of older generations who have experience of vaccinations helping to prevent the spread of other health concerns.\n\"It's just so important that we keep the pressure on here, we keep persuading and convincing people that they need to get their vaccination,\" he told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster.\nThe regional vaccination centres are:\n\u2022SSE Arena, 2 Queens Quay, Belfast \n\u2022Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast \n\u2022Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Trostan Avenue, Ballymena \n\u2022South Lake Leisure Centre, 1 Lake Road, Craigavon \n\u2022The Foyle Arena, 2 Limavady Road, Londonderry \n\u2022Omagh Leisure Centre, Old Mountfield Road, Omagh \n\u2022Lakeland Forum, Broadmeadow, Enniskillen \nDetails of the latest walk-in clinics are listed here."

      "tags": "Electricity pricing,Companies,Resolution Foundation,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Universal Credit",
      "text": "Energy prices will rise for millions of people across the UK in October, right at the start of the cold weather.\nRegulator Ofgem said the price cap for default domestic energy deals would be raised to cover suppliers' extra costs.\nThe typical gas and electricity customer is likely to see their bill go up by \u00a3139 to \u00a31,277 a year. \nCharities warned the timing would hit struggling families hard, who already face losing an extra \u00a320 a week from Universal Credit in October.\nPrepayment customers will see an increase of \u00a3153, from \u00a31,156 to \u00a31309, the regulator said.\nOfgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley told the BBC: \"The reason the price cap is going up is there has been a record increase in energy prices across the board, not just in gas and electricity but in petrol and diesel.\"\nHe urged customers to shop around for the best tariffs, saying there were big savings to be made by switching. \n\"You don't have to live with this tariff. The price cap is a backstop. We'd encourage any customer, particularly those struggling to pay their bills, to contact their supplier, and get access to a wide-range of help and support,\" he said.\n\"This is a devastating increase,\" said Peter Smith, director of policy and advocacy at fuel poverty charity National Energy Action.\n\"Millions of household budgets are already stretched to the limit and this massive increase could not be coming at a worse time.\"\nOfgem said rising wholesale costs were behind the increase, adding that the existence of the price cap meant households would save between \u00a375-\u00a3100 a year.\nThe watchdog also pointed out energy users could switch to a better deal to save up to \u00a3200.\nHowever, the Resolution Foundation says policymakers need to do more to help families who are close to the poverty line.\nJonathan Marshall, senior economist, said the government must focus on widening the current warm homes discount scheme, as well as reversing the planned removal of the \u00a320 Universal Credit uplift. There should also be more targeted support for families at risk of falling into fuel poverty.\n\"A rise in in energy prices will disproportionately impact those who are already struggling,\" said Mr Marshall. \nThe price cap, set twice a year by the regulator, affects 11 million households in England, Wales and Scotland who have never switched suppliers or whose discounted deals have expired. Northern Ireland sets its own cap.\nThat accounts for about half of all UK households. The remainder are on so-called fixed deals, which will not be affected.\nAround four million prepayment meter customers will also be affected.\nThe cap sets the prices that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, but that does not mean there is a limit to how much people can pay. \nThe more gas and electricity you use, the higher the bill.\n\"Finding an extra \u00a320 a month for energy bills will leave me with a stark choice of paying for either food or fuel,\" says Anthony Lyman of Northampton. \nThe 35-year-old autistic single father of two adds: \"We may have to have a cold house to have a full belly.\" \nAnthony lost his job at a special needs school through ill-health at the start of the pandemic and has since been relying on Universal Credit and help with managing his finances from debt charity Christians Against Poverty, as well as being forced to turn to food banks. \n\"We've been relying on the Universal Credit uplift money to get by but the prospect of losing that \u00a320 a week in October and having to pay more for gas and electricity will leave me on a financial knife-edge.\" \nThe energy industry has said there's plenty of help for vulnerable people like Anthony but he says in practice it's almost impossible to get it. \n\"We haven't been able to get in touch with anybody from our suppliers during the pandemic. You can only seem to talk to a computer and it's very difficult to tell a computer I'm struggling.\" \nHow will a rise in energy prices affect you? haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch in the following ways:\nDomestic energy bills are linked to wholesale prices, the price at which energy businesses have to pay for gas and electricity.\nWholesale prices have risen after gas prices soared to a record high as many economies recovered strongly from the Covid-19 crisis, prompting a surge in demand for energy.\nWhen wholesale prices fell last summer following the first lockdown, Ofgem reduced the level of the cap by \u00a384 for last winter.\nBut in February it increased the cap by \u00a396 as wholesale costs rose. \nSince then the wholesale cost of energy - which account for 40% of domestic bills - has climbed by more than 50%, which has led to the latest increase.\nEDF, one of the UK's biggest energy providers, said the \"unprecedented rate\" at which wholesale prices were rising meant that customers would \"at some point see the impact of this global trend\". \nA spokesman said: \"We know this will be worrying news for customers of all suppliers - we will be directing financial assistance to those most in need through a \u00a31.9m support fund, helping customers reduce their bills, manage their debt and even helping with costs for things like more energy efficient white goods.\"\nThe industry's trade body, Energy UK, said people worried about their bills should \"pick up the phone and talk to your supplier\".\nChief executive Emma Pinchbeck told the BBC's Today radio programme: \"There's help and assistance available, particularly for those that are vulnerable and fuel poor.\" She also urged people to consider switching supplier, calling it a \"straightforward\" process. \nThe government also advised people to shop around for the cheapest tariffs, adding that it had simplified the process.\nA spokesperson for the Business Department said: \"To help consumers further, we plan to trial automatic switching for customers on expensive default tariffs to cheaper deals, and are extending the Warm Home Discount so an extra 750,000 households get \u00a3150 knocked off their bill each year.\"\nWhen the energy price cap was introduced three years ago, it was hailed as a shield for customers against unscrupulous energy companies charging sky-high prices. \nBut this October, the cap will rise to its highest ever level, so is it working?\nThe cap applies to a company's default tariff, impacting people who never or rarely change their deal, and also those on pre-payment meters who often have less choice. \nWhile it restricted expensive prices at some companies, there have been accusations that the cap gave other firms an excuse to raise their prices up to same level as the cap. \nWhen fixing the cap point, the regulator says it must consider the wholesale price of gas and electricity so that companies can still make a profit. That's what they describe as setting a fair price.\nThe result is that we've seen more standardised pricing across energy companies at those top rates, but not necessarily a market that's cheaper for most customers. \nWith many people continuing to work from home through the autumn and winter months, and other budgets already being stretched with reductions to Universal Credit, this big jump in utility bills will be an unwelcome extra pressure. \nEnergy users on variable tariffs could move to a different cheaper deal with their existing supplier or switch to another one to save up to hundreds of pounds.\nSwitching online is relatively simple: just use an energy comparison site and all you'll need is your postcode, the name of your current supplier, and the name of your current tariff.\nBut some vulnerable people may not be able to switch, warns National Energy Action.\n\"For some customers, switching is impossible due to levels of debt, or because pre-pay customers have far fewer options to switch supplier or tariff,\" added Mr Smith.\nThe charity has called on Ofgem to provide deeper protection for the most vulnerable customers. \n\"The UK government can also directly help reduce energy arrears as well as maintaining investment to reduce needless energy waste in our homes,\" he said.\nEnergy users can save hundreds by switching to a lower-priced fixed deal.\nAll suppliers have fixed-rate deals, so the simplest way to save is to contact your existing supplier and ask to be moved to its lowest-priced fixed deal.\nBut you could probably save more by switching to a rival, Ofgem says.\nIt's simple to switch using an energy comparison site - all you'll need is your postcode, the name of your current supplier, and the name of your current tariff.\nCitizens Advice has a useful guide to choosing the right tariff. Ofgem also sets out the steps you should take to switch energy supplier and shop for a better deal. "

      "text": "Job starting salaries are rising at record rates due to shortages in candidates, according to KPMG.\nRising demand for staff to fill vacancies resulted in the sharpest salary inflation rate in almost 24 years of data collection, its jobs survey found.\nHowever, ongoing uncertainty over job security concerns caused a \"severe drop\" in candidates in July, it said.\nCandidate numbers fell at the second-fastest rate in the survey's history.\nThe lack of available candidates continued to decline rapidly in July, driven by \"concerns over job security due to the pandemic, a lack of European workers due to Brexit, and a generally low unemployment rate\", the report by KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said.\nThe BBC has approached the Home Office for comment.\nClaire Warnes, partner and head of education, skills and productivity at KPMG UK, said job seekers should be \"taking advantage\" of the bounce in salaries for new recruits.\nCompanies were wanting to invest in their businesses now coronavirus restrictions had been eased but demand for new staff outstripped supply, she added.\n\"We know that reskilling and upskilling is needed to help people move between sectors, and there's no doubt the 'pingdemic' has added an extra dimension to the recruitment challenge,\" said Ms Warnes.\n\"Plus, with furlough due to end soon, there may be a downward pressure on pay to come.\"\nKate Shoesmith, deputy chief executive of the REC, said the data confirmed that it was now a \"good time to be looking for a new job\".\n\"Employers are desperate to find good candidates for the many jobs on offer and this is reflected in starting salaries rising at the sharpest rate since the survey began in 1997,\" she said.\n\"This will likely motivate more people to be on the lookout for new opportunities. The same goes for those on temporary contracts which are also seeing increased pay.\"\nSeveral industries, including the hospitality and haulage sectors, are experiencing chronic shortages in workers.\nSome of the many skilled jobs in short supply include chefs, software engineers, technicians and carers.\nThe report found latest vacancy data indicated faster increases in demand for both permanent and temporary workers in July. \nThe report said the removal of Covid restrictions had led to a \"sharp increase\" in the number of people employed into permanent job roles, while the upturn in temporary vacancies was the steepest since November 1997. \nJuly survey data signalled an upturn in demand for temporary workers as well. So-called \"blue collar\" workers remained at the top of the rankings, followed closely by hotel and catering staff. \nJobs in IT and computing, hotel and catering and engineering were in high demand for permanent roles, while retail vacancies were the least in demand.\nIn the private sector, demand for permanent staff expanded at a slightly quicker pace than for temporary workers. In contrast, short-term vacancies rose more quickly than permanent roles in the public sector.\nHowever, Ms Shoesmith warned pay increases alone won't meet the demand built up over recent months.\n\"We need an immigration system that flexes to meet demand as was promised, and business and government need a long-term plan for skilling up workers,\" she said.\n\"Skills shortages have been with us for a while and as our data shows are getting worse.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nFrom next month, UK music festivals and other live events are to be protected by a \u00a3750m government-backed insurance scheme if they cannot legally go ahead because of Covid restrictions. It's been broadly welcomed by the industry, although some organisations warn the scheme doesn't cover events that would become uneconomical in the event of capacity being reduced due to social distancing coming back into force or star performers cancelling appearances.  \nRules on the number of people that can meet indoors in Wales are to be lifted from Saturday, when nightclubs will be allowed to reopen and laws around social distancing in workplaces will be lifted. However, First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned against a \"free for all\", and says face coverings must still be worn in shops, in health and social care settings, and on public transport.\nWith the pandemic forcing the cancellation of the usual A-level exams for a second year, and teachers submitting recommendations for grades, analysis suggests there could again be high levels of top grades. There are warnings of a resultant \"crush for places\" at universities, in the annual pre-results report of the University of Buckingham's Prof Alan Smithers. With applications to medicine and dentistry courses said to be up 20%, the government is promising more places.\nA confidential sexual harassment reporting line is to be introduced for female guests in quarantine hotels after another woman reported being harassed by a male security guard. The government tried to tackle the problem by saying female guests should be supervised by women - but some in quarantine say they rarely see female guards.\nThe pandemic has been tough for all businesses but perhaps for those in live events more than most. But could one festival, at least, be in for a Covid bounce? The organisers of the Weston-super-Mare Shanty and Folk Festival - delayed from last year - say the lockdown craze for sea shanties has created additional interest.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The blanket self-isolation of whole classes following a positive Covid test will no longer be \"routine\", First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. \nShe told MSPs children identified as close contacts would not have to isolate if they tested negative. \nHowever, teachers and secondary school pupils will still be asked to wear face coverings in classrooms for the first six weeks of the new term.\nThe policy on wearing masks in school buildings will be kept under review. \nMs Sturgeon said she was \"acutely aware\" that many young people found the mask policy difficult but she said experts considered it an \"important protection\" for people in schools. \nThe announcement was welcomed by unions but one parents' group said it was \"unacceptable\" that children would have to wear face coverings \"considerably longer than almost any adult doing any job\". \nMost children returning to school later this month will not have been vaccinated, as only those who are aged 12 and over and at higher risk of falling ill from Covid are being offered the vaccine. \nHowever, Ms Sturgeon said she was hoping updated advice from the UK's vaccine advisory group over the \"next day or so\" would recommend \"going further\" on the vaccination of young people. \nShe said she was \"particularly concerned\" to get 16 and 17-year-olds vaccinated. \nIn her update to a virtual Scottish Parliament, the first minister said carbon dioxide monitors - which asses how well-ventilated a space is - will also be required in schools and childcare settings. \nAnd all school staff and secondary school pupils will be asked to take a lateral flow test one or two days before they return to school for the new term. They should then take them twice a week.\nSchool restrictions are now tougher than those for the rest of society.\nSecondary pupils have to wear a mask at all times and one metre distancing remains between adult staff.\nTeachers were given a guarantee that no rules would change on day one but these current restrictions look set to remain for at least six weeks.\nIt shows a nervousness from the government about large groups of unvaccinated teenagers mixing when term starts -  as early as next week for some.\nThe return of schools last August saw the beginning of an upward trend of cases. Ministers are hoping that holding their nerve now, keeping strict rules for pupils, will prevent history repeating.\nMs Sturgeon told the parliament that anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 would still be required to self-isolate but the rules around close contacts would change. \nPeople aged 17 or over should get a PCR test and if it is negative there will be no requirement to self-isolate. \nThe same policy will apply to children aged between five and 17, while children aged under five will be \"encouraged but not required\" to take the test. \n\"This means that the blanket isolation of whole classes will no longer be routine,\" Ms Sturgeon said. \n\"Instead a more targeted approach will identify close contacts at highest risk of infection.\n\"So fewer young people will have to self-isolate, and most will be asked to self-isolate for a much shorter period of time.\"\nIt come after thousands of pupils had to isolate in the summer term - at one point in June there were more than 24,000 in self-isolation, only slightly lower than a peak of almost 30,000 last autumn. \nMs Sturgeon said the new approach to self-isolation was important to minimise disruption to children's education. \nBut she said that the government's education advisory group has advised that other measures to mitigate the spread of Covid in schools were retained. \nAs well as wearing face coverings, staff will be asked to keep at least one metre from each other and from children while on the school estate. \nMs Sturgeon said: \"The last year and a half has been difficult and stressful for children and young people, parents, and staff working in education settings. I am grateful to them for the understanding and cooperation shown. \n\"The new school and academic year will still have challenges - but I hope it will bring fewer disruptions, and allow a much more normal learning environment.\"\nParents' group UFT Scotland said it was grateful for the change to isolation measures, but criticised the decision on face coverings. \n\"While nightclubs reopen and football fans flock in their thousands to stadiums across the country, kids will still have to stew in masks all day,\" organiser Jo Bisset said. \n\"This means children will be forced to wear coverings for considerably longer than almost any adult doing any job - that's unacceptable.\"\nMeanwhile the EIS union welcomed the decision to broadly retain the same mitigations in school, as at the end of last term. \nIt said the voluntary vaccination of 12-17-year-olds \"would be sensible and may go some way towards making schools safer places and help to address the anxieties of some people\"."

      "tags": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,UK climate change protests,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "UN researchers are set to publish their strongest statement yet on the science of climate change. \nThe report will likely detail significant changes to the world's oceans, ice caps and land in the coming decades. \nDue out on Monday, the report has been compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nIt will be their first global assessment on the science of global heating since 2013. \nIt is expected the forthcoming Summary for Policymakers will be a key document for global leaders when they meet in November.\nThe politicians are due to gather for a climate summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow.\nAfter two weeks of virtual negotiations between scientists and representatives of 195 governments, the IPCC will launch the first part of a three-pronged assessment of the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change.\nIt is the presence of these government officials that makes the IPCC different from other science bodies. After the report has been approved in agreement with governments, they effectively take ownership of it. \nOn Monday, a short, 40-page Summary for Policymakers will be released dealing with the physical science. \nIt may be brief, but the new report is expected to pack a punch.\n\"We've seen over a couple of months, and years actually, how climate change is unfolding; it's really staring us in the face,\" said Dr Heleen de Coninck, from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, who is a coordinating lead author for the IPCC Working Group III.  \n\"It's really showing what the impacts will be, and this is just the start. So I think what this report will add is a big update of the state of the science, what temperature increase are we looking at - and what are the physical impacts of that?\" \nAccording to many observers, there have been significant improvements in the science in the last few years.\n\"Our models have gotten better, we have a better understanding of the physics and the chemistry and the biology, and so they're able to simulate and project future temperature changes and precipitation changes much better than they were,\" said Dr Stephen Cornelius from WWF, an observer at IPCC meetings.\n\"Another change has been that attribution sciences have increased vastly in the last few years. We can make greater links between climate change and extreme weather events.\" \nAs well as updates on temperature projections, there will likely be a strong focus on the question of humanity's role in creating the climate crisis. \nIn the last report in 2013, the IPCC said that humans were the \"dominant cause\" of global warming since the 1950s.\nIt's expected that this time the IPCC will also outline just how much of an influence humans are having on the oceans, the atmosphere and other aspects of our planetary systems.  \nOne of the most important questions concerns sea-level rise. This has long been a controversial issue for the IPCC, with their previous projections scorned by some scientists as far too conservative.\n\"In the past they have been so reluctant to give a plausible upper limit on sea-level rise, and we hope that they finally come around this time,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, from UCL in London.\nAs the world has experienced a series of devastating fires and floods in recent months that have been linked to climate change, the report will also include a new chapter linking extreme weather events to rising temperatures.  \nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a UN body set up in 1988 to assess the science around climate change.\nThe IPCC provides governments with scientific information they can use to develop policies on global heating.\nThe first of its comprehensive Assessment Reports on climate change was released in 1992. The sixth in this series will be split into four volumes, the first of which - covering the physical science behind climate change - will be published on Monday.\nMany have welcomed this development.\n\"I remain hopeful that the scientific evidence will show the stark reality of a world already altered by our rapidly changing climate and will motivate all nations to deliver urgent emission reductions and the necessary amount of climate finance at COP26,\" said Mohammed Adjei Sowah, who is the mayor of Accra in Ghana and vice chair of the C40 group of cities.\n\"We only need to look out of our windows to see that the climate crisis is already here. Cities such as Accra and nations such as Ghana, which have contributed the least to greenhouse gas emissions, will experience many of the greatest impacts.\"\nOne of the things that gives the report additional muscle is the fact that it is not just one particular research paper on one topic - the reviewers consider all the research carried out on each area of focus. \n\"Sometimes the IPCC gets criticised for being focused on consensus, and it's suggested that this can weaken statements,\" said Dr Emily Shuckburgh, from the University of Cambridge.\n\"But the fact that it is a summary across multiple lines of evidence is incredibly powerful and incredibly useful.\"\nOne key question in the new summary will be about the 1.5C temperature target. The climate summit held in the French capital, Paris, in 2015, committed nations to try to limit the rise in global temperature from pre-industrial times to no more than 1.5 degrees. \nAnd in 2018, the IPCC released a special report on keeping to this target.\nWhat do world leaders need to agree to stop climate change?\n\"That report showed very clearly was that there are clear, clear benefits to limiting warming to 1.5C and those benefits have only become clearer over the past three years,\" said Dr de Coninck, who was one of the key authors of that study.\n\"If this report says something about that temperature limit in relation to emissions and how they are developing, it will have a political influence on COP26 I think.\"\nWith just a few months to go until world leaders meet in Glasgow for the climate conference that is seen as the most important since the Paris agreement came into being in 2015, this new report will be required reading for all attendees.\n\"I think it's going to be a wake-up call, there's no doubt about that,\" said Richard Black, an honorary research fellow at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London.\n\"But then again, so are some of the real world events that we're seeing around us at the moment.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "text": "London's Pride parade has been cancelled for a second year due to coronavirus restrictions.\nThe UK's biggest LGBT pride festival usually takes place in the capital every summer, although it was not staged last year due to the pandemic.\nOrganisers said this year's event was not possible under current guidelines.\nBut Culture Minister Caroline Dinenage said there \"shouldn't be any reason now that live events shouldn't be able to go ahead\".\nExplaining the decision, executive director of Pride in London Chris Joell-Deshields said the \"crucial parade\" could not take place, which would have meant \"reducing the event to two or three stages scattered across London with limited tickets\".\n\"This goes against everything we want Pride to be, and everything we've done before,\" he said, adding that: \"No parade, no protest, means no Pride.\"\nHowever, when asked about the cancellation Ms Dinenage said there \"shouldn't be any reason\" that live events were not taking place.\n\"We know that so many [outdoor events] have already - things like Latitude and Tramlines - have already happened. \n\"There are a whole range of events that are going ahead this summer,\" she said.\nEleanor Lawrie, BBC LGBT producer\nNews of London Pride's second cancellation will come as a blow to many in the LGBT community.\nPride gives the chance not just to come together, but also to represent and to protest for hard-fought rights. For some it may also be their first chance to publicly celebrate their sexuality.\nFor one day a year, streets in central London are shut down for the Pride parade, with tens of thousands marching, celebrating, protesting, raising awareness and taking up space in front of over a million spectators. It doesn't get much more high profile than that.\nBut to go ahead with the London event in a way that complied with government Covid guidelines would have meant reducing the event to just a couple of stages, limiting tickets and - crucially - losing the parade, something the organisers said they were not prepared to do.\nThe announcement follows the axing of most in-person Pride events in Brighton, which were due to take place this weekend, and many other Pride events in the UK and around the world.\nManchester Pride has had to cancel its main parade, but - as it stands - is set to hold a two-day live music event over the August Bank Holiday.\nMore than 100 Pride events were cancelled or postponed last year.\nThe London parade usually attracts huge crowds, with organisers estimating the 2019 parade was attended by more than 1.5 million people.\nReacting to the cancellation, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: \"It is a real shame that for the second year in a row we will not be able to join together on the streets of London for Pride.\n\"But although our city continues to open up, we must still be cautious about the spread of Covid-19 and it is understandable why the Pride in London committee have made this decision. \n\"I truly hope that next year we will be able to unite on our streets once again in solidarity and celebration.\"\nDrag Race UK contestant Bimini Bon Boulash, tweeted about the cancellation, promising \"we'll go even bigger next year\", while Rachel Cunliffe, deputy editor of the New Statesman newspaper, called the cancellations \"so sad\".\n\"It's an outdoor parade. If the Euros can happen, why not Pride?,\" she tweeted.\nNext year will be 50 years since the first Pride parade in London and organisers have called on the government to \"declare 2022 as the year of queer\".\n\"Tomorrow we start planning our return to the streets of London for 2022, with out most inclusive and queerest event yet,\" Mr Joell-Deshields said."

      "text": "A mother who left her daughter alone to starve to death as she partied for six days has been jailed.\nVerphy Kudi admitted the manslaughter of 20-month-old Asiah Kudi, who was left at her Brighton flat as she celebrated her 18th birthday in December 2019.\nShe travelled to London and Coventry, and had acted like a \"carefree teenager\", Lewes Crown Court was told.\nKudi, 19, of no fixed address, has been jailed for nine years.\nJudge Christine Laing QC told Kudi that Asiah \"was a helpless child\" who \"relied completely on you as her mother to provide for her needs\".\nShe said: \"It is almost unbearable to contemplate her suffering in the final days of her life, suffering that she endured so that you could celebrate your birthday and the birthdays of your friends as a carefree teenager.\"\nProsecutor Sally Howes QC told the court CCTV covering Kudi's home showed she had left Asiah alone in the flat for five days, 21 hours and 58 minutes.\nKudi left Brighton on 5 December and went to London, where she spent her birthday with her boyfriend.\nTwo days later she attended a concert in Elephant and Castle, south-east London, where she had the DJ announce her birthday, the court was told.\nOn 9 December she moved on to a birthday party in Coventry - 150 miles from Brighton - before returning to London the next day and then home on 11 December, the court heard.\nWhen she returned home, Kudi called 999 and told paramedics her baby wasn't waking up.\nAt just after 18:20 GMT an ambulance crew found Kudi \"incoherent, distressed and distraught\", the court was told. \nThe paramedics discovered Asiah was not breathing, and rushed her to the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital, where she was pronounced dead soon after arrival, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. \nA post-mortem examination concluded the cause of death was starvation and influenza, with reported signs of dehydration and severe nappy rash, the CPS added. \nLibby Clark, of CPS South East, said: \"Asiah's mother Verphy Kudi had a duty to keep her safe from harm, but instead selfishly chose to put her own need to party and be with her friends above all else.\n\"The consequences of her decision meant that Asiah must have suffered dreadfully during the days and nights that she was alone in the flat.\n\"This follows a history of multiple earlier occasions of abandonment and neglect.\"\nWhen Kudi was first interviewed by police she claimed she had been with her child at the flat all the time, except for one visit she made with her to London.\nBut officers found the CCTV footage, and also discovered phone footage taken during her time away from home.\nIn a statement, Asiah and Verphy's family said: \"We are saddened by the current situation and as a family we have many unanswered questions. \n\"Verphy has experienced so much at such a young age and we have always done what we can to support her.\"\nThe statement said the family was \"in the midst of an unbearable tragedy\".\nIt added: \"Not only are we coming to terms with what has happened today but we are also still grieving for our beloved Asiah.\"\nBrighton & Hove Safeguarding Children Partnership said in a statement: \"We are currently working with our partners to look into what happened and are conducting a child safeguarding practice review.\" \nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "text": "University clearing may be more competitive for some students this year, the boss of the admissions service Ucas has said.\nClare Marchant suggested it would still be a \"good year for clearing\", and predicted a record number of applicants would get places that way.\nBut she added: \"Are there going to be hotspots potentially where it is much more competitive? Absolutely.\"\nStudents will get their A-level, BTec and Scottish Higher results on Tuesday.\nExams were cancelled again this year because of the pandemic, and grades have been decided by teachers' estimates.\nClearing is how universities fill spare places, and students apply for a course through clearing after they have their results. It is often used by students who either got different grades than they expected, or if they have changed their mind about a course.\nMs Marchant, who is the chief executive of Ucas, urged students using clearing to make a decision about courses \"in a matter of days\" rather than waiting weeks. \n\"At the most selective institutions at the most selective courses it is likely to be a bit more competitive because there might be slightly reduced courses in clearing, albeit there will still be thousands,\" she said.\nThere have been predictions that this year could be a record year for top results like A* and A, as grades are decided not by exams but by teachers who consider students' coursework, mock exams and essays.\nAnd if more pupils receive high grades, some have suggested there could be a crush for places at the most sought-after universities and courses.\n\"I think it would be disingenuous of me not to point out that for those most selective courses at the most selective institutions it is likely to be more competitive,\" said Ms Marchant.\n\"There will be thousands of courses from higher tariff institutions in clearing, but they are likely to be slightly down on previous years.\"\nHigher tariff institutions are those considered the most selective as they traditionally require higher exam grades.\nMs Marchant also mentioned medicine courses, which have been so oversubscribed that the University of Exeter has encouraged students to delay by offering \u00a310,000.\n\"Certainly medicine is one of those most competitive courses and it's capped as well and so at the most selective institutions I imagine that is going to be increasingly competitive,\" she said.\nBut she said she still believed there could be a record number of clearing places taken - 90,000 - compared to 83,000 last year. \nEarlier this week, Ms Marchant told the BBC that there will be a huge spike in demand for university places over the next four years.\nHowever a survey of current students found that only about a quarter felt they got good value for money from university over the past year. Many thought their fees and living costs were not justified by the disrupted teaching during the pandemic.\nWhat questions do you have about this year's results?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Householders in the UK will find out in the next few weeks how much their gas bills are likely to increase in the coming year.\nThe energy regulator is due to announce the new energy price cap - the maximum amount that suppliers can charge in Great Britain.\nIt's expected to rise steeply, because global wholesale prices have gone up so much.\nEvery six months, Ofgem, the energy regulator, reviews the maximum price that suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThis is called the energy price cap. \nAbout 15 million households saw their energy bills increase by 12% when it was last updated in October. \nThe next review is due at the beginning of February, and the new cap will come into effect in April. Industry predictions suggest gas prices could go up by as much as 50%.\nThere is a separate energy market in Northern Ireland, with two gas suppliers, and prices have risen sharply for consumers there too.\nThere's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies over the past year.\nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. At the end of December, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about \u00a32,000 next year.\nReasons for the increase include:\nThere are a number of technical and geopolitical issues at play as well, which mean many countries across Europe are grappling with the same problems.\nHowever, the UK is hit relatively hard-hit because it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas. Around 85% of homes have gas central heating, and it also generates a third of the country's electricity. \nStorage capacity in the UK is also lower than in some other European countries.\nSince wholesale gas prices started to spike, more than 20 retail energy suppliers have collapsed in the UK. \nThis is largely because the energy price cap prevented retailers from passing on higher wholesale prices to their customers.\nSeveral smaller companies, with fewer reserves, could not weather this.\nFailed firms include Bulb Energy, with 1.7 million customers. Because of its size, it was put into \"special administration\", and is now run by the government, through Ofgem.\nNearly four million customers have been affected. Many households saw their energy prices rise when their supplier went bust, and they were switched over to a more expensive deal with another supplier.\nThe government faces calls from energy companies, the opposition, and even some of its own MPs, to do more to prevent prices from rising too much.\nSuggestions include:\nIn the past, consumers have been encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise.\nBut at the moment better offers - including fixed deals - are simply not available.\nPeople already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, householders are being encouraged to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.\nThe Energy Saving Trust says that simple changes to our homes and habits could offset the current price rises.\nMany companies face a considerable rise in their bills. That could mean they have to: \nEnergy-intensive industries are particularly exposed, but the problem affects every company that has to pay energy bills - even if it is just to heat an office or shop."

      "text": "Police forces have been given new guidance on dealing with crime victims following the suicides of twin sisters.\nSam and Chris Gould, from Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, took their own lives aged 16 and 17 having both said they were abused from the age of five.\nAt their inquests a coroner raised concerns about national police guidance after he heard about the investigation into the alleged abuse.\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said it had identified a \"gap\".\nTheir mother Jane Cannon said: \"The gap was that once the girls had been initially reluctant to give evidence, nobody checked back with them; nobody said 'Are you ready to try and get justice now?'\"\nHowever, she was pleased to see the NPCC had identified the same issue as the coroner and had dealt with it.\nShe added the police guidance that alleged victims of sexual abuse must not discuss it with anyone else, including therapists, still stood, \"whether that's the best thing for the victim and the victim's family\".\n\"Their [the police's] consideration [is] 'Is there anything that could jeopardise a prosecution?' and we can understand that because the burden of proof for child abuse cases is so ridiculously high,\" she said.\nA College of Policing spokesman said: \"Support from family, friends, professional or therapeutic/counselling services is very much encouraged in our advice for forces.\"\nIn May 2016, aged 14, Chris disclosed she and Sam had been sexually abused into their teenage years, and named their alleged abuser.\nHampshire Police investigated the case but, at the time the girls were struggling with their mental health and did not wish to give video evidence.\nOfficers closed the case in late 2016, having never interviewed the alleged abuser.\nSam died in 2018, while Chris took her own life four months later.\nAfter their deaths Ms Cannon told the BBC: \"Every single professional that dealt with the girls said the same - their death was caused by their [mental health] illness and their illness was caused by the sexual abuse.\"\nThe parents added Chris and Sam felt \"invalidated and not believed\" after police dropped the investigation.\nIn June, the force said it had closed the case because there was insufficient evidence to provide any realistic prospect of conviction, and that its decision \"took account of the wishes of the victims and the wider concerns of the family at the time\".\nBut it said it had since changed the way it handled such cases.\nFollowing their inquests, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough assistant coroner Nicholas Moss QC raised concerns that there had been \"no follow-up\" by police to Sam and Chris while they were still alive, to keep open the option of providing an account at a later stage, to be used as evidence.\nHe also said there was no guidance on what should be communicated to alleged child sex abuse victims \"both suffering from mental-ill health and initially unwilling to provide an evidential account\".\nIn response, Merseyside Police's Deputy Chief Constable Ian Critchley, the NPCC lead for child protection, abuse and investigation, agreed it was \"evident that the inquests have identified a gap\" in national guidance - the College of Policing's Authorised Professional Practice (APP) - that applied to all UK forces. \nHe said there had been an \"immediate addition\" to the APP, focused on victims and witnesses reluctant to attend an interview or provide a statement.\nThe guidance states investigators \"should sensitively try to establish why they are reluctant and, where possible, take steps to mitigate these reasons and provide reassurance\".\nIt also states that victims and witnesses should be offered the opportunity to reconsider their decision \"where appropriate\".\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
