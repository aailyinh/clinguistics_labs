      "text": "G Gordon Liddy, one of the masterminds of the Watergate burglary who became a radio show host after his release from prison, has died at the age of 90.\nHis son, Thomas Liddy, confirmed his father's death and said only that it was not Covid-19-related, US media say.\nLiddy remained unapologetic for his part in the plan to bug the Democrats' HQ at the Watergate building during the Republicans' 1972 re-election campaign.\nThe scandal led to the resignation of then President Richard Nixon.\nBorn George Gordon Battle Liddy in New Jersey in 1930, he is said to have been a frail boy who was inspired by the rousing radio speeches of Adolf Hitler that residents in his German American neighbourhood were listening to at the time.\n\"If an entire nation could be changed, lifted out of weakness to extraordinary strength, so could one person,\" he wrote in his autobiography Will, recalling how he roasted and ate a rat at the age of 11 in order to overcome his fear of rodents.\nHaving served in the army and graduated from law school, Liddy joined the FBI and eventually moved to the White House to help with Richard Nixon's re-election campaign. \nSome of the extreme ideas he, and colleague Howard Hunt, a former CIA officer, came up with - from plotting to kill Nixon critics to kidnapping anti-war protesters - never got the go-ahead, but their plan to bug the Democratic National Committee offices did.\nBut the botched burglary, cover-up, and subsequent investigation snowballed into one of America's biggest political scandal.\nLiddy, Hunt and five others were arrested and faced charges of conspiracy, burglary and illegal wiretapping. Liddy was the only one who refused to cooperate with the prosecution. He was sentenced to 20 years and served nearly five years before his sentence was commuted in 1977 by Democratic President Jimmy Carter.\nYears later, Liddy said: \"I'd do it again for my president.\" He drove a Rolls Royce with the numberplate H20GATE.\nAfter his release from prison, he started a security firm, wrote best-selling books and became a popular and provocative conservative talk show host."

      "text": "Google Maps will start directing drivers to routes it calculates to be the most eco-friendly based on a list of factors.\nThe search engine said it will highlight journeys that generate the lowest carbon footprint using mainly traffic data and road inclines.\nGoogle said the feature would launch first in the US later this year \"with a global expansion on the way\".\nThe new feature is part of its commitment to fight climate change.\nWhen launched, the default route on the Google Maps app will be the \"eco-friendly\" option, unless users choose to opt out of it.\nWhen alternative routes are significantly faster, Google will offer choices and let users compare estimated emissions.\n\"What we are seeing is for around half of routes, we are able to find an option more eco-friendly with minimal or no time-cost trade-off,\" Russell Dicker, a director of product at Google said.\nThe search engine, owned by Alphabet, said it uses emissions data based on testing across different types of cars and road types, drawing on insights from the US government's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). \nIts road data factors in slopes and inclines from its own Street View cars feature along with aerial and satellite imagery.\n\"This is a great example of three trends coming together - the data, sustainability and consumer choice,\" said Siddharth Pathak, a partner at consultancy firm Kearney.\n\"It will also push those on the fence to make a deliberate choice of speed over sustainability and often cost.\"\nFrom June, Google will start warning drivers about to travel through low emissions zones where some vehicles are restricted. These are common in countries such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK.\n\"From Amsterdam to Jakarta, cities around the world have established low emission zones - areas that restrict polluting vehicles like certain diesel cars or cars with specific emissions stickers to help keep the air clean,\" Google said in a blog post.\n\"To support these efforts, we're working on alerts to help drivers better understand when they'll be navigating through one of these zones.\"\nGoogle Maps users will be also able to compare car, cycling, public transport and other travel options in one place instead of toggling between different sections in a new feature being launched this year.\nThe US tech giant says it has long developed sustainable practices to benefit the environment, and has pledging to be carbon-free by 2030 to helping cities track greenhouse gas emissions.

      "tags": "Policing,Black Lives Matter,Social mobility,Immigration,BAME communities,Racism,Race and ethnicity",
      "text": "When the death of George Floyd in the US inspired protests about racial injustice across the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson set up the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities to examine inequality in the UK.\nNow its 258-page report covering health, education, criminal justice and employment has been published. But what does it say?\nThe commission acknowledges that it was established as a response to the Black Lives Matter movement and the upsurge of concern about race issues it inspired. It says it owes the mainly young people behind the movement a \"debt of gratitude\".\nBut it sets out a generational divide between younger activists and the commissioners who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s, saying: \"Our experience has taught us that you do not pass on the baton of progress by cleaving to a fatalistic account that insists nothing has changed\".\nIt also criticises \"bleak new theories about race that insist on accentuating our differences\" and an \"increasingly strident form of anti-racism thinking that seeks to explain all minority disadvantage through the prism of white discrimination\". \nThat diverts attention from other reasons for the success or failure of minority groups, including those relating to the \"culture and attitudes\" of those communities, the report says. It rejects terms such as \"white privilege\".\nOld class divisions have lost traction and identity politics is on the rise, fuelling \"pessimistic narratives\" about race, the commissioners say. While single-issue identity groups can do good work in protecting the vulnerable, they also \"raise the volume\" on these pessimistic viewpoints.\n\"Put simply we no longer see a Britain where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities,\" the commission says. It says racism is too often used as a \"catch-all explanation\" for disparities and impediments for people from minority groups. \nExamples where ethnic minority communities \"rightly felt let down\", such as the Grenfell fire or the Windrush scandal, sparked \"genuine national grief\".\nThe commissioners suggest that inequalities such as the higher death rates from Covid-19 among some ethnic groups are explained by factors such as their occupation or housing rather than direct discrimination. \"Outcomes such as these do not come about by design, and are certainly not deliberately targeted,\" they say.\nIt urges a detailed examination of the cases of racial and ethnic disparities and criticises the use of the term BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) as \"no longer helpful\" because it \"disguises huge differences\" between minority groups.\nToo much data in the UK only breaks down ethnic groups according to the \"big five\" of white, black, Asian, mixed and other, making it harder to see differences within ethnic minorities such as black African and black Caribbean communities, the report says.\nMany of the poor outcomes were due to family breakdown, the report suggests. It also says huge geographical inequalities can be the underlying causes of racial disparities. \nThe commissioners say it was \"a revelation how stuck some groups from the white majority are\" and it decided its recommendations should be \"designed to remove obstacles for everyone\".\nAlthough the commissioners cite opinion polls showing there is wide acceptance among the population of the UK as a multi-ethnic society, they suggest social media \"enormously amplifies racist views\".\nIt says the \"dominant narrative\" tends to draw attention to issues such as this abuse rather than progress in society, such as that 40% of NHS consultants are from ethnic minorities.\nSocial media abuse, where people can find themselves targeted in their own homes, is a \"unique torment\", the report says. It says platforms such as Facebook and YouTube with a huge user base have provided racists with a new, more public way to inflict pain on their victims.\nIt suggests social media companies too often fail to even enforce their own terms and conditions, and they should face \"substantial penalties - and public naming and shaming\".\nContrary to public perception of rising hate crimes, the report says they may be declining, according to the Crime Survey of England and Wales. But it still equates to 142 racially-motivated hate crimes a day.\nThe report looks for explanations as to why some ethnic minority groups do better than others, and it finds one in some educational research which suggests an important factor is \"immigrant optimism\".\nIn the education system, black African, Indian and Bangladeshi pupils perform better than white British ones, taking into account socio-economic status. Ethnic minority pupils also have higher aspirations at 14 than white students - with the exception of boys from black Caribbean backgrounds .\nThe research suggests that recent immigrants devote themselves more to education because they see education as a way out of poverty.\nThe commissioners say it may explain why pupils from black African backgrounds have better attainment in education than students with black Caribbean heritage, despite similar levels of neighbourhood deprivation, prejudice, and poverty.\nMinorities who have been long-established in the UK, particularly if they have faced racial, social and economic disadvantage, may be the least optimistic about social mobility, the report says.\nNew arrivals to the UK have seized on educational opportunities and achieved \"remarkable social mobility\", making education the \"single most emphatic success story of the British\u00a0ethnic minority experience\".\nA bigger proportion of ethnic minority students attend university than white British ones, the report says. People from white British backgrounds have the best outcomes at top universities, but the commissioners suggest this is a \"selection effect\", due to a smaller, better qualified cross-section of the white British population going to university. \nIt says from early years onwards, family, geography and poverty are the main reasons for poorer outcomes in education.\nThe report says some groups need extra support, including black Caribbean, mixed white and black Caribbean, traveller of Irish heritage, gypsy and Roma groups, as well as Pakistani boys from low socio-economic backgrounds, and lower socio-economic status white British pupils.\nBut it compares racial attainment gaps to the US and finds they are about eight times smaller in the UK.\nIt acknowledges that teaching is \"overwhelmingly white\" but says the causes for differences in the rates of exclusions and suspensions \"cannot be reduced to structural racism and individual teacher bias\".\nTeachers from ethnic minorities have faced \"pushback\" from senior staff when they push for a broader curriculum, the commissioners say. It suggests opportunities for a more inclusive portrayal of British culture are being missed, even when colleagues from ethnic minority backgrounds are proposing them.\nBut it says British history is not just one of \"imperial imposition\", with a more \"complex picture\" of ideas travelling back and forth, cultures mixing and \"positive relations\". \"All this makes up the British story, our story, which has episodes of both shame and pride,\" the report says.\nIt says to develop a sense of citizenship and to support integration, pupils should be exposed to the \"rich variety of British culture\" and the influences on it, from classical civilisation to modern immigration. \nThe commissioners note there have been calls to include topics such as the Commonwealth contribution to the World Wars, major race relations events such as the Bristol Bus Boycott in 1968 and Commonwealth writers such as Derek Walcott and Andrea Levy.\nFamily breakdown is one of the main reasons for educational failure and crime, the report says. \"Family is also the foundation stone of success for many ethnic minorities,\" it adds.\nThe commission said it had \"great concern\" about high rates of family breakdown in some communities, with 63% of children from black Caribbean backgrounds growing up in lone parent families compared to a UK average of 14.7%. Lone parenthood is much lower than average in south Asian and Chinese families.\nThe report says it is not \"passing judgement\", \"allocating blame\" or saying \"two parents are always better than one\", but stressing they may need extra support from extended families or community groups. \nIt also says \"governments cannot remain neutral here\" and minsters should look at initiatives to prevent family breakdown.\nThe commissioners criticise widely-cited figures that black people are nine times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, saying the nationwide figures do not take into account the different sizes and characteristics of local populations.\nThey produce figures for London alone, where the bulk of searches are carried out, which show black people are nearly four times more likely to be searched.\nStop-and-search is a \"critical tool for policing when used appropriately, and lawfully\", the report says. But it says there needs to be more transparency and accountability about why it is deployed.\nIt quotes a suggestion by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services that the fact that most searches are for drugs does not suggest it is targeted on the most high-priority crimes.\n\"Is stop and search tackling the war on drugs? Or is it removing knives from our streets?\" the commissioners ask, calling for greater clarity from police and government. \nThe report also suggests that more Class B drug possession offences where it is for personal use only should be dealt with outside of the criminal justice system.\nAmid concern about the disproportionate numbers of people from ethnic minorities dying in the pandemic, the report says this is mainly due to increased risk of exposure through their occupation, as well as living in urban areas and multi-generational households.\nIt says that overall ethnic minority groups have better outcomes than the white population in terms of life expectancy, overall mortality and for many of the leading causes of mortality. \n\"This evidence clearly suggests that ethnicity is not the major driver of health inequalities in the UK,\" the commissioners say, pointing to deprivation, geography and different levels of exposure to key risk factors as the main issues.\nThey also suggest that the lack of evidence of an impact on health outcomes casts doubt on whether black and South Asian communities are \"suffering from systemic racism throughout their lives\" that negatively affects their health, education, income, housing and employment.\nThere was \"no overwhelming evidence\" of racism in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions.\nBut the report says there needs to be more research into disparities in maternal mortality.\nIt stresses that the number of deaths overall is low, but between 2016 and 2018, among every 100,000 giving birth, 34 black women died. Among Asian women the rate was 15, and for white women it was eight.\nResearch for the commission suggests that over the last 50 years, many first generation immigrants experienced downward social mobility, but the second generation have \"caught up, and in some cases, surpassed, white people\". \nBut it says this progress has mostly taken place in the last two or three decades and it has been \"imperfect and mixed\". \nPeople from ethnic minorities are more likely to have persistent low incomes and among young people unemployment rates are high even for Indian and Chinese people who \"comfortably outperform the white average in education and incomes overall and generally benefit from positive stereotypes\".\nIt says discrimination is \"likely to be a part of the story\", with experiments showing ethnic minority candidates have to apply for about 1.6 times the number of jobs to get the same number of responses as a white person.\nBut the report says: \"Diversity training and policies that treat people differently according to ethnicity does not work.\" And it recommends policies such as name-blind applications and mentoring rather than quotas."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "text": "Irish pubs could be turned into remote working hubs under a post-pandemic plan to give rural villages a new lease on life. \nThe Irish government scheme is part of a five year rural development policy, released on Monday.\nUnder the plan, a fifth of public servants would shift to remote or home working by the end of the year.\nThe government says it is an invitation to remote workers to live in rural Ireland. \nIt will also introduce legislation this year to give employees the right to request to work remotely.\nThe Irish government's Our Rural Future strategy proposes a national network of 400 remote working hubs, including ones specifically for the public sector. \nIt is the first European country to come up with such a plan. \nRural and Community Development Minister Heather Humphreys said it was \"the most ambitious and transformational policy for rural Ireland in decades\".\n\"As we emerge from Covid-19, the new policy is about maximising a recovery for all parts of the country and giving a better quality of life to people who live and work in rural areas.\"\nConcern about the pre-eminence of Dublin and the need for decentralisation of civil service jobs is a perennial theme in Irish political discourse.\nA previous attempt to move government departments outside of the capital was a failure.\nCivil servants who had bought homes and had children at school in the city were very reluctant to sell-up to move to areas where they may have had no connections.\nBut this time the government is hoping it will be different because the focus will be more on individuals than on civil service departments.\nAnd the pandemic experience of working from home has proved there is such an appetite.\nBut to work broadband speeds in rural areas will need to improve from all too often very slow to superfast - just one of the many challenges the government faces as it looks to a future beyond the pandemic.\nThe report commits to \"explore the potential to develop a pilot scheme to support the use of rural pubs as community spaces and hubs for local services\".\nThe minister likened it to the UK's \"the hub in the pub\" concept. \n\"We are teasing out how, maybe, pubs can be used for different purposes during the day,\" she said. \n\"It could be working spaces. It could be community spaces. It could be many different things and we can look at having high-speed broadband there.\"\nCork South West TD (Irish MP) Michael Collins said such a plan would need high-speed, reliable broadband - which his constituents did not always have, Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 reported. \nAs part of the new strategy, the government has proposed investing up to \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a32.3bn) in the roll-out of the national broadband plan.\n\"There are huge issues. Many people have come back from the cities to work in rural communities and the broadband is shocking. \n\"I have hundreds and hundreds of people in west Cork pulling their hair out of their heads because they can't get broadband in their homes.\"\nNorthern Ireland's civil service is currently developing an \"enduring\" remote-working policy with trade unions. \nIn February, the Department of Finance announced 10 regional hubs for public sector workers.\nThe Cross Border Workers Coalition welcomed the commitment of ministers \"north and south\" to remote working. \nHowever \"restrictive\" cross border tax rules continued to leave rural communities behind, the organisation's co-chair Aidan O'Kane said.\n\"Under current legislation, cross border workers who live in the Republic of Ireland and work for an Northern Ireland-based company can face a 'double tax' on their income if they work remotely. \n\"Employees should be able to live in towns across the island regardless of where their job is based.\"\nThe Irish government has included a tax review for remote workers and employers as part of its strategy.

      "tags": "Sinn F\u00e9in,Michelle O'Neill,Police Service of Northern Ireland,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Northern Ireland's first minister has called on the PSNI's chief constable to resign after it was announced there would be no prosecutions in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey.\nArlene Foster said Simon Byrne's position was now \"untenable\".\nThe funeral last June attracted 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid restrictions were in place. \nThe actions of 24 Sinn F\u00e9in politicians were examined, including Ms O'Neill.\nMr Storey, 64, was a senior republican figure and had formerly been the head of intelligence for the IRA in the 1990s.\nThe attendance of many senior Sinn F\u00e9in politicians at his funeral in west Belfast, at a time when strict limits on gatherings were in place, caused a political furore.\nA police file has been with the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) since December.\nMr Byrne said on Tuesday afternoon that he would not resign and that the force has policed impartially. \nThe first minister said she telephoned Mr Byrne and told him to resign. She said she regretted his decision not to, and that she would be speaking to Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis later. \nMeanwhile, it has been confirmed that the Stormont Assembly will be recalled from Easter recess to debate a motion of censure against Sinn F\u00e9in.\nIt follows a recall petition proposed by the SDLP and supported by the DUP, UUP, Alliance and Green Party. A recall petition requires signatures of 30 MLAs in order to be successful.\nThe assembly is currently in recess until 12 April, but the SDLP had argued Sinn F\u00e9in ministers should be held to account through assembly procedures, following political criticism  after the PPS' decision. \nIt is understood MLAs have been told by the Speaker Alex Maskey that the assembly will be recalled on Thursday 1 April at 12:00.\nOn Tuesday, Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Herron said he acknowledged the widespread public concern over attendance at the funeral. \nBut he added the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 had become \"extremely difficult to navigate\" because of various amendments, and were in some respects \"inconsistent\".\nHe added organisers of the funeral and the police had engaged against \"the backdrop of evolving regulations\". \nThis was done, Mr Herron said, to ensure a balance was struck in the funeral arrangements \"between respecting the sensitivity of the occasion and minimising any risk to both public health and safety\".\n\"Prosecutions can only be brought where the available evidence provides a reasonable prospect of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, a breach of the criminal law.\"\nHe added: \"As a result of the factors considered we have concluded that the prosecution could not prove any breach of the regulations to the required standard.\"\nMr Herron said the \"lack of clarity and coherence within the regulations and the prior engagement between organisers and the police\" would \"pose an insurmountable difficulty\" if prosecutions were brought. \n\"This is because they could all avail of a defence of reasonable excuse in terms of their actual or reasonably perceived compliance with a complex set of regulations and/or their reliance on the prior engagement with PSNI,\" he added. \n\"The law as it applied to the Storey funeral was changed significantly on the evening before the funeral and further amended two days later.\"\nMr Herron said the law relating to permissible conduct in the course of the pandemic was \"not always clear cut and this can be challenging when it comes to enforcement of what are essentially health regulations in a criminal justice context\".\nMrs Foster said it was a bad day for justice, policing, and the rule of law. \nShe said the engagement between the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the funeral organisers was a factor in no prosecutions being made.\n\"The position of the chief constable is now untenable and I am calling on him to resign.  Sadly, it is now clear confidence cannot be rebuilt with him in post.\"\nShe said there was a crisis of confidence in policing.\n\"I think this is the most bizarre situation we have found ourselves in Northern Ireland in quite some time,\" she said. \nMrs Foster said Sinn F\u00e9in had acted as though the party was above the law. \n\"To claim ignorance of the law is no defence when you helped legislate those very same regulations,\" she said. \n\"Hundreds lined the streets dressed in white shirts and black ties and attended a political rally in Milltown Cemetery when the limit on public gatherings was 30. \n\"There was a complete lapse of leadership and a public display of arrogance by Sinn F\u00e9in's elected representatives. Public health rules were undermined and irreparably damaged.\"\nSimon Byrne can soldier on if he wants to soldier on - but if he does, how can he rebuild the unionist community's confidence in him?\nThat confidence was at a pretty low ebb even before today's PPS decision. \nThere is a meeting of the Policing Board on Thursday and I'm hearing from DUP sources that this is something they're not going to drop quickly, even if Mr Byrne has made it clear that he's not for quitting. \nWe need to remind ourselves that it is not unusual for the PSNI to engage with individuals ahead of large-scale events, and this funeral is no exception. \nWhat a lot of people within unionism are struggling to comprehend is a full understanding of what went on in those conversations to such an extent that it has compromised a prosecution. \nThere may be momentum growing for a further investigation, maybe though the Police Ombudsman, to get to the bottom of what went on before the funeral. \nIt is bizarre, though, that we're in a situation where the PSNI is taking a lot of flack and the PPS has simply issued a statement. \nIt was the PPS which reached this decision - a decision the PSNI has been at pains to say it disagrees with - and the police have found themselves on a hiding to nothing. \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she wanted to once again apologise \"for the hurt that has been caused to so many, including to Bobby Storey's own family who have been thrust into the headlines at a time of immense grief\".\n\"Nine months ago I laid my dear friend Bobby Storey to rest. I accept and understand that many people, particularly those who had lost loved ones during the last year, felt that by my actions, I gave the impression that the rules did not apply to us all equally. Let me say clearly they do,\" Ms O'Neill said. \n\"No funeral is more important than any other. No family or community is any more important than any other. All grief is devastating.\"\nMeanwhile, Justice Minister Naomi Long said she did not agree with the call for Mr Byrne's resignation. \nShe said he was being used as a \"lightening rod\" for people's anger. \n\"I don't believe it is the chief constable's fault that we have found ourselves in this position,\" she said. \n\"It is wrong that we should direct our anger towards him and the police.\"\nShe also said it was not the fault of the PPS. \nMr Byrne said enforcing the coronavirus regulations has been a \"consistently challenging and often uncomfortable role for my officers\".\nHe said police did recommend prosecutions in the case. \n\"The PPS decision points to the ambiguity and changing nature of the coronavirus regulations in force immediately before and on the day of the funeral which, in their view alone, amounted to an insurmountable hurdle to a successful prosecution,\" he said. \n\"The decision not to prosecute does not change our view that what happened last summer when large numbers of people chose not to 'stay at home' at the height of a global pandemic was unnecessary, irresponsible and insensitive. It was wrong.\"\nThe chief constable said that if he was to resign, it would undermine his successor.\n\"Sometimes decisions don't go the way people want,\" he said. \n\"Public servants need to be held to account, yes, but every time something doesn't go the way of somebody's point of view, and if we have to resign, there's no continuity.\"\nMr Byrne said no deals were done with the organisers of the funeral. \n\"We did not turn a blind eye,\" he added. \nThe Policing Board said it would have an opportunity to question Mr Byrne at its meeting on Thursday. \nThe police investigation into suspected breaches of pandemic regulations began in July, with Mark Webster, the deputy chief constable of Cumbria Police, providing independent oversight.\nIt is understood all of those interviewed were Sinn F\u00e9in politicians. \nTwo people are facing prosecution in connection with attendance at the funeral of former Sinn F\u00e9in councillor Francie McNally in mid-Ulster in April 2020.

      "text": "Germany is suspending routine use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine for people aged below 60 because of a risk of rare blood clots.\nThe German medicines regulator found 31 cases of a type of rare blood clot among the nearly 2.7 million people who had received the vaccine in Germany.\nCanada earlier suspended use of the AstraZeneca jab in people under 55.\nAstraZeneca said international regulators had found the benefits of its jab outweighed risks significantly. \nIt said it was continuing to analyse its database to understand \"whether these very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia occur any more commonly than would be expected naturally in a population of millions of people\".\n\"We will continue to work with German authorities to address any questions they may have,\" it added.\nThe EU and UK medicine regulators both backed the vaccine after previous cautionary suspensions in Europe this month. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the UK Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency stressed that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine continued to outweigh the risk of side effects.\nIn the UK, a government spokesperson said: \"The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is safe, effective and has already saved thousands of lives in this country. As the UK's independent regulator has said, when people are called forward, they should get the jab. \n\"Over 30 million people have already received their first dose of a vaccine, and we are on track to offer jabs to all over-50s by 15 April and all adults by the end of July.\"\nAstraZeneca's product is one of the most widely used coronavirus vaccines in the West, and is meant to be supplied on a not-for-profit basis to the developing world.\nThe EU's rollout of its vaccination programme has been dogged by delays because of delivery and production problems, and Germany is among several states now fearing a third wave of infections.\nOn Tuesday, Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi and his wife, who are both 73, received their first doses of AstraZeneca in a display of confidence in the vaccine.\nIf you give a vaccine to millions of people you will of course see some cases of people falling seriously ill or even dying shortly afterwards. It does not mean the vaccine has caused the problem - it could have occurred naturally. What authorities have to work out is whether it is cause or coincidence.\nThey do this by monitoring adverse events after vaccination and see if they are above what you would normally expect. The type of blood clot that has been seen is very rare and so it is hard to know exactly how many cases you would normally expect to see. We do know it is more common in women and taking the pill increases the risk of it happening. \nThere is no evidence yet to prove the AstraZeneca vaccine increases the chances of these clots. But, even if it does, the next thing you have to take into account is whether Covid presents more of a danger. \nRegulators in Europe and the UK are clear - given the current evidence - that use of the vaccine should continue in all ages.\nHealth Minister Jens Spahn and the 16 state health ministers decided to suspend routine use for the under-60s at an emergency meeting on Tuesday.\nPeople under 60 can still receive the jab but only \"at the discretion of doctors, and after individual risk analysis and thorough explanation\", according to a document seen by dpa news agency.\nThe decision was reached on the advice of the German vaccine committee (Stiko) which said: \"After several consultations, Stiko, with the help of external experts, decided by a majority to recommend the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine only for persons aged 60 years and older on the basis of available data on the occurrence of rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects.\"\nAdditional advice about booster shots would be issued by the end of April for younger persons who had already received a first dose of AstraZeneca, Stiko said.\nChancellor Angela Merkel said there must be no doubts about the safety of any drug being administered in Germany: \"We have to be able to trust the vaccines... This also includes the subsequent ongoing testing of their effectiveness and safety, and the permanent weighing of risks and benefits. Confidence arises from the knowledge that every suspicion is counted in every individual case.\"\nThe 66-year-old added that she was open to being vaccinated with AstraZeneca when her turn came.\nAhead of  announcement, the German cities of Berlin and Munich, and the region of Brandenburg, halted use of the vaccine for people below the age of 60.\nGermany was one of the European states which briefly suspended use of the AstraZeneca jab earlier this month pending an EMA review into the possible link to blood clots. \nWhen the EMA declared the vaccine \"safe and effective\", Germany and others resumed its use but investigations continued.\nThe German medicines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, has found 31 cases of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT) among people who received AstraZeneca in Germany.\nAlmost all the cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women.\nFrance already limits use of AstraZeneca to those aged over 55.\nOn Monday, Canada recommended immediately suspending the use of AstraZeneca in people aged below 55 following the reports of rare but potentially fatal blood clots in Europe, CBC reports.\nThere have been no reports of blood clots related to the jab in Canada itself, where 300,000 doses of AstraZeneca jabs have now been administered.\nIn the UK, five cases of CSVT - one of them fatal - have been recorded among 11 million people who received the vaccine.\nIn another development, Austria confirmed it was in talks with Russia to buy a million doses of its Sputnik V vaccine, which has yet to be approved by the EMA.\nChancellor Sebastian Kurz is under pressure from opposition parties for his government's failure to buy its full share of vaccines under the EU's collective purchasing scheme.\n\"There must be no geopolitical blinkers regarding vaccines,\" Mr Kurz said in a statement issued by his office. \"The only thing that must count is whether the vaccine is effective and safe.\"\nDespite the lack of EMA approval, Sputnik is already being used by fellow EU state Hungary.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin discussed possible co-operation on vaccines with Mrs Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron when they held a video conference on Tuesday, Mr Macron's office said in a statement.

      "text": "When setting up the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities during the Black Lives Matter protests last summer, Boris Johnson said: \"What I really want to do as prime minister is change the narrative, so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination.\"  \nBut reaching a settled view on the question of racism in the UK was always going to be a struggle.\nCritics were concerned by Mr Johnson's assertion that he wanted \"to look very carefully at the real racism and discrimination that people face\". \nThere was further unease among anti-racism groups at the reported involvement of Number 10 policy advisor Munira Mirza in setting up the commission, because she had previously written of how institutional racism was \"a perception more than a reality\". \nWhen Theresa May created the Race Disparities Audit in 2017, Ms Mirza complained that \"anti-racism is becoming weaponised across the political spectrum\".\nThe appointment of Tony Sewell to lead the inquiry once again disappointed anti-racism activists. \nOne London-based organisation, Monitoring Group, considered seeking a judicial review to prevent his selection on the grounds that he had \"a longstanding record of public statements rejecting or minimising\" the impact of institutional racism in Britain.\nThe accusation that this report is the result of a hand-picked committee, designed to say what ministers wanted to hear, will have some traction, whatever the commission and the government insist about its independence.\nThe problem is not whether the report is right or wrong in its conclusions, nor whether the commission was impartial in its analysis. Indeed, the findings offer some important perspective on the complexities of race and social mobility.\nThe difficulty is that the process does not enjoy broad support as a truly independent exercise. As a result, rather than helping encourage consensus over this vexed issue, it may deepen distrust and division."

      "tags": "Shielding,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wednesday marks the last day that about four million of the most clinically vulnerable people in England and Wales are advised to shield at home.\nLetters have been sent out to the group in the last few weeks. \nThey are still being advised to keep social contacts at low levels, work from home where possible and stay at a distance from other people.\nThe change comes amid falling Covid cases and hospital admissions.\nAccording to NHS Digital, there are 3.8 million shielded patients in England and 130,000 in Wales.\nScotland and Northern Ireland are expected to lift their restrictions later in April.\nPeople identified as being clinically extremely vulnerable were advised to take extra care to avoid contracting Covid-19 because they are considered more at risk of needing hospital treatment.\nThey include people who have had stem cell transplants or are having chemotherapy treatment for cancer, and adults with chronic kidney disease.\nIn February, another 1.7 million people in England were added to the list, based on the clinical judgement of their GP or hospital doctor.\nAnyone shielding has been entitled to priority access to a Covid vaccination before the general population.\nPeople affected by shielding included Rob Smith, from Hull, who has muscular dystrophy.\nShielding for more than a year has been a \"nightmare\", he told BBC Breakfast.\n\"Where I was able to go out, I didn't feel I wanted to. I didn't feel confident to face people again,\" he said.\n\"I've always been sociable.... It's had a massive impact.\"\nMr Smith now says he feels anxious about the future and believes for many people who have been shielding, it will \"take time to get used to being out there again\".\nHe is also wary of the risk of mixing with others again.\n\"I have had the first jab - knowing I'm going to be out there mixing potentially with people who could be carrying the virus - it is still an anxious time,\" he said.\nFor Katherine Taylor in Essex, who has a rare neurological disorder and hyper-mobility, the last year has been a \"real mixture of emotions\".\nHer employer, a local college, has \"been really brilliant and supportive\" and allowed her to do her job as an event planner from home. She will continue to work from home in the next few months.\nBut she said: \"The isolation of not actually being able to see and do the things you'd normally do has been really, really difficult - particularly not being able to see my parents.\"\nIt has also been hard for Mrs Taylor not to attend in-person physiotherapy sessions and to have hospital appointments put off.\nShe said it would be a \"relief to get back to some sort of normal again\" - go shopping with her daughter and eventually take a holiday break with her family in the camper van her husband has been fixing-up over lockdown.\n\"I'm feeling really good now about the future,\" she said, adding she was excited to \"see friends, spend more time with my family, so many things\".\n\"Just such simple things we took for granted.\" \nTuesday's daily coronavirus figures showed deaths and hospital admissions continuing to fall.\nThere were 56 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and 289 patients admitted to hospital, with the seven-day averages for each down by 35% and 22.1% respectively. \nA further 4,040 cases were recorded, with the seven-day average down by 7.9%. \nThe figures also showed 30,680,948 people have now received a first dose of the vaccine, while 3,838,010 have had two doses.  \nOn Monday, restrictions in England were eased, allowing groups to meet outdoors. \nOutdoor sport facilities, including swimming pools, tennis courts and golf courses, have reopened, while weddings are also on again.\nSpeaking on Monday at a Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson it was not clear \"exactly how strong\" the UK's defences would be against another wave of Covid, despite the \"impressive\" vaccine rollout.\nBut he also said he could not \"see anything in the data right now that would cause us to deviate from the road map\" of easing further restrictions.\nFrom 12 April, shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality will reopen in England, if strict conditions are met.

      "tags": "Climate change,Air travel",
      "text": "A small minority of frequent flyers dominate air travel in almost all countries with high aviation emissions, analysis suggests. \nIn the UK, 70% of flights are made by a wealthy 15% of the population, with 57% not flying abroad at all.\nThere are calls for a frequent flyer levy - a tax that increases the more you fly each year.\nGreenpeace supports the tax and also wants air miles banned because they say it encourages frequent flying.\nThe UK government said it is reviewing aviation taxes, but insisted that a frequent flier levy would have many problems.\nThe campaigners believe frequent flyer levies would be broadly popular because they disproportionately affect the rich, who fly the most.\nThe UK Citizens' Assembly last year supported the principle that people who fly more should be taxed more.\nResearch for the climate campaign group Possible says that, in the US, just 12% of people take two-thirds of flights. The government's advisory Climate Change Committee wants a levy on frequent fliers. \nThe Possible research suggests the frequent flyer trend is mirrored in other wealthy countries.\nAlethea Warrington, from Possible, said: \"This report shows the same pattern of inequality around the world - a small minority of frequent flyers take an unfair share of the flights.\n\"While the poorest communities are already suffering the impacts of a warming climate, the benefits of high-carbon lifestyles are enjoyed only by the few. A lot of people travel. But only the privileged few fly often.\"\nJohn Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, told BBC News: \"Taxing frequent fliers is a good idea - but we also have to do something about air miles, which reward frequent fliers for flying more frequently. This is obscene during a climate crisis - and it should be stopped.\" \nA UK Treasury spokesman told BBC News: \"We're leading the global fight on climate change and will use our hosting of COP26 (the Glasgow climate summit) later this year to galvanise global support for aviation decarbonisation.\n\"Frequent flyers already pay more under the current APD (Air Passenger Duty) system, but we are currently consulting on aviation tax reform and welcome views.\" \nHe said there were many drawbacks to a frequent flyer levy. These include that it would be complex to administer, could pose data processing and privacy concerns, could be difficult to impose where passengers hold multiple passports and could be a challenge for those who have an essential need to fly frequently. \nThe government's consultation on aviation tax reform closes on 14 June. \nThe spokesman did not comment on the proposal to make air miles programmes illegal. \nFollow Roger on Twitter."

      "tags": "Minneapolis,US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "A Minneapolis court has been shown new police bodycam footage of George Floyd pleading with officers during his arrest, saying: \"I'm not a bad guy\".\nThe video shows police officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on Mr Floyd for more than nine minutes, and Mr Floyd begging not to be harmed.\nMr Chauvin, 45, who has since been fired from the police force, denies charges of murder and manslaughter.\nMr Floyd's death in 2020 sparked global protests over policing and racism.\nDefence lawyers have indicated they will argue that 46-year-old Mr Floyd died of an overdose and poor health, and the force used was reasonable. \nObservers on the third day of the trial said footage shown of Mr Floyd's actions before and during the arrest may be an attempt by prosecutors to deal with the allegation that drugs played a part in his death.\nIf convicted of the charges, Mr Chauvin could be jailed for decades in the trial, which is expected to take about one month.\nThe court has been shown footage from the body cameras belonging to officers Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao. Mr Chauvin's camera fell to the ground as the arrest unfolded and so did not give a visual recording of the event. \nIn Mr Lane's footage, Mr Floyd is seen being confronted by police. He begs them: \"Please don't shoot me... I just lost my mom.\"\nMr Floyd is handcuffed and continues to plead with Officers Lane and Kueng, saying he is not resisting them and \"will do anything you tell me to\".\nA scuffle occurs when police try to get Mr Floyd into a vehicle, and he starts crying and resisting while saying he is claustrophobic and has anxiety.\nMr Chauvin and his partner Mr Thao arrive as the arrest goes on.\nAs the police officers drag him out of the car and restrain him on the ground, Mr Floyd can be heard calling for his mother and telling his family members he loves them.\nBystanders begin to shout at officers to check Mr Floyd's pulse and stop restraining him.\nMr Chauvin is standing trial separately from the other three police officers because of Covid restrictions on space. The others are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and will come before the courts in August.\nShop employee Christopher Martin, 19, told the court he briefly interacted with Mr Floyd as a customer inside Cup Foods shortly before his arrest. \nHe said Mr Floyd \"appeared to be high\" because he struggled to respond to a simple question, but he was lucid enough to able to hold a conversation. He described Mr Floyd as \"friendly and approachable\".\nIn the shop's surveillance video, Mr Floyd can be seen laughing, talking to people, and walking around.\nMr Martin told the jury he had sold Mr Floyd a packet of cigarettes, and received a counterfeit note as payment. Mr Martin described knowing the bill was fake by its colour and texture, but added that Mr Floyd \"didn't seem to know it was a fake note\".\nHe said he had considered letting the shop deduct it from his wages instead of confronting Mr Floyd, but then decided to tell his manager. Another employee went on to call the police. \nMr Martin, who witnessed the arrest, said he felt \"disbelief and guilt\" because \"if I'd have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided\". \nCharles McMillian, 61, was another witness who took the stand on Wednesday. \nBased on CCTV footage, Mr McMillian appears to have been the first bystander on the scene of Mr Floyd's arrest. He told the court he engaged in conversation with Mr Floyd, urging him to get into the police car.\nMr McMillian said he remembers feeling \"helpless\" seeing the incident unfold. He can be heard on video telling Mr Chauvin: \"Your knee on his neck, that's wrong man.\"\nAs the court was shown footage of the arrest, Mr McMillian began to sob, and the judge called for a brief recess.\nThe court was also shown separate footage of Mr McMillian from Mr Chauvin's own body camera.\nIn the footage, Mr McMillian confronted Mr Chauvin about the arrest after Mr Floyd was taken away in the ambulance.\n\"We had to control this guy because he's a sizeable guy,\" Mr Chauvin told Mr McMillian, as he got back in his squad car. \"It looks like he's probably on something.\"\nIn opening statements on Monday, Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell told the jury that Mr Chauvin had \"betrayed his badge\" by kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck, and using \"excessive and unreasonable force\" to detain him.\nMeanwhile, Mr Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson said the case was about the evidence, not about a \"political or social cause\". He said Mr Floyd had ingested drugs at the time of his arrest \"in an effort to conceal them from the police\", and suggested this had contributed to his death.\nFour young witnesses took to the stand on Tuesday. Darnella - the teenager whose film of Mr Floyd's death sparked global protests - said she \"stays up apologising\" to him for \"not doing more\".\nShe told the court she had started filming on her phone because she \"saw a man terrified, begging for his life\".\n\"It wasn't right - he was in pain,\" she said. \nOne witness, Donald Williams II, who is trained in mixed martial arts, was questioned for more than an hour by the prosecution and defence on Monday and again on Tuesday. He told the court Mr Chauvin had used a dangerous technique called a \"blood choke\" and was moving his knee back and forth to increase the pressure on Mr Floyd's back and neck.\nHe rejected defence suggestions that he and other bystanders' interactions with police had been threatening to the officers there.\nGenevieve Hansen, a Minneapolis firefighter and emergency medical technician who was off duty at the time of the arrest, said she was \"desperate to help\" Mr Floyd but officers would not let her. \nMr Chauvin has been silent but remained engaged during the proceedings, taking almost constant notes on a yellow legal pad while listening to the evidence.\nThe video footage of Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck last May was watched around the world.\nTo many, Mr Floyd's death in police custody became a symbol of police brutality - particularly against people belonging to ethnic minorities  - and it sparked mass demonstrations for racial justice.\nBut despite the global outcry this is not an open and shut case. In the US, police are rarely convicted for deaths that occur while they are on duty, if they are charged at all.\nThe verdict in this case will be widely seen as an indication of how the US legal system treats deaths that occur while in police custody."

Profits slumped 74% to \u00a3194.7m. \nHowever, the company said it had not cut staff pay or laid off employees as a result of the crisis. It also did not make use of the furlough scheme.\nThe company also paid \u00a385m to Ms Coates's charitable foundation.\nMs Coates and her brother John took over the gambling business 20 years ago, which was run by their father. Ms Coates now owns about half of the company.\nShe has previously been described as one of the UK's \"most successful women\". \nMs Coates achieved a first-class degree in econometrics and later trained as an accountant within the family firm, building further on the knowledge of the then small chain that she picked up while working part-time during high school.\nThe chief executive's annual pay packet is likely to be the biggest in UK history. Earlier this month, hedge fund tycoon Sir Chris Hohn staked a claim to that title after paying himself \u00a3343m last year."

      "text": "A report into racial inequality in the UK, ordered by Boris Johnson, will not now be completed until early in 2021. \nThe Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities was due to report to the prime minister by the end of the year but has requested an extra two months.\nIt blamed Covid restrictions for the delay as well as the large number of responses received from the public.\nLabour said the delay added to concerns the government was not taking the issue seriously. \nThe commission, led by education consultant and ex-charity boss Tony Sewell, was established in June in the wake of anti-racism protests across the country triggered by the killing of George Floyd in the United States.\nThe body is looking at areas such as health, education and criminal justice but also \"wider inequalities\" such as issues faced by working-class white boys.\nAt the time of its launch, Mr Johnson said although there was much more to be done to tackle racism, he wanted to \"change the narrative\" to highlight stories of success among those from ethnic minority backgrounds and \"stop a sense of victimisation and discrimination\". \nIn an update to ministers, Mr Sewell said Covid restrictions had delayed the commission's public engagement and it would take time to work through the more than 2,300 responses from the public and interested parties. \nBut he said, when finished, the report would take a \"radical new approach\" and \"change the tone of the discourse\" about the root causes of racial disparities and their pervasiveness in society. \nHe said he believed the report would challenge \"perceptions of racism,\" which he said were not supported by evidence and which \"sowed mistrust\" in communities.\nHe suggested its early findings suggested differences in individuals' life chances were more often influenced by age, sex, class and geography than race and \"may in fact have little to do with racism itself\".\nHe called for more focus on factors other than race when considering the varying educational, health and economic outcomes experienced by different groups, including cultural heritage, religion and parental influence.\nAnd he urged the government to take a \"more rounded view on inequalities\" by moving the Social Mobility Commission from its current home within the education department to the Cabinet Office's Equalities Hub. \nGranting Mr Sewell's request for a two-month extension until the end of February, Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said she was \"pleased\" by the commission's work and ministers believed \"in an evidence-led approach to tackling all discrimination, not box-ticking\".\n\"We are focused on implementing what actually works, and avoiding passing fads,\" she tweeted.\nIt is not clear how soon the government will publish the report after it is completed. \nA government spokesman said the Commission should have time to review and consider all submissions in full before putting together its report. \nMinisters have come under fire for the length of time it has taken to implement the recommendations of a series of previous reviews into racial inequalities.\nShadow Equalities Secretary Marsha de Cordova said the latest delay \"merely adds to our worries that the government is not taking the action it needs to\".\n\"Instead of implementing the clear recommendations from previous reviews into inequality, in the last 48 hours alone we have seen announcements that they are cancelling unconscious bias training for civil servants and that the gender pay gap in the Minister for Equalities' own department is actually growing,\" she said.\nThe Runnymede Trust said the process had already taken too long given the need to respond in real time to the grave inequalities highlighted by the pandemic. \nThe race equality think tank said it was concerned by signs the commission intended to \"downplay\" the impact of racism on the lives of black and other minority ethnic people.\n\"The evidence on social mobility is already known and has been for years. We do not need to collect more evidence on social mobility,\" said the body's director Dr Halima Begum.\n\"Given the appalling evidence of racial inequality in our society, we urge the commission to focus its inquiry on BME communities.\""

Why not let licensed, regulated venues be part of the solution instead of seeing us as the problem?\"\nOne person in Cardiff tweeted a video of a rubbish-strewn park, adding: \"Pontcanna Fields is horrific this morning.\"\nIn Carmarthenshire, groups of up to 100 teenagers have been moved on and large amounts of alcohol seized after police responded to reports of anti-social behaviour near the coastal path in Burry Port.\nIt followed on from Saturday when about 50 teenagers were dispersed near woodland in the area.\nDyfed-Powys Police Sgt Gemma Davies said: \"We would like to appeal directly to parents to be aware of where their children are, and what they are doing. \n\"This behaviour is distressing for people living in Burry Port and we are urging you to be accountable for your children's actions.\n\"We understand that the past few months have been difficult, and that children want to see their friends, but please do your best to ensure they are adhering to regulations that are in place for all our safety.\"\nMichael Butterfield, from Llangattock Litter Pickers in Powys, said he had seen an increase in the amount of litter since restrictions had started to ease.\n\"For the end of March, we have collected 175 bags of litter, which might not sound like a lot, but actually, it is,\" he said.\n\"Since the lockdown, we have been seeing more PPE - facemasks predominantly - but the main litter we see out on the verges are drinks - so cans, bottles, single-use cups.\" \nThe highest March temperature in Wales is 23.9C, which was recorded in Prestatyn, Denbighshire and Ceinws, Powys, on 29 March 1965."

      "tags": "Asian Americans,New York City,US race relations,United States",
      "text": "Police in the US have arrested a man suspected of attacking an Asian American woman in New York City, kicking her repeatedly in the stomach as witnesses appeared to only watch.\nThe 65-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with serious injuries.\nCCTV video from Monday appears to show staff of a nearby building watching without intervening.\nPolice said the suspect, Brandon Elliot, had been charged with attempted assault as a hate crime.\nThe 38-year-old was already subject to a lifetime parole order after fatally stabbing his mother in 2002, and was released from prison in 2019, police said.\nA tweet below contains scenes of violence.\nOn Tuesday, Joe Biden said he could not be silent \"in the face of rising violence against Asian Americans\".\nThe president announced additional steps to address anti-Asian crimes.\nSix of the victims of a gun attack in Atlanta two weeks ago which killed eight in total were Asian women.\nIn the latest incident in New York City, footage shared by police appears to show a man approaching a woman in the street and kicking her to the ground.\nWhile she is lying on the floor outside a building entrance, he kicks her again in the stomach and in the face.\nSeveral security staff in the building appear to watch the attack while one man uses a telephone.\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has condemned the assault as \"absolutely disgusting and outrageous\".\nPolice said the incident took place in Manhattan on Monday morning and asked for anyone with information to come forward.\nThe suspect had made anti-Asian statements, they said.\nThe managers of the building wrote on Instagram that the staff who witnessed the attack had been suspended while an investigation is carried out.\n\"We are extremely distraught by the horrific attack that occurred outside our building,\" the Bordsky Organization wrote, adding that it condemns violence against Asian Americans.\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said it was \"absolutely unacceptable\" that witnesses did not intervene.\nMore than 3,795 incidents were reported to the organization Stop Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) Hate from 19 March last year to 28 February this year, according to a report.\nThis probably accounts for just a fraction of attacks, the organisation explained.\nThe FBI warned at the start of the Covid outbreak in the US that it expected a surge in hate crimes against those of Asian descent.\nNationwide statistics recording hate crimes in 2020 have not yet been released, but many Asian American people say they have observed a rise in insults and attacks.\nThe New York City hate crimes task force investigated 27 incidents in 2020, a nine-fold increase from the previous year.\nOn Tuesday President Joe Biden announced plans to tackle the rising anti-Asian violence.\nHe said the government will publish interactive data on hate crimes as well as train national and local police in responding to hate crimes. \nThe White House also pledged to remove language barriers to reporting hate crimes.\nSome victims of racist attacks are reluctant to come forward because they fear not being taken seriously by police or other officials.\nMr Biden also announced that funding of around $50 million will be available to support victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, including victims from the Asian American community.\nLast week two Senators from Mr Biden's Democrat party criticised his administration for what they said was a lack of representation of Asian Americans at the highest level of government.\nIn response the White House said it would appoint an official to focus on Asian American issues."

      "text": "Facebook is adding features to users' main news feed, including letting them limit comment on their public posts to friends or even specific tagged people.\nThe feature is similar to one rolled out by Twitter last year.\nFacebook will also make it easier to revert to \"chronological\" mode, with the latest posts displayed first.\nThe company abandoned this model in 2009, although the option remained buried in a menu, in favour of using algorithms to rank the content shown.\nBut on Wednesday, vice-president Nick Clegg said a lack of transparency and information available to users had led to mistrust.\nAnd so Facebook has moved its \"most recent\" option to a new \"feed filter bar\", at the top of the news feed, which also allows users to prioritise posts from up to 30 friends or particular pages, a feature introduced in October last year, before reverting to algorithmic content ranking.\nDespite the change, Mr Clegg, the former Deputy Prime Minister, said Facebook's algorithmic content ranking - and personalised advertising - continued to offer \"so many benefits to society\".\nComparing its use of algorithms to a romantic couple in which ones does the shopping and the other cooks dinner, he said: \"Content ranking is a dynamic partnership between people and algorithms.\n\"Your news feed is shaped heavily by your choices and actions.\"\nIn a further bid for transparency, the news feed's  \"Why am I seeing this?\" links will now detail the criteria for recommended posts - from people and organisations users do not follow - such as having recently interacted with a similar post.\nThe new controls would be available for Android app users first, Facebook said, with an iOS update for Apple phones in the coming weeks."

      "tags": "School bullying,Sexual harassment,Young people",
      "text": "A helpline and immediate review into sexual abuse in schools have been set up by the government in response to thousands of allegations from students.\nOfsted will look at safeguarding in both state and independent schools.\nThe helpline will be run by the NSPCC to both support potential victims and provide advice to children and adults.\n\"Sexual abuse in any form is abhorrent and it is vital that these allegations are dealt with properly,\" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said.\n\"While the majority of schools take their safeguarding responsibilities extremely seriously, I am determined to make sure the right resources and processes are in place across the education system to support any victims of abuse to come forward.\" \nThe debate about a culture of sexual abuse at schools has escalated in recent weeks after a website set up for victims to anonymously post their experiences gained more than 11,000 posts, some from children as young as nine.\nMany of the allegations on the website refer to sexual harassment carried out against young women by young men at their school or university.\nWendy Mair, from the Everyone's Invited site, said they were \"proud to have started a crucial conversation\", but disappointed the education secretary had not contacted them before the announcement.\n\"We are encouraged to see that the government has responded and taken the first initial steps to review rape culture in all schools,\" she said, adding that she hoped the site's team will be included in carrying out the review.\n\"The testimonies being shared through Everyone's Invited are extremely upsetting, and underline the urgent need to tackle violence against girls,\" said NSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless.\n\"This is a watershed moment thanks to those who have found the courage to speak out.\"\nThe helpline will be open from 09:00 GMT on Thursday to offer support and advice to children and adults who are victims of sexual abuse in schools. \nThis includes how to contact the police and report crimes, if they wish to, while parents and professionals can also get in touch. \nStudents have contacted the BBC criticising what they see as their school's failure to tackle incidents or acknowledge the wider issues.\nSarah, who is 18 and goes to a state school in London, said she had been \"sexually harassed on numerous occasions\" by students at a neighbouring private school.\nShe said she feels incredibly let down by what she saw as her school's \"lack of response\" to the recent discussions around women's safety.\n\"It's really been left to students to care for each other, often leading to major tensions within peer groups as people attempt to 'confront' certain students known for sexually inappropriate behaviour,\" she said.\nIn June 2020, Soma Sara, who is now 22, shared her experience on Instagram of what she calls \"rape culture\".\nWithin a week she had received and shared more than 300 anonymous responses of people with stories of \"misogyny, harassment, abuse and assault\".\nThe Everyone's Invited website now carries thousands of victims' testimonies, often from schools and universities.\nExperiences range from being drugged and raped at parties to explicit images being shared over messaging platforms.\nAnother sixth former, from Kent, suggested there had been \"lots of sexual assault allegations\" made at her school, but that these had been played down. \n\"Before lockdown two we tried talking to the school and that has totally been ignored, and because of their 'prestigious' image they've been telling girls to keep quiet and to think of the accused's mental health,\" she said. \nLast week, pupils at Highgate School in North London walked out of classes in protest at a perceived \"rape culture\", following the publication of accounts of alleged abuse.\nOne male ex-pupil told BBC Newsnight that girls were \"hounded\" for naked selfies at the school. The school's governing body said it was \"truly sorry\" and had commissioned an external review.\nOfsted will begin an immediate review of safeguarding policies in state and private schools, to determine whether guidance for schools around sexual harassment needs to be improved. It will conclude by the end of May\nMore than half of young women had been sexually harassed at their school, college or university, polling of 1,000 young women aged 14-21 last autumn suggested.\nOne in five said they had received unwanted sexual comments and 8% had been groped, according to the figures from girls' rights charity Plan International UK.\nConservative MP Maria Miller, former chairwoman of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, told BBC Breakfast there was \"far more to do\" on the issue.\n\"If we don't tackle it in our schools we leave young people leaving school thinking that is entirely right, that they're able to either sexually harass or be on the receiving end of sexual harassment,\" she said. \n\"And that's why we're seeing these behaviours going to our universities, our workplaces and beyond.\"\nMs Miller said new mandatory relationships education in England, and a forthcoming Online Harms Bill introducing age controls on online pornography, were \"steps in the right direction\".\n\"There is no doubt that schools can and should play a key role in this work, but this is a problem that reaches far beyond the school gates,\" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of head teachers' union NAHT, said.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the union welcomed the review and the helpline, adding: \"Robust safeguarding is the number one priority of state and independent schools.\"\nThe Report Abuse in Education helpline can be reached on 0800 136 663, on Monday to Friday 8am - 10pm, or 9am - 6pm at weekends. It can also be contacted by email at help@nspcc.org.uk"

All he does is lick them and wag his tail. But... I realise some people, understandably, are afraid of dogs to begin with.\"\nThe Bidens adopted Major, who is now three years old, as a puppy from Delaware Humane Association in 2018. Champ had already spent some time in the White House as a younger dog, when Mr Biden was vice-president, before moving in permanently in January this year."

The sale will also \"help to secure the Festival's return in 2022\", organisers said.\nA commemorative poster will also be sold in support of stage crew who have struggled to make ends meet during the pandemic.\nGlastonbury was the first festival to cancel in 2021, with several others - including Download and the BST festival - following suit.\nThe Isle of Wight Festival, TRNSMT and All Points East have moved their events to late-summer dates, while festivals that were already taking place in August and September, including Reading and Leeds, have spoken optimistically of their abilities to operate as normal.\nGlastonbury organisers have also applied for permission to hold a separate two-night concert in September, which would be on a much smaller scale than the main festival, which attracts 200,000 people to Somerset every year.\nEavis said she had \"no idea\" whether the September event would actually take place, but said she \"wanted to get the application in to be in with a chance\".\nSpeaking to Dermot O'Leary on Radio 2, she added that the main festival was ready to return in 2022.\n\"Pretty much, we're good for next year which is a very, very fortunate position to be in,\" she said. \"We've got a combination of bands that were due to play last year... and then we've also got some new people who are touring.\n\"So we've got a different line-up but there are some things you'll recognise as well.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Policing,Sarah Everard murder,Clapham,Metropolitan Police Service",
      "text": "The Metropolitan Police acted \"appropriately\" at a vigil for Sarah Everard in south London earlier this month, a police watchdog has found.\nThe force came under intense criticism after women were handcuffed and removed from crowds on Clapham Common.\nA report said there was too little communication between officers at the event but their response, amid Covid restrictions, had been \"measured\".\nIt called the media coverage a \"public relations disaster\" for police.\nMs Everard, 33, was last seen walking home nearby on 3 March. Her body was found a week later in woodland near Ashford, Kent - prompting a public debate over women's safety. \nHome Secretary Priti Patel, who commissioned the independent investigation into the force's decisions on the evening of the vigil, said she backed the police and the report had found they acted in the \"right way\" over the vigil.\nShe said there had been violence shown towards officers which was \"simply unacceptable\" and called for people not to \"prejudge the police\" based on footage because \"images can be taken out of context\".\nOrganisers of the vigil said the report was \"disappointing\" and said the Met will have to deal with years of trying to \"regain that trust\" over its policing of the event.\nHer Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) found that the force was \"justified\" in deciding that the risks of transmitting coronavirus \"were too great to ignore\" and officers \"did their best to peacefully disperse the crowd\".\nHowever, it added that \"there was insufficient communication between police commanders about changing events on the ground\".\nHMICFRS said calls for Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick to resign - including from Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey  - were \"unwarranted\".\nA spokesman for the Lib Dems said: \"We stand by our view that in the circumstances, the Met commissioner got the judgment on the vigil badly wrong.\"\nThe report said most protesters had behaved in a \"dignified and respectful\" way but some police, including female officers, faced abuse and hostility.\nThe inspectorate said \"the chorus of those condemning\" the force after the event showed \"a distinct lack of respect for public servants facing... a sensitive and complex situation\".\n\"It is one thing... to recognise that the scenes were worrying or upsetting (and to order an inspection such as this). It is another to jump to conclusions - and in doing so, undermine public confidence in policing - based on very limited evidence,\" the report said.\nWhatever the official report might say about the police response, the inspectors accept that the reputation of policing in London took a big hit on Clapham Common.  \nPowerful images of a woman under arrest, lying beside the boots of male police officers, were quickly reproduced around the world on social media. \nThe inspectors say a more conciliatory approach to criticism \"might have served the force's interests better\" but they also note the \"chorus\" of what they call \"unwarranted\" and \"uninformed\" condemnation of the police from people in positions of some responsibility.\nThe police were wrong in their reading of the law, the report finds. Some protests can take place legally, even in areas under Tier 4 lockdown. The Met could have worked with Reclaim These Streets to manage a safe and respectful vigil.  But they didn't because of \"confusion\" over the law.  \nAnd once again, the finger is pointed at the politicians. The report says this: \"It is incumbent on the legislature to provide a set of rules that is readily capable of being accurately interpreted and applied.\"  \nIf the police are largely vindicated by this report, the politicians are most certainly not. \nHMICFRS said \"a more conciliatory response after the event might have served the Met's interests better\".\nIt said the events had a \"materially adverse effect on public confidence in policing\". \nHMICFRS said its inspection involved reviewing documents and body camera video footage.\nMatt Parr, who led the inspection team, said: \"We found that there are some things the Met could have done better, but we saw nothing to suggest police officers acted in anything but a measured and proportionate way in challenging circumstances.\"\nMetropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe said officers had acted \"sensibly and proportionately... given we remain in a public health crisis\" and \"spent considerable time engaging, explaining and encouraging before considering any enforcement action\".\nShe said: \"We welcome the considered scrutiny of this event which highlights how a snapshot may not represent the full context of the challenges police face.\"\nKen Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said the outcome of the report was \"no surprise\" - and hit out at \"armchair critics\".\n\"The knee-jerk commentary from politicians of all parties - who as the report states were reacting to a snapshot on social media rather than the facts - has made the already difficult job of our colleagues in London incredibly harder. And more dangerous,\" he said.\nImages and footage from the resulting vigil on Clapham Common prompted widespread concern, including among the country's most prominent political figures.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"deeply concerned\" by the scenes, while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called them \"disturbing\".\nThe Labour leader said he \"remained concerned\" about the events but accepted the findings of the report.\nSir Keir added it was \"very important women and girls have confidence in the police\".\nLabour London Mayor Sadiq Khan - who called police actions \"unacceptable\" at the time - said he accepted the conclusions of the report.\nBut he said it was \"clear that trust and confidence of women and girls in the police and criminal justice system is far from adequate\", adding that the events had \"done further damage to this\".\nShaun Bailey, Conservative candidate for Mayor of London, said Mr Khan had \"serious questions\" to answer over his response to the policing of the demo.\nIn a tweet, the Labour MP for Streatham, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, suggested the report could \"heighten the impression that the police are not listening to women, or respecting the right to protest\".\nTensions between those who wanted to hold a vigil and police began before the evening of 13 March.\nAn official event had been planned by Reclaim These Streets - but the group called it off, saying police had failed to \"constructively engage\" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way.\nPeople turned up to Clapham Common despite the group asking them not to. \nReclaim These Streets said the HMICFRS report was evidence of \"institutional sexism running through the force\".\n\"We warned the Met Police... that forcing us to cancel would cause additional risk to public safety, as did Lambeth Council. They completely dismissed our warning and concerns,\" it said in a statement posted on Twitter.\nJamie Klingler, an organiser for the group who gave evidence to the HMICFRS, told the BBC police had \"created the situation and then were left to deal with it\".\nShe said protests were not banned under Covid laws but police had failed to provide Reclaim These Streets with the \"parameters\" in which to protest safely.\nPolice said the report had made it clear there were \"good reasons\" why they could not come to an agreement to allow the planned vigil to take place.\nAn inquest into Ms Everard's death has been adjourned until the conclusion of criminal proceedings.\nPC Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with her murder and kidnap.\nHe has been remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on 9 July ahead of a trial that is set to start on 25 October."

      "tags": "Sinn F\u00e9in,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Michelle O'Neill,Police Service of Northern Ireland,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) has announced a review of its decision not to prosecute anyone in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey.\nThe funeral last June attracted 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid restrictions were in place.\nThe actions of 24 Sinn F\u00e9in politicians were examined, including Ms O'Neill.\nSeparately, Health Minister Robin Swann urged people to stick with restrictions and not be distracted by politics. \nThe PPS said it has received requests for a review, including one from a politician on behalf of the public.\nUUP MLA Doug Beattie said he had submitted that request to the PPS on Tuesday on behalf of his constituents \"who have been materially affected both financially and emotionally by the original decision not to prosecute\".\nMr Storey, 64, was a senior republican figure and had formerly been the head of intelligence for the IRA in the 1990s.\nThe attendance of many senior Sinn F\u00e9in politicians at his funeral in west Belfast, at a time when strict limits on gatherings were in place, caused a political furore.\nThe decision not to prosecute anyone in relation to the funeral led to First Minister Arlene Foster on Tuesday calling for the resignation of Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Simon Byrne. \nShe said he had lost the confidence of the unionist community, but he has rejected calls to step down. \nOn Wednesday, the PPS said its review process will be carried out by a senior PPS lawyer who was not involved in taking the original decisions. \n\"This lawyer will be assisted by obtaining the advice of senior counsel who is independent of the PPS and was also not in any way involved in the original decisions,\" the body said. \nDUP MP Ian Paisley said he welcomed the review decision and that he had, on behalf of a constituent, instructed solicitors to commence a judicial review of the decision, but that has been paused until the review is completed. \nThe Northern Ireland Assembly will be recalled on Thursday for a censure motion against Sinn F\u00e9in for its members' attendance.\nMrs Foster told Good Morning Ulster that it was \"folly\" to ignore unionists' concerns, and those of the wider community.\n\"If Simon Byrne believes that he can dig in and stay, then we will have to look at other ways to deal with these issues.\"\nShe added: \"It cannot continue as normal.\" \nMrs Foster said Mr Byrne had \"engaged in leading an organisation into a position where they have lost the confidence of the unionist community\".\nParty colleague Gordon Lyons said on Wednesday morning that it continues to be the party's position that Michelle O'Neill should also resign. \nThe Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) and the TUV have also called on the chief constable to resign. They have questioned whether unionist representatives should remain on the policing board.\nMr Byrne said he would not step down, and that such an action would undermine his predecessor. \nOn Wednesday, Mr Byrne told the Nolan Show that police warned the organisers of Bobby Storey's funeral in advance that their plan would be a breach of Covid regulations. \nHe also insisted that no deals were done with the organisers. \n\"Nobody in the PSNI did a deal or looked the other way,\" Mr Byrne said. \nIt is understood that the Police Ombudsman is giving \"careful consideration\" to issues raised in correspondence to the office, believed to be from the DUP. \nThis review should not be overstated - it is something that happens, if not on a routine basis, certainly on a regular basis. \nThere is a well established internal process within the PPS whereby people who are unhappy with the original decisions can have an internal review of that decision. \nThis isn't a new call for evidence. \nThis is simply a fresh pair of eyes and a different mind casting their eye over the same evidence and seeing whether the original decision is one that they agree with.\nIn my experience, it would be unusual for the original decision in these cases to be overturned. \nMr Byrne said on Tuesday that enforcing the coronavirus regulations has been a \"consistently challenging and often uncomfortable role for my officers\", and that police did recommend prosecutions in the case.\n\"The decision not to prosecute does not change our view that what happened last summer when large numbers of people chose not to 'stay at home' at the height of a global pandemic was unnecessary, irresponsible and insensitive. It was wrong,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, a meeting of the Northern Ireland Policing Board will be held in private on Thursday, but the public element of the meeting has been cancelled.  \nMrs Foster said it was not possible to table a motion of no confidence in Mr Byrne, as 10 days notice is required. \nShe stopped short of saying whether DUP members of the board would step down, but did not rule it out.  \nDUP MLA and board member Mervyn Storey said he would challenge the chief constable over the \"appalling\" actions of the police in relation to the funeral and seek to find out how decisions were reached.\n\"Any senior officer who approved of or contributed to the decision-making around this policing operation is also in an untenable position,\" he said.\nMs O'Neill said in the wake of the PPS announcement on Tuesday that she wanted to once again apologise \"for the hurt that has been caused to so many, including to Bobby Storey's own family who have been thrust into the headlines at a time of immense grief\".\nOn Wednesday, the party's North Belfast MP John Finucane, who also attended the funeral and was interviewed by the PSNI, said \"mistakes were made\" over the way the funeral was organised. He also apologised. \nBut he said there was confusion over the Covid restrictions in place at the time. \n\"Mistakes were made, and I think that's very clear, and there are those who will struggle to accept our apology for that and I totally understand that,\" Mr Finucane said. \nSDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole said the recall of the assembly would provide a \"forum of accountability\". \nThe South Belfast MLA said the motion, which does not have any binding consequences, was not \"political game play\" but was about holding Sinn F\u00e9in ministers to account. \nSimon Byrne has made it clear that he's not for turning on this. There is a massive divide here - we know the anger that the DUP feels about this. \nArlene Foster said she has written to the Police Ombudsman, she's also raised it with the secretary of state and has called for Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to get involved and carry out their own assessment. \nThere are those today questioning why the DUP appear to be piling pressure on the chief constable rather than Sinn F\u00e9in, although we know that the DUP position remains that Michelle O'Neill should have stepped down at the time.\nClearly, Sinn F\u00e9in isn't going to do that and the DUP feels it also has to direct its anger at others involved. \nAll of this more widely reflects the view held within grassroots loyalism and unionism for some time now that they feel frustrated that the PSNI doesn't have their confidence in terms of how it has handled events over the last year. \nThe motion calls for the assembly to place on record its regret that the Sinn F\u00e9in representatives, who attended the funeral last June, breached political messaging and undermined efforts to prevent transmission of the virus. \nHealth Minister Robin Swann has urged people to stick with the Covid restrictions in place. \n\"What I would say to the people of Northern Ireland is don't let the political distraction that has come out over this take away from the public health message,\" he said. \nMr Swann said we are entering a challenging period over Easter, but we are facing a \"joint enemy\".\nUUP leader Steve Aiken said his party had \"real concerns\" about the PSNI's senior leadership, and would be referring the matter to the Police Ombudsman. \nHe said attendance at the Storey funeral had undermined the health message, but added that people should continue to follow Covid regulations and not be \"distracted\" from that.\nAlliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said that the party continues to have confidence in Mr Byrne. \n\"What we are very conscious of is the primary responsibility for what happened lies with Sinn F\u00e9in and it would be perverse if we end up in the situation where the agencies who had to handle the situation are being held to account rather than those who were primarily responsible for what unfolded last June.\"\nTUV leader Jim Allister has backed calls for Mr Byrne to resign, and said the decision not to prosecute had \"trashed\" Covid regulations. \nHe added that the recall motion would keep a \"spotlight on those who were the lawbreakers and got away with it and those at the same time who were the lawmakers\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Jair Bolsonaro,Brazil,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro is facing the biggest crisis of his presidency after the heads of the army, navy and air force all quit and the country recorded its highest daily Covid-19 death toll.\nThe unprecedented resignation of the defence chiefs is being seen as a protest at attempts by Mr Bolsonaro to exert undue control over the military.\nMr Bolsonaro's popularity has plummeted over his response to Covid-19.\nNearly 314,000 people have died, with a new daily record of 3,780 on Tuesday.\nWorldwide, Brazil has the second highest number of total confirmed Covid cases with more than 12.6m. Only the United States has more.\nIt is also the country with the second highest number of Covid-related deaths since the pandemic began and its daily deaths currently account for about a quarter of all coronavirus fatalities in the entire world. \nThe high number of cases has brought the health system to the verge of collapse. \nIn 18 of Brazil's 26 states and in the capital, Brasilia, the occupancy of intensive care units (ICU) is above 90%, according to Brazilian public health institute Fiocruz. In two states, Amap\u00e1 and Mato Grosso do Sul, ICU are completely full.\nThe latest surge in cases and deaths has been attributed to the spread of a highly contagious variant of the virus which was first detected in Japan in travellers from the city of Manaus, in Brazil's Amazon state. \nPreliminary data suggests the new variant could be up to twice as transmittable as the original version of the virus. \nNeighbouring countries are extremely worried the new variant. Bolivia, which shares a 3,400km-long (2,100 miles) border with Brazil, announced that it would focus its Covid immunisation programme on the border areas.\nBrazil's own vaccine programme has been beset by delays. So far, only 8% of its 211-million-strong population have received a first dose. \nAccording to a poll published by Datafolha in mid-March, 43% of Brazilians blame President Bolsonaro for the poor handling of the pandemic.\nThe far-right leader has consistently opposed lockdown measures, arguing that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the coronavirus itself. He has also told Brazilians to \"stop whining\" about the situation.\nWhile his stance made him popular with anti-lockdown protesters, his popularity is falling. In a poll conducted in mid-March, 54% of respondents said his management of the Covid crisis was \"bad\" or \"very bad\", up from 48% in January. \nMr Bolsonaro was a divisive figure even before the pandemic hit and the rapid spread of Covid seems to have further hardened opinions.\nThe Datafolha poll suggests that while the percentage of those who said they \"never trusted\" the president's words rose from 41% to 45% between January and March, those who say they \"always trust\" what has only dropped slightly from 19% to 18% in that same timeframe. \nHowever in recent days, his government has been furthered weakened by a deep political crisis.\nSince the pandemic began, Brazil has had no fewer than four health ministers. The latest is Marcelo Queiroga, a cardiologist, who replaced an army officer with no medical training on 16 March.\nBut while changes in the health ministry have become almost par for the course, this week also saw the foreign minister and five other cabinet ministers leave. \nForeign Minister Ernesto Ara\u00fajo had fallen foul of Congress, some of whose members accused him of mishandling relations with China, India and the US, which they said in turn led to Brazil not getting enough Covid vaccines from those countries.  \nBut it was Mr Bolsonaro's sacking of the defence minister, Fernando Azevedo e Silva, which caused the biggest storm so far. \nMr Bolsonaro and his minister had clashed over the issue of the armed forces' loyalty, which the defence minister said should be directed to upholding the constitution rather than supporting the president personally.\nIn a first in Brazilian history, on Tuesday the heads of the army, navy and air force all resigned together in a move signalling their opposition to the president and his sudden sacking of the defence minister's sacking.\nThe role of the armed forces in Brazilian politics has been a contentious issue since the country's return to democracy in 1985 after 21 years of military rule.\nPresident Bolsonaro, a former army captain, caused outrage in 2019 when he organised a commemoration of the 1964 coup which brought the military to power. \nHe also appointed active duty and retired generals to key positions in his cabinet, including the health ministry and the vice-presidency. \nBut in recent weeks, top members of the military seem to have increasingly distanced themselves from the president, culminating in the resignation of the armed forces heads on Tuesday. \nMr Bolsonaro's newly appointed minister of defence, Gen Walter Braga Netto, seems to be more closely aligned with the president. In one of his first statements he said that the 1964 coup had \"pacified the country\" and should be celebrated. \nMarking the coup's anniversary on 31 March, the general said that there had been a \"very real threat to peace and democracy\" and that the armed forces had confronted that threat in 1964."

      "tags": "Companies,Deliveroo,Stock markets",
      "text": "Deliveroo shares have plummeted on its stock market debut after a number of major UK investors expressed concerns about its gig economy worker model.\nShares in the food delivery business had been offered to investors at 390p each, but closed 14% lower at 284p per share, having fallen 30% initially.\nThe company had initially hoped for a share price of up to 460p.\nBut in recent weeks a number of high-profile fund managers said they would not be buying the shares.\nThe Deliveroo share sale is London's biggest stock market launch for a decade and the sharp fall on its first day of trading is a blow to the UK's ambitions to persuade more big tech companies to list in the UK.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said earlier this month that the listing of the Amazon-backed company was a \"true British tech success story\" that could clear the way for more initial public offerings by fast-growing technology firms.\nWhen ITV political editor Robert Peston asked on Wednesday whether he was embarrassed by the plunge in Deliveroo shares,Mr Sunak said: \"Gosh, no... share prices go up, share prices go down.\"\nMr Sunak cited Facebook's mixed start after its initial public offering in 2012, and its subsequent success.\nBut some analysts were not so complimentary. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said:\n\"Deliveroo has gone from hero to zero as the much-hyped stock market debut falls flat on its face.\n\"Initially there was a lot of fanfare about the Amazon-backed company making its shares available to the public, including the ability for customers to buy stock. Sadly, the narrative took a turn for the worst when multiple fund managers came out and said they wouldn't back the business due to concerns about working practices.\"\nDeliveroo, which has not yet made a profit, said on Monday it had chosen to \"price responsibly\" and sell its shares at the bottom of its planned price range at 390p due to \"volatile\" market conditions.\nSome of the UK's biggest investment fund managers, including Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, charity fund manager CCLA, Legal and General Investment Management and M&G said recently they would not buy shares in Deliveroo, citing concerns over including the working conditions of its riders and lack of investor power.\nThis was supposed to be a landmark day for Deliveroo, the wider UK tech sector and the London Stock Exchange. A British business founded just eight years ago had shown it could grow and prosper here without falling into overseas hands and by choosing London rather than New York for its stock market debut, setting an example for others to follow. \nBut the sharp fall this morning in shares - already priced at the conservative end of the planned range - showed that faith in Deliveroo's prospects was somewhat shaky. It was as if investors had suddenly woken up to something which should have been obvious all along - Deliveroo might have grown rapidly during the pandemic but it is still racking up big losses in what is a competitive food delivery market, \nThen there's the question of whether the company might have to improve pay and conditions for its delivery drivers following Uber's defeat before the Supreme Court. However loudly Deliveroo insisted that the Uber ruling had no relevance to its business, some investors weren't so sure, worrying that the path to profitability might be even tougher. \nAs the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said, pointing at Facebook, a shaky debut does not mean the shares won't soar in the longer term. Then again, Facebook didn't have to compete with Uber Eats and Just Eat in a market that looks a far more challenging place to make money than online advertising.\nFounder Will Shu will have shares that give him 20-times the voting power of other investors.\nChief executive Will Shu said he was \"very proud\" that Deliveroo was listing in London.\n\"In this next phase of our journey as a public company we will continue to invest in the innovations that help restaurants and grocers to grow their businesses, to bring customers more choice than ever before, and to provide riders with more work,\" he added.\nDeliveroo's self-employed drivers have seen a boom in demand during the Covid-19 pandemic, bringing food from restaurants to housebound customers.\nInitially, Deliveroo hoped to see that value as high as \u00a38.8bn, based on a share price of 390-460p. It scaled that back to \u00a37.6bn, but the share price drop wiped \u00a32.28bn off that.\nThe firm is making a portion of its stock available for customers, with delivery riders and restaurant partners also able to buy shares.\nDeliveroo is selling just over one-fifth of the group, while institutional investing trading started on Wednesday, the general public can start trading in its shares from 7 April.\nPrivate companies, as a way of raising cash, can start a process to list on a stock exchange.\nIn an initial public offering (IPO) companies offer shares to investors before listing.\nThe price of the shares is typically set by investment banks hired by the company to run the process.\nBut once the shares start to be publicly traded, prices are set by supply and demand.\nThe value of the shares, multiplied by how many there are, gives the market value of the company.\nSophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the biggest concern from investors was about worker rights: \"The flexible employee model of Deliveroo's riders is a huge pillar of the group's plans for success.\n\"If forced to offer more traditional employee benefits, like company pension contributions, Deliveroo's already thin margins would struggle to climb, and the road to profitability would look very tough indeed.\"\nShe said it was difficult to value the firm as it had yet to turn a profit. \nNeil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said that \"even pricing the initial public offering at the bottom of the range, Deliveroo was demanding too high a price tag for a loss-making delivery platform in a very competitive space with a questionable path to profitability.\n\"The books were covered, it was just plain mis-priced.\"\nHave you bought Deliveroo shares?

      "text": "The number of potholes filled in by councils in England and Wales has increased during the past year to almost 1.7 million, a survey suggests.\nThe Asphalt Industry Alliance said this figure - up 200,000 from 1.5 million in 2019-20 - equated to one being fixed every 19 seconds.\nThe total amount spent by local authorities on filling in potholes in 2020-1 was \u00a393.6m, it added.\nThe government said it was working to ensure \"smoother, safer journeys\".\nPotholes - collapsed areas in the tarmac resulting from the pressure of traffic and bad weather - can be dangerous to motorists and, in particular, cyclists.\nThe AA told the BBC last year that the pandemic, which has cut traffic levels, presented a \"unique opportunity\" for local authorities to fix more roads.\nBut, while the pothole-filling figure has risen this year, the Asphalt Industry Alliance's survey still suggests one million fewer were fixed than in 2014-15, when it went as high as 2.7 million.\nIt also found that the proportion of council-maintained roads in England deemed to be in a \"poor\" state fell from 21% in 2019-20 to 16% this year.\nBut in Wales it increased from 20% to 21%.\nMain roads and motorways in England and Wales are maintained by Highways England and the Welsh Government respectively, while councils look after the upkeep of local, usually more minor, roads.\nAA president Edmund King said many of these were still in a \"perilous state\" and that users had to \"run the gauntlet of potholes once they turn into their neighbourhoods\".\nHe added: \"Government and councils urging more active travel by getting people to switch from car to bicycle doesn't sit right with local roads riddled with potentially lethal potholes.\"\nThe Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, has called for \u00a310bn to be spent to bring roads \"up to scratch\".\nNicholas Lyes, head of roads policy at the RAC, said local authorities were \"grappling with crumbling road surfaces\" and called for a more \"long-term approach\" to funding.\nBut a Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"This government is providing \u00a32.5bn in funding over five years to help councils improve their roads, to ensure all road users have smoother, safer journeys.\"\nThe government has published daily figures on road use by motorised vehicles in Great Britain since the beginning of the pandemic last year.\nThey dipped as low as 23% of the usual level during the first lockdown but are currently at about 80%."

      "text": "The decision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) not to recommend any prosecutions in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey has divided opinion across the political spectrum.\nMr Storey, a senior republican figure, died in June last year when Covid restrictions were in place.\nHis funeral attracted more than 2,000 mourners - including Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill - causing a political furore.\nHere are some of the reactions to the PPS decision not to prosecute.\nSinn F\u00e9in President Mary Lou McDonald said it was good the process had \"reached a conclusion\".\nThe decision not to prosecute \"is the decision arrived at independently by those who are charged to make these decisions,\" she told Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9.\n\"I understand at the time of that funeral, that there was alarm and some hurt at the number of people that were out to pay their respects. \n\"Certainly for our part, for my part, I regret that that hurt was felt,\" she added.\nWhile DUP leader Arlene Foster has called on PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne to step down over the PPS' decision not to prosecute, some of her party colleagues went further.\nEast Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell said he was \"flabbergasted\" by the outcome.\nHe said the outcome had done \"untold damage\" to the police and the PPS.\nStormont's Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, whose father died last spring, tweeted that he was \"disgusted\" with the decision.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the Sinn F\u00e9in leadership must be held accountable.\n\"We should be clear, a decision not to prosecute is not a determination that no law was broken and it is not a verdict on the actions of those who took part,\" said the Foyle MP.\n\"Public rules that were communicated with the weight of law, and respected with that burden by so many families and circles of friendship, were egregiously breached by people who had a full hand in setting those regulations. That demands accountability\".\nThe SDLP is seeking to bring back MLAs early from Easter recess through a recall petition to discuss the decision by the PPS not to prosecute.A recall petition needs the signatures of 30 MLAs to be successful.SDLP sources said they were confident of reaching that figure.However it would be up to the assembly speaker to decide when any recall would happen.\nThe PPS decision was \"regrettable\", said UUP leader Steve Aiken.\n\"That in the height of the Covid pandemic Sinn F\u00e9in saw fit to very publicly and visibly flout the rules and guidelines that applied to everyone else in Northern Ireland should be of concern to us all.\n\"Sinn F\u00e9in have clearly been allowed to get away with something that no other organisation or citizen would have been allowed to do and that has very serious implications.  \n\"Rules and the law must apply equally to everyone, or else they might as well not exist.\n\"That there is now a very distinct perception that there is two-tier policing in Northern Ireland is a matter that must be addressed\".\nAlliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said: \"The onus lies with Sinn F\u00e9in to belatedly take responsibility for their actions,\" he said.\n\"It undermined the entire messaging of the executive and others last year - Michelle O'Neill needs to issue an unreserved, unambiguous public apology on the matter, and now show some leadership.\"\nHowever, Mr Farry said he did not think PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne should resign.\n\"There is obviously a major emotional reaction to what happened and the lack of accountability to what transpired last summer - I think the police are the wrong target in that regard.\n\"I think the focus has to be on Sinn F\u00e9in and holding them to account and demanding that they do far better in terms of recognising the hurt and damage that has been done\".\nTUV leader Jim Allister said the decision not to prosecute was \"wholly perverse\".\n\"Fear of offending, once again, republicans and favour towards the Sinn F\u00e9in leadership who are apparently above the law, the very law that they made,\" he said.\nGreen Party leader Clare Bailey said there had been a failure of political leadership \"at a time when people needed it the most\".\n\"Apologies to date have been reserved and fall short of acknowledging the standards required from those in senior public office,\" she said.\nMs Bailey added: \"People have sacrificed so much as we enter into the second year of the pandemic. This in spite of the lack of leadership from people who knew better but chose to act otherwise.\""

      "tags": "Xinjiang,Human rights,China",
      "text": "Women who made allegations last month of rape and sexual abuse in Chinese detention camps have been harassed and smeared in the weeks since. Rights groups say the attacks are typical of an aggressive campaign by China to silence those who speak up.\nQelbinur Sedik was making breakfast when the video call came, and the sight of her sister's name made her nervous. Many months had passed since the two had spoken. In fact, many months had passed since Sedik had spoken to any of her family in China.\nSedik was in the kitchen of her temporary home in the Netherlands, where she shared a room with several other refugees, mostly from Africa. Two weeks earlier, she and three other women had spoken to the BBC for a story about alleged rape and torture in China's secretive detention camps in the Xinjiang region, where Sedik worked as a camp teacher.\nNow her sister was calling.\nShe hit answer, but when the picture appeared it wasn't her sister on the screen, it was a policeman from her hometown in Xinjiang.\n\"What are you up to Qelbinur?\" he said, smiling. \"Who are you with?\"\nThis was not the first time the officer had called from her sister's phone. This time, Sedik took a screenshot. When he heard the sound it made, the officer removed his numbered police jacket, Sedik said. She took another screenshot.\nIn conversations with the BBC over the past few weeks, 22 people who have left Xinjiang to live abroad described a pattern of threats, harassment, and public character attacks they said were designed to deter them from speaking out about alleged human rights abuses back home.\nAccording to UN estimates, China has detained more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims in camps in Xinjiang. The Chinese state has been accused of an array of abuses there including forced labour, sterilisation, torture, rape, and genocide. China denies those charges, saying its camps are \"re-education\" facilities for combatting terrorism.\nAmong the few who have fled Xinjiang and spoken publicly, many have received a call like the one to Sedik that morning - from a police officer or government official at their family home, or from a relative summoned to a police station. Sometimes the calls contain vague advice to consider the welfare of their family in Xinjiang, sometimes direct threats to detain and punish relatives. \nOthers have been publicly smeared in press conferences or state media videos; or been subjected to barrages of messages or hacking attempts directed at their phones. (Last week, Facebook said that it had discovered \"an extremely targeted operation\" emanating from China to hack Uyghur activists abroad.) \nSome of those who spoke to the BBC - from the US, UK, Australia, Norway, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, and Turkey - provided screenshots of threatening WhatsApp, WeChat and Facebook messages; others described in detail what had been said in phone and video calls. Everyone described some form of detention or harassment of their family members in Xinjiang by local police or state security officials.\nWhen Qelbinur Sedik recounted the call from the policeman that morning, via her sister's phone, she buried her head in her hands and wept. \n\"He said, 'You must bear in mind that all your family and relatives are with us. You must think very carefully about that fact.' \n\"He stressed that several times, then he said, 'You have been living abroad for some time now, you must have a lot of friends. Can you give us their names?'\nWhen she refused, the officer put Sedik's sister on the call, she said, and her sister shouted at her, 'Shut up! You should shut up from now on!', followed by a string of insults.\n\"At that point I couldn't control my emotions,\" Sedik said. \"My tears flowed.\"\nBefore the officer hung up, Sedik said, he told her several times to go to the Chinese embassy so the staff there could arrange her safe passage back to China - a common instruction in these kinds of calls.\n\"This country opens its arms to you,\" he said.\nReports of this type of intimidation are not new, but Uyghur activists say China has become more aggressive in response to growing outrage over alleged rights abuses in Xinjiang. The Chinese government has gone on the attack in public in recent weeks, directing a slew of misogynistic abuse specifically at women who have spoken up about alleged sexual assaults.\nAt recent press conferences, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin and Xinjiang official Xu Guixiang held up pictures of women who gave first-hand accounts of sexual abuse in detention camps and called them \"liars\"; said one was \"morally depraved\" and of \"inferior character\"; and accused another of adultery. One woman was branded a \"bitch of bad moral quality\" by a former husband in what appeared to be a staged video put out by state media; another was called a \"scumbag\" and \"child abuser\" by a Chinese official.\nWang, the foreign ministry spokesman, revealed what he said were private medical records, claiming that they disproved one woman's account of having an IUD forcibly fitted. Officials have also claimed that sexually transmitted diseases were responsible for fertility problems suffered by former camp detainees, rather than violent physical abuse, and put out a range of propaganda material calling the women \"actresses\".\nTursunay Ziawudun, a former camp detainee who is now in the US, was one of the women attacked at a press conference. When she watched it, she was relieved Wang had not mentioned her family, she said, but \"deeply sad\" about the rest. Ziawudun has previously recounted being raped and tortured during her detention in Xinjiang in 2018.\n\"After all the horrors they inflicted on me, how can they be so cruel and shameless as to attack me publicly?\" she said in a phone interview after the press conference.\nThe attacks on Ziawudun and others showed that China was \"adopting misogyny as a style of public communication,\" said James Millward, a professor of Chinese history at Georgetown University. \n\"We have these various women coming forward and telling very credible stories about how they've been abused,\" he said. \"And the response shows a complete tone deafness and misunderstanding of how sexual assault and sexual trauma is  being understood and treated now. Besides being horrifying, it's also completely counterproductive for the Chinese state.\"\nThe Chinese embassy in London told the BBC that China stood by its assertions that the women's accounts of rape and sexual abuse were lies, and said it was reasonable to publicise private medical records as evidence.\nTwo other women who spoke to the BBC have been the targets of what appear to be highly staged videos, published by Chinese state media, in which their family and friends insult them and accuse them of stealing money and telling lies. According to a report published last month by the US-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, China has produced at least 22 videos in which individuals are allegedly forced to make scripted statements, often denouncing their family members as liars or thieves. \nAziz Isa Elkun, a Uyghur exile in the UK, had not been able to contact his elderly mother and sister for years when he saw them in a Chinese state media video calling him a liar and a shame on the family. Elkun's crime had been to draw attention to the destruction of Uyghur cemeteries in Xinjiang, including his father's tomb. \n\"You could tell what they were saying was scripted, but it was still extremely painful to see my elderly mother in a Chinese propaganda film,\" Elkun said. \nQelbinur Sedik is worried a similar video of her husband could be released any day, she said. He told her on the phone late last year that Chinese officials had visited him at home in Xinjiang and forced him to recite lines calling her a liar. He said he struggled so much to say the lines correctly that it took four hours to film the short clip.\nAnother common form of harassment described by those who spoke to the BBC was pressure to spy on fellow Uyghurs and organisations that scrutinise China, often in return for contact with family, guarantees of relatives' safety, or access to visas or passports.\nA Uyghur British citizen who did not want to be named said he was harassed repeatedly by intelligence officials during and after a visit to Xinjiang and told to spy on Uyghur groups and on Amnesty International, by joining the charity as a volunteer. When he refused, he received repeated calls from his brother pleading with him to do it, he said.\nJevlan Shirmemmet, who left Xinjiang to study in Turkey, gave the BBC a recording of a call he received a few weeks after posting on social media about his family's mass arrest in Xinjiang. The caller, who said he was from the Chinese embassy in Ankara, told Shirmemmet to \"write down everyone you've been in contact with since you left Xinjiang,\" and send an email \"describing your activities,\" so that \"the mainland might reconsider your family's situation\". Another Uyghur in exile in Turkey described a similar call from the same embassy.\nMustafa Aksu, a 34-year-old activist in the US who said his parents had been harassed in Xinjiang, showed the BBC text and voice messages from an old school friend - now a Chinese police officer - who Aksu said was pressuring him to provide information about Uyghur activists.\n\"He says, 'Maybe we can co-operate. I'm sure you must miss your parents.'\"\nNot everyone feels that they can refuse these requests. \"When I say no, they get my younger brother and sister to call and tell me to do it,\" said a Uyghur student in Turkey, who provided screenshots of the messages from police. \"They could send my brother and sister to a concentration camp. What choice do I have?\" she said.\nSome have sought to protect themselves by gradually cutting off means of contact. \"You can throw away the phone and cancel the number,\" said Abdulweli Ayup, a Uyghur linguist in Norway, \"but you cancel your number and they contact you on Facebook; you delete Facebook and they contact you by email.\" \nOthers have tried beyond hope to stay in touch. A Uyghur exile in the Netherlands said she still sends pictures and emojis to her young son and parents, four years after her number was blocked. \"Maybe one day they will see,\" she said.\nThe BBC was not able to independently verify the identities of the people behind the calls and messages provided by various interviewees, but Uyghur rights activists say efforts to coerce Uyghurs to spy for the Chinese government are common. \n\"It comes as an offer first - 'You won't have any more visa problems', or 'We can help your family' - that kind of thing,\" said Rahima Mahmut, a prominent UK-based Uyghur activist. \"Later it comes as a threat,\" she said.\nThe UK Foreign Office told the BBC it was \"closely monitoring reports that members of the Uyghur diaspora in the UK have been harassed by the Chinese authorities\", and that it had \"raised our concerns directly with the Chinese embassy in London\".\nThe Chinese embassy in London told the BBC that the allegations in this story were \"completely untrue\" and it was \"baffling that the BBC so readily believes whatever is said by a few 'East Turkestan' elements outside China\" - using another term for the Xinjiang region.\nDespite the growing public outrage over alleged abuses in Xinjiang, the number of people who have spoken publicly remains vanishingly small compared with the estimated number detained. China has been tremendously successful at silencing people through fear, said Nury Turkel, a commissioner on the US Commission on International Religious Freedom. \n\"Millions of people have disappeared into the camps, and yet we have only a handful of Uyghurs speaking out against the detention of their loved ones,\" Turkel said. \"Why? Because they are afraid.\"\nSome Uyghurs who have criticised China have managed to maintain limited contact with loved ones. Ferkat Jawdat, a prominent activist in the US, speaks to his mother regularly now, after campaigning publicly for her release from detention. She is under house arrest, and her calls are monitored, but she is there on the other end of the line. \nIt can be hard to make sense of why some Uyghurs are harassed and others are not; some allowed contact with loved ones and others not. Some have speculated that China is \"A/B testing\" - trying to work out whether fear or kindness is more efficient. For the thousands who are cut off, it can feel ruthless and arbitrary.\nJawdat knows that the likelihood of seeing his mother again before she dies is diminishing, so when they speak on the phone they speak carefully. He did tell her once that Chinese state media had put out a video of her saying she was ashamed of him. She said she knew, they had come to film it a few days earlier. \"How did I look?\" she joked. Then, taking a risk, she told him she was proud of him.\n\"It was the unscripted version,\" he said."

      "text": "Prince Harry and Meghan were legally married at Windsor Castle, the Archbishop of Canterbury has said.\nDuring her interview with Oprah Winfrey, Meghan said the couple exchanged vows three days before their official wedding in May 2018.\nJustin Welby said he would have been \"committing a serious crime\" if he had signed the marriage certificate on the actual day, knowing it was false.\nBut he met the couple \"in a private and pastoral setting\" beforehand, he said.\nDuring a revelatory two-hour interview earlier this month, Meghan told Oprah: \"You know, three days before our wedding we got married.\"\nShe said: \"No-one knows that. But we called the archbishop and we just said: 'Look, this thing, this spectacle is for the world, but we want our union between us.'\n\"So the vows that we have framed in our room are just the two of us in our backyard with the Archbishop of Canterbury.\"\nThe archbishop was speaking to a group of European newspapers when he was asked to address Meghan's remarks.\nHe told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: \"I met the Duke and Duchess of Sussex several times in a private and pastoral setting before the official ceremony on Saturday 19 May 2018. That day was the day of the marriage. \n\"If I had signed the certificate on a different day, I would have been committing a serious crime. The marriage was celebrated on the 19 May. But I won't say what occurred in our other meetings.\"\nThe Sun newspaper published a copy of Prince Harry and Meghan's wedding certificate which showed the couple were legally married at Windsor Castle.\nThe document was dated 19 May 2018 and showed the names of Prince Charles and Meghan's mother Doria Ragland as witnesses."

      "text": "Scientists in southern Argentina have found the skull of a large meat-eating dinosaur named \"one who causes fear\" in the local Mapuche language.\nThe horned Llukalkan aliocranianus was around 5 metres (16 feet) long and roamed South America 85 million years ago. \nResearchers found remains nearby of another carnivorous dinosaur, something they said was highly unusual.\nThe findings from Patagonia were published on Tuesday. \nLike the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Llukalkan dinosaur was two-legged with very short arms, but was medium-sized compared to the giant T. rex.\nIt also had short horns and tiny fingers. It was estimated to weigh between one and five tonnes, slightly lighter than an adult African elephant.\nIt was probably a fearsome predator, with a large skull and a strong bite, according to the research published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.\nThe findings suggest it had better hearing than other dinosaurs in the abelisaurids family which likely made it a better hunter, Federico Gianechini, a palaeontologist at the National University of San Luis Argentina told Reuters news agency.\nIt lived on earth during the Cretaceous period, the last era before dinosaurs were wiped out.\nClose to Llukalkhan's skull, scientist found the fossilised remains of a slightly larger meat-eating dinosaur called Viavenator exxoni.\nMr Gianechini said it is very unusual to find two abelisaurids living close together at the same time.\n\"Llukalkan was a little smaller than Viavenator, although, if they lived together, they surely shared the same ecological niche and fed on the same prey, so they would have competed with each other and - why not - even eaten each other,\" he told Reuters.\nA series of important dinosaur discoveries have been made in Argentina in recent decades. \nIn 2014 the remains of a dinosaur that weighed around the same as 14 elephants were found - it was thought to be the biggest ever discovered."

      "tags": "Shielding,Disability,Spinal muscular atrophy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Within the month of September 2019 Michaela Hollywood flew across America eight times, such were the demands of a leadership programme she was on. Since coronavirus, however, she has only been able to leave her home five times.\nIn early 2020 Michaela was scrolling through the news when she found an article about a \"weird virus in China\". As someone with health difficulties, the 30-year-old immediately started making changes to her life.\n\"I tried to stop touching any surfaces outside my home,\" she says. \"If I'd waited until the extremely clinically vulnerable letter had come in, who knows what would have happened.\"\nMichaela, from Northern Ireland, has spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic and degenerative condition which weakens muscles and impacts movement. She is a full-time wheelchair-user, is unable to sit-up unaided and her breathing muscles are paralysed.\nMichaela went about life cautiously but continued with cinema trips and bingo with her mum - until her final night of freedom, although she didn't know that when she went out.\n\"It was big money night at bingo,\" she says. \"My phone started flashing to say that we had community transmission in Northern Ireland, and I knew that would be it. I decided to shield.\"\nIt was 12 March 2020 - one day after the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic.\nAt this point there was no guidance offered in the UK. Friends who had previously been part of Michaela's medical team suggested she take \"every precaution\".\nShe went from jet setting across America for her work in disability rights, to trying to settle into life at home under lockdown just six months later.\nShe lives with her parents, while her sisters, brother-in-law, nieces and nephews live in the next house along. \"I still had family around me, so I know I'm really privileged,\" she says.   \nBut the initial weeks and months of lockdown were taken up with solving problems.\nMichaela uses personal assistants to help with everyday tasks like washing and eating, but that became problematic when protective clothing, known as PPE, ran out because of high demand.\nThere was one way around it.\n\"Two of them moved in,\" she says. \"We have a spare room, but it was full of junk. So we had a day where we emptied the room. I'm really thankful to them for making it happen.\"\nWhile this newly-formed bubble solved one problem there were others.  \nMastering the balance between having medication stocked at home and ordering new batches in time, while allowing for delays, was tricky. And food was a headache too. Michaela's condition affects her ability to swallow and so while she can eat solid food, it needs to be soft.\nFor the first four months, securing online deliveries without food substituted for something she might not be able to eat was near-impossible and she relied on what she had stockpiled pre-lockdown.  \n\"I lived on beans and soup,\" she says. \"Once I was able to get on to the register as a vulnerable person it wasn't too bad.\"\nThen there was the mundanity of lockdown everyone has faced for a year too. But for Michaela there was no possibility of a walk outside or meeting a friend, socially distanced.\n\"I watched Star Wars for the first time, and I am still trying to watch every episode of The Simpsons. It's all those little things that sound nothing but actually keep you busy.\"\nAlthough stuck inside, technology did open up the world for some disabled people.\n\"There was a sense of euphoria because all of a sudden there were events we could go to - there were concerts online, access to university,\" Michaela says.\n\"I was looking at all these things and thinking how much better this is for our community. \n\"That's not saying we would choose that every time, we wouldn't, but we would certainly need it sometimes.\"\nIt wasn't being confined to the house which Michaela found most frustrating, but other people's behaviour, including those who could but refused to wear masks.\n\"It's not straightforward to shield when you're also physically disabled,\" she says. \"I have to bring people in from the community into my house every day - I can't stay in my room on my own.\"\nThis was one reason why her PAs moved in, so she didn't have to deal with a variety of agency staff.\nMichaela also implemented her own rules - she wouldn't step on ground beyond the house boundary until community transmissions stopped.\nCome June, that possibility arrived when Northern Ireland recorded no new cases.\n\"I made the most of that,\" she says.\nHaving got a new job to support disabled people with technology, Michaela hit the shops for new work clothes and managed to get a private cinema screening of Tenet, because no one else had booked. \nShe only had three other trips outdoors, all for medical appointments - X-rays, blood tests and her first Covid vaccination. It still felt like freedom.\n\"That was a period of grace for me and I still genuinely believe that it should have been two weeks for shielders to get out and have some respite,\" she says.\nSome European countries like Spain did implement a timetable to ensure everyone could enjoy time outside - something Michaela thinks the UK should think about next time.\nNon-shielders were banned from going out during certain hours to allow those shielding or the over 70s to go out safely.\nDuring the interview, Michaela's phone rings and she says she has to take it, but wants to keep me on Zoom. \n\"You have just witnessed the greatest moment of my life,\" she beams, looking slightly shocked as she ends the call.\n\"There's a drug for my condition called Risdiplam that has just become available in Northern Ireland - I can only call it liquid gold.\"\nRisdiplam helps the body produce the protein that people with SMA are missing, which causes muscle weakness. It can halt the progression of SMA and may encourage improvements. \n\"For the first time ever, my speech should hopefully become clearer,\" she says. \"Wow - I might be able to lift my hand up to my mouth again. \n\"It's turned the worst year of my life into one of the most changing.\"\nWith Michaela's first order arriving this week it brings hope that things are getting better.\nIn England and Wales 1 April signals the end of shielding. In Northern Ireland shielders are advised to continue taking extra precautions until further notice.\n\"I would need to know that community transmission has all but stopped before things change for me,\" Michaela says.\nBut that doesn't stop her dreaming about that day. \n\"There is an ice cream parlour, not far from here. It's by the seaside and they do the most incredible ice cream.\"\nFor more disability news, follow BBC Ouch on Twitter and Facebook and subscribe to the weekly podcast on BBC Sounds."

We're not angry, we just want to know you're ok'.\"\nMr Okorogheye was last seen boarding the 23 bus southbound in Ladbroke Grove at about 20:45 GMT on 22 March.\nCCTV footage showed he was wearing black clothing and was carrying a black satchel with a white Adidas logo.\nIt is unknown where he got off the bus and police have asked anyone who may have been around Ladbroke Grove at the time to get in touch.\nMs Joel described her son as \"a very civilised boy, he's very focused, intelligent, loved by everyone\". \nShe said: \"We feel he has been taken away - he went to a friend and something happened there.\n\"If anybody has seen Richard, please tell Richard to come home. \n\"Please, tell him to come home. We need him at home.\" \nMs Joel, a nurse, said she returned home from work at about 21:00 GMT and assumed her son, who had only been leaving the house for regular blood transfusions, was in his bedroom.\nHis condition affects how red blood cells work in the body.\nShe claimed that when his disappearance was first reported, police \"did nothing\" and initially told her the 19-year-old was an adult, who could go out and come back whenever he wanted.\n\"I said 'he's a young adult with a medical condition and he has left home without his medication'.\"\nShe said she told officers he had \"no jacket, no money, so I'm worried, I'm concerned about his wellbeing\" but the \"response was 'sorry'\".\n\"Every time I called them, they said there was no update,\" she said.\n\"If you're doing something there, should be a result, no? \n\"They kept telling us there's no update - that was not very encouraging.\"\nShe said that it was only on Sunday and Monday that she \"felt like they were doing something\".\nShe added that her son, who has also in the past been known to frequent the Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham areas, had been \"struggling to cope\" with his university course.\nThe Met said it was \"following every lead possible\" to find the teenager, including speaking with witnesses and examining CCTV.\nCh Insp Claire McCarthy added officers have been \"working tirelessly to locate Richard\"."

      "tags": "Police Service of Northern Ireland",
      "text": "Simon Byrne was appointed as the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland in May 2019, but his tenure to date has been notable for a number of setbacks and controversies. \nHe arrived with 36 years of policing behind him - a third of it at high rank, with most of his career having been spent at Merseyside Police.\nMr Byrne held senior positions there - and then the Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police - before his appointment as chief constable of Cheshire in 2014.\nThat job ended in 2017 in controversial circumstances, after he was accused of bullying and humiliating staff.\nHe was cleared of 74 misconduct allegations with a tribunal finding much of what was claimed was either exaggerated or probably did not happen. \nWhen he officially took over from his predecessor Sir George Hamilton on 1 July 2019 - the beginning of a five-year contract - Mr Byrne became the fifth chief constable in the PSNI's history.\nHere's a look at the notable events of his time as chief constable so far: \nSimon Byrne is appointed the PSNI's new chief constable, replacing the outgoing Sir George Hamilton.\nThe other candidates for the top policing job were Steve Martin and Mark Hamilton, both PSNI officers, and Jon Boutcher, the head of Bedfordshire Police.\nThe head of the Policing Board says that Mr Byrne \"brings a wealth of strategic and operational experience to the post\".\nAlthough not a contractual requirement, Mr Byrne decides to move to Northern Ireland from England, tweeting that he looked forward to living \"full-time in Northern Ireland as an active member of the community\".\nMr Byrne is criticised for suggesting the children of paramilitaries could be taken into care.\nHe clarifies his remarks afterwards saying he was \"not suggesting children can be used as weapons in the fight against paramilitary crime\".\nThe chief constable first made the comments at a conference on the use of stop and search powers.\nHe said his message to paramilitaries was: \"You carry on doing this and we will have your house, if you keep going we will have your car, we will have your kids, we will have your benefits and we will put you in jail.\"\nMr Byrne says he was happy to withdraw \"the interpretation that children are pawns, if that's what's been heard\", adding it was not his intention.\nSinn F\u00e9in's Gerry Kelly calls the original remarks \"unacceptable\" and says the comments had caused \"deep worry\". \nMr Byrne apologises after tweeting a photo of himself with officers holding rifles outside a PSNI station in Crossmaglen on Christmas Day.\nSome nationalist politicians criticise him, saying the image is offensive to the local community.\nIn a statement in January 2020, Mr Byrne says his message was \"never meant as a comment on the community of Crossmaglen and South Armagh\".\n\"I am sorry for any offence that has been caused,\" he adds.\nThe PSNI launches a new recruitment campaign, backed by First Minister Arlene Foster, and notably, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill.\nMr Byrne says the attendance of Ms O'Neill at its launch got it off to \"the best possible start\".\nIt came amid continued concerns over the PSNI's ability to increase its numbers of Catholic officers.\nSinn F\u00e9in has historically been critical of the role of the police in Northern Ireland, both with the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which replaced it in 2001.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says her attendance at the recruitment campaign launch \"speaks volumes\".\n\"We need a PSNI that is reflective in terms of the community in which it serves,\" she said.\nThe PSNI saw numbers rise from 6,900 to 7,100.\nHowever, the Northern Ireland Executive soon found itself swamped by other financial priorities as the Covid-19 pandemic hit.\nSimon Byrne is forced to backtrack on a proposal to \"tinker\" with the force's badge on uniforms, admitting the idea was \"a non-starter\".\nAs part of a branding refresh, he had publicly floated the idea of a modified emblem.\nIt would have removed the words Police Service Northern Ireland from the badge used on signs, vehicles and uniforms.\nUnionist parties and the Police Federation strongly opposed the idea.\nFollowing the death of George Floyd in the US, Black Lives Matter protests take place in Londonderry and Belfast on 6 June.\nBetween 60 and 70 fines are issued to those attending the anti-racism demonstrations, provoking accusations of inconsistency in the PSNI's approach to Covid-19 regulations.\nCovid-19 lockdown measures in place at the time banned people gathering in groups.\n\"On any other day, this police service would be standing right beside the organisers to facilitate their protest and their right to have their voices heard about the unjustifiable and unnecessary death of George Floyd,\" says Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd.\nOrganisers say efforts were made to maintain social distancing between those in attendance at the protests, which took place at Belfast's Custom House Square and the Guildhall in Derry.\nThe funeral of IRA man Bobby Storey takes place in west Belfast on 30 June, with images of huge numbers lining the streets in a period of strict Covid-19 regulations. \nFootage of the funeral causes huge controversy.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill is among the mourners and her attendance leads to the biggest crisis in NI politics since devolution was restored in January 2020. \nMs O'Neill was part of the funeral cortege, which Sinn F\u00e9in said included no more than 30 people,\nCritics suggest social distancing was not maintained among the crowds which lined the streets as the hearse drove by, nor by the large groups of people who walked behind the hearse at a greater distance.\nLockdown regulations at the time stated a maximum of 30 people were allowed to gather together outdoors. \nNo arrests are made by the PSNI for breaches of coronavirus regulations, but police begin an investigation.\nA number of arrests are made in Operation Arbacia, a MI5-PSNI counter-terrorism operation targeting the alleged leadership of the New IRA.\nTo date, nearly 50 charges have been brought against 10 individuals who have been remanded in custody. \nThe New IRA formed in 2012 and is said to have about 500 supporters and fewer than 100 prepared to plan and carry out attacks, principally against the police.\nIn 2019, it murdered journalist Lyra McKee during disorder in Londonderry.\nA PSNI investigation into potential Covid-19 breaches at Mr Storey's funeral is completed, with a file submitted to public prosecutors. \nTwenty-four people are interviewed as part of the investigation, including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill.\nDeputy chief constable of Cumbria, Mark Webster, is brought in by the PSNI to oversee and direct inquiries. \nUnionists are critical of the pace of the investigation.\nSimon Byrne apologises after the Police Ombudsman found justification in claims the handling of the Black Lives Matter protests was unfair and discriminatory.\nA report by Police Ombudsman Marie Anderson states it was \"not intentional and not based on race or ethnicity\".\nHowever, confidence in policing among some in minority communities has been \"severely damaged\", it says.\nMr Byrne says: \"The time is right to show some humility and say sorry.\"\nSimon Byrne apologises over the PSNI's handling of a commemoration event to mark the anniversary of a gun attack, in which five people were murdered by loyalists.\nAn officer was suspended and another redeployed after a man was arrested at the event.\nSimon Byrne acknowledged questions over his future at a news conference but said he would not quit.\n\"Clearly that's the question on everybody's lips, but I'm not a quitter.\"\nThe Public Prosecution Service announces it has not recommended prosecution for anyone concerned in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey.\nDirector of Public Prosecutions Stephen Herron said he acknowledged the widespread public concern over the attendances at the funeral.\nHe added that the \"lack of clarity and coherence within the regulations and the prior engagement between organisers and the police\" would \"pose an insurmountable difficulty\" if prosecutions were brought.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster calls for Mr Byrne to resign, arguing that his position was now \"untenable\".\nSpeaking to the press later, Mr Byrne says he would not resign."

      "title": "Minimum wage rises for two million workers",
      "tags": "UK National Minimum Wage,UK economy",
      "text": "About two million of the UK's lowest-paid workers will get a pay rise from Thursday as the minimum wage goes up.\nThe National Living Wage will rise 2.2% to \u00a38.91, the equivalent of more than \u00a3345 a year for a full-time employee.\nIt will also be given to 23 and 24-year-olds for the first time, not just those aged 25 and over.\nStatutory rates for apprentices and those aged between 18 and 22 will also rise, along with the voluntary \"Real Living Wage\".\nHowever, hundreds of thousands of low-paid workers on furlough will see no uplift at all after they were excluded.\nMinisters said the increases to minimum wages would particularly benefit workers in sectors such as retail, hospitality, cleaning and maintenance.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said it would be \"a welcome boost to families right across the UK\".\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng urged \"all workers\" to check their pay packets to ensure they were \"getting what they are entitled to, and remind employers of their duty to pay the correct wage\". \nWhat is the minimum wage?\nThe voluntary Real Living Wage will rise to \u00a310.85 an hour in London and \u00a39.50 outside the capital, but only a small minority of employers have signed up to pay it. \nThe foundation promoting it warned there was still a \"substantial gap\" between the statutory rates and one based on the actual cost of living.\nMuch of the UK's retail and hospitality industries remain closed because of Covid, meaning many of the lowest-paid workers are on furlough and will miss out on a pay rise.\nThey will continue to get 80% of their usual income, based on pre-pandemic rates for the minimum wage. \nAbout 800,000 of the lowest-paid workers were on furlough in February, according to the House of Commons Library. \nThe government said furloughed workers who returned to work after 1 April would move on to the new minimum wage rates for hours worked. \nBut shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds hit out at the \"pay freeze\" for furloughed workers.\n\"Hitting Britain's families in their pockets isn't just wrong - it's economically illiterate. If families have less money to spend, then businesses will suffer and the recovery will take longer,\" she said.\nFrances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, also said nobody should be expected to get by on less than the minimum wage.\n\"Low-paid workers on furlough have bills to pay like everyone else,\" she said.\n\"The government should guarantee that everybody will get at least the full rate of the minimum wage. And it should give all minimum wage workers a decent pay rise.\" \nMike Hawking of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation described the boost to the minimum wage as \"necessary\", but said that the pandemic had revealed the urgency of taking further steps to tackle in-work poverty.\n\"As we start to recover from the impact of the last year, too many workers are finding that minimum wage increases are being wiped out due to inadequate social security, insufficient hours available to them, and high housing costs.\"\nBryan Sanderson, chairman of the Low Pay Commission, which recommends the level at which the minimum wage should be set, said: \"This week's increase is our first step towards the government's target of two-thirds of median earnings.\n\"It is a real-terms increase, meaning that an hour's work can buy more than it could last year at the start of the pandemic. The level of the new rate, however, also reflects the need to protect workers from job losses.\"\nThe commission said its best estimate for the National Living Wage rate in 2022 was \u00a39.42, but this is subject to more uncertainty than usual and is likely to change.\nThis rise in the legal minimum wage will be welcome news, particularly as most households across the UK are also seeing their bills going up from the start of April. Planned price rises kick in for gas and electricity, council tax, water charges, the licence fee, TV and broadband rates, and NHS prescription charges in England. It'll be a stretch for many. \nFor those minimum wage staff who are on furlough at the moment, the news is even harder. Pay for those who would normally be working in bars, restaurants, hairdressers and hotels will continue to be based on 80% of their pre-Covid earnings. \nThey won't get the new pay rise until they start back to work again, but given the timetable on easing restrictions, many may be heading back to full employment soon."

      "text": "A pioneering businesswoman who grew Fisherman's Friend cough sweets from a small firm into a huge global brand has died aged 91.\nDoreen Lofthouse, known as \"the mother of Fleetwood\", began spreading word of the menthol and eucalyptus lozenges around the world in the 1960s.\nThe Lancashire philanthropist was also awarded an OBE for her charity work.\nWyre Council said Mrs Lofthouse was \"a true pioneer\" whose generosity had also helped \"transform Fleetwood\".\nOver the past 30 years, Mrs Lofthouse and her family have given tens of millions of pounds to fund community projects in the town, including the recent restoration of The Mount.\nFisherman's Friend lozenges were originally developed by pharmacist James Lofthouse in 1865 to relieve various respiratory problems commonly suffered by fishermen.\nFor the next 100 years, they were virtually unknown outside the fishing community.\nBut thanks to the entrepreneurial skills of Mrs Lofthouse, who married James's grandson Tony, the cough sweet is now available in 120 countries, netting the company annual revenues of more than \u00a355m.\nThe lozenge's shape was based on the design of the buttons on one of the dresses she used to wear to the office.\nGarry Payne, chief executive of Wyre Council, said he was \"deeply saddened\" to hear of her death on Tuesday night.\n\"Mrs Lofthouse was a true pioneer of Fleetwood... She was a woman who deeply cared about the town and I thank her for everything she has done,\" he said.\nLofthouse of Fleetwood said it was \"a sad day for the entire Fisherman's Friend family\" and \"she was simply one of life's good people\".\nThe company said Mrs Lofthouse had \"tremendous focus and dedication\" and \"was a keen supporter of the local community and at the same time, devoted to her friends and family.\"\nDick Gillingham, a trustee of Fleetwood Museum, said she was a \"wonderful woman... who will be remembered in Fleetwood for many, many years to come\".\nHe remembered her many contributions over the years, including helping to fund floodlights at the local football club, a lifeboat for the RNLI, as well as public artworks such as the \"welcome home\" statue for the families of fishermen.\nThe Lofthouse family also paid for the restoration of a replica of the London Eros statue and donated it to Fleetwood in 2006.\n\"She's taken the name of Fleetwood all over the world... and been probably our greatest advert,\" added Mr Gillingham.\nFleetwood Town Football Club tweeted its condolences, saying: \"Doreen put our town on the map and will be sadly missed.\"\nFormer Blackpool police Supt Damian Kitchen remembered how she \"gave hundreds of thousands of pounds\" to Lancashire Police in 2009 after she was the victim of an \"horrendous\" robbery in which her OBE and MBE were stolen by masked raiders.\nMrs Lofthouse and her husband were locked in a bathroom overnight during the robbery.\n\"What a great legacy of safety and protection she leaves. RIP Doreen,\" tweeted Mr Kitchen.\nZara Robinson, from Fleetwood Museum, told the BBC that Mrs Lofthouse became aware of the lozenge's popularity when she received letters from holidaymakers who had visited the town.\nThe tourists hoped that one day they would be able to buy the cough sweets where they lived. \n\"Doreen took it upon herself to visit all these towns to try to sell the lozenge in all these different locations,\" she said.  \nMs Robinson said the businesswoman would be remembered for \"her inspiring nature [and] the fact that she took the Fisherman's Friend lozenge and she made it into the global business that it is today\".\n\"It's just truly a magnificent story. She was a magnificent woman,\" she added.  \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram? You can also send story ideas to northwest.newsonline@bbc.co.uk"

      "text": "\"We have existed in Britain and been pioneers, inventors, icons. And then colonialism happened, and that has shaped the experiences of black people - but that is not all we are.\"\nThese are the words of Lavinya Stennett, founder of The Black Curriculum, an organisation which teaches black British history in schools - and is campaigning for Education Secretary Gavin Williamson to make it compulsory.\nThe death of George Floyd in America has inspired thousands of people in Britain to demand justice, marching through the streets of our biggest cities.\nBlack Lives Matter protesters here insist that the UK \"is not innocent\". But some commentators have questioned whether racism exists in Britain, and to what extent.\nGeorge The Poet, who was questioned about this on Newsnight, believes a lack of education about black British history - and the British Empire - plays a part in racism in the UK and our discussions about it.\nThe transatlantic slave trade and the US civil rights movement are largely the only black history taught in UK schools, normally in October when we celebrate Black History Month.\n\"lf you're omitting different histories and narratives, you're saying that these people aren't part of this country, this nation, this heritage - or they're not important enough to be taught as common knowledge,\" says Melody Triumph, policy specialist at The Black Curriculum. \nThese are just a few episodes of black British history we weren't taught in school.\nSome might think the first black people in Britain arrived from Britain's colonies - the countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia that Britain ruled over, in some cases for centuries - after World War 2. \nBut that's not true, says Lavinya from The Black Curriculum.\n\"We know that black people were in Britain since Roman times - and there's specific examples.\"\nThe Ivory Bangle Lady is the name given to remains discovered in York in 1901 which are now on display in the York Museum. Archaeological analysis reveals that although she was born in Roman Britain, she's likely to be of North African descent. \nThe remains have been dated to the second half of the 4th Century. \nShe was found with jet and elephant ivory bracelets, earrings, pendants, beads, a blue glass jug and a glass mirror. In other words, she wasn't poor. \n\"It puts into question assumptions that black people have never been aspirationally wealthy or had any kind of wealth,\" Lavinya says.\nDuring the Tudor period there were hundreds of black migrants living in England. For those of us a bit rusty on our Tudor dates, we're talking about the 1500s. \nJohn Blanke, an African trumpeter, was one of them. His face can be seen inscribed into a 60ft long roll depicting the prestigious Westminster Tournament of 1511 - an elaborate party which Henry VIII put on to celebrate the birth of a son. \nThere's even a letter from John Blanke to Henry VIII asking for a pay rise.\n\"He petitioned for 8p a day. I don't know what the conversion is today, but that showed he knew his worth,\" Lavinya says.\nShe was a princess from Germany who became a British Queen after marrying King George III - and many historians believe Queen Charlotte had African ancestry. \nThey married in 1761 and Charlotte was the mother of two British monarchs - George IV and William IV.\nIt's been argued that despite coming from Germany, Queen Charlotte was descended from a black branch of the Portuguese royal family. \nKing Afonso III of Portugal conquered the city of Faro from the Moors - Muslims from North Africa who lived in modern-day Spain and Portugal during the Middle Ages - in the 13th Century. Afonso was thought to have had three children with the city governor's daughter.\nOne of their sons, Martim Afonso Chichorro, is also said to have married into a family with black ethnicity. He and his wife, Ines Lourenco de Sousa de Valadares, founded the Portuguese house of Sousa-Chichorro, which had many descendants, including Queen Charlotte.\nQueen Charlotte's great granddaughter? Queen Victoria. \nQueen Charlotte, whether she had African ancestry or not, joined the Royal Family in the century when Britain started slave-trading - which made it vastly wealthy.\n\"A lot of the time, we start with black history in London - it's London-centric. But a lot of Glasgow's wealth actually comes from the tobacco, the sugar, the cotton that was created and sustained by enslaved people in Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados,\" Lavinya says.\nMany of Glasgow's prominent city centre streets are named after 18th Century slave owners who made fortunes from plantations. \n\"You're told that black people were slaves, but you're not told the fruits of their labour are actually the streets we walk on.\"\nLavinya says teaching slavery is important but you need to \"contextualise it\".\n\"Talk about who gained from it, the people not only in the colonies but also here in the UK.\"\nThat also means teaching about the \"black people in Scotland who were part of the abolition of the slave trade\".\n\"All you hear about is William Wilberforce\" - a British politician who campaigned to abolish slavery - Lavinya says.\nWhen we talk about Caribbean migration into England we often think about the Windrush generation, who arrived in Britain between 1948 and 1971. \n\"But black people were actually brought over from Jamaica to fight in World War One,\" says Lavinya. Her great-uncle came to England at the age of 17 to help the war effort, settling in London afterwards. \nBut she says her uncle was \"one of the lucky ones\"- because he wasn't sent back after the war.\nWhen soldiers returned to the UK after WW1 there was a jobs shortage and a lack of opportunities.\n\"White people made the link that they were not getting jobs because of the black people\" - and violence towards black communities followed. \nThey're known as the 1919 race riots in Glasgow, Liverpool, Cardiff and other seaports across Britain, during which three people were killed and hundreds injured.\nBut there were economic consequences too. Many black serviceman and workers found themselves without jobs after a \"colour bar\" was introduced in many industries, with white workers, often backed by unions, refusing to work alongside black people.\nLots of black men were sent back to the countries they had lived in before the war. \nPoverty and a lack of jobs were a big factor in the riots, but according to researcher Jamie Baker, there was also a fear that black men and white women were starting families. \n\"It fits into the hyper-sexualisation of black men. White men felt threatened because they felt that black men were taking their women,\" Lavinya says.\nAfter WW2 black people from the Caribbean and Africa, and people from India, were asked to come to Britain to help rebuild the country. \nThey were put to work in the NHS and other public sector roles, like driving buses. \nBut in Bristol the Omnibus Company, run by the council, refused to employ black and Asian drivers, which eventually led to a boycott of buses across the whole city. \n\"But it wasn't as easy as that,\" Lavinya says. At the time it was not illegal to discriminate based on race - the first Race Relations Act was passed in 1965, but didn't include legislation about employment or housing until 1968.\nPaul Stephenson, Roy Hackett and Guy Bailey were the brains behind the boycott and Paul drew inspiration from the bus boycott in the US, started when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white passenger when the bus was at capacity, for what they did in Bristol.\nHackett organised blockades and sit-down protests to prevent buses getting through the city centre. \n\"White women taking their kids to school or going to work would ask us what it was about,\" he told the BBC. \"Later they came and joined us.\"\nStudents showed support too and it was backed by the local MP Tony Benn as well as Harold Wilson, who became Labour leader a year later. \nOn the same day Martin Luther King Jr delivered his famous \"I have a dream\" speech after marching on Washington DC - 28 August 1963 - pressure had built enough over the summer that the Bristol Omnibus Company announced a change in policy. \nBy mid-September Bristol had its first non-white bus conductor - Raghbir Singh, an Indian-born Sikh who'd lived in Bristol since 1959 - and further black and Asian crews followed. \nPaul Stephenson, Guy Bailey and Roy Hackett all received OBEs for their action. \nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "tags": "Abortion,NHS Wales,Pregnancy",
      "text": "There are calls for changes to rules on home abortions in Wales to be made a permanent.\nAt the start of the coronavirus pandemic, temporary measures were introduced allowing women to take early medical abortion tablets at home.\nSeveral clinicians and women's groups welcomed the change, but concerns about women's safety have been raised by others. \nA Welsh government consultation on the issue ended in February.\nWomen wanting an early medical abortion, which is classed as being within the first nine weeks of pregnancy, have to take two types of tablet.\nUp until April 2020, the first pill, mifepristone, had to be taken at a registered clinic.\nThe second drug, misoprostol, is normally taken 24 to 48 hours later, and could be taken at home.\nWomen and girls in Wales can now be prescribed both pills following an online or telephone consultation with a medical practitioner.\nThe pills can be sent to them in the post or they can collect them from a pharmacy or clinic, before taking them both at home. \nThe change in rules was due to last until 31 March 2022, or until the pandemic was over, as part of regulations to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. \nJennifer, not her real name, is a student from south Wales. \nWhen the pregnancy protection she and her partner were using, and the morning after pill failed to work, she decided to have an abortion. \nAfter having a video consultation with a local provider, Jennifer, who was seven weeks pregnant, collected the pills from a surgery before taking them the same day.  \nCramping, bleeding, and vomiting are common symptoms during an early medical abortion. \nBut Jennifer said she did not expect to experience as many side effects as she did. \n\"I ended up just stripping off, throwing my stuff in the washing machine, getting in the bath and then using the shower head on the hot setting on my stomach. \n\"I just let the water run and I actually started listening to some podcasts to distract myself from the pain,\" she said. \nJennifer's initial symptoms lasted a couple of days but the bleeding continued and became worse after two weeks. \nShe was eventually admitted to hospital because of complications, for which she had to take further medication. \nJennifer said her experience was not typical and that she was \"grateful\" that she was able to access the abortion drugs.\nShe said she was especially grateful that she was able to \"take her comfort into her own hands\" by having the abortion at home. \n\"If I had to take the first dose and then walk back home I don't think I would have felt very well at all because I became quite queasy. I'm glad I could just lie in a heap at home,\" she said. \nVivienne Rose, the clinic manager at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) clinic in Cardiff, said the provision of telemedical abortion care had \"empowered\" women. \n\"They can have consultations at a time that suits them so people are accessing the service earlier - they don't have to go via their GP. They don't have to make arrangements, so it's much easier for them.\"\nBPAS said that this has led to a reduction in waiting times, meaning abortions had been carried out at an earlier gestational stage. \nAbortions are safer the earlier they're carried out, according to the NHS. \nBPAS, which runs abortion services for the Betsi Cadwaladr and Powys health boards, said the time from first contact to treatment fell by 11 days in April-July 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. \nBPAS also said women who were suitable to have a home abortion could choose when they wanted to start the process, so could arrange their work, support and any childcare around this. \nHowever, the Christian Medical Fellowship (CMF) said it had \"deep concerns\" about home abortions and the safety of women and girls who accessed them. \nThey called on the Welsh government to end the current provision as soon as it could.\nJennie Pollock, the associate head of public policy at CMF, said: \"These measures remove abortion from the proper safeguards and regulations. They remove doctors and nurses from being on hand in case anything goes wrong.\" \nA freedom of information request showed that the number of ambulance callouts for women who had taken abortion medicine in Wales increased from 11 between April-December 2019, to 20 in the same period in 2020, after the rules had changed. \nBut Dr Jane Dickson, a consultant at the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board and the vice president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, said the numbers were \"tiny\". \n\"In my service alone we provide abortion treatment for about 45 women a week, and across Wales approximately 7,500 abortions are performed every year. The increase is tiny,\" she said. \nShe added that women were \"screened extensively for safety\" and would be asked to come into a clinic for a scan and a consultation if there was any cause for concern. \nHer faculty is also one of those that has called for the provision of home abortions to be made permanent. \nWelsh Labour Party said it \"commits to maintaining a close dialogue with women's groups and with clinicians and to consider in full the responses to the consultation before taking any next steps\".  \nAn official added: \"Above all we will put clinical and safeguarding risks at the forefront of any final decision on making the provision permanent.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives said they \"consider abortion as a matter of conscience\" and that it was \"up to each elected representative to vote accordingly\".\nPlaid Cymru said the health sector had \"failed to harness the full potential for digital technology\" for too long and if clinicians were satisfied remote services were safe, the change should be made permanent.\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said they would \"continue to develop telemedicine and remote consultations, including for abortion advice and the Welsh Gender Service.\"\nA Welsh government official said: \"We introduced these temporary measures, developed and supported by clinicians, to improve safety during the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\"The service is provided via teleconference and clinicians must arrange for a woman to attend clinic if there's any concern about the accuracy of the gestation stage. \n\"Clinicians operating the service are content that the current temporary measures are safe for women who use them.\"\nYou can see more on this issue on Wales Live on BBC One Wales on Wednesday, 31 March at 22:35 BST, or on BBC iPlayer.\nIf you have been affected by the issues raised in this piece, you can access advice and support through the BBC Action Line."

      "title": "AstraZeneca: Is there a blood clot risk?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Unusual blood clots in the brain have been detected in a handful of people after they were injected with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThese \"cerebral venous sinus thromboses\" or CVSTs have led some countries - including Germany, France and Canada - to restrict who can be given the jab. The World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency say the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks.\nScientists and medicines safety regulators around the world are trying to figure out if the vaccine is genuinely causing these strokes, how big any risk might be and what that might mean for vaccination programmes. \nAt the moment, we do not know. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA), which has been reviewing the safety data, says it is \"not proven, but is possible\".\nThe organisation has to figure out whether the reported clots are a side-effect or a coincidence that would have happened naturally. This is incredibly hard when dealing with rare events. If, on the other hand, one in every 10,000 people was having serious blood clots then the answer would be obvious.\nI have spoken to respected scientists some of whom are sceptical, others increasingly convinced. \nSome point to the highly unusual nature of the clots as a sign something could be going on. They are often appearing at the same time as low levels of blood platelets, which are one of the main components of a clot, and antibodies linked to other clotting disorders appearing in the blood. \nOthers say there is not enough proof and the reported cases could plausibly be down to Covid, which itself is linked to abnormal clotting. \nIt remains entirely possible the risk is zero as vaccines are not proven to cause the brain clots. \nGermany's Paul Ehrlich Institute has reported 31 cerebral venous sinus thromboses and nine deaths out of 2.7 million people vaccinated there. \nThe most recent UK data reported 30 clots linked with low platelet counts and seven deaths out of 18 million people vaccinated. \nThe European Medicines Agency, which has assessed data from around the world, estimates there is around a one in 100,000 risk of a CVST in people under the age of 60 who have been given the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nThe organisation's head of safety monitoring, Dr Peter Arlett, said that was \"more than we would expect to see\". \nHowever, it is uncertain what the background rate of these blood clots in the brain truly is. Estimates vary from around two cases per million people every year to nearly 16 in every million in normal times and coronavirus itself may be causing them too. \nYou might expect to see the same numbers of CVSTs in different countries if they were genuinely being caused by the vaccine. Yet the UK has reported roughly the same number of cases despite giving the vaccine to nearly seven times as many people as Germany.\nOne argument is the type of people being vaccinated is different. \nThe UK has, largely, been working from the oldest age groups down, while Germany was one of the countries that initially refused to use the vaccine in the over 65s because of a lack of trial data. Instead nearly 90% of Germans given AstraZeneca are thought to be under 60.\nSide-effects in general tend to be more severe in younger people as they have a stronger immune response, which has been one speculated reason why the UK has had fewer cases. \nHowever, CVSTs are inherently more common in younger women and taking the pill increases the risk. So the natural risk levels - whether people are vaccinated or not - could have a role too. \nTeasing all this apart is challenging, but the EMA said it had found no specific risk factors such as age, gender or medical history. \nNothing in medicine in completely safe and even therapies that are highly toxic are used in the right circumstance. \nChemotherapy drugs can have brutal side effects, but are hugely valuable; and even over-the-counter painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen have severe side-effects, they are just incredibly rare. \nThe real decision is always whether the benefits outweigh the risks. \nThis is particularly challenging in a pandemic. Normally medicine would rely on the \"precautionary principle\" to prove adequate safety before giving a new medicine to large numbers of people. But in a pandemic, any delays in vaccinating people will also cost lives. \nBased on the Germany data alone, if you vaccinate a million people then you would expect 12 to have a blood clot and four of them to die. \nBut if a million 60-year-olds catch coronavirus then around 20,000 would die of Covid-19. If a million 40-year-olds catch coronavirus then around 1,000 die. It would be a few hundred people in their 30s.\nThe benefits of vaccination clearly increase with age and countries like Germany and Canada have allowed the AstraZeneca vaccine to be used in older age-groups. These decisions will also be driven by which alternative vaccines they have available and who still needs to be immunised. \nThe world is scrutinising the data intensely, but clarity will still take time. \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "The number of potholes filled in by councils in England and Wales has increased during the past year to almost 1.7 million, a survey suggests.\nThe Asphalt Industry Alliance said this figure - up 200,000 from 1.5 million in 2019-20 - equated to one being fixed every 19 seconds.\nThe total amount spent by local authorities on filling in potholes in 2020-1 was \u00a393.6m, it added.\nThe government said it was working to ensure \"smoother, safer journeys\".\nPotholes - collapsed areas in the tarmac resulting from the pressure of traffic and bad weather - can be dangerous to motorists and, in particular, cyclists.\nThe AA told the BBC last year that the pandemic, which has cut traffic levels, presented a \"unique opportunity\" for local authorities to fix more roads.\nBut, while the pothole-filling figure has risen this year, the Asphalt Industry Alliance's survey still suggests one million fewer were fixed than in 2014-15, when it went as high as 2.7 million.\nIt also found that the proportion of council-maintained roads in England deemed to be in a \"poor\" state fell from 21% in 2019-20 to 16% this year.\nBut in Wales it increased from 20% to 21%.\nMain roads and motorways in England and Wales are maintained by Highways England and the Welsh Government respectively, while councils look after the upkeep of local, usually more minor, roads.\nAA president Edmund King said many of these were still in a \"perilous state\" and that users had to \"run the gauntlet of potholes once they turn into their neighbourhoods\".\nHe added: \"Government and councils urging more active travel by getting people to switch from car to bicycle doesn't sit right with local roads riddled with potentially lethal potholes.\"\nThe Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, has called for \u00a310bn to be spent to bring roads \"up to scratch\".\nNicholas Lyes, head of roads policy at the RAC, said local authorities were \"grappling with crumbling road surfaces\" and called for a more \"long-term approach\" to funding.\nBut a Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"This government is providing \u00a32.5bn in funding over five years to help councils improve their roads, to ensure all road users have smoother, safer journeys.\"\nThe government has published daily figures on road use by motorised vehicles in Great Britain since the beginning of the pandemic last year.\nThey dipped as low as 23% of the usual level during the first lockdown but are currently at about 80%."

      "text": "The taoiseach (Irish PM) has announced that from 12 April people will be allowed to travel within their county for exercise and recreation.\nMiche\u00e1l Martin outlined various dates for easing Covid-19 restrictions in the Republic of Ireland on Tuesday.\nThe country's National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommended a cautious approach.\nFrom 12 April, two households can meet outdoors and the construction industry can return to work.\nFrom 19 April, some additional high performance training will be allowed, including senior-inter county GAA training.\nHe said training for high-performing athletes approved by Sport Ireland will also be allowed. \nFrom 26 April, those who are fully vaccinated can meet other fully vaccinated people indoors, provided both people have had their second doses at least 14 days previously.\nOn the same date golf and outdoor tennis can resume, some outdoor visitors such as zoos can reopen and the number of people permitted to attend a funeral will increase from 10 to 25.\nRecommencement of religious services on a staggered basis will be considered after 4 May.\nMr Martin said vaccines will get the country \"out of this pandemic\" but said that disruptions to supply have held things back. \nHe said supply will dramatically increase in April, May and June.\nMore than 800,000 doses of the vaccine have been administered, he added.\nBy the middle of April, all those over 70 will have their first dose and he added that six million doses should be administered by the end of July.\n\"Less than two weeks from now all of our children will be back at school. In four weeks many of our outdoor sporting facilities will be open again,\" he said.\n\"We are on the final stretch of this terrible journey,\" he added. \nHowever he urged people to still be careful even though things are difficult\n\"Sometimes the challenge of living with these restrictions obscures their purpose but we should never forget that by accepting the restrictions on our lives, we have saved lives.\n\"The disease we are dealing with now is a very different beast to that which we were facing in the first lockdown more than 54 weeks ago.\n\"The so called UK or B117 variant is essentially a new virus - if it is given any space will spread quickly and the consequences are terrible.\"\nThe Irish cabinet agreed to the following measures.\nThat from April 12: \nFrom April 19:\nFrom April 26: \nThe Republic has been under its highest level of coronavirus restrictions since 30 December.\nThe level five restrictions include a ban on all household visits, the closure of non-essential retail and a 5km limit on travel.\nOther restrictions include the closure of sports including golf and tennis, with the exception of professional or elite sports like Gaelic games and horse racing behind closed doors."

      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,Rural life,Pubs,Broadband,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Irish pubs could be turned into remote working hubs under a post-pandemic plan to give rural villages a new lease on life. \nThe Irish government scheme is part of a five year rural development policy, released on Monday.\nUnder the plan, a fifth of public servants would shift to remote or home working by the end of the year.\nThe government says it is an invitation to remote workers to live in rural Ireland. \nIt will also introduce legislation this year to give employees the right to request to work remotely.\nThe Irish government's Our Rural Future strategy proposes a national network of 400 remote working hubs, including ones specifically for the public sector. \nIt is the first European country to come up with such a plan. \nRural and Community Development Minister Heather Humphreys said it was \"the most ambitious and transformational policy for rural Ireland in decades\".\n\"As we emerge from Covid-19, the new policy is about maximising a recovery for all parts of the country and giving a better quality of life to people who live and work in rural areas.\"\nConcern about the pre-eminence of Dublin and the need for decentralisation of civil service jobs is a perennial theme in Irish political discourse.\nA previous attempt to move government departments outside of the capital was a failure.\nCivil servants who had bought homes and had children at school in the city were very reluctant to sell-up to move to areas where they may have had no connections.\nBut this time the government is hoping it will be different because the focus will be more on individuals than on civil service departments.\nAnd the pandemic experience of working from home has proved there is such an appetite.\nBut to work broadband speeds in rural areas will need to improve from all too often very slow to superfast - just one of the many challenges the government faces as it looks to a future beyond the pandemic.\nThe report commits to \"explore the potential to develop a pilot scheme to support the use of rural pubs as community spaces and hubs for local services\".\nThe minister likened it to the UK's \"the hub in the pub\" concept. \n\"We are teasing out how, maybe, pubs can be used for different purposes during the day,\" she said. \n\"It could be working spaces. It could be community spaces. It could be many different things and we can look at having high-speed broadband there.\"\nCork South West TD (Irish MP) Michael Collins said such a plan would need high-speed, reliable broadband - which his constituents did not always have, Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 reported. \nAs part of the new strategy, the government has proposed investing up to \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a32.3bn) in the roll-out of the national broadband plan.\n\"There are huge issues. Many people have come back from the cities to work in rural communities and the broadband is shocking. \n\"I have hundreds and hundreds of people in west Cork pulling their hair out of their heads because they can't get broadband in their homes.\"\nNorthern Ireland's civil service is currently developing an \"enduring\" remote-working policy with trade unions. \nIn February, the Department of Finance announced 10 regional hubs for public sector workers.\nThe Cross Border Workers Coalition welcomed the commitment of ministers \"north and south\" to remote working. \nHowever \"restrictive\" cross border tax rules continued to leave rural communities behind, the organisation's co-chair Aidan O'Kane said.\n\"Under current legislation, cross border workers who live in the Republic of Ireland and work for an Northern Ireland-based company can face a 'double tax' on their income if they work remotely. \n\"Employees should be able to live in towns across the island regardless of where their job is based.\"\nThe Irish government has included a tax review for remote workers and employers as part of its strategy.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Brisbane,Coronavirus pandemic,Australia",
      "text": "Australia has fallen 3.4 million doses short of its target of delivering four million Covid vaccinations by 31 March, prompting criticism of the government.\nThe 85% shortfall comes two days after Brisbane entered another snap lockdown to combat a small outbreak.\nLast week the government said the vaccine rollout did not demand urgency given Australia's low infection rates.\nThe country has recorded 909 deaths and 29,300 cases since the pandemic began - far fewer than many other nations.\nBut sporadic outbreaks have led to six lockdowns in cities in recent months. Critics say situations like Brisbane's outbreak show why a quick vaccine programme is still needed.\nBrisbane's two clusters have been linked to a nurse and a doctor who contracted the virus from a Covid ward at the same hospital. \nIt's unclear why those health workers had not yet been vaccinated, officials said.\nCritics have accused the government of mishandling the rollout, which began on 22 February - later than in many countries.\nAustralia is administering the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines and has a rate of 2.3 vaccines per 100 people. That is expected to increase in coming months as vaccine access is opened up to the wider population.\nOn Wednesday, Health Minister Greg Hunt said a record 72,826 vaccinations had been given in the past day - taking the total to 670,000.\n\"That's showing that the national vaccination programme is accelerating exactly as intended in the manner that was intended,\" he told reporters.\nBut in January, Prime Minister Scott Morrison promised to have four million people inoculated with their first shot by March.\nEarlier this month, the government pushed that target back to April, and said six million people would be vaccinated by mid-May. \nIt has also dialled back a promise to have every Australian fully vaccinated by October - now saying that everyone will have received a first shot by then.\nAustralia is currently up to stage two of its four-phase rollout for its 25 million population.\nDoses are being offered to people over 70, those in aged care homes, frontline health workers, emergency services workers, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over 55, and people with underlying health conditions.\nAuthorities have not specified why the pace has been so slow, but issues such as booking technicalities have been reported. There are also reports that some people are choosing to not get the vaccine.\nNatural disasters - such as the massive floods in eastern Australia last week - have also disrupted the rollout.\nEarlier this month, the EU blocked a shipment of AstraZeneca doses to Australia, arguing there was a greater need for them in Europe.\nAustralia said the one shipment of 250,000 doses would not greatly affect its own programme, as it built up its own manufacturing capability. \nHowever, Australia has asked the EU to review the ban on its order, which Mr Morrison said had been paid for.\nLabor opposition leader Anthony Albanese said the government, by its own admission, could not blame international supply issues.\n\"They said that target wasn't dependant on anything else and they would certainly reach the target,\" he told the ABC. \n\"Yet again it's an example of how Scott Morrison is always strong on announcement and weak on delivery.\"\nQueensland's capital reported two more community transmission cases on Wednesday, bringing the outbreak to 15 infections in total.\nThere are fears that the city's three-day lockdown, due to finish on Thursday, will need to be extended. \nContact tracers are scrambling to track down infected people and have so far placed more than 1,000 of their close contacts in quarantine.\nThe lockdown has forced many in Queensland and interstate to cancel their Easter and school holiday plans. \nQueensland's state economy is heavily reliant on tourism - and operators have forecast that the three-day lockdown has caused a A$35m (\u00a319m; $26m) loss."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Retailing,Coronavirus pandemic,UK High Streets",
      "text": "A group of big names in fashion and retail are campaigning for the government to provide more support for small independent shops.\nThey want the chancellor to offer a \"Shop Out to Help Out\" scheme to get consumers spending again when non-essential shops reopen on 12 April.\nIt would cover 50% of a shopper's costs, up to \u00a310, on Monday to Wednesdays for a month. \nAnd it would only apply at physical stores with fewer than 10 staff. \nThe \"Save The Street\" campaign says independent retailers won't survive without it. The Treasury did not comment on whether it would pursue the idea, but said it had protected \"millions\" of retail jobs during the pandemic.\nThe proposed scheme - which would work like the Eat Out to Help Out restaurant discounts last year - is backed by the likes of beauty entrepreneur Charlotte Tilbury, fashion designer Henry Holland and retail consultant Mary Portas. \n\"We would be kidding ourselves to think that everything will be fine for independent retailers once they reopen on 12 April,\" says Ross Bailey, the entrepreneur leading the campaign.\n\"Now it is the government's responsibility to support these businesses and ensure they are given a fighting chance to bounce back - the government needs to show that all businesses matter, not just big businesses.\"\nThe British Retail Consortium estimates that non-essential retail stores lost around \u00a322bn in sales in 2020 due to lockdown measures, as footfall declined by 40%.\nIndependent shops - many of which lack a strong online presence - were hit particularly hard as they faced prolonged closures and restrictions. \nYet this hasn't stopped people from trying to start businesses. Latest data from Cornerstone Tax, which gives advice on property stamp duty, shows 13% of consumers have started, or intend to start, their own business in 2021.\nThe firm's research also shows more than half of consumers want to support smaller firms over retail giants. \nClare Oakey is the co-founder of Frippery Lifestyle Boutique, an independent fashion and homeware retailer in Colchester. \nShe and her business partner Kim will spend up to \u00a31,000 on reopening promotional activities, including printing a hundred 10%-off discount vouchers for the local barber to give away, putting flower arrangements and sweets in the shop, and offering customers who make a purchase goodie bags.\nMs Oakey says that five retail chain outlets on the same high street will not be reopening on 12 April, along with a number of independent stores. So even though people in Colchester generally like supporting small retailers, more needs to be done to get the public spending on the High Street again.\n\"We've prioritised keeping our business open by paying invoices to suppliers to keep the company running long term, but the honest truth is that it's been financially tough on a very personal level for me and my business partner,\" Clare tells the BBC.\n\"We really badly need the support - any form of help to let us catch up and break even, in terms of a scheme that incentivises the customers. We're nothing without customers.\"\nThe only nice thing, she says, is that local independent businesses have come together to help each other out.  \nFor example, while the Frippery has been closed in the most recent lockdown, a nearby artisan coffee shop, Sir Isaacs Coffee House, has offered a click-and-collect service on its behalf. \nIt meant the Frippery could continue serving its customers online, while the coffee shop got more exposure and hopefully sold a few extra coffees.\nRetail analysts are also seriously concerned about the situation facing Britain's independent shops.\n\"Independent retailers have had a tumultuous year and immediate action is needed to avoid a high street apocalypse,\" says Natalie Berg, retail analyst at NBK Retail.\nA Shop Out to Help Out Scheme would encourage consumers to \"ditch their screens\" and support their local shops, she says.\n\"This is a unique opportunity to redefine our high streets, but without government support we'll be bracing for a retail bloodbath.\"\nRetail expert Kate Hardcastle agrees, pointing out that independent retailers were the ones who \"really demonstrated their worth\" in the early days of the pandemic in coming to their communities' aid when other retailers didn't have their online shopping offerings ready.\nShe is concerned that everyone will forget about them now.\n\"Just telling people to shop small as has been previous campaigns might serve as a reminder, not an action,\" she tells the BBC.\n\"Just as the case was with Eat Out to Help Out, we need to see our government support small businesses longer term.\n\"I'd love to see initiatives to make it easier for small businesses to open up on the High Street and rejuvenate.\"\nShe says the collaborative approach used by the Frippery and its neighbours is the right one: \"The future of small businesses has to be one of collaboration and not feeling they have to justify their worth to consumers all the time, but being able to focus on a brilliant offer because they can afford to survive.\"\nA Treasury spokesman said: \"We've supported retailers across the UK though out the outbreak, protecting millions of jobs - and will continue to do so in the months ahead. \n\"Shops won't pay any business rates until July, can continue to furlough staff until September, and are receiving Restart Grants of up to \u00a36,000.\""

      "text": "How this year's A level and GCSE grades are decided is putting too much pressure on pupils and schools, it has been claimed.\nHeadteachers and unions fear students may be overburdened with classroom tests, as schools seek to justify teacher-determined grades.\nThe Welsh government scrapped all exams last year because of the pandemic.\nExam board WJEC and Qualifications Wales said there was flexibility in choosing evidence for grades.\nBut teaching union UCAC said it is \"extremely concerned\" and has written to the education minister and Children's Commissioner. \nThis year's summer exams were cancelled in November 2020, to be replaced by classroom-based assessments.\nWhen schools were closed again after Christmas, it was announced the assessments had also been scrapped.\nInstead, grades will be determined by schools and colleges, but some teachers have become increasingly worried about how it will work in practice, after the regulator Qualifications Wales and the WJEC published more details about the process. \nDr Llinos Jones, head of Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bro Myrddin in Carmarthen said the system which has emerged was different to what they had originally anticipated. \n\"Initially, we thought that they'd be coming back after Easter to enhance their learning and to move on to the next step,\" Dr Jones said.\n\"But of course with this weighting on evidence, now it seems to be a different playing field.\"\n\"Many schools, at the moment, are looking - after Easter - to give tests and some schools are even giving exams to pupils to make sure that they've got the evidence.\"\nShe said schools were trying their best not to put undue pressure on GCSE, AS and A-level students.\n\"We've got to realise that these children have been home for months on end and it's very important for them to go back to meeting friends, to meeting teachers and to go back to the learning experience,\" she added.\nTeaching union UCAC said it was a concern they had heard from members the length and breadth of Wales.\n\"Every member who's been in touch with us has been concerned about the level of bureaucracy but they are extremely concerned about the pressure that this is putting on their pupils,\" UCAC policy officer Rebecca Williams said.\n\"We're moving to a situation which is much more similar to a set of external exams over a specific period of time, with all the stresses and strains that come with that, and even more so in that it was rather unexpected.\"\nLleucu is studying four A Levels and the Welsh Baccalaureate and says she is apprehensive about the period after the Easter holidays.\nThe 17-year-old says, despite the best efforts of her teachers, who have passed on information as they get it, the process for deciding their grades is still unclear.\n\"I think it's been difficult for students as well as teachers to keep going and to understand what we're working towards,\" she said.\n\"I think that the intentions were there and by allowing teachers to give us the grades they believe we deserve, it has given some freedom.\n\"However I don't think that this freedom that was advertised is really going to happen, because the assessments that are going to take place in the classroom are going to be structured as if they were exams.\n\"I think it's going to be a difficult seven weeks after Easter and we're going to have to work quite hard to get the grades that we deserve.\"   \nQualifications Wales' chief executive Philip Blaker said schools and colleges needed to collect evidence so they could make sound judgments about grades for their students.\n\"We want to be very clear that there is a great deal of flexibility in how they go about this, and that the quality of evidence is more important than the quantity,\" he said.\n\"Evidence generated during the course can be used as long as it's the learner's own work and is representative of their attainment at the end of the course.\"\nThe WJEC said it was implementing policy decisions in the best way it could and was \"mindful of the concerns\" and the \"very difficult circumstances\" for everybody.\n\"I think what we're trying to do is put a solution in place which is fair and balanced for everybody so that learners get the outcomes that they deserve,\" said WJEC chief executive Ian Morgan.\n\"In the current climate the solution that we're currently implementing is the one that collectively we felt was the best option in order to resolve the issues.\"\nStudents will be given their provisional grades by their school or college in June, before final results are released in August.

      "tags": "Black Lives Matter,Edward Colston,Birmingham,Naga Munchetty,George Floyd death,Bristol",
      "text": "The killing of George Floyd last year triggered a national debate about racial injustice not just in the US, but in the UK, too. Naga Munchetty travelled across the UK to understand what race and racism means today.\nI have experienced racism. You never forget the first time you hear that painful and distressing word. I was seven, when someone I thought was a friend at school, told me we could no longer hang out. They used the P-word, making clear the reason was because of the colour of my skin\nThe sense of shame was overwhelming. I was told I didn't belong when up until then I assumed I did. From that moment I knew I was seen as different. That first hurt never goes away.\nI grew up in south London. My dad was from Mauritius and my mum was from India. Both were nurses. They too received racial insults at work, including the P-word.\nNews events last year catapulted the subject of race into many conversations people were having.\nWhether you attended, agreed with, or condemned the Black Lives Matter protests - I imagine a conversation in your social group or your home, took place about race, regardless of the colour of your skin.\nThe death of George Floyd, after being restrained by US police, led to Black Lives Matter protests across the world. In the UK, thousands took to the streets in the biggest anti-racism protests for decades. In Bristol, a statue of slave trader Edward Colston, which was prominent in the city for more than 125 years, was pulled down. Protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement continued for months.\nTwenty-year-old Corey, who was born and raised in Bristol, went along to a BLM protest. He's a semi-professional basketball player who told me that he doesn't \"feel that comfortable as a black man in our society\". When I asked him why, he said because he cannot show all of his personality outside his home. He has been brought up not to be too loud, or too passionate, or come across as intimidating.\nSince he was small, his father Vernon - who represented Great Britain at the 1988 Olympic Games and was a member of the Gospel choir which sang at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018 - told him that he needed to be more aware than his non-black friends, about how he is perceived at school or out in public.\nCorey says his dad told him that the rules were not going to be the same for him.\n\"The reality is we live in a time and place which like it or not, isn't equitable in terms of how races are perceived,\" Vernon explains. He never wants his son to be stereotyped as an angry black man, or as someone with a chip on their shoulder.  He acknowledges it is sad that he has to have a conversation with his son asking him not to draw attention to himself. It's not one he thinks a white father would have to have with his child.\nCorey understands that he and his brother Taylor can't show everything of themselves. I understand that, and I don't like the fact that I've lived by those rules too. It hurts Vernon to see that his sons have had to do the same thing.\nCorey doesn't feel that racism today is as bad as when his grandmother first came to the UK from Jamaica. Still, he thinks that \"things are not where they need to be\".\nYou can watch Naga's Panorama programme on Monday 8 March at 19:00 GMT on BBC One, or afterwards on BBC iPlayer.\nCorey's grandmother Hermie was part of the Windrush generation, many of whom faced a hostile reception in the UK in the early 1960s. It was while working as a nurse for the NHS shortly after she arrived that she experienced blatant racism for the first time. A patient told her while she was trying to clean her, \"Don't touch me, you black creature.\" She has never forgotten that.\nWhen I asked her if she was surprised that her grandchildren still see evidence of racism 60 years later, her resigned response was, \"It's as though nothing's changed\". She constantly reminds her grandchildren that they have to be \"twice as good as [their] white counterpart\".\nMany families of colour have been having these conversations - for them, it's an everyday consideration.\nI also met Jason, a black man born and raised in east London. He remembers his mum being chased by the National Front and shot with a pellet gun in her leg. He says she still has a scar. He tells me that the racism he experiences today is different, not as overt or blatant, but more under the surface, and no better. \"There's no way you can feel or live my life unless you have that shade of skin.\"\nLike Vernon, he is preparing his son for life as a black male in Britain.\nJason first began to talk to Ezra about how to behave outside the home, when he was just nine years old.\nJason tells Ezra, who is now 14, not to wear all-black clothing. That way it's harder for him to match a generic description and be stopped by the police. If Ezra is stopped by the police, Jason has prepared him for how to behave. Ezra tells me what he has been taught - \"Just be respectful, keep composed\". He adds that he knows he will be stopped eventually, \"because of the colour of my skin\".\nJason thinks Ezra will eventually have to have similar conversations with his son when the time comes. \"Unfortunately he will,\" he tells me.\nWhen I asked Jason what he would like to see change - his answer was simple: \"Let me speak first, then judge me. Don't judge me before I speak.\"\nWhy should anyone ask for that in 2021?\nJason's sister Frankie, 33, is a receptionist. She spoke to me about the kind of racism she experiences.\n\"I think the worst one for me is getting me confused with another black receptionist, or not even another black receptionist, but just another black colleague that doesn't even actually work in my department.\n\"We might not even look the same. We might not even have the same hair texture or anything like that. But we're all black.\n\"It is humiliating. It's horrible. It's absolutely horrible.\"\nThis type of covert racism isn't uncommon but it's difficult to prove, says Professor Kalwant Bhopal, director of the Centre for Research in Race and Education at the University of Birmingham.\n\"It can take the form of individuals not given eye contact. Black and minority ethnic people not even being asked their opinion. People pushing in front of you in a queue,\" she says.\nDespite Frankie's experiences, she also told me about how she believes it is important for the young black women she mentors to not hide their identities in order to fit in, and their lives should be celebrated not compromised.\nI questioned why these conversations need to take place in the 21st Century. She said: \"I may not be experiencing racism in the same [way] as my mum, I think it has changed, but it's a really slow change.\"\nEveryday racism isn't obvious and it's hard to explain. It's like when someone asks you, \"Where are you really from?\" That's telling. It makes me feel that I'm the other, that I don't belong. If I call it out, I'm being difficult. It chips away at you.\nStephen lives in Blyth, Northumberland, which is 98% white. He told me that he followed the Black Lives Matter protests and understands the raw emotions around police brutality.\nAs I sat by the harbour with the warehouse worker and his dad John, a retired mining engineer, he said he supported the right for people to protest - but he was concerned when some elements turned violent, and caused criminal damage. He then found it difficult to carry on backing the movement.\nJohn said until this year, he never thought about race, and had never had a conversation with anyone about racism other than with his son. He says that's because it's something that has never touched his life.\nUnemployment is 7% in Blyth, higher than the national average. John has concerns that the push for diversity after the Black Live Matter protests could impact jobs. He's worried if the government were to introduce quotas for apprenticeships that would mean \"you've got to have a certain colour skin. Is that the way forward?\"\nWhile some companies do have diversity targets, it's against the law to hire a less suitable candidate just because of the colour of their skin.\nSteve admits he knows people with racist views, and that makes him cringe, and sometimes upset. He says people need to challenge their thought processes - it's something he does himself. \"It's about exploring different viewpoints.\"\nAlum Rock is one of the most deprived parts of Birmingham. Almost 60% of those living there are of Pakistani heritage\nUsman works as a GP there. His grandfather arrived in the 1960s and worked as a road digger. Usman knows that his grandfather experienced racism, but believes things have moved in the right direction. \"Have they moved quick enough? No,\" he says. \"Do they need to continue to move in the right direction and faster? Yes.\"\nHe helps young people in his area by giving interview tips to some local students.\n\"You can accept that you may not have the same opportunities that other people have, but you can either be miserable and say, 'I'm not working from a level playing field' or you can say, 'I'm going to do something about it,' and that's why we're here to try and help.\"\nAsian students I met in Birmingham told me they are proud of being British and of their heritage - wearing traditional clothes with pride and not embarrassed that their home lives are different from White-British students.\nOne student, Zahnab, told me: \"I think over the years I have accepted my culture. I realise that I'm always probably going to be different. One day I might come in and smell of my mum's curry - I just embrace it.\"\nI remember being paranoid about smelling of the curries my mum cooked when I was at school. That's something I had conveniently forgotten until I spoke to the students.\nI was heartened to see that they have no sense of that embarrassment. They say to me: \"My food smells good, of course my clothes may smell a bit of it, but what's to be ashamed of?\"\nI know what it's like to hide parts of my whole self, to play down my Asian heritage - It's difficult to acknowledge that I've done it, and hard to admit. Since I was young, I felt I needed to, so that I fitted-in more easily.\nThe conversations I have been part of have been honest and sometimes painful. People opened up about race and racism, and voiced their fears and frustrations. It feels different to the way I've heard people talk about it before. \nMaybe that's a start.\n All photographs subject to copyright."

      "text": "As the UK enjoyed the hottest March day in half a century, thousands gathered to enjoy the weather in outdoor spaces, prompting social distancing concerns.\nParks in Birmingham and Leeds as well as Brighton beach were busy on Tuesday evening. Two parks in Nottingham are now shut after \"frightening\" scenes.\nHeath Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted to say \"don't blow it\" - urging people to enjoy the warm weather safely.\nA Birmingham resident said scenes at a city park \"looked like a festival\".\n\"When I see the pictures I do get anxious,\" Prof Sian Griffiths, a senior public health official, told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"If we're not in a household bubble we need to be two metres apart and I don't think those pictures look like that's happening.\"\nNottingham City Council leader David Mellen branded the scenes in Nottingham on Monday as \"frightening\" and has now closed two of the city's parks in response. \n\"We regret having to take this action, since everyone has been looking forward to the chance to visit our parks, now that easing of restrictions means we can meet up to six other people outdoors,\" he said. \n\"Sadly, the actions of a thoughtless minority has spoilt that. We will keep the situation under review and hope to reopen parks as soon as possible.\" \nIn Birmingham, thousands gathered at Holders Lane playing fields, in Moseley, with taxis doing multiple drop-offs from about 20:00 BST. \nThe BBC understands a party had been arranged earlier in the day via social media and at the time there was no police presence.\nFlyers were also shared on social media regarding another gathering for students in the city's Cannon Hill Park, which is linked to the playing fields. West Midlands Police said officers had been sent there but \"did not need to issue any fines\".\n\"Officers initially found no breaches of coronavirus legislation, with people enjoying the weather in small, individual groups,\" Supt Farooq Sheikh said.\n\"The crowds were good-natured and engaged with officers and the park was all clear by 23:30.\" \nHowever Adam Jones, who lives nearby, said the park \"looked like a festival\" on Tuesday evening.\n\"While there were a fair few people in small groups respecting distancing, they were overshadowed by lots of big groups, sometimes up to 20 to 25 people, blaring music,\" the 27-year-old said.\nThousands of revellers on Brighton beach danced into the night as fire performers drew large crowds as the sun went down. Some were photographed flouting the rule of six and social distancing guidelines.\nMerseyside Police made the decision to impose a dispersal order on Formby beach following reports of anti-social behaviour. \nThe force said it was in response to \"youths gathering on the beach and dunes\" and would remain in place until 19:00 on Thursday.\nEssex Police also enforced a dispersal order in Leigh-on-Sea after reports of a large group of people congregating at a seafront and behaving anti-socially.\nMeanwhile in Newquay, Cornwall, more than 100 people were found gathering and setting fires in protected sand dunes.\nNewquay Community Fire Station was called overnight to dunes by Fistral beach twice this week.\nMultiple groups were found burning rubbish and a skip was on fire because of \"inappropriately\" discarded disposable barbecues, the station said.\nLast summer when thousands flocked to Bournemouth beach, in Dorset, for one of 2020's warmest weekends, a spike in the number of coronavirus cases was predicted but never materialised.\nEvidence suggested crowds on the beach did not significantly spread the virus. However, Prof Griffiths said there was still a risk and people should not be complacent.\n\"If you were carrying one of the variants we'd see a different picture,\" she said. \"This is all about reducing risk - yes the risk of passing the disease on outside is much lower than if you're inside, but it's still there.\"\nBy Dr David Gregory-Kumar, BBC Midlands Today science correspondent\nIf you've been obeying the rules then pictures of people out partying in a local park probably rub you up the wrong way. Plenty of people are ready to blame thoughtless behaviour, particularly by the young, for any rise in infection rates.\nThe scientific truth though is that a gathering outdoors is very low risk. Scenes of Britons heading to beaches or to hills as lockdowns were lifted in the past have not been followed by more people ending up in local hospitals. Outdoors, the airborne coronavirus quickly blows away and so the danger of infection is small.\nWhile what happened yesterday in our parks is against the rules, it likely won't cause problems long term, at least as far as Covid is concerned. \nIt's worth contrasting these outdoor parties with events like Cheltenham Races in 2020. Cheltenham may have been an outdoors event but it also went hand in hand with packed public transport, bars and pubs. Now that was an event that many suspect did cause infection rates to increase.\nSince Monday, two households or groups of up to six people have been able to meet outside in England as the stay-at-home Covid restrictions order came to an end.\n\"Despite today's easements,\" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at the time, \"everyone must continue to stick to the rules.\"\nThe government also unveiled a new slogan - Hands, Face, Space and Fresh Air - to emphasise the importance of ventilation in reducing the spread of the virus.\n\"It's your behaviours while you're [outside],\" Prof Griffiths said. \"We just have to think about the risk of the virus and adapt our behaviours.\"\nOne of the other concerns to follow the gatherings was the \"masses\" of litter left behind in parks.\nRebecca Langton, a Nottingham City councillor, said rubbish left behind in the city's outdoor spaces was \"really disappointing\".\n\"We've spent a good couple of hours this morning cleaning up masses and masses of litter,\" she said.\n\"We want people to get out and enjoy the parks but it's just about people being responsible.\"\nThe BBC's Tom Airey was at Woodhouse Moor, in Leeds, as the aftermath of Tuesday's crowds was laid bare and said there was \"a sea of rubbish stretching across the park's gentle slopes\".\nThe first Leeds City Council workers to arrive had already filled four hay bale-sized bags of litter by 10:00, collecting glass beer bottles, crisp packets, discarded bags-for-life, used disposable barbecues and nitrous oxide canisters. This was all despite multiple 'no litter' signs along the park's tree-lined paths. \n\"It's really disgusting that people left their litter piled up by the bins and across the grass, and it's an issue that happens every time there's a hot day in Leeds,\" 26-year-old student Sophie Meredith said.\n\"Today was the worst I've ever seen it, and it's probably made worse by the fact that everyone's been cooped up for a year.\"\nSimilar scenes have been reported across England in places including Sheffield, Doncaster and Bristol.\nIn Sheffield, the council started a litter-picking operation early in the morning and shared images of rubbish strewn across Endcliffe Park.\n\"[Maintenance workers] have been out since 06:00 clearing up but our resources could be much better spent,\" the local authority said on Twitter.  \"Don't leave your mess, please love our parks.\"\nThe waste left behind at Birmingham's parks also meant the city council there had to suspend planned grass-cutting so workers could focus on removing litter.\nKeep Britain Tidy said the litter was a \"disaster for our environment\" and urged people to \"take some responsibility and dispose of their rubbish correctly\".\n\"While it is great that people can now come together in our parks and on our beaches after a long, hard winter, we need them to do the right thing,\" Richard McIlwain, from the charity, said. \n\"Particularly when it comes to disposing of their rubbish.\""

      "tags": "Abergavenny,Prestatyn,Welsh government,Restaurants,Pubs,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Pubs, restaurants and hotels in Wales may reopen indoors in time for the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has set out a series of dates for easing lockdown, stretching into the next month.\nUnder the plans two households could meet indoors from 10 May, if Covid cases remained low.\nTravel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK and Common Travel Area may go ahead from 12 April.\nRestaurants and bars could reopen outdoors from 26 April and from 3 May, outdoor wedding receptions with up to 30 people may be permitted.\nBut the changes could depend on the results of the Senedd election on 6 May, and whether the Welsh Labour leader is returned to power.\nThe Welsh Conservatives' own plans would see most rules on social contact scrapped by 17 May. \nBoth the Tories and Plaid Cymru called for gyms to reopen now, while Plaid said the Senedd should be recalled to discuss more economic help for businesses.\nUnder the Welsh plans gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities will also be able to reopen from 10 May. This will include individual or one-to-one training, but not exercise classes.\nSpring Bank Holiday Monday is 31 May, but the Welsh government has not specified an actual date for reopening hospitality indoors.\nIt said after 17 May it would \"consider enabling indoor hospitality and remaining visitor accommodation to reopen in advance of the Spring Bank Holiday\".\nOnly six people from two households will be able to meet in reopened beer gardens and should still socially distance.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the public emergency is not over. \nHe told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: \"You see in the pattern a continuation of the step-by-step approach we've taken in Wales, doing the outdoor activities first because it's safer to be outdoors.\n\"But for the first time in the timetable we are now able to set out the first re-openings of indoor activities as well.\"\nHe added: \"The presence of the virus in Wales is the lowest in the United Kingdom, the rate of vaccination in Wales is the highest in the United Kingdom.\n\"On Saturday, we will complete the vaccination offer to everybody in the top nine priority groups, again the first country in the UK to get to that milestone.\" \nProvided cases remain low, the following things will be permitted:\nMonday, 12 April\nMonday, 26 April\nMonday, 3 May\nMonday, 10 May\nMonday, 17 May\nBeyond that date, ministers would consider reopening indoor pubs and restaurants, and remaining visitor accommodation ahead of the Spring Bank Holiday.\nTracy Lawler, who owns The Dressing Room Boutique in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, said she cannot wait to reopen on 12 April. \nShe said because her shop is \"is small and intimate I can keep it really ultra clean after each person has entered\".\n\"I'm probably one of the safest public places for people to come in and the government is saying to me that I can't open up [yet]\u2026 very frustrating.\" \nLucy Hywel, who owns That's Lovely That giftshop in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, was also looking forward to reopening, but said: \"We're hurt and we're still hurting.\n\"I myself have thrown out loads of food, thousands of pounds worth of stock, even last week, stock I thought I may have sold in the lead up to Easter got chucked away and that pain is there every time you do something like that.\"\nVictoria Hallimi, who owns Victoria's Driving School in Swansea, gave her last lesson on 13 December but can now reopen on 12 April.\nShe said: \"My phone was going a bit crazy last night as soon as the announcement was made.\n\"I was up until about 11, 11:30 last night scheduling everybody in.\" \nShe said the past few months had been \"really tough\" and her husband had been doing a lot of overtime to make up for her not being able to work. \"He can relax now,\" she added. \nKelly John, owner of KMW Beauty in Maesteg, Bridgend county, said she has not paid herself a wage since January to ensure she had enough money in her business account to buy supplies when she was allowed to reopen.\n\"Luckily my husband is working, otherwise I wouldn't have a house,\" the mother-of-two said.\n\"But being an independent woman, it is really hard. I can't do anything - it's Easter this weekend and I haven't bought anything.\"\nMeanwhile, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective, which represents more than 400 Welsh hospitality firms, said it welcomed the move but \"continues to press for certainty and support\" about funding to support them while they remain closed.\nThe plans will move Wales into the \"alert level three\" stage of the government's control plan by 17 May.\nWhile parts of Wales' lockdown have eased quicker than elsewhere in the UK, the Welsh government had been reluctant to set out a full schedule for when different sectors would reopen.\nFriday's announcement is the most detailed list of dates given by the government since the winter lockdown began to be eased.\nIt does not go as far as England's tentative plans to scrap social contact restrictions by 21 June, although Mark Drakeford has previously said that's \"very optimistic\".\nMr Drakeford told a press conference the new \"indicative dates\" were are there \"to help businesses plan and prepare\".\n\"We have to remember that the pandemic isn't over - it's more important than ever that we continue to work together to keep this terrible virus under control so that we can go on unlocking Wales.\"\nSome sectors like cinemas and theatres have not been given a date to reopen in Wales.\nFollowing criticism of his plans for gyms and leisure centres, Mr Drakeford said the sector will be the first able to reopen indoors.\nPubs will be able to open outdoors two weeks after England. The first minister said he had considered bringing that forward, but \"the advice was very clear that that was not advisable on public health grounds\".\nThe Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Mr Drakeford's roadmap was \"very late in the day\".\nHe said it was \"unfortunate\" that further funding had not been made available to hospitality sector - and said outdoor hospitality should be opening in line with England on 12 April.\nMr Davies told Wales Today: \"What's really dumbfounding is that despite his mental health minister's assurances that gyms will be one of the first facilities to open, they are now not going to open until May.\"\nPlaid Cymru Leader Adam Price said he would go faster on reopening gyms and indoor hospitality.\n\"We've also been calling for a much more accelerated timetable in terms of reopening gyms, because of their importance in terms of mental and physical well being. So I think it's disappointing to see that being delayed.\n\"There are dangers of course in moving too fast but there's an equal danger of being over cautious\".\nLeader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds said: \"Now that more and more of Wales is opening up and life is slowly returning to normal, it's time to put our recovery first. \n\"I want to see support for those individuals who will lose their jobs when furlough ends, those who are likely to lose their homes when the ban on evictions is lifted and those whose mental health has suffered as a result of this pandemic.\"\nA UKIP spokesman said: \"With the success of the vaccine rollout, lockdowns no longer have any major impact on case numbers. \n\"The Welsh economy must be reopened now. Not in a month's time. This apathetic timeline will be the final nail in the coffin for many businesses that have been just about clinging on.\"\nThe announcement comes as latest figures show admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases hit a record low - it stands at a daily seven-day average of 19.\nCovid hospital admissions are the lowest since the pandemic began with 17 confirmed and suspected Covid patients on Wednesday, with none at all in Swansea Bay hospitals.\nWales' case rate stands at 34.9 per 100,000 people over seven days - the lowest since mid-September."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nToday is the last day for about four million people who are considered clinically vulnerable to shield at home. They were advised to take extra care during the pandemic to avoid contracting Covid-19, because they are considered more at risk of needing hospital treatment. According to NHS Digital, there are 3.8 million shielded patients in England and 130,000 in Wales and they include people who have had stem cell transplants or are having chemotherapy treatment for cancer, and adults with chronic kidney disease. Cases and hospital admissions are falling but the change, from tomorrow, still urges caution. People will no longer need to shield at home but they are still being advised to keep social contacts at low levels, work from home where possible and stay at a distance from other people.\nGermany is suspending routine use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine for people aged below 60 because of a risk of rare blood clots. The German medicines regulator found 31 cases of a type of rare blood clot among the nearly 2.7 million people who had received the vaccine in Germany. Canada earlier suspended use of the AstraZeneca jab in people under 55. AstraZeneca says international regulators had found the benefits of its jab outweighed risks significantly.\nHow this year's A level and GCSE grades are decided in Wales is putting too much pressure on pupils and schools, it has been claimed. Head teachers and unions fear students may be overburdened with classroom tests, as schools seek to justify teacher-determined grades. The Welsh government scrapped all exams last year because of the pandemic. Exam board WJEC and Qualifications Wales said there was flexibility in choosing evidence for grades. But teaching union UCAC said it is \"extremely concerned\" and has written to the education minister and Children's Commissioner.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has had an impact on everyone's mental wellbeing but those on the front line of dealing with it have suffered more than most.  Laura Foster talks to three doctors in the NHS for their tips on how you can help support health and care workers with their mental health.\nStephen Wright collects and recycles colourful items from his travels around the world. He's created a grotto of plastic, glass, broken ceramics and toy dolls in his London home, which he calls the House of Dreams. Everything means something. During lockdown, he\u2019s been expanding on his work from the past 23 years and documenting his experience of the pandemic. He says the project will never be finished, but will be left to the National Trust when he dies.

I didn't feel confident to face people again,\" he said.\n\"I've always been sociable.... It's had a massive impact.\"\nMr Smith now says he feels anxious about the future and believes for many people who have been shielding, it will \"take time to get used to being out there again\".\nHe is also wary of the risk of mixing with others again.\n\"I have had the first jab - knowing I'm going to be out there mixing potentially with people who could be carrying the virus - it is still an anxious time,\" he said.\nFor Katherine Taylor in Essex, who has a rare neurological disorder and hyper-mobility, the last year has been a \"real mixture of emotions\".\nHer employer, a local college, has \"been really brilliant and supportive\" and allowed her to do her job as an event planner from home. She will continue to work from home in the next few months.\nBut she said: \"The isolation of not actually being able to see and do the things you'd normally do has been really, really difficult - particularly not being able to see my parents.\"\nIt has also been hard for Mrs Taylor not to attend in-person physiotherapy sessions and to have hospital appointments put off.\nShe said it would be a \"relief to get back to some sort of normal again\" - go shopping with her daughter and eventually take a holiday break with her family in the camper van her husband has been fixing-up over lockdown.\n\"I'm feeling really good now about the future,\" she said, adding she was excited to \"see friends, spend more time with my family, so many things\".\n\"Just such simple things we took for granted.\" \nTuesday's daily coronavirus figures showed deaths and hospital admissions continuing to fall.\nThere were 56 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and 289 patients admitted to hospital, with the seven-day averages for each down by 35% and 22.1% respectively. \nA further 4,040 cases were recorded, with the seven-day average down by 7.9%. \nThe figures also showed 30,680,948 people have now received a first dose of the vaccine, while 3,838,010 have had two doses.  \nOn Monday, restrictions in England were eased, allowing groups to meet outdoors. \nOutdoor sport facilities, including swimming pools, tennis courts and golf courses, have reopened, while weddings are also on again.\nSpeaking on Monday at a Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson it was not clear \"exactly how strong\" the UK's defences would be against another wave of Covid, despite the \"impressive\" vaccine rollout.\nBut he also said he could not \"see anything in the data right now that would cause us to deviate from the road map\" of easing further restrictions.\nFrom 12 April, shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality will reopen in England, if strict conditions are met.

      "tags": "Russia,Alexei Navalny,Vladimir Putin",
      "text": "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has announced a hunger strike at the penal colony where he is held, to demand proper medical treatment. \nHe has complained on Instagram of not receiving medical help for back pain and problems with his right leg, as well as being deprived of sleep.\nNavalny, 44, returned home from Germany in January after treatment for a nerve agent attack in Siberia in August.\nHe was taken into custody immediately and then given a jail sentence.\nHe is currently being detained at the IK-2 corrective penal colony 100 km (60 miles) east of Moscow and has accused the guards there of denying him proper treatment for his ailments. \nRussia's federal penitentiary service has rejected his complaint, insisting he had \"all the necessary medical assistance in accordance with his medical indications\".\nA fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, Navalny was given a two-year and eight month sentence last month for violating the probation terms of an embezzlement case. \nThe conviction was widely seen as politically motivated and the European Court of Human Rights said he should be freed because of the risk to his life. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this week that Navalny was \"responsible for his deeds under the law\" and no different from any other Russian.\nNavalny's Instagram post on Wednesday, published by his lawyers, shows a handwritten note in which the Kremlin critic writes: \"I have declared a hunger strike demanding that the law be upheld and a doctor of my choice be allowed to visit me.\"\n\"I have the right to invite a doctor and receive medication. But they are simply not allowing me to do either. The back pain has spread to my leg. I've lost sensation in parts of my right leg and now the left leg too. Jokes aside, this is getting worrying,\" he wrote.\nHe said in an earlier post that he had only been given two tablets of the painkiller ibuprofen and was yet to be diagnosed. The penitentiary service (FSIN) said at the time that his health was stable and satisfactory.\nNavalny has also complained of being woken up every hour by a guard during the night which he argues amounts to torture. The FSIN said in its statement on Wednesday that staff carried out \"a visual inspection of the convicts' presence on their beds\" but that did not disturb their sleep.\nAs well as serious back pain, he spoke of numbness in his leg which was preventing him from standing on it. He thought he was suffering from a pinched nerve after standing \"crookedly\" in cages during court appearances and travelling in police wagons. \nNed Price, spokesperson for the US state department on Wednesday described Navalny as a \"political prisoner\" and said his detention was \"politically motivated\". \n\"We will continue to seek to hold accountable those in Russia who may be responsible for the attempt on his life, for the repression against his peaceful supporters who have taken to the streets, and we will continue to find ways to support Mr Navalny and to call for his release,\" he added."

      "text": "A scheme to fit electronic tags on offenders to see if they are breaching court-ordered drinking bans is being rolled out across England.\nThe \"sobriety tags\" monitor a wearer's sweat levels every 30 minutes, and alert probation services if alcohol is detected.\nOffenders breaching their abstinence order can then be returned to court to face further sanctions.\nThe scheme has been in operation across Wales since October. \nThe government said more than 100 people have been tagged there since then, with offenders staying sober on over 95% of days monitored.\nThe rollout across England was meant to begin in late 2020, but has been delayed.\nUnder the scheme, courts will be able to hand out \"alcohol abstinence orders\" to offenders who commit crimes fuelled by alcohol.\nThese can require the offender to abstain from alcohol for up to four months and wear the electronic tag to monitor compliance. \nPolicing and Crime Minister Kit Malthouse said the tags were a \"powerful new tool\" to combat alcohol-fuelled violence and help steer offenders away from \"bad habits\". \nThe tags can only be used with offenders over the age of 18, who are not dependent on alcohol or have certain medical conditions. \nThe government says the tags can distinguish the difference between drinks and other types of alcohol - such as in hand sanitiser or perfume.\nThe scheme has already been trialled in Humberside, Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire and London."

      "text": "Pfizer says trials of its Covid vaccine in children aged 12 to 15 show 100% efficacy and a strong immune response.\nInitial results from trials in 2,260 adolescents in the US also suggest the vaccine is safe with no unusual side-effects.\nThe drug company says it will submit its data to the US and European authorities for emergency use in 12- to 15-year-olds.\nThere are currently no plans for children to be vaccinated in the UK.\nChildren's risk of becoming very ill or even dying with Covid-19 is tiny, and throughout the pandemic they have very rarely needed hospital treatment.\nAdults - particularly those over 50 and people with serious underlying health conditions - have a much higher risk, which is why they have been vaccinated as a priority in the UK. \nPfizer is one of a number of drug companies testing their Covid vaccines on children. The aim of vaccinating them - particularly older children - would be to keep schools open, reduce the spread of coronavirus in the community and protect vulnerable children with conditions which put them at increased risk.\nAstraZeneca announced trials of its vaccine in UK children aged six to 17 some time ago, and the first of 300 volunteers were due to be jabbed last month. The vaccine is currently only authorised for people aged 18 and over in the UK.\nAlongside trials in teenagers, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is authorised for use in those aged over 16, is also being tested in children under 12, with the aim of involving babies from just six months old. \nThe company started dosing the first healthy, young children in this trial last week.\nIn the Pfizer trial in 12- to 15-year-olds, 18 cases of Covid-19 were seen in the group given a dummy vaccine and none in group given the Covid vaccine which protects against it.\nAll participants received two doses 21 days apart, and the 18 cases were all children with symptoms. There were no tests for asymptomatic infection - children displaying no symptoms.\nThe figures are preliminary and full data has not been released, peer-reviewed or published in a journal.\nDr Peter English, former consultant in communicable disease control and past chair of the BMA public health medicine committee, said more detail was needed to properly evaluate the company's claims.\n\"It would be useful to know how effective the vaccine is at preventing asymptomatic infection. Young people are less likely to have severe disease; and when they are infected, they are more likely to have asymptomatic infection, allowing them to transmit the disease to others,\" he said.\nThe company's press release also doesn't mention the impact of variants on the trials, how cases were identified in children and whether a longer gap between doses was tested.\nAlbert Bourla, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer, said the company was \"encouraged\" by the clinical trial data.\n\"We plan to submit these data to FDA [US Federal Drugs Administration] as a proposed amendment to our Emergency Use Authorization in the coming weeks, and to other regulators around the world, with the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year.\"\nUgur Sahin, CEO and co-founder of BioNTech, said the initial results in adolescents suggested children \"are particularly well protected by vaccination\".\nHe added: \"It is very important to enable them to get back to everyday school life and to meet friends and family while protecting them and their loved ones.\"  \nModerna, the US company behind another Covid vaccine ordered by the UK, has also started testing its jab on children under 11."

      "tags": "Russia,Nato,Italy",
      "text": "An Italian navy officer has been arrested after being caught in the act of handing secret documents to a Russian military official, police say.\nThe men were stopped by military police on suspicion of serious crimes relating to espionage and state security.\nThe Russian, who reportedly worked at the Russian embassy in Italy, is expected to be expelled.\nThe foreign ministry in Rome summoned Russia's ambassador Sergey Razov and then expelled two Russian officials.\nItalian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said the pair were \"involved in this extremely serious affair\". The Italian officer was identified as a navy frigate captain working in the office of Chief of the Defence Staff.\nThe Kremlin said it hoped the \"very positive and constructive nature of Russian-Italian relations will continue\" but Russia's foreign ministry is expected to respond to the expulsions.\nThe carabinieri del Ros special operations group swooped on the men in Rome on Tuesday evening \"during a clandestine meeting between the two,\" a police statement said.\nThey were \"caught immediately after the transfer of a document by the Italian officer in exchange for a sum of money\", it added. \nItalian media reported that the exchange had taken place in a car park and involved \u20ac5,000 (\u00a34,250; $5,900) in cash.\nWhile the navy captain was arrested, Italian police said the Russian officer's diplomatic status was currently being assessed.\nItaly's Corriere website reports that papers seized in the naval officer's flat suggest he may have passed on Nato secrets, thereby placing other countries' national security at risk. According to the Ansa news agency, the documents involved military communications.\nThe Russian embassy confirmed the involvement of a military attach\u00e9 official but said any further comment was inappropriate. \nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said \"we don't have information about the reasons for or the circumstances of this detention\". The foreign ministry in Moscow told Ansa that it regretted the expulsions of two embassy staff and would make a further announcement on possible steps in response.\nIt has the makings of a Cold War thriller: the Italian naval captain handing top-secret files, including Nato documents, to a Russian military attach\u00e9 for the princely sum of \u20ac5,000; the two caught red-handed as police burst in; an arrest, diplomatic expulsions; the risk of 15 years in prison\u2026 \nBut beyond the drama, the story will add to concerns that Italy has become somewhat of a back door for illicit Russian activity in the EU. \nRome is one of the more Moscow-friendly members. In 2019, an Italian and Russian were arrested for colluding to steal trade secrets from an American aviation company. \nProsecutors are investigating whether Russians tried to siphon funds to the League party of Matteo Salvini. \nAnd when the coronavirus pandemic exploded in Italy last year and the EU was slow to help, Moscow despatched supplies under the banner \"From Russia with Love\" - an operation that some here believed raised security fears given the large number of military officers sent in.  \nPolice moved in following a lengthy operation by Italy's Aisi domestic intelligence agency. Italian media are describing the incident as the most serious since the Cold War. \nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter that the UK stood in solidarity with Italy in \"exposing and taking action against Russia's malign and destabilising activity that is designed to undermine our Nato ally\".\nRelations between Moscow and Nato have deteriorated since Russia seized and annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. The poisoning of leading Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, now being held in a Russian penal colony, has also led to a decline. \nWhen US President Joe Biden said this month that he considered Russia's Vladimir Putin \"a killer\", the foreign ministry in Moscow demanded an explanation and Mr Putin retorted that \"it takes one to know one\".\nLast week, Nato member Bulgaria expelled two Russian diplomats for \"intelligence activity incompatible with diplomatic relations\".\nItalian fighter planes were involved in a Nato operation to intercept Russian planes over the Baltic Sea on Monday."

      "tags": "Black Lives Matter,Racism",
      "text": "A government-commissioned report which found that the UK \"no longer\" had a system rigged against minorities has been accused of ignoring black and ethnic minority people's concerns.\nThe Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on how people's lives turned out.\nCampaigners said it laid the blame for inequality on individuals and families.\nAnd Labour has accused the government of downplaying institutional racism.\nThe commission was set up after Black Lives Matter (BLM) anti-racism protests across the country last summer - triggered by the killing of George Floyd in the US. But its report has been was met with criticism from campaigners.\nJabeer Butt, chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, said: \"The report seems to go out of its way to deny that there's anything that's been the result of policies we've put in place and instead puts the blame at individuals' decisions or at family's doors.\"\nThe GMB's national officer Rehana Azam said it \"feels like a deeply cynical report\", calling it \"completely irresponsible and immoral\" and accusing it of ignoring black and ethnic minority workers' concerns.\nBoris Johnson said the government would consider the implications of the report's recommendations for future policy and remained \"fully committed to building a fairer Britain\".\nThe commission's 258-page report concluded that the UK is not yet a \"post-racial country\" - but its success in removing race-based disparity in education and, to a lesser extent, the economy, \"should be regarded as a model for other white-majority countries\".\nIn his foreword to the report chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, said while the \"impediments and disparities do exist\", it continued, they were \"varied and ironically very few of them are directly to do with racism\".\nBlack Lives Matter UK tweeted that it was \"disappointed\" that the report overlooked disproportionality in the criminal justice system.\nBlack people in England and Wales are nine times more likely to be imprisoned than their white peers, it said.\nThe report thanked the \"mainly young people\" behind the BLM movement for putting the focus on race but said progress could not be achieved by \"cleaving to a fatalistic account that insists nothing has changed\".\nAmong the main findings of the report were:  \nLabour's shadow women and equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova labelled the report a \"divisive polemic\" that downplayed institutional racism.\nHer colleague David Lammy, who led a review on racial bias in the justice system, tweeted that Britain's black community was being \"gaslighted\" and said he was \"tired of the endless debate about whether structural racism exists with little desire to actually address it\".\nInstitutional racism was defined in the Macpherson report, commissioned after Stephen Lawrence's murder, as \"the collective failure of an organisation to provide the appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin\".\nCommission member Samir Shah, chief executive of a TV production company, said the commission did not believe there was no institutional racism in Britain but said the term had become \"divisive\".\nRacism was only one of the factors which caused disparities between ethnic groups, he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. \"People do have choices, they do have agency, it's not always that they're just victims of some miasmic racism that's in the air,\" he said.\nWhen setting up the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities during the Black Lives Matter protests last summer, Boris Johnson said he wanted to \"change the narrative, so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination\".  \nBut reaching a settled view on the question of racism in the UK was always going to be a struggle.\nCritics were concerned by the prime minister's assertion that he wanted \"to look very carefully at the real racism and discrimination that people face\". \nThere was further unease among anti-racism groups at the reported involvement of Number 10 policy advisor Munira Mirza, because she had previously written of how institutional racism was \"a perception more than a reality\". \nThe appointment of Tony Sewell to lead the inquiry once again disappointed anti-racism activists. \nOne London-based organisation, Monitoring Group, considered seeking a judicial review to prevent his selection on the grounds that he had \"a longstanding record of public statements rejecting or minimising\" the impact of institutional racism in Britain.\nThe accusation that this report is the result of a hand-picked committee, designed to say what ministers wanted to hear, will have some traction, whatever the commission and the government insist about its independence.\nRead more from Mark here.\nThe commission said unemployment differences between ethnic groups had declined and the pay gap between ethnic minority workers and white workers was also falling and at its lowest level for almost a decade.\nBut TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said \"institutional and structural racism exists in the UK, in both the labour market and wider society\", and said black and minority ethnic workers were far more likely \"to be in low-paid, insecure jobs\" compared to white workers.\nProf Kehinde Andrews, a professor of black studies at Birmingham City University told BBC news the report was \"not a genuine attempt to understand racism in Britain\" or \"make a substantive change\".\nHe said the fact there was a discussion over whether institutional racism existed was the problem, \"because it does exist, it clearly exists and the question should be 'how do we address this'\". \nLiberal Democrat equalities spokeswoman Wera Hobhouse said the report must not be used as an excuse to continue \"shameful inaction\" on issues of racial injustice.\nShe called for an end to \"hostile environment\" immigration policies and the \"disproportionate\" use of police stop and search tactics.\nThe commission found not enough information was given to the public about why police used stop and search, saying the focus was on drugs rather than knife offences.\nIn its recommendations, the commission also called for the term BAME, which stands for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic, to be dropped, calling it \"unhelpful\" and \"imprecise and often misleading\".\nDr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a member of the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, said the report was not denying institutional racism existed but said the commission had not discovered evidence of it in the areas it had looked.\nEqualities minister Kemi Badenoch said she \"warmly welcomed\" the report and was impressed by the analysis within the report, but added she was \"looking forward to understanding fully\" the issues that had been raised and \"what can be done\" to address them.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said progress had been made to tackle racism. \"That's not to say there aren't instances of racism that of course exist in this country,\" he told ITV.\n\"But if I think about the things that happened to me when I was a kid, I can't imagine those things happening to me now.\"\nThe report's 24 recommendations included: "

      "text": "Labour says it has obtained an old business card that described financier Lex Greensill as a \"senior adviser\" in David Cameron's office.\nThe card includes a Downing Street email address, and what appears to be a direct line landline telephone number.\nThe party said it raised \"further serious questions\" about Mr Greensill's influence under the ex-PM.\nThe government has said Mr Greensill's role was unpaid and \"approved in the normal manner\". \nThe Sunday Times has reported that he was given \"privileged access\" to Whitehall when he worked as an unpaid adviser under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government.\nNeither Mr Greensill nor Mr Cameron has commented on the matter.\nCommunities Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC News Channel that unpaid advisers offered Whitehall departments \"fantastic expertise and experience, completely free of charge\".\nHe added that, if Mr Greensill had had a government business card showing an official email account, these would have been \"signed off by civil servants at the time\".\nLabour says the business card was handed to a figure in industry in the summer of 2012 by Mr Greensill, after he started the advisory role on business financing. \nThe Sunday Times reported that during his time in the role, he had promoted a government-backed loans scheme to speed up payments to pharmacists.\nThe company he founded, Greensill Capital, later went on to provide funds for the scheme.\nIn 2018 - two years after he had stood down as prime minister - Mr Cameron became an adviser to the firm.\nLabour has called for an urgent inquiry in to the matter and it wants the Committee on Standards In Public Life to look into the extent of the access to government offered to Mr Greensill under the coalition.\nShadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: \"The public have a right to know what happened here . We need a full, transparent and thorough investigation\".\nThe committee has said it does not investigate individual cases, but it is looking more widely at issues of lobbying and transparency.\nLabour has also asked the committee to examine Mr Cameron's reported role in lobbying the government on behalf of Greensill Capital after the firm employed him as an adviser.\nThe Financial Times has previously reported that Mr Cameron unsuccessfully tried to increase the firm's involvement in a scheme offering government-backed loans to Covid-hit companies.\nGreensill was accredited to supply lending under the government's Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme, before it filed for insolvency earlier this month.\nLast week, Mr Cameron was cleared by a lobbying watchdog, after it concluded his work for the company did not require declaration on the register of consultant lobbyists.\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"Lex Greensill acted as a Supply Chain Finance Adviser from 2012 to 2015 and as a Crown Representative for three years from 2013.\n\"His appointment was approved in the normal manner and he was not paid for either role.\""

      "tags": "France,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Emmanuel Macron,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "French schools will close for at least three weeks as part of new national restrictions to fight rising Covid cases, President Emmanuel Macron says.\nMr Macron said that schools would move to remote learning from next week. \nLockdown measures, introduced in some areas of France earlier this month, are also being extended to other districts.\nAll non-essential shops are to close from Saturday and there will be a ban on travelling more than 10km (six miles) from home without good reason. \nThe country is facing a peak of over 5,000 people in intensive care.\nOn Wednesday, the country's health ministry reported 59,038 new cases. France has so far reported more than 4.6 million cases of coronavirus and 95,495 Covid-related deaths.\nIn his live televised address on Wednesday, Mr Macron described the situation in the country as \"delicate\" and said that April would prove crucial. \"We will lose control if we do not move now,\" he said. \nThe 43-year-old president said it was a race between vaccinations on the one hand and attempting to control the spread of the virus on the other.\nHe said that while schools would be closing from next week, classes would remain open for the children of key workers. Primary schools and kindergartens will shut for three weeks and high schools for a week longer, although that includes two weeks of spring holiday from 12-26 April.\nMr Macron said that measures introduced in 19 districts earlier this month - including the closure of non-essential businesses, exercise restricted to within 10km of an individual's home and a ban on travel to other parts of the country without a valid reason - would be extended nationwide. \n\"Everyone should limit their contacts with other people,\" he said, adding that people would be given the Easter weekend to get themselves to where they want to spend the lockdown. \nFrance's nationwide 19:00 curfew will remain in place and people are again being asked to work from home.\nThe president said \"the end of the tunnel\" was in sight if people respected the new measures. \nParliament will debate the measures announced by Mr Macron before voting on them on Thursday, according to the prime minister's office.\nMore than at previous turning-points, the politics of Covid in France is becoming interesting.\nFor one thing, President Macron has opened up a much clearer target now for the opposition - they can argue that his decision back in January to overrule the scientists and not launch a third lockdown was a blunder.\nHe was warned then that the so-called British variant would sweep all before it by the end of March - and lo and behold that is what has happened. And now he is eating his hat.\nFor his enemies, it is the result of Macron's hubris - the insufferable self-belief that makes him think he knows better than the doctors.\nThe other reason it's getting sensitive is the UK. Everyone in France can see how much better the vaccination programme is going there. If the UK starts resuming ordinary life while France is still struggling, tough questions will be asked of the president.\nAnd elections are only a year away. \nWith serious cases of coronavirus increasing in France, the pressure on hospitals in the greater Paris region has resulted in a surge in demand for beds at intensive care units (ICUs). Hospitals in and around Paris have also been reducing non-Covid treatments.\nThe French hospital federation (FHF) last week warned that wards across the country were facing an \"unprecedented violent shock\" in the coming weeks if authorities were unable to curb the rise in cases. It urged the government to issue a \"strict lockdown\" or risk hospitals becoming overwhelmed. \nIn an interview with France Inter radio on Tuesday, head of infectious diseases at the Tenon hospital in Paris, Gilles Pialoux, said that lockdown restrictions should have been implemented sooner.\n\"We've lost so much time that the measures now will be harder and last for longer,\" he said, adding that hospital staff were \"tired of being tired\".\nPublic support for a new national lockdown has reportedly been increasing in recent days, with an Elabe Institute poll published on Wednesday suggesting that 54% of citizens questioned backed the move.\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo on Wednesday backed the closure of schools, saying the move - which had been seen by the government as a last resort - was necessary because of the \"very serious situation\".\nA group of French school teachers had earlier filed a legal complaint against Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer for \"endangering the lives of others\", accusing him of failing to protect staff in regular contact with children in classrooms.\nIn Germany, the leaders of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg, the country's worst hit states, have called for tougher restrictions, saying the situation was worse than initially thought. The city of Hamburg is to introduce a night curfew on Friday.\nSpain is to revisit a new law implemented on Wednesday that requires face masks to be worn in outdoor spaces - including beaches and swimming pools - amid mounting criticism over the move. \nAuthorities in Portugal say they aim to vaccinate all members of priority groups with at least one Covid-19 jab by 11 April. The head of the national coronavirus taskforce told parliament that the focus would be on care home residents, people aged 80 and over and those aged 50 and over with underlying conditions.\nA court in the Czech Republic has struck down the requirement for Czech citizens returning from blacklisted countries to test negative before leaving, arguing that tests can be carried out on arrival.\nPoland on Wednesday registered its highest daily Covid death toll this year, with 653 fatalities. The country has recorded a total of 53,045 coronavirus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic. \nMeanwhile, experts investigating possible links between the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots have so far found no specific risk factors, such as age, gender or medical history, European Union regulators have said. The European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, said that analysis was continuing."

It's easier to attack something than do something positive about it,\" she said.\nUnconscious bias training is an attempt to challenge prejudiced ways of thinking that could unfairly influence decisions - such as who might get a job or a promotion.\nIt can be prejudiced behaviour, based on assumptions about others, that people are not aware of themselves.\nBut the government says there is no proof that such training changes behaviour - and that it can \"backfire\" and create a negative response.\nA written ministerial statement from Cabinet Office minister Julia Lopez will announce \"unconscious bias training does not achieve its intended aims. It will therefore be phased out in the civil service\".\n\"We encourage other public sector employers to do likewise,\" she says, urging the end to training which has been widely used to address bias in race, gender and sexuality.\nBut it has also been caught up in \"culture war\" arguments and accusations over \"political correctness\".\nThe government says it is \"determined to eliminate discrimination in the workplace\", but unconscious bias training is the wrong approach.\nThe Government Equalities Office says there has been \"no evidence\" that the training improved workplace equality.\nAmong the researchers cited is psychologist Patrick Forscher, who examined more than 400 studies on unconscious bias.\nHe said that few studies measured changes over time, and among \"the most robust of those that did\", the findings suggested \"changes in implicit bias don't last\".\nDr Forscher said such training had too often been used by employers as a \"catch all\", which failed to really tackle the specific barriers for different groups.\nHalima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust race equality think tank, said unconscious bias training is not always effective - and recognised the dangers of a corporate \"diversity industry\" wanting to have \"off the shelf\" training.\nBut she warned the government would have to replace it with something better and further reaching - which addressed bias and \"ingrained views\" at a more \"fundamental level\".\nMs Begum said there needed to be structural changes about fair pay, progression and work practices, rather than courses which \"make your boss feel better, but is not going to change the system\".\nThe value of such training was defended by Jane Farrell, chief executive of the EW Group, a diversity and inclusion consultancy. \n\"There is a misconception that unconscious bias training is guilt inducing and tells people off for who or what they are, which is simply not true,\" she said.\n\"Great unconscious bias training provides a positive and supportive environment to think through how to ensure we recruit the best staff rather than inadvertently clone ourselves,\" said Ms Farrell.\nPsychologist and author Stuart Ritchie said even though many staff might be required to take such unconscious bias training there was \"nowhere near robust evidence\" that it was able to change minds or behaviour.\nDr Ritchie said firms might use this training to \"placate worries\", but there was a lack of evidence that it would really reduce prejudice.\nJonny Gifford, who has worked with firms on diversity and inclusion, said unconscious bias had to be recognised as a \"massive problem\".\nBut Mr Gifford, adviser to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, warned the shortcomings of unconscious bias training should not be used to stop trying to \"make the workplace more inclusive and to reduce barriers to inequality\".\n\"To dismiss this as political correctness or being 'woke' is a very shaky place to be,\" said Mr Gifford."

      "title": "George Floyd: Teenage witness 'stays up apologising for not doing more'",
      "tags": "Minneapolis,US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "The teenager whose film of George Floyd's death sparked global protests said she \"stays up apologising\" to him for \"not doing more\".\nDarnella, now 18, was one of four young witnesses to take the stand on the second day of Derek Chauvin's trial. \nShe told the court of seeing Mr Floyd \"begging for his life\", comparing him to her dad, brother, cousins and uncles \"because they are all black\".\nIssues of racial equality and policing lie at the centre of the case.\nOn Monday, the opening session of the trial heard Mr Chauvin, an ex-police officer, knelt on Mr Floyd's neck for over nine minutes while arresting him in Minneapolis in May 2020. Prosecutors say this was a \"major cause\" in his death.\nDefence lawyers have indicated they will argue that 46-year-old Mr Floyd died of an overdose. Mr Chauvin, 45, denies charges of murder and manslaughter.\nThree other officers who were present - Tou Thao, J Alexander Keung and Thomas Lane - will go on trial later in the year.\nFour children who were all under 18 at the time of the incident gave evidence to the court, but the cameras were switched off so the jurors could not see them and they were identified only by their first names.\nDarnella, then 17 years old, was walking to the Cup Foods shop with her nine-year-old cousin when they came across the arrest on the street outside. \nShe told the court she started filming on her phone because \"I saw a man terrified, begging for his life. It wasn't right - he was in pain.\"\nShe described hearing Mr Floyd \"saying 'I can't breathe'. He was terrified, he was calling for his mom.\" \nDarnella said witnessing his death had changed her life.\n\"When I look at George Floyd I look at my dad, I look at my brother, my cousins, my uncles - because they are all black,\" she said, audibly crying. \"And I look at how that could have been one of them.\"\n\"I stay up apologising to George Floyd for not doing more.\"\nHer young cousin also gave evidence and said she felt \"sad and kind of mad\" by what she saw. \"It sounded like he was hurting\".\nTwo friends, Alissa, 18, and Kalen, 17, had driven up to the store when they came across the arrest. Both described feeling helpless as they watched Mr Floyd's last moments before \"he was just laying there, no longer fighting or resisting\".\nThe last witness of the day was Genevieve Hansen, an off-duty firefighter, who said the officers prevented her from administering medical help that would have saved Mr Floyd's life. She was rebuked by the judge for her testy responses to defence questioning.\nOne witness, Donald Williams II, who is trained in mixed martial arts, was questioned for over an hour by the prosecution and defence on Monday and again on Tuesday.\nHe told the court Mr Chauvin had used a dangerous technique called a \"blood choke\" and was moving his knee back and forth to increase the pressure on Mr Floyd's back and neck.\nHe rejected defence suggestions that he and other bystanders' interactions with police had been threatening to the officers there. \nIn opening statements on Monday, Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell told the jury that Mr Chauvin had \"betrayed his badge\" by kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck, and using \"excessive and unreasonable force\" to detain him.\nMeanwhile, Mr Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson said the case was about the evidence, not about a \"political or social cause\". He said Mr Floyd had ingested drugs at the time of his arrest \"in an effort to conceal them to police\", and suggested this contributed to his death.\nMr Chauvin has been silent but remained engaged during the proceedings, taking almost constant notes on a yellow legal pad while listening to the evidence.\nDarnella's video footage of Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck was replayed the world over and sparked mass protests and a racial reckoning in the US.\nTo many, Floyd's death while in police custody became a vivid symbol of police brutality - particularly against people of colour - and it sparked worldwide demonstrations for racial justice.\nBut despite the global outcry this is not an open and shut case. In the US, police are rarely convicted for deaths that occur while they are on duty, if they are charged at all.\nThe verdict in this case will be widely seen as an indication of how the US legal system treats deaths that occur while in police custody."

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),China,Wuhan,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said further investigation is needed to conclusively rule out that Covid-19 emerged from a laboratory in China. \nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that although a lab leak was the least likely cause, more research was needed.\nThe US and other countries have criticised China for failing to provide the WHO with sufficient data.  \nBeijing has always dismissed the allegations of a virus leak.\nA report by WHO and Chinese experts released on Tuesday, said the lab leak explanation was highly unlikely and the virus had probably jumped from bats to humans via another intermediary animal. \nChina has yet to respond to the WHO's latest statement. \nHowever the theory that the virus might have come from a leak in a laboratory \"requires further investigation, potential with additional missions involving specialist experts,\" Dr Tedros said on Tuesday.  \n\"Let me say clearly that as far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table,\" he added. \nThe virus was first detected in Wuhan, in China's Hubei province in late 2019. An international team of experts travelled to to the city in January to probe the origins of the virus. \nTheir research relied on samples and evidence provided by Chinese officials but Dr Tedros said the team had difficulty accessing raw data and called for \"more timely and comprehensive data sharing\" in the future. \nThe team investigated all possibilities, including one theory that the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The institute is the world's leading authority on the collection, storage and study of bat coronaviruses. \nIn response to the WHO report, the US and 13 allies including South Korea, Australia and the UK voiced concern over the findings and urged China to provide \"full access\" to experts. \nThe statement said the mission to Wuhan was \"significantly delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and samples\".\n\"Scientific missions like these should be able to do their work under conditions that produce independent and objective recommendations and findings.\"\nThe group pledged to work together with the WHO. \nFormer US President Donald Trump was among those who supported the theory that the virus might have escaped from a lab.\nWHO investigation team leader, Peter Ben Embarek said on Tuesday his team had felt under political pressure, including from outside China but said he was never pressed to remove anything from the team's final report.\nHe also confirmed his team had found no evidence that any laboratories in Wuhan were involved in the outbreak. \nDr Embarak also said that it was \"perfectly possible\" that cases were circulating in the Wuhan area in October or November 2019. China informed the WHO about cases on 3 January, a month after the first reported infection. \nChina has always rejected claims the virus originated in a lab and says that although Wuhan is where the first cluster of cases was detected, it is not necessarily where the virus originated. \nState media has claimed that the virus may have arrived in Wuhan on frozen food imports.\nThe country has largely brought its own outbreak under control through quick mass testing, stringent lockdowns and tight travel restrictions.\nWorldwide, more than 127 million people have caught the virus since it was first identified, and more than 2.7 million people are known to have died from it."

His wife, Yvonne Murray, reports on China for the Irish public broadcaster RT\u00c9.\nSudworth says he and his team faced surveillance, threats of legal action, obstruction and intimidation wherever they tried to film. \nHis reporting colleagues are still in Beijing, and he says he intends to continue his reporting from Taiwan.\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the authorities had not been given prior notice. \n\"Only in recent days when we were faced with the task of renewing Sudworth's press card did we learn that Sudworth left without saying goodbye. After he left the country, he didn't by any means inform the relevant departments nor provide any reason why,\" Hua Chunying told a news conference in Beijing. \nIn its statement, the BBC said: \"John's reporting has exposed truths the Chinese authorities did not want the world to know.\"\nThe number of international media organisations reporting from China is shrinking. Last year China expelled correspondents for the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, among others. \nAnd in September 2020, the last two reporters working in China for Australian media flew home after a five-day diplomatic standoff.\nThe Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) of China says foreign journalists are \"being caught up in diplomatic rows out of their control\".\n\"Abuse of Sudworth and his colleagues at the BBC forms part of a larger pattern of harassment and intimidation that obstructs the work of foreign correspondents in China and exposes their Chinese news assistants to growing pressure,\" the FCC said in a statement posted on Twitter.

      "text": "Scotland's political leaders have clashed over whether a second independence referendum is needed as the country recovers from the pandemic.\nSNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the country was in danger of going in the \"wrong direction\" if it left decisions on the recovery to Boris Johnson. \nBut her pro-UK opponents said the last thing the country needed was the \"divisiveness\" of a referendum.\nThey were taking part in a BBC Scotland debate ahead of the election on 6 May. \nThe televised debate saw Ms Sturgeon, the country's first minister, go head-to-head with Conservative leader Douglas Ross, Labour's Anas Sarwar, Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie and Lorna Slater, the co-leader of the pro-independence Scottish Greens.\nMs Sturgeon said she would want a second vote on Scottish independence to take place in the first half of the next five-year Holyrood term \"assuming the crisis has passed\".\nBut she dismissed suggestions that the pursuit of independence was a distraction from the Covid crisis, saying she had spent the day in talks with her clinical advisers rather than on the campaign trail.\nShe said: \"I'll leave other people to judge if my focus has been on the pandemic or not over the past year. People have seen me literally every single day lead the country's fight against Covid and I have literally spent almost every waking moment doing that.\n\"I will continue to do that for every single day that is required out of that crisis, because it is not over yet.\"\nBut she added: \"Recovery is not a neutral thing. \n\"So long as so many of the decisions lies in the hands of Boris Johnson and Westminster, then the danger is we take the wrong decisions and go in the wrong direction just as we've been dragged out of the EU against our will.\"\nThis debate was a reminder of the major fault line in Scottish politics - independence or continued union. \nMore than six years after the referendum, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed she is aiming to hold another vote in the first half of the next term at Holyrood.\nShe qualified that by saying this timescale depends on the Covid crisis being past but it's not clear how that will be determined.\nThe Greens also support indyref2 but avoided being tied down on timing. \nThe three other parties - Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats made their opposition to a referendum clear. \nBut the Tory leader Douglas Ross was determined to outdo the others, going as far as saying he did not want to work with the SNP because of independence. \nThat prompted Labour's Anas Sarwar to urge him to \"grow up\". \nThis election is not just a choice of first minister - there's also a lively debate between those for whom a strong second place finish would be a good result.\nBut Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the coronavirus vaccination programme showed the strength of the United Kingdom when it worked together. \nHe said more than half of all Scottish adults have now had their first does of vaccine, and added: \"The United Kingdom getting the vaccines that are delivered by our NHS staff, our British armed forces and volunteers. That's the union working for people right now.\"\nMr Ross asked: \"Why do we have bills in the Scottish Parliament to take forward another independence referendum, but not bills in the Scottish Parliament to support education, to help businesses, to protect jobs?\n\"None of that is happening because the Scottish government and the SNP are focused on another independence referendum.\"\nSCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat elections are happening? On 6 May, voters in Scotland will elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government. Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Scottish Parliament have? MSPs pass laws on most aspects of daily life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and benefits. Defence, foreign and immigration policies are decided by the UK Parliament.\nHow do I vote?\u00a0Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You can\u00a0register to vote online. \nMeanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar highlighted the case of a tertiary cancer patient who had been told she would not be treated in Scotland.\nMr Sarwar said this was because the backlog due to Covid meant operations were only being done on first cancers, and not recurring cancers, so the woman had to travel to England for treatment.\nHe said: \"That is what should be getting us exercised in this debate today. That is what we should be obsessing about, and that is what the recovery plan needs to be about.\n\"These are the things that matter to people across the country. They don't care about the badges or the name calling. They care about having services that work for them - what Scotland can do, not what Scotland can't do\". \nBut Ms Sturgeon's position was backed by Ms Slater, who said the Scottish Green manifesto would commit to a referendum taking place in the next Holyrood term.\nMs Slater said: \"Around the room we hear people who are in favour of the Union not actually arguing for the Union, but instead arguing that the people of Scotland shouldn't have the right to choose.\n\"The Scottish Greens would support a referendum in this term of parliament because we think decisions about Scotland should be made by the Scottish people.\"\nMs Slater said the pandemic had shown that Scotland's economy was propped up by low wages, insecure work and a social security system that is full of holes.\nAnd she said science showed that the planet had less than a decade before the climate breakdown would go past the point of no return - and argued that we \"can't go back to this broken system\" after the pandemic.\nMr Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said more than 1,500 young people were having to wait more than a year for mental health support. \nAnd he said the pandemic had also highlighted the need to improve the country's care sector, and the lack of support for schoolchildren who had lost out on education. \nHe said: \"I've seen a window into the next five years in the last few weeks - arguments over the constitution, strategy about independence, arguments between Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond which have been poisonous and unpleasant.\n\"What we need to do is to put all of that behind us and choose a different future. \n\"And if we can do that we can tackle mental health, we can tackle education, but we can also make sure our social care workers get the pay they deserve.\"\nDo you have a question about the Scottish Parliament election?

      "tags": "Companies,Deliveroo,Stock markets",
      "text": "Deliveroo shares have plummeted on its stock market debut after a number of major UK investors expressed concerns about its gig economy worker model.\nShares in the food delivery business had been offered to investors at 390p each, but closed 14% lower at 284p per share, having fallen 30% initially.\nThe company had initially hoped for a share price of up to 460p.\nBut in recent weeks a number of high-profile fund managers said they would not be buying the shares.\nThe Deliveroo share sale is London's biggest stock market launch for a decade and the sharp fall on its first day of trading is a blow to the UK's ambitions to persuade more big tech companies to list in the UK.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said earlier this month that the listing of the Amazon-backed company was a \"true British tech success story\" that could clear the way for more initial public offerings by fast-growing technology firms.\nWhen ITV political editor Robert Peston asked on Wednesday whether he was embarrassed by the plunge in Deliveroo shares,Mr Sunak said: \"Gosh, no... share prices go up, share prices go down.\"\nMr Sunak cited Facebook's mixed start after its initial public offering in 2012, and its subsequent success.\nBut some analysts were not so complimentary. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said:\n\"Deliveroo has gone from hero to zero as the much-hyped stock market debut falls flat on its face.\n\"Initially there was a lot of fanfare about the Amazon-backed company making its shares available to the public, including the ability for customers to buy stock. Sadly, the narrative took a turn for the worst when multiple fund managers came out and said they wouldn't back the business due to concerns about working practices.\"\nDeliveroo, which has not yet made a profit, said on Monday it had chosen to \"price responsibly\" and sell its shares at the bottom of its planned price range at 390p due to \"volatile\" market conditions.\nSome of the UK's biggest investment fund managers, including Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, charity fund manager CCLA, Legal and General Investment Management and M&G said recently they would not buy shares in Deliveroo, citing concerns over including the working conditions of its riders and lack of investor power.\nThis was supposed to be a landmark day for Deliveroo, the wider UK tech sector and the London Stock Exchange. A British business founded just eight years ago had shown it could grow and prosper here without falling into overseas hands and by choosing London rather than New York for its stock market debut, setting an example for others to follow. \nBut the sharp fall this morning in shares - already priced at the conservative end of the planned range - showed that faith in Deliveroo's prospects was somewhat shaky. It was as if investors had suddenly woken up to something which should have been obvious all along - Deliveroo might have grown rapidly during the pandemic but it is still racking up big losses in what is a competitive food delivery market, \nThen there's the question of whether the company might have to improve pay and conditions for its delivery drivers following Uber's defeat before the Supreme Court. However loudly Deliveroo insisted that the Uber ruling had no relevance to its business, some investors weren't so sure, worrying that the path to profitability might be even tougher. \nAs the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said, pointing at Facebook, a shaky debut does not mean the shares won't soar in the longer term. Then again, Facebook didn't have to compete with Uber Eats and Just Eat in a market that looks a far more challenging place to make money than online advertising.\nFounder Will Shu will have shares that give him 20-times the voting power of other investors.\nChief executive Will Shu said he was \"very proud\" that Deliveroo was listing in London.\n\"In this next phase of our journey as a public company we will continue to invest in the innovations that help restaurants and grocers to grow their businesses, to bring customers more choice than ever before, and to provide riders with more work,\" he added.\nDeliveroo's self-employed drivers have seen a boom in demand during the Covid-19 pandemic, bringing food from restaurants to housebound customers.\nInitially, Deliveroo hoped to see that value as high as \u00a38.8bn, based on a share price of 390-460p. It scaled that back to \u00a37.6bn, but the share price drop wiped \u00a32.28bn off that.\nThe firm is making a portion of its stock available for customers, with delivery riders and restaurant partners also able to buy shares.\nDeliveroo is selling just over one-fifth of the group, while institutional investing trading started on Wednesday, the general public can start trading in its shares from 7 April.\nPrivate companies, as a way of raising cash, can start a process to list on a stock exchange.\nIn an initial public offering (IPO) companies offer shares to investors before listing.\nThe price of the shares is typically set by investment banks hired by the company to run the process.\nBut once the shares start to be publicly traded, prices are set by supply and demand.\nThe value of the shares, multiplied by how many there are, gives the market value of the company.\nSophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the biggest concern from investors was about worker rights: \"The flexible employee model of Deliveroo's riders is a huge pillar of the group's plans for success.\n\"If forced to offer more traditional employee benefits, like company pension contributions, Deliveroo's already thin margins would struggle to climb, and the road to profitability would look very tough indeed.\"\nShe said it was difficult to value the firm as it had yet to turn a profit. \nNeil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said that \"even pricing the initial public offering at the bottom of the range, Deliveroo was demanding too high a price tag for a loss-making delivery platform in a very competitive space with a questionable path to profitability.\n\"The books were covered, it was just plain mis-priced.\"\nHave you bought Deliveroo shares?

      "tags": "Social media,France,Coronavirus vaccines,Fake News,Conspiracy theories,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "France is one of the most vaccine-sceptical countries in the world - fertile ground for hard-line anti-vaccine activists spreading online misinformation, writes the BBC's specialist disinformation reporter Marianna Spring. \nIn his spare time, Gilles loves to watch sci-fi films and read bandes dessin\u00e9es - French comic books. \nHe also helps run a conspiracy-themed French-language Facebook group with 50,000 members, many of whom spread falsehoods about coronavirus. \nHe became a member just after the start of the pandemic, almost a year ago. \n\"I felt in my gut that this whole thing was overrated and wrong,\" Gilles says. He doesn't deny - like some others in the group - that Covid-19 is real. Instead he harbours vague suspicions about the disease, potential cures, and alleged cover-ups. \nAnd he doesn't want a Covid vaccine, because of posts he's seeing on the group.\nHe fears, despite the weight of scientific evidence, that jabs have been developed too quickly to be safe. And Gilles' story is part of a bigger picture. \nThe Facebook group that Gilles helps to run is just one example of a larger trend - an increase in French-language anti-vaccine content on social media over the past year. \nResearch from BBC Monitoring found that the number of followers of pages sharing extreme anti-vaccine content in French grew in 2020, from 3.2m to nearly 4.1m likes. \nThese pages aren't about asking legitimate medical questions - they're miles away from the scientific and political discussions currently under way in Europe and elsewhere.\nInstead, they're run by people who've firmly made up their minds against vaccinations, and who spread wild false rumours about vaccines killing millions, containing tracking devices, or altering our DNA. \nAnti-vaccine pages in French also tend to mix in anti-establishment posts. Many of the discussions centre around concerns that Covid jabs could be made compulsory, with anti-establishment and protest communities fearing that French democracy will be replaced with a so-called \"sanitary dictatorship\".\nCovid-19 vaccination is not currently mandatory in France, though children are legally required to be vaccinated against some diseases.\nFacebook says it is investigating the groups and pages flagged by the BBC's research, and that it has removed 12 million pieces of harmful misinformation about Covid-19 and approved vaccines. \n\"Last week we announced further measures to curb the spread of harmful misinformation in groups,\" a company spokesperson said, \"including by restricting the reach of those who break our rules.\"  \nThe Anti-Vax Files: A new series from BBC Trending, on the World Service from 05:30 GMT Saturday - or listen online \nIn the group run by Gilles, outlandish false conspiracy theories appear alongside posts expressing more moderate views, like opposition to making vaccines mandatory. \nHe doesn't agree with the extreme content, but Gilles says he struggles to delete all of the offending posts. \nBut there are others trying their best to fight the wave of anti-vaccine conspiracies. They create their own Facebook pages, infiltrating the spaces on social media where falsehoods thrive.\nMarie - not her real name - runs a group of volunteers pushing pro-vaccine messages online. She wants to remain anonymous because she fears for her safety.\n\"We had a lot of death threats,\" she explains, a little shaken as she speaks from her home in Paris, \"[from] people on social media who read our page and don't like what they see on it.\"\nI asked her why she continues in the face of abuse.\n\"I love science,\" she says, \"and I hate fake news.\" \nHer Facebook page arms followers with accurate information about vaccines, asks them to debate people and even to try to persuade them to get vaccinated.\nThis battle for the truth is raging all over the world, but it's particularly fierce in France. \nAccording to a survey by Ipsos late last year, just 40% of French people intended to receive a Covid-19 vaccine - although a more recent study indicated that number has increased to more than half. \nBut Tristan Mendes France, a university lecturer who helps run a site called Conspiracy Watch, is still worried about the figures. Fifteen years ago, he says, polls indicated that only about a tenth of France's population were sceptical about vaccines. \n\"It's important to differentiate between those who are sceptical about the vaccine and those who are absolutely anti-vaccine,\" he says. \nIn his view, the online anti-vaccine movement has thrived in France in particular because it plays on pre-existing scepticism of authority and pharmaceutical companies.\nIt's not just about online conspiracy theories. According to Mendes France and other experts, vaccine scepticism has deeper and more complicated roots - a combination of deep distrust in the state, a passion for personal liberty, and historical failings. \nThe country experienced a genuine vaccine scandal in 2009. The French government bought enough doses of the vaccine against the H1N1 \"swine flu\" virus to vaccinate its entire population. \nIt cost more than 600m euros (more than $700m or \u00a3500m), but with only a few hundred swine flu deaths in the country, many didn't want the jab. It was seen as huge waste of money. \nIn recent weeks, France was one of several European countries to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine over concerns about blood clots. \nThe UK and EU Medicine regulators have concluded that there is no evidence the vaccine causes clots, and that the jab safe and effective.\nBut it's another news story that has been used by French-speaking anti-vaccine activists to promote conspiracy narratives. \nThen there's the so-called \"Didier Raoult effect\".\nRaoult is a doctor who's a household name in France - famed for his intellect and his outspokeness. \n\"If you just start to be clever, it's a crime in our country. It's very hard for me not to be clever. I'm sorry,\" he chuckles, speaking from his research institute in Marseille. \nDespite a once-stellar reputation for scientific research, Dr Raoult caused controversy when he advocated the use of a drug called hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus. \nHis claims were repeated by Donald Trump, but lacked scientific evidence. The incident resulted in a formal complaint from his peers in the medical community.\nAside from the controversy over the drug, Dr Raoult has become - through no choice of his own - a hero for hard-core activists pushing anti-vaccine conspiracies. Fictitious quotes falsely attributed to the doctor have been circulated on social media. \nWhile these posts are false, he still has some controversial opinions about vaccines. He says he isn't sure people under age 65 should get a Covid-19 vaccine. That's despite the benefits that public health experts point out: younger people can be seriously affected by the virus, and mass vaccination can limit harmful virus mutations. \nDr Raoult's approach appears to be part of a more general outlook in French-speaking Europe. At the extreme end, it sometimes spills over to conspiratorial thinking. \nGilles, the sci-fi fan, is sure he doesn't want a Covid-19 vaccine. He's blas\u00e9 about catching the disease. \n\"I don't think that anything could happen,\" he says, \"Maybe [I would] get symptoms of flu, but that's very unlikely.\" \nCovid-19 has a higher mortality rate than flu in all age groups, except perhaps children under the age of 12. The long term effects of coronavirus can also be severe - and it's more infectious than flu. \nBut his lingering suspicion leaves Gilles - and others like him - vulnerable to all sorts of misinformation. \nHear The Anti-Vax Files from BBC Trending, on the World Service from 05:30 GMT Saturday - or listen online "

      "tags": "Glastonbury Festival,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nRecord temperatures in parts of England have coincided with lockdown restrictions easing and that's led to a warning not to \"drop our guard\" by breaking the rules. Tuesday was the hottest March day in 53 years, leading to many people gathering in parks and on beaches. Two parks in Nottingham have been closed after large crowds failed to socially distance and left rubbish behind. Public Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said: \"As restrictions lift and the weather improves, we cannot drop our guard. We're not out of the woods quite yet.\" Before you make plans, check out our explainer on the rule of six and social distancing and the roadmap of what's allowed and when.\nCritics of the police enforcement of Covid restrictions at a Sarah Everard vigil spoke out \"without knowing the facts\", the Met Police chief has said. Dame Cressida Dick said she had warned senior members of the government the event was likely to become an illegal mass gathering and could end with arrests. Several hundred people gathered on Clapham Common on 13 March to pay tribute to Miss Everard, 33, whose body was found in woodland near Ashford, Kent. Her death prompted a public debate over women's safety and the Met was criticised after women were handcuffed and removed from crowds. But a report has said the force was \"justified\" in deciding that the risks of transmitting coronavirus \"were too great to ignore\".\nA number of Covid vaccine manufacturers are now testing their jabs on children. And Pfizer says its trials on 12 to 15-year-olds show 100% efficacy and a strong immune response. British-Swedish brand AstraZeneca and Moderna, the US company behind another Covid vaccine ordered by the UK, are also testing their jabs on children. There are currently no plans for children to be vaccinated in the UK aside from 16 to 18-year-olds who have underlying health conditions. Find out what the risk of spreading coronavirus in schools is.\nRemember the Eat Out to Help Out restaurant discounts of last year? Well some big names in fashion and retail are calling for a \"Shop Out to Help Out\" scheme to get people spending again when non-essential stores reopen on 12 April. The likes of beauty entrepreneur Charlotte Tilbury, fashion designer Henry Holland and retail consultant Mary Portas are backing the plea for help from Chancellor Rishi Sunak. The Treasury has not commented on whether it would pursue the idea, but says it has protected \"millions\" of retail jobs during the pandemic.\nIf you've been in parts of the UK that have had sunshine this week and you've got that festival feeling we've got some good news for you. Glastonbury organisers have announced plans for a \"spectacular\" livestream from Worthy Farm, after the festival was cancelled for a second year. Coldplay, Damon Albarn, Jorja Smith, Kano, Haim and Wolf Alice will play at the five-hour event on 22 May. Organiser Emily Eavis told BBC Radio 2: \"What we're hoping is that people watch this from home\u2026 and they have a moment and get into the spirit of the festival.\" Here's how you can join in the party without the toilet queues.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. If you're wondering when you can go to a pub or restaurant we've got you covered.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise. Your contact details will never be published. Please ensure you have read our terms & conditions and privacy policy.\nUse this form to ask your question: \nIf you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question or send them via email to YourQuestions@bbc.co.uk.

      "title": "Why was Bobby Storey's funeral so controversial?",
      "tags": "Sinn F\u00e9in,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Michelle O'Neill,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The attendance of Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill at the funeral of Bobby Storey in June led to the biggest crisis in NI politics since devolution was restored in January.\nMs O'Neill and other senior Sinn F\u00e9in figures were widely criticised for attending the funeral, with claims they broke coronavirus guidelines.\nA decision was later made by the Public Prosecution Service not to prosecute anyone in connection with the funeral.\nHere is how the crisis unfolded.\nThe north Belfast man was considered the head of intelligence of the IRA for a period from the mid-1990s - being named as such under parliamentary privilege.\nSecurity sources linked him to several major incidents, including the \u00a326m Northern Bank robbery in 2004.\nMore recently, he was northern chairman of Sinn F\u00e9in.\nHe spent more than 20 years in jail, beginning with internment without trial when he was 17, a year after he joined the IRA in 1972.\nIn 1981, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison for possession of a rifle following an attack on the Army.\nHe was a close and lifelong ally of former Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams.\nWhen he was released from jail in 1994, Mr Storey was seen as a key individual in selling the peace process to republican hardliners.\nMr Storey's coffin was driven from his home in west Belfast for his funeral at St Agnes' Church on the Andersonstown Road.\nLarge numbers of people lined the route and the cortege was followed at a distance by a large number of mourners.\nAfter Requiem Mass, Mr Storey's remains were taken to Milltown Cemetery where speeches were made by senior republican figures including former Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams.\nHis body was then taken to Roselawn Cemetery in east Belfast, where it was cremated at about 15:30.\nMs O'Neill was part of the funeral cortege, which Sinn F\u00e9in said included no more than 30 people,\nCritics have suggested social distancing was not maintained in crowds that lined the streets as the hearse drove by or by large groups of people who walked behind the hearse at a greater distance.\nMs O'Neill also went to a Requiem Mass in St Agnes' Church in Andersonstown, which the BBC understands was attended by about 120 people.\nShe was also criticised for posing for a photograph at Milltown cemetery, where a man had his arm around her shoulders.\nShe subsequently said this incident took place \"in the blink of an eye\" and \"shouldn't have happened\".\nCritics were angry the deputy first minister, who appealed to the public during the pandemic to adhere to social distancing guidelines to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission, has now contravened the very rules she helped set.\nImmediately following the funeral, both the party and Ms O'Neill maintained they acted within the guidelines at all times and broke no rules.\nIn statements to the Irish News and Stormont's Executive Committee, she did not apologise for any of her actions, with the exception of the photograph. \nSinn F\u00e9in gave her its full backing, saying she would not stand down \"under any circumstances\".\nMs O'Neill later issued a statement expressing concern for families of those who had died in the pandemic whose grief would have been compounded by lockdown restrictions.\n\"Not being able to have their family and friends' support to help them through was hugely difficult,\" she said.\n\"I am also concerned that those grieving families are experiencing more hurt over recent days. I am sorry for that.\"\nShe reiterated that she had kept to the rules, adding: \"If the regulations had prevented me from attending his funeral I would have obeyed those regulations.\"\nHer party leader, Mary Lou McDonald, told RT\u00c9: \"I do understand that looking at the images of very busy pathways in west Belfast and taking all of that in obviously has jolted and has caused some hurt among some of those families, and for that I am very sorry.\n\"That certainly would never have been my intention, or Michelle's intention, or the intention of the Storey family as they laid Bobby to rest.\"\nIn September, Ms O'Neill acknowledged Stormont's public health messaging was \"undermined\" by the controversy.\nFollowing the announcement in March 2021 that nobody would be prosecuted in relation to the funeral, she apologised again \"for the hurt that has been caused to so many, including to Bobby Storey's own family who have been thrust into the headlines at a time of immense grief\".\nNorthern Ireland's system of government sees five parties share power in government together - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Sinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Alliance.\nImmediately following the funeral all the other parties called for Ms O'Neill to stand aside while investigations are carried out.\nThe Green Party and Traditional Unionist Voice, which are not part of the government, also called for Ms O'Neill to stand aside. \nFirst Minister Arlene Foster, leader of the DUP, said she could not stand beside Ms O'Neill to give out public health advice after what had happened.\nThe two women had been at the forefront of regular press conferences to update the people of Northern Ireland on the handling of the coronavirus crisis.\nThey did not give a joint press conference again until September, after Ms O'Neill admitted her actions had undermined the health messaging.\nThe Public Prosecution Service took a decision on 30 March not to prosecute anyone in relation to the funeral.\nDirector of Public Prosecutions Stephen Herron said he acknowledged the widespread public concern over attendance at the funeral.\nHe set out a number of reasons behind the decision not to prosecute.\nAmong these, he said was that a \"lack of clarity and coherence within the regulations and the prior engagement between organisers and the police\" would \"pose an insurmountable difficulty\" if prosecutions were brought.\nMrs Foster called for Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign as a result, saying his position was now \"untenable\".\nMr Byrne said he would not resign and added that no deals were done with the organisers of the funeral.\nLockdown regulations stated a maximum of 30 people were allowed to gather together outdoors.\nThe regulations, as they were in place on the day of the funeral, also stated that people can leave their homes to attend the funeral of a friend if no close family member or member of their household is attending.\nPeople were allowed to leave their home to \"visit a burial ground to pay respects to a member of your household or your family member of a friend\".\nA number of Mr Storey's family attended his funeral.\nThe regulations said if anyone had to leave their home they should maintain a distance of at least 1m from anyone outside their household.\nAn independent investigation was launched into Mr Storey's cremation at Roselawn Cemetery, which is run by Belfast City Council.\nIt had been claimed that some council staff were allowed to go home early, leaving republicans largely in control of what took place.\nThe report, published in February 2021, found Sinn F\u00e9in did not pressurise the council to give his family special treatment.\nIt also rejected suggestions there had been a \"takeover\" of Roselawn cemetery.\nIn addition, questions were also raised over why a large crowd gathered at Milltown Cemetery in west Belfast for speeches by Sinn F\u00e9in politicians when the cremation happened at Roselawn in east Belfast.\nMilltown Cemetery is a significant location for republicans, and contains the graves of a number of high-profile republicans, including Bobby Sands.\nLarge crowds are a common feature at funerals of high profile republicans.\nDuring the Troubles, tens of thousands of people turned out for the funerals of IRA members who had been killed.\nFunerals often feature common elements, such as a piper, while the coffin is draped in the Irish flag.\nAccording to political commentator Chris Donnelly, these types of funerals \"demonstrate a commitment to pursue the cause\" of Irish unification, as well as allowing mourners to grieve and pay their respects.\n\"So a funeral almost is an occasion to express gratitude, renew commitment and the passing of the torch all rolled up into one,\" he said."

      "tags": "European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "The UK is at a \"real risk\" of falling behind the EU when it comes to workers' rights, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) says.\nThe union body said the EU had \"various initiatives\" in the pipeline which would improve standards once they became law.\nBut it said the UK had no similar legislation on the way.\nThe government said in protecting workers' rights the UK already \"goes further than the EU in many areas\".\nThe TUC's call comes three months after a new post-Brexit trade deal came into force between the UK and EU.\nBoth sides have committed not to lower labour standards in a way that impacts trade or investment - but that does not mean they have to match each other. \nNonetheless, the TUC said the UK had already failed to implement directives it agreed to while still a member of the EU, including: \nIt said further initiatives were being considered by the EU that could improve conditions for \"platform workers\" and give employees the right to \"digitally disconnect\" outside working hours. \nThe bloc is also looking at ways to make employers accountable for the rights of workers in their supply chains.\nTUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said that \"as a bare minimum, the government must keep the pace with the EU on rights\".  \n\"Just three months after the UK-EU deal came into force, we're already at real risk of losing ground to the EU on workers' rights.\n\"Again and again, Boris Johnson promised that his government would protect and enhance workers' rights. It's high time the prime minister lived up to his word.\" \nA spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said the UK offered workers \"generous holiday pay and high standards for workplace safety\".\nBEIS cited as examples that the UK annual leave entitlement of 5.6 weeks compared favourably with the four weeks required in the EU. The UK allows parents to share paid parental leave, which the EU does not, BEIS said. It also said the UK had one of the highest minimum wage rates in Europe.\n\"We have a strong record of protecting and enhancing workers' rights and are committed to going further to make the UK the best place in the world to work,\" the spokesperson said. \nHowever, Ms O'Grady noted the government had promised to introduce a new employment bill to improve people's rights at work in 2019 but was yet to bring it before Parliament. \nShe said the bill could \"end exploitative work practices like zero-hours contracts, once and for all\". \nIn January, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng scrapped a planned review of workers' rights amid fears it would lead to an erosion of job protections, such as the 48-hour week, holiday entitlements and overtime pay.\nAt the time, Mr Kwarteng stressed the government had never intended to water down standards and if anything wanted to raise them.\nThe government said an employment bill designed to enhance workers' rights would be brought forward \"when parliamentary time allows\"."

      "text": "A critical meeting on climate change, organised by the UK, appears to be the latest victim of an ongoing row with China. \nMinisters from around 35 countries are due to participate in today's summit on climate and development.\nBut while the US, EU, India and others are taking part, China is notable by its absence. \nThe UK says that China was invited to the event but is not participating. \nRelations between the UK and China have deteriorated in recent weeks after angry exchanges about human rights. \nJust a few days ago China imposed sanctions on nine UK citizens - including five MPs- for spreading what it called \"lies and disinformation\" about the country.\nThe move came in retaliation for measures taken by the UK government and others over human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslim minority group.\nToday's climate and development summit is being described by the UK as a \"key moment\" in the run up to COP26 in Glasgow later this year. \nA list of invitees was published two weeks ago including China. But when the final list of participants was circulated, they were absent. \nA UK COP26 spokesman said China had been invited, adding: \"We look forward to working with them on climate change issues in this critical year ahead of COP26.\"\nWhen pressed on the reasons for the non-participation, no further comment was forthcoming.\nWith major emitters such as the US, EU and India taking part, it would be expected that China would play a leading role in this type of event. \nNot only is it the world's biggest carbon emitter but it also likes to portray itself as a key ally for developing countries. \n\"To have the ministerial taking place without China is far from ideal,\" said Richard Black, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. \n\"China is a major lender, trading partner and diplomatic presence across much of the developing world, and will of course be a hugely important power broker for COP26.\"\n \"As John Kerry recently said, the logical approach of western nations is to carve out a constructive place to engage with China on climate change amid the very real differences on other issues. However, it's not yet clear if Chinese leaders will be prepared to go along with this - and the UK, as COP26 hosts, has a very tricky diplomatic path to steer.\"\nHosted by COP26 President Alok Sharma and UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, today's meeting is seen as an important platform for the countries that are most vulnerable to rising temperatures. \nThe gathering will hear from ministers and representatives of international institutions and much of the focus will be on climate finance and debt relief. \nThe question is critical for vulnerable nations. \nMinisters from several threatened island states and poor countries will take part in the meeting, and they will likely make the point that while they contribute little to the causes of climate change they are already feeling the effects. \nA report published recently by African finance ministers indicated that some countries are now spending up to 10% of their GDP adapting to the impacts of rising temperatures.\nThe event is also facing criticism from environmental groups who are angry about the UK's decision late last year to cut overseas development assistance from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5%.\n\"Cuts to the overseas aid budget risk not only undermining the UK's reputation for progressive development action, but also the chances of the UK presidency delivering a successful outcome to COP26,\" said Andrew Norton from the International Institute for Environment and Development.\n\"The aid cuts undermine the UK's ability to ask other countries to step up, as well as reducing the resources available for climate action in poorer countries.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."

The government's advisory Climate Change Committee wants a levy on frequent fliers. \nThe Possible research suggests the frequent flyer trend is mirrored in other wealthy countries.\nAlethea Warrington, from Possible, said: \"This report shows the same pattern of inequality around the world - a small minority of frequent flyers take an unfair share of the flights.\n\"While the poorest communities are already suffering the impacts of a warming climate, the benefits of high-carbon lifestyles are enjoyed only by the few. A lot of people travel. But only the privileged few fly often.\"\nJohn Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, told BBC News: \"Taxing frequent fliers is a good idea - but we also have to do something about air miles, which reward frequent fliers for flying more frequently. This is obscene during a climate crisis - and it should be stopped.\" \nA UK Treasury spokesman told BBC News: \"We're leading the global fight on climate change and will use our hosting of COP26 (the Glasgow climate summit) later this year to galvanise global support for aviation decarbonisation.\n\"Frequent flyers already pay more under the current APD (Air Passenger Duty) system, but we are currently consulting on aviation tax reform and welcome views.\" \nHe said there were many drawbacks to a frequent flyer levy. These include that it would be complex to administer, could pose data processing and privacy concerns, could be difficult to impose where passengers hold multiple passports and could be a challenge for those who have an essential need to fly frequently. \nThe government's consultation on aviation tax reform closes on 14 June. \nThe spokesman did not comment on the proposal to make air miles programmes illegal. \nFollow Roger on Twitter."

The aim of vaccinating them - particularly older children - would be to keep schools open, reduce the spread of coronavirus in the community and protect vulnerable children with conditions which put them at increased risk.\nAstraZeneca announced trials of its vaccine in UK children aged six to 17 some time ago, and the first of 300 volunteers were due to be jabbed last month. The vaccine is currently only authorised for people aged 18 and over in the UK.\nAlongside trials in teenagers, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is authorised for use in those aged over 16, is also being tested in children under 12, with the aim of involving babies from just six months old. \nThe company started dosing the first healthy, young children in this trial last week.\nIn the Pfizer trial in 12- to 15-year-olds, 18 cases of Covid-19 were seen in the group given a dummy vaccine and none in group given the Covid vaccine which protects against it.\nAll participants received two doses 21 days apart, and the 18 cases were all children with symptoms. There were no tests for asymptomatic infection - children displaying no symptoms.\nThe figures are preliminary and full data has not been released, peer-reviewed or published in a journal.\nDr Peter English, former consultant in communicable disease control and past chair of the BMA public health medicine committee, said more detail was needed to properly evaluate the company's claims.\n\"It would be useful to know how effective the vaccine is at preventing asymptomatic infection. Young people are less likely to have severe disease; and when they are infected, they are more likely to have asymptomatic infection, allowing them to transmit the disease to others,\" he said.\nThe company's press release also doesn't mention the impact of variants on the trials, how cases were identified in children and whether a longer gap between doses was tested.\nAlbert Bourla, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer, said the company was \"encouraged\" by the clinical trial data.\n\"We plan to submit these data to FDA [US Federal Drugs Administration] as a proposed amendment to our Emergency Use Authorization in the coming weeks, and to other regulators around the world, with the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year.\"\nUgur Sahin, CEO and co-founder of BioNTech, said the initial results in adolescents suggested children \"are particularly well protected by vaccination\".\nHe added: \"It is very important to enable them to get back to everyday school life and to meet friends and family while protecting them and their loved ones.\"  \nModerna, the US company behind another Covid vaccine ordered by the UK, has also started testing its jab on children under 11."

      "text": "Celeste and Dua Lipa are among the main nominees for this year's Brit Awards, which take place in May.\nThe stars both have three nominations, as have newcomer Arlo Parks, dance producer Joel Corry and grime duo Young T & Bugsey.\nA year after the Brits were criticised for a lack of female nominees, four women are up for the best album prize - the highest-ever total.\nDua Lipa's pop odyssey Future Nostalgia is the one to beat in that category. \nHer record, which recently won best pop album at the Grammys, is up against Jessie Ware's What's Your Pleasure? and J Hus's Big Conspiracy.\nThe debut releases by Arlo Parks and Celeste round out the nominees. Last year the award went to Dave's bold and thought-provoking Psychodrama.\nUK rap also has a strong presence across the nominations with AJ Tracey, Headie One and J Hus scooping two nods each, and rising stars Young T & Bugsey building on the viral success of their single Don't Rush.\nThe 2021 winners will be announced at the Brit Awards ceremony on 11 May at London's O2 Arena. Comedian Jack Whitehall will present the show for the fourth time, while Dua Lipa and rising star Griff will perform. \nThe show was delayed from its usual date in February because of the pandemic. It is not yet known what format the ceremony will take.\nHere are six notable facts about this year's shortlist.\nFor the first time, artists didn't have to release an album to be eligible for the best male and female categories.\nThat helped Geordie Shore star turned dance producer Joel Corry pick up three nominations, thanks to his hit single Head & Heart which topped the charts last summer and is yet to leave the Top 40.\n\"If you'd told me a few years ago I'd be nominated for a Brit Award I'd have said you were mad. So to be nominated for three has blown my mind,\" said the musician.\nA more highly-publicised rule change allowed any artist who has been a permanent resident in the UK for more than five years to become eligible for nomination.\nThat opened the door for British-Japanese pop star Rina Sawayama, who had previously been told she was \"not British enough\" to enter the awards.\nShe ended up with a nomination in the rising star category and said she \"literally fell to the floor\" when the news broke.\nThe winner of that prize is announced in advance, however, with London singer-songwriter Griff taking the title.\nFor reasons best known to themselves, the Brits scrapped the best international group prize in 2020 - causing uproar amongst the BTS Army.\n\"The Brit Awards straight up robbed BTS,\" said a typical tweet. \n\"They kept best international male and female,\" noted another fan. \"Are they really that desperate to block out BTS?\"\nThis year the category has been reinstated and BTS - after becoming the best-selling act in the world in 2020 - must surely be among the favourites to win.\nHowever, there's stiff competition from acts like Haim and Fontaines DC who, while not having the Korean band's sales, are more favoured by critics.\nIt's bad news for Sam Smith, who walks away with no nominations for the second time in their career.\nThe singer, whose identifies as non-binary, did not enter the best male or female categories. Their third album Love Goes was eligible for the album of the year award but did not make the cut. \nOrganisers of the Brits had previously considered scrapping male and female-specific awards, but later told voters it would keep them for this year.\n\"Looking to the future we still have a lot of work to do in the coming years to evolve the Brits,\" it said in a statement. \n\"The process of change isn't something that can be fixed in just one campaign and we are committed to working together with the industry to evolve the show to be as inclusive and relevant as possible.\"\nSmith later wrote on Instagram: \"Music for me has always been about unification, not division. I look forward to a time where award shows can be reflective of the society we live in.\n\"Let's celebrate everybody regardless of gender, race, age, ability, sexuality and class.\"\nThe singer is not the only artist to miss out on a nomination this year. Kylie Minogue is absent from the shortlist, despite scoring a number one record with Disco last year. \nAnd Sir Paul McCartney failed to receive a nomination for his latest album McCartney III. It is now 38 years since the former Beatle has won a competitive Brit award.\nWith the nominations ceremony scrapped due to the pandemic, this year's nominees were all notified by post.\nAs you can see in the video above, Little Mix had a little trouble opening the envelope (gotta protect those nails) but they eventually discovered they'd made the best group shortlist for the third time in their career.\nLast year's Brit Awards were notable for the lack of female nominees. In the four categories where men and women could compete, only three women received a nomination: Mabel, Miley Cyrus and Norman (and the latter two were featured singers on singles by male artists).\n\"It's mis-representational of society,\" singer Paloma Faith told the BBC. \"Next year the Brits can do better,\" added Charli XCX.\nAnd so they have - although, awkwardly, neither Paloma nor Charli got a nod for their latest albums.\nNonetheless, and for the first time, four of the five records nominated for best album are by women - with Dua Lipa, Celeste, Arlo Parks and Jessie Ware in the running. \n\"It's a pleasure to be surrounded by these incredible women,\" said Ware, on learning of her nomination. \"It's a real treat.\"\nHowever, she didn't rate her chances of winning.\n\"This is my fourth time up for [a Brit] and I've always been the bridesmaid,\" she explained. \"And I feel like I'm going to be the bridesmaid again.\"\nMeanwhile, in the best international female category, the competition was so stiff that two of last year's most critically-acclaimed albums - Phoebe Bridgers' Punisher and Fiona Apple's Fetch The Bolt Cutters - were denied a nomination.\nPaul McCartney once said he knew the Beatles had become famous \"when I was lying in bed one morning, and I heard a milkman whistling From Me To You.\"\nThose days are over, even though milk deliveries actually increased in the pandemic. With a proliferation of radio stations, streaming services and other ways to access music, the idea of a universally recognisable hit is dwindling. \nOver the last 10 years, there have only been a handful of crossover songs. Pharrell's Happy, Mark Ronson's Uptown Funk and Adele's Someone Like You spring to mind.\nThe nominees for best British single reflect the fragmentation of music listening. Although the nominees are made of the 10 best-selling British singles of the last year, there are maybe three songs that will be recognisable to a large cross-section of the public: Dua Lipa's Physical, Joel Corry's Head & Heart and Harry Styles' Watermelon Sugar.\nThe rest are a combination of streaming hits and UK rap, most notably the sinuous and addictive Ain't It Different, which features the all-star cast of Headie One, AJ Tracey and Stormzy.\nBarely scraping onto the shortlist is Young T & Bugsey's Don't Rush, which holds the dubious distinction of being the first best single nominee since 1995 not to have made the Top 10.\nThat's not to say the scattershot nature of this year's field is a bad thing. Taken together, the nominees reflect the strength and diversity of our music scene... and UK rap is absolutely the defining sound of 21st Century Britain.\nBut a healthy scene also needs big hits to rally around. What else are we going to chant at the top of our voices when we're finally allowed back into concerts? \nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Policing,Sarah Everard murder,Clapham,Metropolitan Police Service",
      "text": "Critics of the police handling of a Sarah Everard vigil in south London spoke out \"without knowing the facts\", the Met Police chief has said. \nDame Cressida Dick told the BBC that remarks during a \"social media pile-on\" had damaged confidence in policing.\nThe force was criticised after women were handcuffed and removed from crowds on Clapham Common, but a report has said police acted \"appropriately\". \nThe Duchess of Cambridge's visit to the vigil was legal, Dame Cressida added.\nMs Everard was last seen walking home nearby on 3 March. Her body was found a week later in woodland near Ashford, Kent - prompting a public debate over women's safety \nSeveral hundred people gathered on Clapham Common on 13 March to pay tribute to the 33-year-old, despite Covid restrictions.\nDame Cressida said it was \"clearly possible\" under the law for those who lived locally to walk to the common and \"lay flowers legally\".\n\"You would have seen for six hours we did not enforce any laws, we showed some discretion and we allowed people to carry on,\" she said.\nBut the Met chief said she had warned City Hall and senior members of the government the event was likely to become an illegal mass gathering and could end with arrests.\n\"What I was saying consistently was this is likely to be illegal, if it is illegal and people do not disperse when they're asked to do so, we will use as much discretion as we can, we will encourage people, we will try to get them to disperse, but if they don't disperse we will end up arresting people,\" she said.\nAn official event had been planned by Reclaim These Streets - but the group called it off, saying police had failed to \"constructively engage\" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way.\nPeople turned up to Clapham Common despite the group asking them not to.\nReferring to the Duchess of Cambridge's visit to the vigil, the Met chief said she was \"in the course of her duties, she was working.\"\nShe added: \"At that point people had a whole series of potential reasonable excuses for being away from home, we didn't all have them.\n\"I've picked out one that may apply to her but, let's be clear, there was a very calm vigil to which she attended where lots of people came.\"\nWhen challenged on her previous remarks that she would have attended the vigil if it had been legal, Dame Cressida said: \"What we knew is that it was quite clear that what ever the organisers wanted to arrange, the numbers were going to be overwhelming, there was not an ability, in the long run, to be able to keep this socially distanced... Covid safe or strictly legal.\"\nThe duchess's visit was not listed in the daily list of royal engagements - the Court Circular - so it was not an official engagement. Palace sources at the time said it was a private visit, which can constitute a royal duty, but it would still usually be listed in the Court Circular.\nOn Tuesday, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) found that the force was \"justified\" in deciding that the risks of transmitting coronavirus \"were too great to ignore\" and officers \"did their best to peacefully disperse the crowd\".\nHowever, it added that \"there was insufficient communication between police commanders about changing events on the ground\". \nImages and footage from the vigil prompted widespread concern, but HMICFRS said calls for Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick to resign - including from Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey  - were \"unwarranted\".\nThe report added that \"the chorus of those condemning\" the force after the event showed \"a distinct lack of respect for public servants facing... a sensitive and complex situation\".\nA spokesman for the Lib Dems has said: \"We stand by our view that in the circumstances, the Met commissioner got the judgment on the vigil badly wrong.\"\nDame Cressida said: \"I think there are two things that come out of this report about the immediate aftermath.\n\"The first is that people in public life, people in responsible positions, should stop and think before they judge, whoever they may be.\"\nShe added: \"If they comment without knowing the facts, they may - and I would suggest on this occasion some people did - affect public confidence in their police service inappropriately.\n\"And, secondly, affect the officers' confidence about volunteering for the same duty in the next instance, if they are actually going to be criticised even when they've done a really good job.\"\nDame Cressida said the report suggested that if the force had been \"slightly more conciliatory\" in communications afterwards, \"then that might have helped with what I think is, in modern-day parlance, a kind of social media pile-on\".\nAn inquest into Ms Everard's death has been adjourned until the conclusion of criminal proceedings.\nPC Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with her murder and kidnap.\nHe has been remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on 9 July ahead of a trial that is set to start on 25 October."

      "text": "Guidance for people in England identified as being \"clinically extremely vulnerable\" is being updated from 19 July - but what is actually changing?\nFormal advice telling them to take extra care, or \"shield\", to avoid becoming seriously ill from Covid was paused at the start of April. \nMost coronavirus restrictions are being lifted in England on 19 July. The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else.\nHowever, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to \"think particularly carefully\" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including:\nThere is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAlthough Scotland moves to Covid protection level zero on 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said keeping the mandatory use of face coverings past then would give \"added protection and assurance\" to people who were particularly vulnerable.\nFrom 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace.\nHowever, companies still have legally binding health and safety responsibilities - and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. \nSome firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people.\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough) is available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. \nYou may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons.\nRead the updated government advice.\nAlthough the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it \"expects and recommends\" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport.\nYou should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. \nThe NHS Volunteer Responders programme is still available to offer support.\nData shows Covid vaccines are highly effective in most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection.\nBeing double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. \nYou should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not, book through the NHS website or call 119.\nThe most vulnerable people are likely to be offered booster jabs from September, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. \nYou are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions.\nThe pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The government recommends several support websites.\nIf you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on the NHS Shielded Patient List. \nA combination of factors can contribute to a person's risk, including: \nHigh risk categories include people: "

      "text": "German carmaker Volkswagen will not change its name to \"Voltswagen\" in the US despite earlier saying it would in a press release.\nThe name change was in fact an April Fool's joke that was leaked to the media several days early by mistake.\nIt was initially said to mark VW's shift to electric vehicles, and was backed by US boss Scott Keogh.\nThe carmaker will put out an official press release clearing up the matter on Wednesday.\nOn Tuesday, the carmaker went as far as changing its name on its US website and even launched a new Voltswagen Twitter handle. \nIt denied speculation it was just a prank, leading to numerous media outlets picking up the story, including BBC News. \nIn the press release, Mr Keogh said: \"We might be changing out our K for a T, but what we aren't changing is this brand's commitment to making best-in-class vehicles for drivers and people everywhere.\n\"This name change signifies a nod to our past as the peoples' car and our firm belief that our future is in being the peoples' electric car.\"\nSome had remained unconvinced, though.\nThe Volkswagen Group has long supported the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and aims to become carbon neutral by 2050. \nVW has also committed to sell one million electric vehicles worldwide by 2025.\nBut its environmental record was damaged by the diesel emissions scandal of 2015. The firm admitted to installing software that was capable of cheating emissions tests in 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide.\nAs a result it has faced huge fines and compensation claims in Europe and the US, and two VW employees have received jail terms in America."

      "tags": "Black Lives Matter,Racism",
      "text": "The UK \"no longer\" has a system rigged against people from ethnic minorities, a review set up by No 10 says.\nThe Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on how people's lives turned out.\nIt said children belonging to ethnic minorities did as well or better than white pupils, but overt racism remained, particularly online.\nThe Runnymede Trust think tank said it felt \"let down\" by the report.\nThe commission was set up after Black Lives Matter anti-racism protests across the country last summer - triggered by the killing of George Floyd in the US. \nThe main findings were: \nThe commission's report concluded that the UK is not yet a \"post-racial country\" - but its success in removing race-based disparity in education and, to a lesser extent, the economy, \"should be regarded as a model for other white-majority countries\".\nA foreword to the report by chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, said: \"We no longer see a Britain where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities.\"\nWhile the \"impediments and disparities do exist\", it continued, they were \"varied and ironically very few of them are directly to do with racism\".\nThe report added that evidence had found that factors such as geography, family influence, socio-economic background, culture and religion had \"more significant impact on life chances than the existence of racism\".\n\"That said, we take the reality of racism seriously and we do not deny that it is a real force in the UK.\"\nThe report also said there is an \"increasingly strident form of anti-racism thinking that seeks to explain all minority disadvantage through the prism of white discrimination\" which it said diverted attention from \"the other reasons for minority success and failure\".\nIn a statement issued after the report was published, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was \"right\" that ministers now consider its recommendations in detail and assess \"the implications for future government policy\". \nHe added: \"The entirety of government remains fully committed to building a fairer Britain and taking the action needed to address disparities wherever they exist.\"\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Sewell said while there was anecdotal evidence of racism, there was no proof that there was \"institutional racism\" in Britain.\n\"No-one denies and no-one is saying racism doesn't exist\", he said.\n\"We found anecdotal evidence of this. However, evidence of actual institutional racism? No, that wasn't there, we didn't find that.\"\nDr Sewell added that the term \"institutional racism\" is \"sometimes wrongly applied\" as a \"sort of a catch-all phrase for micro-aggressions or acts of racial abuse\".\nProf Kehinde Andrews, a professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University, said the report was not a \"genuine effort to understand racism in Britain\".\nProf Andrews said: \"It's complete nonsense. It goes in the face of all the actual existing evidence. This is not a genuine effort to understand racism in Britain. This is a PR move to pretend the problem doesn't exist.\"\nBaroness Kishwer Falkner, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: \"This report rightly identifies the varied causes of disparities and by making recommendations to address them gives the government the opportunity to design policy targeting the sources of inequality. \n\"There are a number of recommendations we can play a leading role in and we welcome the recognition that additional funding would help us carry out our important work to tackle discrimination and disadvantage.\"\nDr Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank, said she felt \"deeply, massively let down\" by the report, and that the government did not have the confidence of black and minority ethnic communities.\nAsked for her view on the commission's suggestion that the UK is not institutionally racist, she said: \"Tell that to the black young mother who is four times more likely to die in childbirth than her young white neighbour, tell that to the 60% of NHS doctors and nurses who died from Covid and were black and ethnic minority workers.\n\"You can't tell them that, because they are dead.\n\"Institutionally, we are still racist, and for a government-appointed commission to look into (institutional) racism, to deny its existence is deeply, deeply worrying.\"\nShe added: \"We feel that if the best this government can do is come up with a style guide on BAME terminology, or what we should do about unconscious bias training, or extend a few school hours, then I'm afraid this government doesn't carry the confidence of black and ethnic minority communities any longer, certainly not on race.\"\nDr Begum also claimed the report had failed to acknowledge the \"suffering\" of black and ethnic minority communities, adding: \"All this is is a whitewash and a script that has been written to 10 Downing Street.\"\nShe also questioned the suitability of Dr Sewell and head of the Number 10 policy unit Munira Mirza, who had a role in setting the commission up - both of whom have questioned the existence of institutional racism previously. \nThe 258-page report makes 24 recommendations which include: \nFrances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said the commission had \"chosen to deny the experiences of black and minority ethnic workers\" who were \"far more likely\" than white workers to be in \"low-paid, insecure jobs\".\nShe added they have been \"far more likely to be exposed to Covid infection and far more likely to die - because they are far more likely to be in frontline roles.\n\"This is institutional racism. And it traps too many black and minority ethnic workers in poverty, insecurity and low pay.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he felt \"disappointed\" with what he had seen of the report's findings so far, insisting there were \"structural\" issues that needed to be addressed.\nSpeaking on a visit to Leeds, he told reporters that whilst there was \"an acknowledgement of the problems, the issues, the challenges that face many black and minority ethnic communities\" there was also \"a reluctance to accept that that's structural\".\nThe report had been due to be published last year but was pushed back until 2021, with the commission blaming Covid restrictions and the large number of responses from the public for the delay. \nHave you been affected by the issues covered in this report?

      "text": "The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City star Jennifer Shah has been charged over fraud allegations involving \"hundreds of victims\".\nThe TV star, 47, and her assistant Stuart Smith, 43, have been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York said.\nThey were arrested and appeared in Salt Lake City federal court on Tuesday.\nIt's alleged they have been running a US-wide fraud scheme since 2012.\nAccording to prosecutors, Ms Shah and Mr Smith sold services - such as website design - which claimed to make the management of victims' businesses more efficient or profitable. \nThey're also alleged to have offered to sell the personal information of potential victims to other members of the \"fraud ring\".\nManhattan US Attorney Audrey Strauss said Ms Shah portrays herself \"as a wealthy and successful businessperson on reality television\". \n\"In actual reality and as alleged, the so-called business opportunities pushed on the victims by Shah, Smith, and their co-conspirators were just fraudulent schemes, motivated by greed, to steal victims' money,\" she said.\nMany of the alleged victims are over the age of 55.\nThe charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with telemarketing carries a maximum sentence of 30 years. Conspiracy to commit money laundering carries a maximum sentence of 20 years.\nJennifer Shah is part of the main cast of the show, which airs on Bravo. The first season ended in February and the show has been renewed for a second season.\nNewsbeat has contacted the show and Ms Shah's representatives for comment, but they are yet to respond. Bravo said it would not comment on the allegations.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here. "

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."
