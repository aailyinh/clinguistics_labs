      "text": "The risk of \"long Covid\" in children is much lower than many had feared, leading child health experts have said.\nAfter the world's biggest study into the issue, the researchers, led by University College London, said they were \"reassured\".\nThey surveyed 11- to 17-year-olds testing positive for coronavirus in England between September and March.\nThe research suggests somewhere between 2% and 14% still had symptoms caused by Covid 15 weeks later.\nThe team said it was important those with persistent symptoms, which included headaches, tiredness and breathing difficulties, received support.\nBut there was little evidence huge numbers had sought NHS help for symptoms that had left them bedridden or unable to attend school.\nThe study, which has yet to be published in a medical journal, also gathered data from young people who had never tested positive, meaning more than 50,000 were surveyed in total.\nAnd 53% of them had at least one symptom after 15 weeks, simply because they are common in the general population.\nAmong those who had tested positive, this proportion was 65%.\nA more significant difference was seen among those 30% had three or more symptoms, compared with 16% of those who had never tested positive, suggesting 32,000 out of nearly 235,000 who were infected between September and March have developed long Covid.\nBut the numbers could be even lower. \nOnly 13% of those asked to respond to the survey did so. \nResearchers believe those who are suffering ongoing symptoms would be more likely to complete the survey than those who are not.\nIf all those with long Covid were to do so among those who did so, that would suggest their actual number was just 4,000 or fewer than 2%.\nThe research team - including Prof Sir Terence Stephenson, from UCL's Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health infectious disease lead Dr Liz Whittaker, and Public Health England officials - will continue to follow the children in the coming months.\nBut Sir Terence said he was already \"reassured\" suggestions, at the height of the pandemic, that half of children could develop long Covid cases were wrong.\n\"It is nowhere near what people thought in the worst-case scenario\".\nAlthough, he said, the numbers were still \"not trivial\" and the issue needed to be taken seriously.\nMost likely to report persistent symptoms were older girls who already had poorer physical and mental health.\nThose struggling emotionally and mentally could be more attuned to even minor physical illnesses, the researchers said, and a positive coronavirus test could help trigger that.\nOf all the children in the study, 40% reported feeling sad, worried or unhappy.\nAnd the researchers said it was clear the pandemic had had a damaging effect on young people because of:\nThis showed how important it was to get \"back to normal\" and have schools open, Dr Whittaker added."

      "text": "A branch of McDonald's in Oregon, US, is calling on 14 and 15 year olds to apply for jobs at the restaurant amid a shortage of fast food workers.\nThe Biddle Road franchise in Medford put a banner outside its shop two weeks ago, urging younger workers to apply. \nAccording to reports, it has seen a spike in applications since making the offer, which complies with labour laws. \nIt comes as fast food and other outlets across the US struggle to fill vacancies despite restrictions easing. \nHeather Kennedy, operator of the Medford restaurant, told Business Insider such staff shortages were \"unheard of\" in her family's 40-year history operating McDonald's franchises.\nInitially she tried to attract more workers by raising the restaurant's minimum wage to $15 (\u00a310.50), but did not spark enough interest. \nHowever, Ms Kennedy said she had received more than 25 new applications since she opened her doors to under 16s.\nMcDonald's declined to comment on the move but told the BBC franchisees were using a range of measures to tackle staff shortages including better pay, sign-on bonuses, and new benefits like backup childcare. \nMcDonald's also recently announced it will raise hourly wages to an average of $15 per hour at company-owned restaurants across the US.\nIt is not the first fast food chain to ask younger workers to fill staffing gaps.\nBranches of Burger King and Wendy's have put up similar signs recently. And according to reports, the Texan chain Layne's Chicken Fingers is promoting workers in their teens and early 20s into managerial positions, amid a lack of more experienced recruits. \nUS labour laws vary from state to state, but in Oregon, people aged 14 and above are allowed to work in non-hazardous jobs such as food service, as long as their hours are limited to accommodate schooling and they get adequate rest breaks. \nHowever, it seems to be rare - the average age of an employed McDonald's worker in the US is 27, according to research from jobs website Zippia.\nThere is currently a sharp labour shortage in the US as fear of Covid, schools remaining shut, and a lack of available child-care keeps workers at home. \nSome economists have also blamed generous federal benefits brought in during the pandemic - which provide an extra $300 every week - although these have already expired in many states. \nVacancies for lower skilled, lower paid jobs have been particularly hard to fill, prompting firms such as Walmart and Amazon to offer retention bonuses and higher starting wages.

      "text": "Young people strapped for space at home have helped to drive a \"rapid recovery\" in membership numbers at Gym Group.\nThe gym operator said membership had jumped by a third since February as its sites reopened.\nOver two-thirds of its members are under the age of 34, and the company said many younger people lacked space to do home workouts.\nThe chain, which operates 190 sites, aims to open 40 new gyms by the end of 2022 by converting former shops.\n\"The physical gym will always be really important for people and I think that's coming through in our numbers,\" chief executive Richard Darwin told the BBC's Today programme.\nWhile many people worked out at home during lockdown, Mr Darwin said that many younger people \"just don't have the space...  to be able to do home workouts\".\nGym Group is a low-cost gym operator, where customers do not have to have an annual contract.\nIt said membership numbers had hit 730,000 by the end of June this year, compared with 547,000 at the end of February 2021 - during the lockdown. This compares with a peak membership of 891,000 in February 2020 before the first coronavirus lockdown measures were introduced. \nGyms only reopened in England on 12 April this year, and later in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nGym Group reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a328.5m for the six months to the end of June whiles sales tumbled by 21.4% to \u00a329.3m.\nHowever, despite the losses, the company is looking to expand.\nIt said it planned to repurpose vacant retail spaces on the High Street, which has seen the closures of chains such as Debenhams and Topshop accelerate during Covid. \nGym Group has already opened seven new sites this year and plans to open an additional 40 by the end of 2022.\n\"We're seeing a lot of properties become available, particularly in retail parks which are very good for gyms as they have accessible parking and clear signage,\" Mr Darwin said.  \nHowever, Dan Lane, senior analyst at investment platform Freetrade, said Gym Group's site rollout needed to be done \"efficiently\" and not end up \"diluting overall profits just for the sake of willing itself back to normality\".\n\"Rushing to snap up more properties while the current ones aren't at capacity and fewer of us are back in the office is a sign of how much the group needs footfall,\" he said. \n\"If we aren't going or coming from work, will we be bothered to leave our homes (many of which are now in the country, after the London exodus) to get to the gym?\"\nBut with lockdown restrictions now lifted there have been signs that people are exercising less at home. \nRival gym chain PureGym has also seen a pick up in customers, whereas home fitness bike firm Peloton recently reported losses.."

      "text": "You've probably heard of Poohsticks, now here come the Pooh coins.\nForget the stick game made up by Winnie-the-Pooh for a minute (although it is a classic) because the Royal Mint has marked the famous bear's 95th birthday with collectable coins.\nMint designers have said the nine commemorative coins are inspired by E H Shepard's original drawings in A A Milne's classic children's book.\nThe Winnie-the-Pooh and Friends set will be released later this year.\nPooh is well-known for words of wisdom and the Hundred Acre Wood's most famous resident once said \"sometimes the smallest things take up the most room in your heart\".\nBut the coins which will bear images of Pooh and friends will take up most room in your moneybox as they will be 50p pieces - available in gold, silver and a special-edition colour.\nThe bear first appeared in print in 1926 and follows Peter Rabbit, Harry Potter, Paddington Bear and Alice in Wonderland in being immortalised on UK currency.\nThe Royal Mint unveiled its latest coin collection on Thursday and one of the pieces features a group shot of Pooh, Piglet, Owl, Eeyore, Rabbit, Tigger, Kanga and Roo.\nThe coins feature an original watercolour effect and were created at The Royal Mint's south Wales headquarters by designer Daniel Thorne who said he wanted to \"stay true to the iconic E H Shepard decorations\".\n\"Using inspiration from the original decorations of E H Shepard has been a fantastic experience but one that has also tested me,\" he said.\n\"With each design, so much care and attention has been given to remastering the iconic decorations for the canvas of a coin while staying true to the texts people know and love.\n\"I also wanted to add something extra special for collectors, with the bee motif.\n\"Inspired by the original decorations, the buzzy bee from the storybooks features on each of the nine coins in the collection. I hope collectors can appreciate the beauty in each design in the range and enjoy the special colour editions.\" \nPooh and friends, now part of the Disney brand, have been family favourites for almost 100 years and the Royal Mint, based in Llantristant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said its design was a \"fitting tribute to the much-loved adventures\".\n\"Winnie-the-Pooh is a treasured children's classic which, much like the popular hobby of coin collecting, has been passed down through generations,\" said Clare Maclennan, of the Royal Mint's commemorative coin division.\n\"As we celebrate 95 years of Winnie-the-Pooh, the latest design featuring Pooh and friends is a fitting tribute to the much-loved adventures.\n\"Fans of Winnie-the-Pooh can enjoy the coins individually, or as part of the nine-coin collection released over three years. We are buzzing with excitement to bring these wonderful characters and memories to life on a collectable 50p coin series.\""

      "tags": "Kabul,War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Since they took control of Afghanistan just over two weeks ago, the Taliban have sought to portray a more moderate image than when they last seized power in 1996.\nThey have repeatedly said they will grant amnesty to all, including those who worked for western militaries or the Afghan government or police. In a dramatic press conference after the group swept into Kabul, chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid made a declaration of forgiveness. \nBut there is growing evidence that the reality on ground is different to the rhetoric coming from Taliban leaders and spokesmen. It was not lost on some watching the press conference in Kabul that Mr Mujahid made his declaration from the seat of the former government spokesman Dawa Khan Menapal, who had been killed by the group just weeks earlier, as \"punishment for his deeds\".\nNow sources inside Afghanistan, as well as some who recently fled, have told the BBC that Taliban fighters are searching for, and allegedly killing, people they pledged they would leave in peace.\nSeveral sources confirmed that Taliban fighters last week executed two senior police officials - Haji Mullah Achakzai, the security director of Badghis province, and Ghulam Sakhi Akbari, security director of Farah province. Video footage showed Mr Achakzai was kneeling, blindfolded, with his hands tied behind his back before he was shot.\nThose who managed to flee say they fear for their colleagues back home. Zala Zazai, a former Afghan policewoman, one of thousands trained since the Taliban was deposed in 2001, said she was still in touch with other former policewomen. \n\"The Taliban call them from their office phones and ask them to come to work, and ask for their home address,\" she said.  \nMs Zazai said that even in Tajikistan she was not totally out of the reach of the Taliban. Her mother, who is with her, received messages urging both women to return to Afghanistan and \"live in the Islamic way\", she said. \nA former Afghan soldier who fled from Badakhshan province along with his three brothers, all of whom were in the army, said Taliban fighters were harassing his family, \"asking them for money saying your son was in the special forces\".\nAnd a former Afghan special forces soldier still inside the country told the BBC that he and his family were in hiding after former colleagues were killed. \n\"Since the Taliban have come to power they haven't stopped killing,\" he said. \"A few days ago, they killed twelve members of the special forces in Kandahar and three soldiers in Jalalabad as well. They were my close friends. I was in touch with them. The Taliban took them out of their homes and shot them.\"\nThe BBC was not able to independently confirm the killings, and the Taliban have repeatedly denied committing any revenge killings. But the group was widely thought to be behind a spate of assassinations after signing a peace deal with the US in 2020, and there are mounting reports they have been searching for targets since taking power two weeks ago.\nAmnesty International reported earlier this month that Taliban fighters massacred nine ethnic Hazara men after taking control of Afghanistan's Ghazni province in July. And Human Rights Watch reported that Taliban fighters were conducting searches in Kandahar province as they swept the country and detaining anyone suspected of working with the government, reportedly killing some detainees. \nA high-ranking Afghan police official, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, told the BBC from hiding that he'd heard the Taliban were searching for him. \n\"They caught my assistant and interrogated him for five hours,\" the official said. \"They treated him very badly. They asked him, 'Where is your chief?' If they are forgiving everyone then why are they hunting for me?\"\nHe said he was changing location every day with his wife and children. \"I have no money to cross the border,\" he said, breaking down as he spoke. \"The problem is the Taliban have no justice system. They have no courts, no jail. They are just killing.\"\nIt is not just people who worked in the security forces who say they are being targeted. Members of the civil administration, and those who worked in jobs disapproved by the Taliban told similar stories. \n\"The Taliban took my car, beat up my guards and took their weapons,\" said Zarifa Ghafari, who was Afghanistan's first female mayor, governing Maidan Shar, the capital of Wardak province. \n\"They were searching for me. They called all the people who used to be in contact with me asking where I was. They even went to my husband's parents' house to look for me,\" she said. \nMs Ghafari was speaking via a video call from Germany, where she fled after the Taliban took power. \n\"They made me do something I never wanted to do,\" she said. \"They made me leave a country that I love.\"\nNilofar Ayoubi was also among those who managed to flee in time. A few weeks ago, she was busy working with her staff at her high-end fashion and accessories store in Kabul. When Taliban fighters walked into the city, they began stripping everything.\n\"We removed the mannequins from the windows, covered the windows, locked the door and ran,\" Ms Ayoubi said. \"I paid my staff a month's salary, then I went off home, packed two bags with my documents and a few things for my children and went into hiding,' she said. \nMs Ayoubi applied for asylum to Poland and, after pushing through the scrum at Kabul airport, managed to escape with her husband and children.\n\"As soon as I landed I saw multiple calls from my family,\" she said. \"They were so scared. They said the Taliban had come to our home, pointed guns at them and warned them that if you don't call your daughter and son-in-law back, we will kill you.\"\nAs the Taliban settles into power, part of the concern is that even if all their promises of clemency are true, the group's factions are not all necessarily in agreement, and not necessarily under control. Many in Afghanistan doubt that the Taliban leadership plans to honour its own amnesty. They doubt the group is a new moderate version of its old self. If violent acts of intimidation and reprisal go unaccounted for, and unpunished by the leadership, it will become clear that the Taliban of the present is no less ruthless than the Taliban of the past.\nAdditional reporting by Aakriti Thapar and Imogen Anderson"

      "text": "US President Joe Biden says \"historic investment\" is needed to deal with the climate crisis, as the north-east reels from flash flooding and tornadoes that have killed at least 45 people.\nThe US is facing climate-related destruction across the country and tackling it is \"a matter of life and death\", the president said.\nNew York City and New Jersey saw unprecedented levels of rainfall.\nSome residents became trapped in flooded basements and cars.\nSix states suffered loss of life:\nPresident Biden has declared an emergency in both New Jersey and New York, enabling both states to receive federal funding to support local disaster relief efforts.\nThe impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but we know that increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall. \nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio criticised weather experts, saying their forecasts were being \"made a mockery of in a matter of minutes\". He said he had been warned to expect between three and six inches (7.5 and 15cm) of rain over the course of the day. However a record 3.15 inches fell in Central Park in just one hour.\n\"The suddenness, the brutality of storms now, it is different,\" he said, adding that the latest extreme weather was \"the biggest wake-up call\".\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul said: \"We did not know that between 8:50 and 9:50 p.m. last night, that the heavens would literally open up and bring Niagara Falls level of water to the streets of New York.\" \nResidents have been assessing the damage to property. \nOne man in Flushing, New York, said his house was prone to flooding \"but what I saw last night is unimaginable\". \"I have never seen water coming in all directions,\" Tedla Asfaw, 60, told the BBC. \"There's huge damage here. It's a big hit for us.\"\nIn New Jersey, a tornado flattened the state's largest dairy farm, ripping roofs off buildings and toppling several large silos.\nMany cows were trapped under fallen sheds and some died, the owners of Wellacrest Farm wrote on their Facebook page. \"Along with the devastating loss of homes in our neighbourhoods - we, as a community, suffered a great loss with the destruction of our farm.\"\nIn New York, some 835 people had to be rescued from stranded subway trains, police said on Thursday, after social media pictures showed water gushing into underground stations and tunnels.\nOther footage showed cars floating down flooded roads, with cries of \"help\" being heard from inside. Nearly 500 vehicles were abandoned in New York, the Associated Press says.\nPassengers on trains, planes and buses have been describing finding themselves stuck for hours without moving as the flooding made travelling impossible.\nPresident Biden said the unprecedented flooding in the region, along with the destruction brought by Hurricane Ida to Louisiana and Mississippi and wildfires in the West, were \"yet another reminder that these extreme storms in the climate crisis are here\".\nHe said he would be pushing Congress for action on his Build Back Better plan, which would see \"historic investment\" in infrastructure, including modernising roads and bridges and improving energy grids, water and sewage systems.\n\"This destruction is everywhere,\" he said. \"It's a matter of life and death and we are all in this together. This is one of the great challenges of our time but I'm confident we will meet it.\nThe president will visit Louisiana on Friday to assess what is being done to help the state, which became the first to face Hurricane Ida when it made landfall on Sunday.

      "text": "People who do not turn up to reservations they have made at pubs and restaurants are costing the hospitality sector \u00a317.6bn a year, a report says.\nData from hospitality technology firm Zonal said one in seven customers have not turned up for a reservation without telling the venue since April.\nIt said 18-34-year-olds were the \"worst offenders\" for no-shows, with more than a quarter not honouring bookings.\nIndustry group UK Hospitality said no-shows were \"deeply damaging to venues\".\nJacob Georgallis, general manager at Toast Bar in Leeds, said punters not turning up and not cancelling bookings had \"massively\" affected the business during times when some coronavirus restrictions remained.\n\"We'd be fully booked but then no-shows would happen and you've turned away three or four groups who could have taken the space,\" he said.\n\"It was a really gutting feeling for us, and a nightmare for staffing and forecasting.\"\nDuring Euro 2020, the bar took pre-orders on food and drinks and did not experience any no-shows, apart from customers unable to attend due to Covid-related reasons.\nMr Georgallis said he hoped there was a \"big push\" towards solving the problem and \"finding ways to take money up front\".\nThe research, conducted by Zonal and consultancy firm CGA, surveyed 5,000 people nationwide.\nAlthough younger people were found to be the most likely out of the sample to fail to turn up to bookings, compared to just 1% of those aged 55 and over, younger adults were more frequent bookers and ate out more often.\nIn its report, researchers said Londoners were found to be the worst no-show offenders in the UK, with 24% of consumers in the capital admitting to not notifying a venue that they weren't planning to turn up. \nThe figure was higher than the national average of 14%. The report said customers in Scotland, the South West and the South East were most likely to honour their reservations, with just 10% failing to show up.\nUK Hospitality said the \u00a317.6bn loss from no-shows equated to 13.3% of the sector's \u00a3132bn in pre-pandemic revenue.\nSource: Zonal and CGA's Technology survey\nVicky Liner, marketing director at West Midlands-based Suburban Inns, said no-shows had \"calmed down a little bit\" after the venue started asking patrons to hand over card details and put down deposits when making a booking. \n\"Taking deposits wasn't something we really wanted to do, but we've had to - and they're no bad thing if they help to change the culture,\" she said.\n\"We still want spontaneity in hospitality and give people the option to just walk in.\"\nIn response to the survey findings, Zonal and UK Hospitality have launched a campaign aimed at encouraging people to honour the bookings they make, or at least inform venues if they have to cancel a booking. \nUK Hospitality's chief executive Kate Nicholls said no-shows had been a blight on the industry for \"many, many years\". Added to the difficulties businesses were experiencing due to the pandemic, they were \"currently deeply damaging.\"\n\"Our pubs, bars and restaurants deserve our support and it's encouraging that this research shows there is a growing realisation among customers of the need to honour their booking or let the venue know they can't make it,\" she said.\n\"But it also highlights the fact that no shows still happen far too often, with younger customers particularly responsible, and that really can't go on.\""

      "text": "The former Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, has been defending the UK's handling of the evacuation from Afghanistan after the Taliban took control of Kabul in August. \nIt follows claims from a whistleblower, Raphael Marshall - who worked at the Foreign Office at the time - that the government's response to the crisis was chaotic and dysfunctional. \nMr Raab said 15,000 people were evacuated by the UK from Afghanistan from 15 August to the end of that month.\nHe said it was a larger number than by any other nation except the US.\nAt the time, the government said the 15,000 people included 5,000 British nationals, 8,000 Afghans and 2,000 children.\nSome Afghan nationals had already arrived in the UK for resettlement before that date.\nThe Foreign Office told us that since the end of August, a further 3,000 people had been helped to leave Afghanistan. This included more than 1,100 UK nationals.\nIn written evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Marshall said he estimated that between 75,000 and 150,000 people in Afghanistan had applied for evacuation to the UK in August. \nHe estimated that 5% of these received assistance. \nThe US evacuated the largest number of people from Afghanistan in August. \nFrom 14 August to 28 August, it got 113,500 people out of the country.\nOther countries evacuated much smaller numbers over that period, according to official statements and press releases\nSince the end of August, some countries have continued to carry out occasional evacuations. France evacuated 258 people just last week.\nIn August, Mr Raab said that the number of British nationals remaining in Afghanistan was \"in the low hundreds, \" although he would not give a more precise figure.\nMr Raab told a committee of MPs that nearly all the people in Afghanistan with single UK nationality and accompanying documentation had been brought back - but it had proved harder to estimate the number of dual-nationality Britons remaining in Afghanistan.  \nThe example he provided was that some large families may have one or more people that were documented, but it was unclear what the status of the rest of the family was.\nOn 7 December, the Prime Minister's special representative for Afghanistan, Nigel Casey, told MPs there were about 200 British nationals still in Afghanistan.\nThe UK government has a scheme to resettle Afghans - the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), which was launched on 1 April. \nUnder the scheme, Afghans who worked for the British military and UK government (for example, as interpreters) are able to move to the UK permanently, rather than getting five years' residency as was previously offered.\nThe Home Office says there have been 7,000 people relocated under the ARAP scheme since its launch.\nBefore the ARAP scheme, the Home Office says 1,400 former staff and families were relocated since 2013 under a previous scheme called the Ex-Gratia Policy.\nIn addition to ARAP, the government has said the Afghan Citizens' Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) will allow a total of 20,000 to settle in the UK.\nIt will focus on women and children as well as religious and other minorities in danger from the Taliban.\nA fact-sheet released about it in September said it would welcome 5,000 Afghans in the first year, although the scheme is yet to open. \nImmigration lawyer Sarah Pinder said resettlement schemes are often too slow for crises such as the one in Afghanistan.\n\"The idea that people can queue up to make an application by staying put... in reality, it's difficult to put into practice,\" she said.\nAnd she said the schemes' criteria were often narrow, leaving people \"stuck in a loop\" between different ones. \nOutside a small number of official resettlement schemes, the main way to settle in the UK is to seek asylum once within the country's borders.\nIn 2020, 1,336 people from Afghanistan applied for asylum, out of 29,456 total applications from around the world, and 580 were granted it. But not all of those granted asylum had applied in the same year.\nThey were much larger numbers of Afghans applying for asylum last year in some EU countries, such as Greece, France and Germany.\nThis year up until September, there were 1,974 asylum applications in the UK from Afghan nationals - an increase of almost 40% over the previous year.\nWhat claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

A spokesperson said: \"The searches are ongoing and we expect them to continue for a number of days\".\nIn addition to water-based searches, specialist officers have been seen combing through a large area of woodland that surrounds both lakes.\nLead investigator Det Supt Wayne Fox has said members of the public have provided new information and lines of inquiry since the searches began.\nNorth Yorkshire Police has not revealed what led officers to the location, but has said the search was one of \"several active lines of inquiry\" being followed in the case.\nThe force said searches at Sand Hutton could last for some time.\nUniversity chef Ms Lawrence's disappearance sparked one of the longest-running and highest-profile missing person cases in the UK.\nShe was last seen at 15.05 GMT on Wednesday 18 March 2009 walking towards her home on Heworth Road, York.\nThat evening she spoke to both of her parents in separate phone calls, but failed to arrive for her shift at Goodricke College the following day.\nHer father reported her missing on 20 March. A friend of Ms Lawrence's had called him after she did not turn up at a local pub on the evening of the 19 March.\nA number of people have been questioned in connection with her disappearance, but no charges have ever been brought.\nThe land at Sand Hutton is owned by the Church Commissioners for England, which said it would \"continue to support North Yorkshire Police with their requirements and apologise for any disruption caused\".\nThe York and District Amalgamation of Anglers, whose members use the lakes for fishing, said the area remained cordoned off by police.\nIn a statement, the trustees said they were aware of the ongoing investigation and were \"thoroughly co-operating with all organisations involved\".\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Being fully vaccinated against Covid-19 not only cuts the risk of catching it, but also of an infection turning into long Covid, research led by King's College London suggests.\nIt shows that in the minority of people who get Covid despite two jabs, the odds of developing symptoms lasting longer than four weeks are cut by 50%.\nThis is compared with people who are not vaccinated.\nSo far, 78.9% of over-16s in the UK have had two doses of a Covid vaccine. \nMany people who get Covid recover within four weeks but some have symptoms that continue or develop for weeks and months after the initial infection - sometimes known as long Covid. It can happen after people experience even mild coronavirus symptoms. \nThe researchers, whose work was published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, say it is clear that vaccinations are saving lives and preventing serious illness, but the impact of vaccines on developing long-lasting illness has been less certain.\nThey analysed data gathered from the UK Zoe Covid Study app, which tracks people's self-reported symptoms and vaccines and tests.\nThat meant that between December 2020 and July, the health was tracked of more than 1.2 million adults who received one coronavirus jab and 971,504 who received two jabs in that time frame. \nResearchers found some people were more at risk of so-called breakthrough infections (getting Covid after a vaccine) than others - including frail, older adults and people living in deprived areas. This was particularly the case for people who had only had one jab. \nLead researcher Dr Claire Steves said people at increased risk needed to be prioritised for booster jabs. \nShe added: \"In terms of the burden of long Covid, it is good news that our research has found that having a double vaccination significantly reduces the risk of both catching the virus and if you do, developing long-standing symptoms.\" \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said vaccines had saved more than 105,000 lives and prevented more than 24 million infections in England alone. \nHe said: \"It is clear vaccines are building a wall of defence against the virus and are the best way to protect people from serious illness. I encourage everyone who is eligible to come forward for both their jabs as quickly as possible.\""

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban,United States",
      "text": "The top US general has described the Taliban as a \"ruthless group\" and says it is unclear whether they will change.\nGen Mark Milley said, however, it was \"possible\" that the US would co-ordinate with the Islamist militants on future counter-terrorism operations.\nUS forces withdrew from Afghanistan on Tuesday, ending America's longest war 20 years after launching an invasion to oust the Taliban.\nThe Islamists are now in control and expected to announce a new government.\nGen Milley was speaking alongside US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, in their first public remarks since the last troops left Afghanistan.\nUS President Joe Biden has been widely criticised over the abrupt manner of the withdrawal, which led to the unexpected collapse of the Afghan security forces the US had trained and funded for years.\nThe Taliban's lightning advance sparked off a frenetic effort to evacuate thousands of foreign nationals and local Afghans who had been working for them. \nIn the news conference on Wednesday, both Gen Milley and Secretary Austin praised the troops who had served in Afghanistan and the massive evacuation mission.\nAsked about their co-ordination with the Taliban in getting evacuees to the airport, Mr Austin said: \"We were working with the Taliban on a very narrow set of issues, and that was just that - to get as many people out as we possibly could.\"\n\"In war you do what you must in order to reduce risk to mission and force, not what you necessarily want to do,\" Gen Milley added.\nHe said it was possible that the US would co-ordinate with the Taliban on future action against Islamic State affiliate IS-K, the group which claimed an attack outside Kabul airport last week that killed as many as 170 people, including 13 US service personnel. \nIS-K is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan. It has major differences with the Taliban, accusing them of abandoning jihad and the battlefield.\nMr Austin, meanwhile, said he would \"not want to make any predictions\" on future co-operation. But he added that officials would \"do everything that we can to make sure we remain focused on [IS-K], understand that network, and at the time of our choosing in the future, hold them accountable for what they've done\".\nIn total, the evacuation operation saw more than 123,000 people wishing to flee the Taliban airlifted out of the country. \nThe US estimates that there are between 100 and 200 Americans still in Afghanistan.\nUS Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said \"all possible options\" were being looked at to get remaining US citizens and people who had worked with the US out of the country. \nMeanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he was not certain how many UK nationals remained in the country, but that it was believed to be in the \"low hundreds\".\nThe Taliban have celebrated the final withdrawal of foreign forces, and are now focusing on forming a government.\nThe deputy head of the Taliban's political office in Qatar, Sher Abbas Stanekza, told BBC Pashto that a new government could be announced in the next two days. \nHe said there would be a role for women at lower levels but not in top positions.\nHe also said that those who served in government in the past two decades would not be included.\nThis magical word \"inclusive\" is being used by Afghanistan's neighbours to try to put pressure on the Taliban to share some of the power so they don't have absolute control.\nBut look at it in pure political terms. The Taliban have come to power much more quickly than even they expected. And they feel they have an overwhelming mandate to pursue their overriding objective to establish an Islamic system. \nIn this new emerging Islamic emirate, women will be playing secondary roles to men. \nThis is already very different from what we heard even two years ago, when the Taliban started discussing with representatives of the Afghan government and civil society. They said then that women could have any roles in our new Islamic government except the president or prime minister. They could be ministers or CEOs. \nNow they seem to be rolling back from that because what happened in the past is now history. It's a new day for them and it's a day when the Taliban are in charge.

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Vaccine passports",
      "text": "Vaccine passports are to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from later this month, Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nThe plans will apply to indoor and outdoor events, and will need to be signed off by MSPs next week.\nMs Sturgeon said the move was needed to help stem the recent surge in the number of cases.\nA further 6,107 people have tested positive, with the number of people in hospital doubling in the past 10 days. \nAnd several areas of Scotland are among the regions with the highest rates of the virus in Europe. \nThe new vaccine certification rules mean people over the age of 18 will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to: \nThe new rules will impact on many sporting events in Scotland - particularly football matches - as well as concerts and music festivals.\nSPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said Premiership football clubs had \"a significant number of questions and real concern\" about the plan.\nHe added: \"It's not clear what IT infrastructure will be in place, what time-scales clubs will be asked to work to, or what can be done for those without smart phones.\n\"And it's not clear if it's going to cut across terms and conditions of seasons tickets already bought by people across the land.\"\nMs Sturgeon said the hospitality industry as a whole would not be included in the certification scheme - although that decision would be kept under review.\nAnd there are no plans to include key services or settings where people have no choice over attendance - such as shops, public transport, education and medical services. \nAnyone who has good reasons for not getting fully vaccinated - including children and people with particular medical conditions - will be exempt. \nPeople can already request a paper copy of their vaccination record to allow them to travel, and from Friday they will be provided with a QR code so they can download a copy of the record to keep on their phone.\nA similar scheme will be introduced in England at the end of this month, with people needing to have a \"Covid pass\" to access \"higher risk\" settings such as nightclubs. \nSeveral other European countries - including France, Italy and Ireland - have already introduced certification.\nScotland's health secretary, Humza Yousaf, said in July that he was \"sceptical\" about the case for vaccine passports, citing concerns that they \"might increase the inequality gap, and there would be ethical issues\".\nThe country's deputy first minister, John Swinney, also said he did not believe it was right to exclude people who do not want to be vaccinated after the UK government set out its plans to introduce passports in England.\nIn a statement at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that the certification scheme was now needed to \"help protect individuals and the country as a whole and reduce the risk of further restrictions being necessary\".\nThe first minister added: \"Many of the events and venues that are covered by the certification scheme are important - they matter to our economy, and to our cultural and social life. \n\"That's why we want to enable them to stay open safely - but they are not essential services.\n\"And the nature of them - which involves bringing many people together in relatively small areas - does mean that, despite their very best efforts, they can contribute significantly to the spread of the virus.\"\nShe also said it would be \"grossly irresponsible\" to rule out re-introducing further restrictions in the future.\nThe Scottish Greens are not keen on vaccine passports. The new minister for zero carbon buildings, active travel and tenants' rights, Patrick Harvie, has raised concerns about their introduction before.\nIn July he argued vaccine certification \"would deepen discrimination against those who have not yet been vaccinated\".\nToday the party's health spokesperson, Gillian Mackay, said it was essential the Scottish government ensures the introduction of vaccine certification doesn't adversely affect disabled people, those with underlying health conditions and those from the global south who may not be able to access proof of vaccination. \nBut the Greens are now in government. Vaccine certification isn't specifically excluded in the co-operation agreement they signed with the SNP and so the Greens are bound by collective responsibility on this issue and will have to support it when it's put to the vote at Holyrood. \nThe first minister said it was a \"significant move\" and would need to be signed off by MSPs, with a debate and vote to take place next week.\nHowever the SNP has a comfortable majority with the backing of the Scottish Greens - who have previously been opposed to the move - and the cooperation agreement between the two parties commits them to working together on Covid-related matters.\nThe Liberal Democrats were the only party to hit out directly against the plans following Ms Sturgeon's statement, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton saying vaccine passports were akin to \"medical ID cards\", adding: \"This is an illiberal step\".\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the Scottish government had \"wasted months\" that could have been spent making preparations, and was now \"introducing vaccine passports at the last minute\".\nHe added: \"It's a striking u-turn from what John Swinney said last month, where he emphatically claimed vaccine passports were \"the wrong way\" to go. \n\"We need businesses to get in-depth guidance around these certificates as soon as possible. They should be involved in the process and the government needs to clarify whether they will be expected to police these new rules.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the virus was now out of control and Scotland - and claimed the government had no strategy to deal with it. \nCase levels in Scotland are 80% higher now than they were last week, and five times higher than they were four weeks ago.\nThe number of people in hospital has more than doubled since 20 August, from 312 to 629.\nIntensive care admissions have not risen as quickly, but have still gone up from 34 to 59 over the same timescale.\nMeanwhile 4,108,804 people have had a first dose of vaccine, and 3,691,066 have had two.\nThat includes 95% of people over 40 who are now fully vaccinated, as well as 71% of 30 to 39-year-olds and 51% of 18 to 29-year-olds.\nThe Federation of Small Businesses said the many affected firms would not welcome the certificate scheme - but would accept it as an alternative to stricter restrictions. \nBut it said the system needed to be user-friendly for both businesses and the public, and warned against a \"rush\" to extend the scheme to other settings. \nThe Scottish Licensed Trade Association (SLTA) said the scheme was a \"threat hanging over the whole of the hospitality industry\", while the UK Hospitality Scotland said the move would \"cause dismay amongst businesses\" that had only recently been allowed to reopen."

      "text": "The parents of a seven-month-old baby who is stranded in Kabul without them say they are losing hope that they will be able to get her to the UK.\nThey say a five month delay in receiving their baby's British passport means their daughter is stuck in Afghanistan with grandparents.\nThe mother and British father say they had no choice but to return to the UK in May to retain the mother's UK visa.\nThe government said it would do all it could to help British nationals.\nThe baby's mother, an Afghan national, travelled to Afghanistan in September last year to see family. \nShe says she lost her UK ID card during her trip, and because of this, she was unable to return to the UK before her baby was born. Her partner joined her in December, and their daughter was born in Kabul in January. \nThe mother, who the BBC is not naming to protect her identity, was later issued a single-entry visa, which gave her 30 days to return to the UK to apply for a replacement permit.\nThe family say they had no choice but to leave their baby behind because of the limited window in which to travel back and renew the visa. They were also told the baby could not travel without a passport.\nThe mother speaks little English and needed the father to return to the UK with her to gain her replacement documents.\nThey hoped to return to Afghanistan as soon as the document was issued but events took over.\nAlthough the parents received their baby's passport on Wednesday, there are now no commercial flights operating into and out of Kabul.\nThe baby remains in the care of her grandparents. \n\"I have been separated from my baby for months I am lost without her by my side and we are losing hope,\" says the baby's mother, who is in London.\n\"I beg the government to please help us bring my baby and family back to me.\"\nThe baby's father says they applied for the baby's passport in March.\n\"We miss her but we cannot do anything. We want to hug her, kiss her,\" he says.\n\"She is stuck in Afghanistan because of the passport delay. If the passport took less time, she would have been here with us.\"\nBritish forces and embassy staff left Kabul before the baby could be brought to the UK.\n\"They said: 'Wait until she gets her passport.' I told them: 'It is going to be too late,'\" the father says, referring to British officials. \n\"They said she's not British yet. You have to wait till her passport arrives, then she's British, then we can help you.\"\nThere are also concerns for the safety of the baby's grandparents because of the help they have given to UK and US forces since 2001.\nThe family has not left their house in Kabul for the past week for fear of reprisals from the Taliban.\n\"We helped the UK when they came to our country, we now need help,\" one family member said.\n\"We helped as much as we could but now we need help, nobody wants to know.\"\nA Home Office statement said the UK will \"continue to do all we can to deliver on our obligation to British nationals and eligible Afghans\".\nIt said it did not comment on individual cases, but said \"more must be done to support those at risk\" and it will \"urgently\" look to establish a scheme to provide protection for Afghan citizens most at risk.\nMore than 16,000 people have been evacuated by the UK from Afghanistan, it added.\nThe Foreign Office said any British nationals who remain in Afghanistan and want to leave, and those caring for British nationals who are in Afghanistan, should continue to check travel advice and sign up for alerts.\n\"We will keep under constant review our means to help these people as the situation evolves,\" a statement said. \nIt said the UK has advised against travel to Afghanistan since at least 2001.\nIn April 2021 the UK advised British nationals there to consider leaving and on 6 August 2021 urged all those still there to leave immediately.\nAdditional reporting by Emma Harrison"

      "tags": "Abortion,Women,Texas,US abortion debate,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The US Supreme Court has refused to block a new law in Texas that bans abortions for most women.\nThe so-called Heartbeat Act bans terminations after the detection of what anti-abortion campaigners call a foetal heartbeat - a point when many women do not know they are pregnant.\nThe law gives any individual the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past the six-week point.\nRights groups had asked the court to block the law.\nBut in a late night vote, the Supreme Court justices ruled 5-4 against granting this. \nThe court's majority said their decision was not based on any conclusion about whether the Texas law was constitutional or not, and that the door remained open for legal challenges. \nAll three of former President Donald Trump's Supreme Court appointees voted against blocking the ban. \nOne of the court's six conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts, joined the three liberal justices in dissent.\nLiberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the court's order \"stunning\".\n\"Presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand,\" she said.\nPresident Joe Biden condemned the court's decision, calling it an \"unprecedented assault\" on women's rights. He promised a \"whole-of-government effort\" to try to limit the law's impact on women, but did not elaborate on what that would entail.\nIn a statement, President Biden said his administration would \"protect and defend\" the constitutional rights established under Roe v Wade and \"upheld as a precedent for nearly half a century\".\nHe was referring to the 1973 case in which the Supreme Court ruled US women have the right to an abortion until a foetus is viable - that is, able to survive outside the womb. This is usually between 22 and 24 weeks into a pregnancy.\nWhite House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that the president had long wanted to see the \"codification\" of Roe v Wade - which would mean Congress voting to make the precedent federal law - \"and [the Texas law] highlights even further the need to move forward on that effort\".\nOther Democrats also expressed their outrage. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Supreme Court had \"delivered catastrophe to women in Texas\" while New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said it was a \"direct assault on the rights of women\" across the country and would need a \"national mobilisation\" to fight it.\nRights groups including Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who had requested that the Supreme Court block the legislation, say they will not give up the fight. \nTexas' Republican Governor Greg Abbott, who signed the Heartbeat Act into law, said the state would \"always defend the right to life\".\n\"No freedom is more precious than life itself,\" he tweeted.\nBy Ang\u00e9lica Casas, BBC News, San Antonio, Texas\nDr Ghazaleh Moayedi, who carries out abortions in her OB/GYN practice in north Texas, said she feels targeted. In the 15 years that she has worked in abortion care, she has seen greater restrictions in the state, but never anything as aggressive as this law.\n\"Providing abortion care, and accessing abortion care is actually the very heart of being Texan,\" Moayedi told the BBC.\n\"Texans don't believe that the government should interfere in our personal lives. We believe that the community takes care of each other. It doesn't make sense that our legislators here in the state continue to go after folks for their personal lives, because that's really not what we're about here.\"\nShe said that the bill will immediately stop access to care for 90% of the people that see her for abortions and that those patients will likely be forced to consider going out of state or to continue unwanted pregnancies.\nHer biggest fear is for women who will seek dangerous alternatives to a medical abortion with the help of a doctor - but she also fears for herself.\n\"I'm afraid for my personal future and the future of my career as a result of this.\"\nMost abortion restrictions that have been proposed before have relied on criminal penalties or some form of regulatory punishment.\nThe Texas law, which was signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott in May, instead authorises \"a private civil right of action\", which allows people to sue to enforce the law even if they themselves have not been harmed.\nAn ordinary American, from Texas or elsewhere, may now be able to seek up to $10,000 (\u00a37,200) in damages in a civil court against abortion providers and doctors - and possibly anyone at all involved in the process. That means people like clinic staff, family members, or clergy who encourage or support the procedure could, in theory, be sued.\nThe legislation makes an exception in the case of medical emergency, which requires written proof from a doctor, but not for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.\nTurning over enforcement of the Heartbeat Act to private citizens instead of government officials likely means that - in the absence of Supreme Court intervention - the law cannot be challenged until a private citizen seeks damages. \nKim Schwartz of the Texas Right to Life organisation, which supports the measure, told the BBC most anti-abortion laws were \"held up in the court system for years\" and this \"thwarts the will of the people\". She argued that courts would require \"a credible claim that an illegal abortion occurred\" and would still undergo fact-finding processes.\nBut the ACLU and other critics have suggested the Texas law will champion \"a bounty hunting scheme\" of costly \"vigilante lawsuits\" designed to harass women seeking an abortion. The ACLU noted tip lines had already been set up by anti-abortion groups."

      "text": "Evacuation flights from Afghanistan could resume \"in the near future\", the UK's foreign secretary says, after talks with leaders in Qatar.\nDominic Raab is in the country to discuss allowing more British nationals and Afghan allies to leave Afghanistan.\nAsked when Kabul airport could reopen, Mr Raab said: \"that's looking like it may happen at some point in the near future\".\nIt is currently out of action following the withdrawal of US troops last week.\nMr Raab's Qatari counterpart said he hoped for \"good news\" on its reopening \"in the next few days\". \nSheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani added that Qatar was working with the Taliban to ensure it was operational \"as soon as possible\".\nThe Gulf state, which has hosted the Taliban's political office for eight years, is seen as a key link between the West and the group.\nSpeaking after meetings with politicians in Doha, Mr Raab said the UK would not recognise the Taliban \"any time in the foreseeable future\".\nBut he said there was a need for \"direct engagement\" with the group, to ensure UK nationals and Afghan allies could leave Afghanistan.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson later underlined that message, telling reporters that if the Taliban wanted to engage with the West \"then the first priority for them for us is safe passage for those who want to leave\".\nDominic Raab told a news conference that co-operation on border crossings would be an \"important first test\" of the Taliban's relationship with the West.\nAnd he admitted the UK must \"adjust to the new reality\" after their rapid takeover of Afghanistan after the US withdrawal. \nAfter talks with Mr Raab, Sheikh Mohammed said there was not yet a \"clear indication\" of when Kabul airport would reopen. \nBut he told reporters: \"We are working very hard [and] we remain hopeful that we will be able to operate it as soon as possible.\nHe added that Qatar was also in discussions with Turkey, to see if it could provide \"any technical assistance on that front\".\nAt the start of a tour of the region, Mr Raab held talks with Sheikh Mohammed, along with the Emir of Qatar. \nBritish officials have been meeting senior Taliban leaders in Doha and they will brief the foreign secretary on the outcome of those talks. \nThe Foreign Office said the British embassy to Afghanistan, which moved out of Kabul last week, was now up and running in Doha.\nSpeaking to broadcasters, Mr Raab said the UK was working with neighbouring countries to ensure the \"basic logistics\" are in place to allow people to leave Afghanistan.\nThe last UK plane flying people out of Kabul took off on Saturday, with the US following on days later to stick to the 31 August deadline pledged by US President Joe Biden.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Raab said more than 17,000 people had been evacuated by the UK from Afghanistan so far, including over 5,000 UK nationals.\nBut it is feared hundreds eligible for relocation were left behind, although Mr Raab has estimated the number of UK nationals still in Afghanistan was in the \"low hundreds\". \nHe has said he cannot give a precise figure of the number of eligible Afghans who wanted to leave but were unable to get on evacuation flights. \nThese groups include Afghan nationals and their families who worked with British forces during their time in the country and asylum seekers who could be eligible to come to the UK under international law. \nMr Raab's trip to Qatar came after he was grilled by MPs on the Commons foreign affairs committee on Wednesday about the UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan.\nThe foreign secretary defended his handling of the crisis, saying the UK was \"caught out\" by the speed of the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, with intelligence at the time suggesting it would hold out until the end of the year.\nBut the committee's chairman, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, said a Foreign Office risk report from 22 July predicted a \"very real danger of cities collapsing\" after US forces withdrew.\nThe Foreign Office said it was a standard monthly report that did not contain intelligence assessments.\nIts statement added: \"The July document makes clear that our central planning assumption at the time was that the peace process in Afghanistan would run for up to a further six months.\"\nSpeaking later at a military base in Essex, Boris Johnson said: \"I think it's been clear for many months that the situation could be very fast and that has been part of the intelligence briefing. There have also been suggestions as you know that the Afghan National Defence force might hold on for longer, but logically you can see what happened.\" \nHe added that once the Afghan army felt they no longer had American air cover then \"things did go faster\".\nIn an interview in the Spectator published on Wednesday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he had argued as early as July that the previous Afghan government would fall.\n'It was a bit of a shock when [regional city] Herat fell,\" he told the magazine. \n\"Some of these big places had historically been resistant to the Taliban. When they fell, literally without a fight, I think the game was up.\n\"I remember back in July arguing that whatever we think, the game is up and we have to do what we can to accelerate whatever we're doing.\"\nHe added: \"When the actual moment came in Afghanistan, intelligence hadn't failed. It was just limited, as it always is at the very end.\"\nOn Thursday, Mr Raab insisted he and Mr Wallace had been \"taking the same assessment throughout until very late\".\n\"We were all working to the same set of assumptions,\" he added.

      "text": "Young people strapped for space at home have helped to drive a \"rapid recovery\" in membership numbers at Gym Group.\nThe gym operator said membership had jumped by a third since February as its sites reopened.\nOver two-thirds of its members are under the age of 34, and the company said many younger people lacked space to do home workouts.\nThe chain, which operates 190 sites, aims to open 40 new gyms by the end of 2022 by converting former shops.\n\"The physical gym will always be really important for people and I think that's coming through in our numbers,\" chief executive Richard Darwin told the BBC's Today programme.\nWhile many people worked out at home during lockdown, Mr Darwin said that many younger people \"just don't have the space...  to be able to do home workouts\".\nGym Group is a low-cost gym operator, where customers do not have to have an annual contract.\nIt said membership numbers had hit 730,000 by the end of June this year, compared with 547,000 at the end of February 2021 - during the lockdown. This compares with a peak membership of 891,000 in February 2020 before the first coronavirus lockdown measures were introduced. \nGyms only reopened in England on 12 April this year, and later in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nGym Group reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a328.5m for the six months to the end of June whiles sales tumbled by 21.4% to \u00a329.3m.\nHowever, despite the losses, the company is looking to expand.\nIt said it planned to repurpose vacant retail spaces on the High Street, which has seen the closures of chains such as Debenhams and Topshop accelerate during Covid. \nGym Group has already opened seven new sites this year and plans to open an additional 40 by the end of 2022.\n\"We're seeing a lot of properties become available, particularly in retail parks which are very good for gyms as they have accessible parking and clear signage,\" Mr Darwin said.  \nHowever, Dan Lane, senior analyst at investment platform Freetrade, said Gym Group's site rollout needed to be done \"efficiently\" and not end up \"diluting overall profits just for the sake of willing itself back to normality\".\n\"Rushing to snap up more properties while the current ones aren't at capacity and fewer of us are back in the office is a sign of how much the group needs footfall,\" he said. \n\"If we aren't going or coming from work, will we be bothered to leave our homes (many of which are now in the country, after the London exodus) to get to the gym?\"\nBut with lockdown restrictions now lifted there have been signs that people are exercising less at home. \nRival gym chain PureGym has also seen a pick up in customers, whereas home fitness bike firm Peloton recently reported losses.."

      "title": "Texas abortion law: The implications of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling",
      "tags": "US Supreme Court,Texas,US abortion debate,United States",
      "text": "A landscape-shifting Supreme Court decision on abortion wasn't expected until next June, as the court spends the coming months weighing the merits of a Mississippi law limiting abortion rights. Instead, the legal lightning bolt came just before midnight on Wednesday.\nIn an unsigned ruling backed by a narrow 5-4 majority, the court justices allowed a Texas law banning all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy to go into effect.\nThe move stunned many legal observers and abortion-rights advocates, who were expecting the court to suspend the law until after the justices decided the Mississippi case.\nAs the judicial dust settles, here are five significant implications of the court's action.\nForty-eight years ago, in the landmark case Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court legalised abortion across the US, ruling that women have an unfettered constitutional right to the procedure during their first trimester (12 weeks) of pregnancy.\nThe court has occasionally chipped away at the right, upholding spousal and parent notification laws and allowing greater regulation of abortion providers, but by and large that precedent has held up.\nIn the half-century since Roe, however, there hasn't been a court majority as predisposed to ruling against abortion rights as this one. \nAnti-abortion activists viewed the Mississippi case, which bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy except in medical emergencies and cases of \"severe foetal abnormality\", as their greatest opportunity to strike down Roe. That would allow individual states to decide the legality of abortion in their individual jurisdictions, creating the sort of patchwork of laws that existed in the US before 1973.\nWhile the court did not rule on the merits of the Texas law, the fact that five of the nine justices permitted it to go into effect - even though it could have a significant chilling effect on abortion providers and women seeking the procedure - suggests there is a functioning majority on the court ready to scrap Roe.\nAnti-abortion activists aren't popping champagne corks yet, but an ultimate victory - one they've organised and laboured toward for decades - appears within their grasp.\nJust because the court declined to pass judgement on the merits of the Texas law doesn't mean the court's ruling won't have an immediate knock-on effect. Texas appears to have found a way around quick judicial review of constitutionally questionable laws.\nThe state law outsources enforcement of the abortion ban to private citizens, who can file lawsuits against abortion providers and individuals who \"aid and abet\" the procedure - collecting $10,000 (\u00a37,230) in damages for each case they win. With no government official or entity enforcing the ban, the Supreme Court majority held, there's no one for opponents of the law to sue until those private cases start showing up in court.\nPresident Joe Biden, in his statement reacting to the court's ruling, highlighted the court's response to the unusual construction of the Texas law in a scathing statement released on Thursday.\n\"Rather than use its supreme authority to ensure justice could be fairly sought, the highest court of our land will allow millions of women in Texas in need of critical reproductive care to suffer while courts sift through procedural complexities.\"\nAs the court does its \"sifting\", other Republican-controlled states, many of whom have already tried passing some form of abortion ban only to have them suspended by the courts, are already considering copying the Texas law\nThe tactic doesn't have to be limited to abortion, either. One can imagine liberal states passing legislation allowing citizen enforcement of handgun bans, global warming regulations or vaccine mandates.\nThe Supreme Court might ultimately slam the door on such a practice - it's hard to imagine the court allowing such a significant erosion of its powers of judicial review - but in the meantime, it's open season for states that have long been stymied by federal courts.\nIf anti-abortion advocates are celebrating this week, they should take a moment to give thanks to Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. If it weren't for the Senate minority leader's procedural manoeuvring - and willingness to break with longstanding Senate precedent - this week's abortion ruling would almost certainly have gone the other way.\nIt was McConnell in 2016 who blocked Democrats from filling the seat of the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia for nearly a full year in 2016, allowing Donald Trump to make the pick instead. McConnell also scrapped the Senate rule that required a 60-vote majority to confirm Trump's pick, circumventing Democratic attempts to block Trump's nominee.\nThen, when liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died last October, McConnell flipped from his 2016 position of not filling Supreme Court openings during an election year and used his Senate Republican majority to seat another Trump pick.\nBoth Trump-appointed justices, as well as a third who replaced retired Justice Anthony Kennedy (who had previously voted to uphold Roe), were among the five justices who let the Texas law go into effect.\nIf it wasn't for McConnell - or if Hillary Clinton had beaten Trump in 2016 - current conversations would be about a liberal court majority and constitutionally protected abortion rights for decades to come.\nOnce again, the Supreme Court's chief justice - appointed by Republican President George W Bush in 2005 - has sided with the court's liberals on a major issue.\nLast term John Roberts signed on to a landmark case for gay and transgender employment rights and sided against efforts to protect Trump tax returns from criminal investigators. He also was the pivotal vote upholding Democratic healthcare reform in 2016 and Barack Obama's immigration protections for undocumented children in 2020.\nSuch rulings have sparked the ire of conservatives, many of whom view him as a political apostate.\nRoberts is no liberal - his rulings in favour of corporate power and religious liberty prove that -  but his high-profile votes have placed him decidedly in the ideological middle of the spectrum. If the balance of the court ever moves to the left - either by the death or retirement of a conservative justice while Democrats control the presidency and the Senate - Roberts could end up as the court's key swing vote.\nFor decades, abortion has been a more powerful motivating issue for conservatives than for liberals, if only because anti-abortion activists are the ones facing a legal landscape they desperately wanted to change.\nIf the Texas ruling is an indication that the court is poised to strike down Roe and allow states to ban abortion, however, that legal landscape will shift quickly and dramatically.\nIt will be abortion rights advocates who feel threatened - with fear frequently an effective motivating factor in getting people to the polls. With mid-term congressional elections just a year away, a candidate views on abortion rights will no longer be a theoretical discussion, with the ultimate fate of the procedure decided by the courts.\nLegislators in states and US Congress will be casting votes on abortion laws that have very real implications for everyday Americans - and very real electoral implications.\nFor instance, Democratic voters in Texas, a traditionally conservative state that has trended to toward the left in recent elections, could take note of their legislature's sweeping efforts to reshape abortion law and flock to the polls next November. In other states, it could be conservatives who turn out to overturn abortion protections.\nFor decades both Republicans and Democrats have been saying \"abortion is on the ballot\". Some, particularly on the left, have shrugged that off. But if Roe falls, it will be hard to dispute such an assertion."

      "tags": "Commercial space travel,Richard Branson,Virgin Galactic,Space exploration",
      "text": "The US Federal Aviation Administration has grounded Virgin Galactic missions as it investigates how Sir Richard Branson's recent space flight drifted off course during its climb skyward.\nThe British billionaire fulfilled a lifetime ambition on 11 July by riding his rocket plane to 86km in altitude.\nBut the New Yorker magazine has revealed how the vehicle flew for a period outside its pre-agreed airspace.\nSir Richard's company has disputed the New Yorker's description of events.\nThe rocket plane, known as Unity or SpaceShipTwo, which carried Sir Richard aloft, landed safely.\nIn a short statement, the FAA said it was overseeing the investigation of the \"July 11 SpaceShipTwo mishap that occurred over Spaceport America, New Mexico.\n\"Virgin Galactic may not return the SpaceShipTwo vehicle to flight until the FAA approves the final mishap investigation report or determines the issues related to the mishap do not affect public safety,\" it added.\nIn response to the FAA announcement, Virgin Galactic told the BBC it was cooperating fully with the aviation administration.\nIt took such issues very seriously, it said, and was working to determine how to prevent trajectory deviations from occurring on future missions. \nThursday saw the company announce details of the next Unity flight - a research outing for the Italian Air Force.\nThis had been scheduled for the end of September or early October, but must now await the results of the FAA probe.\nThe New Yorker article was penned by Nicholas Schmidle, who's written a book about Sir Richard's near two-decade effort to develop a rocket plane capable of taking fare-paying passengers above Earth's atmosphere.\nMr Schmidle's magazine story said the pilots on the 11 July flight - with Sir Richard and three other company employees sitting behind them - received cockpit warnings about the off-course trajectory of their rocket-powered ascent.\nLeft uncorrected, this shallower than planned climb to altitude could have left Unity unable to reach its landing location on the glide back down to Earth. Mr Schmidle claims company protocols for the cockpit warnings would normally have led to the pilots aborting the ascent, but that they pressed on instead.\nVirgin Galactic had earlier on Thursday rejected what it described as \"mischaracterisations\" in the New Yorker's article.\nThe company said its pilots had encountered unexpected winds at high altitude and took the necessary actions to complete a safe climb to space and return to Earth.\n\"Although the flight's ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity to successfully reach space and land safely at our spaceport in New Mexico,\" a company spokesperson told the BBC.\n\"At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory, and at no time did the ship travel above any population centres or cause a hazard to the public.\" \nThe spokesperson said FAA representatives were present in the ground control room during the flight and in the post-flight debriefs.\nThe New Yorker magazine told the BBC it stood by its account of what happened on the day.\nWhen Unity's next mission will now occur is anyone's guess.\nThis is meant to take aloft three Italian nationals - Walter Villadei and Angelo Landolfi from the Italian Air Force; and Pantaleone Carlucci, an Italian national research council engineer. \nThe men plan to conduct 13 scientific experiments during the flight, and in particular during those few minutes of weightlessness they'll experience at the top of Unity's climb.\nUnder the plan, the Italians are to be supervised in the back of the rocket plane by Virgin Galactic's chief astronaut instructor, Beth Moses. If and when it happens, the flight will be her third to the edge of space.\nThe Virgin Galactic pilots up front in the rocket plane are designated to be Michael Masucci and CJ Sturckow. Masucci was also in the cockpit for the 11 July mission, along with the company's chief pilot, David Mackay.\nAfter this next mission, Virgin Galactic is expected to enter an extended period of maintenance and upgrades for both Unity and its carrier/launch plane, known as Eve.\nIf the schedule is not disrupted by the latest FAA ban, these vehicles are expected to resume space missions by the middle of next year. The company said one further test outing would be conducted before full commercial service began, probably in the second half of 2022.\nSome 600 individuals put down deposits a number of years ago to buy seat tickets costing $200,000-250,000. Tickets sales resumed last month with prices from $450,000 (\u00a3325,000) per seat."

But it is not yet clear how he plans to achieve this. \nMr Kerry said he aimed to meet Chinese leaders again ahead of the upcoming COP26 UN climate summit in Glasgow this year and push for stronger emission reduction targets. \n\"We have consistently said to China and other countries... to do their best within their given capacity,\" he said on Thursday. \"We think that China can do more.\"\nIf there was to be any sign of progress between the world's two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases you'd expect a nod to it now. \nThis is John Kerry's second trip to China in a matter of months. \nInstead China has refused to accept America's terms. It won't separate talks on climate change from the broader disagreements between Beijing and Washington DC; everything is on the table. \nWhich means John Kerry has - so far - failed in his bid to get just one thing on the table. One thing that's so important, he said, that it shouldn't be overshadowed by tariffs or sanctions or extradition. \nThe question now is will President Joe Biden - a man who has enhanced some of the punitive measures put in place by his predecessor - change tack?"

      "text": "Pop legends Abba have surprised and delighted fans by announcing their first studio album for 40 years.\nAbba Voyage will be released in November, before a \"revolutionary\" set of concerts where virtual avatars will play hits like Mamma Mia and Waterloo.\nThe quartet, who split up in 1982, said they ended up back in the recording studio while working on the stage show.\n\"At first it was just two songs, and then we said, 'Well, maybe we should do a few others,'\" said Benny Andersson.\nIn the end, they recorded 10 tracks - two of which were premiered during a globally-streamed press conference on Thursday.\nThe first, I Still Have Faith In You, is an affectionate piano ballad portraying the bond the four band members share.\n\"When Benny played the melody, I just knew it had to be about us,\" said Bjorn Ulvaeus, explaining the song's origins.\n\"It's about realising that it's inconceivable to be where we are. No imagination could dream up that, to release an album after 40 years and still be the best of friends, and still be enjoying each other's company, and have a total loyalty. \n\"Who has experienced that? Nobody.\"\nThe second track, Don't Shut Me Down, is a mini-melodrama in the vein of the Abba classic The Day Before You Came, where a woman returns to her partner years after walking out.\n\"You asked me not to leave, well here I am again - and I love you still,\" sing Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad in their trademark stacked harmonies. \nBoth songs will feature on Abba Voyage when it is released on 5 November, with an eye on the lucrative Christmas market. The record will even include \"a little Christmas tune\", said Benny, as well as \"a number of pop songs\".\nHe added: \"I think it's pretty good. We've done as good as we could, at our age.\"\nThe reunion had, for many years, seemed unlikely. The band reportedly turned down $1bn to tour in 2000.\nIn an interview with the BBC in 2013, Agnetha said she preferred to leave Abba in the past. \"It was such a long time ago, and we are getting older, and we have our different lives,\" she explained.\nIn a statement accompanying Thursday's announcement, the singer said she \"had no idea what to expect\" when they finally reconvened in 2018.\n\"But Benny's recording studio is such a friendly and safe environment, and before I knew it I was really enjoying myself!\"\n\"It was so joyful to be together in the studio again, the four of us, and hearing Frida and Agnetha going for it again,\" added Benny. \nBut the pianist confessed to having nerves ahead of the initial recording session. \n\"Five minutes before they came into the studio, I was thinking, 'I should have asked if they can still sing,'\" he said. \"But they could and they can and you will hear it when you listen to the records.\"\nHowever, neither singer attended the press launch in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. \n\"They should have been here,\" said Bjorn, half-joking, \"but they don't enjoy this [publicity] as much as Benny does.\"\nThe band's new songs will also be played during the band's virtual concert, also titled Abba Voyage, which will open next year in a specially-built arena in east London.\nPlaying six nights a week, it will feature digital versions of Abba's band members, accompanied by a 10-piece live band performing 22 of their greatest hits. Tickets go on sale on 7 September, starting at \u00a321, with the opening night on 27 May.\nThe so-called \"Abba-tars\" were designed by Industrial Light and Magic - the visual effects company founded by Star Wars creator George Lucas.\nMore than 850 people worked on recreating Abba \"in their prime\" using motion capture technology to scan \"every mannerism and every motion\" of the musicians, who are now in their 70s, as they performed.\n\"Agnetha, Frida, Benny and Bjorn got on stage in front of 160 cameras and almost as many VFX geniuses, and they performed every song in this show, to perfection, over five weeks,\" explained producer Ludvig Andersson. \n\"So when you see this show, it is not four people pretending to Abba, it is actually them.\"\nBjorn said the band had chosen London to premiere the show because \"London is the best city to be in when it comes to entertainment, theatre, musicals\u2026 We have always felt that the Brits see us as their own.\"\nAsked what he enjoyed most about being in Abba, Benny replied with refreshing honesty: \"Not having to worry about the money\". \n\"It's been a good thing for all of us,\" he continued. \"You are free to do anything. I just keep on writing music.\"\nHere we are in 2021 with the first new Abba material since ET came out and, I'm happy to report, they haven't messed it up.\nWe join Abba not as the pant-suited disco voyeurs of Voulez-Vous and Dancing Queen, but as they are now - in their 70s, reminiscing about their lives, and looking back at the music they made in their prime.\nThe lead track, I Still Have Faith In You, is an ode to their friendship and to the bonds that have matured and survived despite divorce and heartbreak. \nStarting gently, it builds to an astronomical climax, full of power chords and dazzling harmonies, as the quartet declare: \"Through joy and the sorrow, we have a story and it survived.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "At least 18 councils across the UK confirmed on Thursday that they are experiencing ongoing disruptions to their bin collection services. \nIt is due to staff self-isolating and a lack of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers for bin lorries.\nThe Local Government Association (LGA) told the BBC that the delays were primarily affecting garden waste.\nHowever, some councils are also delaying recycling collections in order to prioritise general waste. \nIt comes as three councils in Devon wrote to Home Secretary Priti Patel on Thursday, asking for the government to grant temporary visas for trained European HGV drivers to ease the shortage.\n\"At the time of writing, North Devon Council are attempting to fill seven [bin lorry driver] vacancies, Torbay Council eight vacancies, and Teignbridge Council 10 vacancies,\" wrote councillors Steve Darling, David Worden and Alistair Dewhirst. \n\"This equates to approximately 20% of the HGV workforce in driver vacancies and it is proving very challenging to fill this resourcing gap given the dynamics of this labour market.\" \nThe UK currently has a shortfall of about 100,000 HGV drivers, after many EU workers returned home following Brexit and during the pandemic. \nMinisters say UK employers should hire locally to fill the gap, but the councils said it would take time to train the next generation of drivers. They also highlighted delays in the current HGV driver recruitment process. \n\"With our efforts to 'grow our own' HGV drivers, we need their DVLA applications to be fast tracked, as for example in Teignbridge, there are five [bin lorry driver] applications in the system which if fast tracked could help partially tackle the challenges we face,\" the councillors stressed. \nThe BBC understands that the DVSA has already increased the number of vocational tests from 2,000 a week to 3,000, and the DVLA are prioritising HGV provisional licence applications and taking about two weeks to issue them.\nWaste management giants Biffa, Veolia and FCC Environment told the BBC they are \"doing everything\" they can to mitigate the driver shortage.\n\"We are working hard to recruit new drivers, offering great rates of pay alongside fantastic benefits, as well as full training,\" said Biffa's human resources director Jane Pateman.\nVeolia said it currently has 180 bin lorry driver vacancies in the UK. In August, it launched a campaign encouraging mothers to consider a new career in driving for the waste management industry. \n\"To meet the industry-wide shortage of drivers, Veolia are offering incentives such as a sign-on bonus for new staff, and a retention bonus for existing drivers in areas where we are most affected,\" said Veolia UK and Ireland's chief human resources officer Beth Whittaker.\n\"We are also up-skilling existing staff and utilising our extensive apprenticeship scheme.\"\nThe councils confirmed to be experiencing ongoing bin collection delays are:\nRecycling and waste management firm FCC Environment said it too was trying to attract more workers to the profession. \n\"We are focused on actively recruiting drivers across the country, offering local people local employment with job security in the waste and recycling sector, and an attractive package that includes flexible, part-time hours with no overnight stays, fitting around family life and helping work/life balance,\" said FCC Environment's operations director Steve Longdon. \n\"In the short-term in some areas, working in close agreement with our local authority partners, we have prioritised waste and recycling collections - enabling these to continue by temporarily suspending other services, such as garden waste collections, to allow us to reallocate drivers.\"\nHowever the LGA said that the haulage industry was causing part of the problem: \"Fast inflating HGV driver salaries in the private sector risks exacerbating issues in the public sector, with the rises potentially creating a retention as well as a recruitment problem for councils and their contractors.\"\nOn Thursday, the LGA released a report showing 46% of councils in England and Wales experienced disruptions to their bin collection services in July.\nDr Adam Read, director of external affairs at Suez Recycling & Recovery UK, told BBC Breakfast that chronic driver shortages had been going on for about 10 to 12 weeks.\nHe set out what he sees as the benefits to working as an HGV driver in waste management: \"You might start early, but you finish early and you get to pick the kids up. \n\"You're not working long shifts and certainly not driving long distances, a lot of it is close to where you live - so there are some upsides to the sector.\"\nHe did concede, however, that waste collection firms do not typically pay as well as delivery agencies or supermarkets.\n\"In some geographies, we've seen some staff start to have their head turned by slightly better pay conditions,\" he added.\nIn a bid to tackle the wider HGV driver shortage, supermarkets such as Tesco and Aldi have increased wages or started to offer sign-on bonuses for delivery drivers.\nBefore the pandemic, there was a shortage of an estimated 60,000 HGV drivers, according to the Road Haulage Association, but that's now risen to 100,000.\nSince Brexit, many European drivers who worked in the UK have returned to their home countries or decided to work elsewhere due to the additional paperwork required at borders. It slows them down and costs them money, as they are often paid by distance covered rather than per hour.\nPandemic travel restrictions and a lack of Covid tests for drivers have also played a part.\nThousands of lorry drivers were forced to spend Christmas in their cabs in December, after France closed its border with the UK due to a backlog in coronavirus testing.\nAbout 4,000 lorries had to park at Manston Airport in Kent, with another 2,300 held on the M20, creating a long tailback.

      "text": "Pupils have begun returning to schools for the new term as the Welsh government pledges to watch Covid cases.\nSome children go back this week while others return after the weekend.\nCovid measures are being based on local risk, but head teachers have asked for more information from government.\nOne said schools hoped for \"as much normality as possible\" at the start of a third school year affected by coronavirus.\nAt Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Llangynwyd, near Maesteg, Bridgend county, there is a staggered return for pupils.\nHead teacher Meurig Jones said everyone just wanted normality.\n\"Now that we've seen society go to category zero, and greater freedom and movement, I think that's what schools are hoping for,\" he said.\nThe return of pupils has coincided with an increase in Covid rates, especially among the young.\nRecord high coronavirus cases in Scotland have partly been blamed on schools returning in mid-August, earlier than elsewhere in the UK.\n\"I am concerned, looking at what has happened in Scotland with them returning,\" Mr Jones said.\nDr Christine Tait-Burkard, an expert in infection and immunity at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Radio Wales with Claire Summers the vaccination programme meant many people testing positive in Scotland were experiencing milder Covid symptoms.\n\"I think people are now aware that these numbers do not directly translate into hospitalisations anymore,\" she said. \n\"With vaccination, many people have much milder disease, and do not only not get admitted to hospital, but when they get admitted, they're also spending much less time there, which is good news.\"\nBut Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said vaccinations were not the solution to school outbreaks.\n\"Schools are going back, but I would emphasise that these vaccines are not really terribly good at preventing mild infection and transmission. What they're good at is stopping you from getting seriously ill and that is something that is very unusual in healthy children,\" he said.  \n\"So I think the concept that somehow vaccination can keep schools going and stop outbreaks and is there as a solution to that problem, is not a very strong one I would say.\"\nMr Jones said: \"The main goal here is to keep our staff and learners safe, but to make sure they get the education they deserve.\n\"There's been enough upheaval over the last year-and-a-half and we want to get back to that normality.\"\nThe Welsh government said rising Covid rates were \"in line with expectations\".\n\"We will monitor the situation very closely when schools return, but the high rates of vaccination in Wales have weakened the link between the virus and hospitalisations,\" a spokesman said.\nBefore the summer holiday, the government said contact groups, or \"bubbles,\" would not be required from September and masks in classrooms would not be routinely recommended.\nThey are still needed for secondary pupils on school transport.\nLast week, a Welsh government plan said it should be \"business as usual\" in schools where possible, but added that measures could be escalated or removed according to local factors.\n\"The framework isn't clear enough,\" Mr Jones said, echoing criticism from education unions.\n\"It gives us some sort of information. I feel it lacks depth of what will be required.\"\nThe Welsh government claimed risk in schools was low when the country was at alert level zero.\n\"Schools will only need to consider putting additional measures in place if the local risks differ from this national rating,\" a spokesman said.\n\"Local authorities will work with their schools to decide how these measures should be tailored.\"\nSecondary pupils have been encouraged to take lateral flow tests before going back, and to stay home if they are positive.\nCwm Taf Morgannwg health board's public health director, Prof Kelechi Nnoaham, said it was \"imperative\" steps were taken to stop Covid spreading in schools.\n\"Once they're back in school, students should continue to take lateral flow tests twice a week to make sure they're not spreading the virus unknowingly,\" he said.\n\"Young people's education has been hit hard by this virus, and it's important we keep classrooms open as much as possible.\"\nWales' chief medical officer, Frank Atherton, said on Wednesday that 61% of 16 and 17-year-olds had received their first vaccine dose, and those who had not were being urged to.\nNicola Chan Gizzi, from Abergele, Conwy county, said she was \"apprehensive\" as her children prepared to go back.\nThe mum-of-six wished they were still in class bubbles as a Covid outbreak would then be easier to control.\n\"I feel the spread will be increased when the children do go back to school,\" Ms Gizzi said. \nUnder-18s no longer have to isolate if they are a close contact of someone who has tested positive. \nThis means it is less likely large groups of children will have to stay away from school.\nMs Gizzi said: \"In Scotland, for example, numbers have really gone up since children returned to school.\n\"We have some elderly, vulnerable members in our family and it's really, really difficult.\n\"We try to just meet outside and try to keep each other safe, it is a difficult position.\"\nMs Gizzi's daughter, Anna-Beth, had \"mixed feelings\" about returning to Denbighshire's Ysgol Glan Clwyd.\n\"Our school had decided to try and get everything back to normal as much as they can,\" the 15-year-old said."

      "text": "A new study shows that increases in extreme winter weather in parts of the US are linked to accelerated warming of the Arctic. \nThe scientists found that heating in the region ultimately disturbed the circular pattern of winds known as the polar vortex.\nThis allowed colder winter weather to flow down to the US, notably in the Texas cold wave in February. \nThe authors say that warming will see more cold winters in some locations.\nOver the past four decades, satellite records have shown how increasing global temperatures have had a profound effect on the Arctic. \nWarming in the region is far more pronounced than in the rest of the world, and has caused a rapid shrinkage of summer sea ice.\nScientists have long been concerned about the implications of this amplification of global change for the rest of the planet. \nThis new study indicates that the warming in the Arctic is having a significant impact on winter weather in both North America and East Asia. \nThe researchers detail a complex meteorological chain that connects this warmer region to a rotating pattern of cold air known as the polar vortex.\nThe authors show that the melting of ice in the Barents and Kara seas leads to increased snowfall over Siberia and a transfer of excess energy that impacts the swirling winds in the stratosphere above the North Pole. \nThe heat ultimately causes a stretching of the vortex which then enables extremely cold weather to flow down to the US.\nThere has been an increase in these stretching events since satellite observations began in 1979.\nThe scientists believe this vortex stretching process led to the deadly Texas cold wave in February this year. \n\"We're arguing that melting sea ice across Northwest Eurasia, coupled with increased snowfall across Siberia is leading to a strengthening of the temperature difference from west to east across the Eurasian continent,\" explained lead author Dr Judah Cohen, who's a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a director of Atmospheric and Environmental Research, a weather risk management company.  \n\"We know when that temperature difference increases, that leads to more disruptions of the polar vortex. And when it's weakened, that leads to more extreme winter weather such as the Texas cold wave last February.\"\nThe researchers say that their findings are based on both observations and modelling and they show a physical link between climate change in the Arctic, the stretching of the polar vortex and the impacts on ground.\nThe authors believe their work could improve predictions about the onset of extreme cold winter events. \n\"One of the benefits of this study is that if you recognise these precursors and you know the conditions that are favourable for triggering such event, then you get to extend your forecast lead time,\" said Dr Cohen.\n\"In Texas, people could have certainly prepared better with better warnings, some people froze to death in their homes and perhaps they could have gone to seek shelter.\"\nLooking at the bigger picture, the research team believes that their findings will help people understand that global warming is complex and perhaps dispel the idea that colder winters mean climate change isn't happening.  \n\"There has been a long-standing apparent contradiction between the warmer temperatures globally, however, an apparent increase in cold extremes for the United States and in northern Eurasia. And this study helps to resolve this contradiction,\" said fellow author, Prof Chaim Garfinkel from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\"In the past, these cold extremes over the US and Russia have been used to justify not reducing carbon, but there's no longer any excuse to not start reducing emissions right away.\"\nThe study has been published in the journal Science.\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "tags": "Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse",
      "text": "There are \"shocking failings\" and \"blatant hypocrisy\" in the way major UK religious groups handle child sex abuse allegations, an inquiry has found.\nThe Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) said some religious organisations in England and Wales were \"morally failing\" children. \nIt examined evidence from 38 groups, including those from Christianity, Orthodox Judaism and Islam.\nLeaders discouraged reporting abuse to protect reputations, the report found.\nIt said the religious leaders also blamed victims for their abuse, and relied on religious dogma when responding to allegations.\nThe report, which follows on from inquiries into the Catholic and Anglican Churches, comes after several weeks of public hearings held last year in which victims of abuse gave evidence.\nIt covers a series of religious groups including Jehovah's Witnesses, Baptists, Methodists, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and non-conformist Christian denominations.\nThe report said that many religious groups were putting children at risk by:\nThe inquiry found that in some communities \"the relationship between ideas of sexual 'purity' and social and familial standing are likely to make abuse markedly harder to report\".\n\"The imperative not to speak is bound up with notions of honour, with consequences for an individual's ability to marry, for their family and for the 'honour' of their community. In extreme cases, being seen as dishonourable can lead to violence against that individual or their family,\" it said. \nWhile the inquiry's press release was strongly worded, the report itself was more measured and Lloyd Evans, who campaigns against abuse in the Jehovah's Witnesses, told BBC News it was \"wishy washy\".\nMr Evans, a former elder of the Jehovah's Witnesses, suggested that IICSA did not look at as much data as it could have - and that part of the problem was that the inquiry was \"under-funded\".\nToday's report from the inquiry is the 16th in three and a half years.\nWith each one, the colossal scale and destructive force of child sexual abuse within British society is revealed.\nThere is barely a corner of this country's institutional, cultural or spiritual life untarnished by the activities of abusers.\nWherever the inquiry has looked, it has found.\nReligious organisations exist with an explicit purpose to teach right from wrong, but the authors of today's report suggest that only heightens the \"moral turpitude\" of their \"egregious\" failure in protecting children from harm.\nTime and again, they note how cries for help were ignored while perpetrators were protected.\nThe inquiry suggests several reasons. Top of the list: victim-blaming, shame and honour, a sense that the abuse is somehow the child's own fault.\nSome faith leaders use theological texts to justify abuse and their elevated status to prevent disclosure.  \nSmaller religious communities may be distrustful of external authorities and fearful of reputational damage.\nThe report also suggests that in some religious settings, the concept of \"forgiveness\" is misused, to silence the abused and to justify not reporting abusers' terrible crimes.\nIn about a year's time, the inquiry will publish its final overarching report. We already know it will be a very sobering read.\nThe inquiry took more evidence about the Jehovah's Witnesses, which has 131,700 members in England and Wales, than any other group.\nThe organisation has repeatedly been accused of covering up child abuse and told the inquiry allegations concerning 67 individuals had been reported to its branch office within 10 years.\nA particular concern in the report was that, while some organisations did have \"effective\" child protection policies, in some settings \"not even basic child protection procedures\" were in place.\n\"Religious believers can find it difficult to accept that members of their congregation or religious leaders could perpetrate abuse. As a result, some consider that it is not necessary to have specific child protection procedures or to adhere strictly to them,\" the inquiry concluded. \nIn the case of the Jehovah's Witnesses, IICSA was particularly critical of a biblical rule applied by the group requiring two witnesses before an allegation of abuse is considered by elders. \nThe Jehovah's Witnesses gave evidence that it also has policies requiring allegations to be reported to the police when there is a legal duty do so. However, the UK has no such \"mandatory reporting law\".\nIICSA strongly criticised the \"two witness rule\", saying it was likely to increase the suffering of victims, and failed to reflect the reality that \"child sexual abuse is most often perpetrated in the absence of witnesses\".\nA statement from the Jehovah's Witnesses said the protection of children was \"of utmost concern and importance to all Jehovah's Witnesses\" and they \"fully agree\" that all religious organisations should have a child protection policy.\n\"We will carefully and respectfully consider all the observations and recommendations contained in IICSA's investigation report,\" it added.\nThe Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations, representing over 100 synagogues claimed its child protection hotline had only received four calls which \"raised concerns of a serious nature\".\nThe Union provided no details of allegations of child sexual abuse within the previous 10 years to the inquiry. \nIt told IICSA the \"prevailing environment and culture\" within the community led to a reduction in abuse compared with the population as a whole, according to the report. \nHowever, the inquiry said that while the figures it was given by religious organisations may reflect the \"known prevalence of child sexual abuse\", it was \"extremely unlikely that they reflect the full extent\".\n\"As a result of this investigation, a number of religious organisations have told us that they have altered, improved or recognised the need for policies and procedures in respect of child sexual abuse,\" the inquiry added.\nRead more here.\nThe report gave the example of a girl who was sexually assaulted by a church volunteer when she was 12 years old.\nShe disclosed the abuse to her mother, who reported it to the police.\nAfter being made aware of the allegations, a church minister told her mother that the abuser was \"valued\" and must be considered \"innocent until proven guilty\".\nProf Alexis Jay, chairwoman of the inquiry, said: \"Religious organisations are defined by their moral purpose of teaching right from wrong and protection of the innocent and the vulnerable. \n\"However, when we heard about shocking failures to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse across almost all major religions, it became clear many are operating in direct conflict with this mission.\"\nIICSA highlighted concerns that the law currently does not define religious leaders as holding a \"position of trust\" within child protection law. \nHowever, the inquiry did not make a finding requiring this to change. A final report following more than a dozen investigations is due next year. \nA key decision for the inquiry is whether to back \"mandatory reporting\" - a law making it a criminal offence for professionals not to report evidence of child abuse. \nRichard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer who acts for seven victim and survivor groups in the IICSA, said the latest report confirmed religious groups had \"catastrophically\" failed to protect children and the findings made the arguments for mandatory reporting \"overwhelming\".\nThe Rev Dr Jonathan Hustler, secretary of the Conference of the Methodist Church, said the early indications from the report were that organisations were \"still failing their members\" and he said he was \"truly sorry\" when this happened in Methodist churches. \nThe Muslim Council of Britain said the report made for \"difficult reading\" and said the protection of children should be at the centre of all Muslim institutions.\nAdditional reporting by Katie Wright.\nUpdate 9 September 2021: This story has been amended after the IICSA issued a correction to its report \"to say allegations concerning 67 individuals and not 67 allegations\" had been reported to the Jehovah's Witnesses' branch office within 10 years."

      "text": "Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says the benefits of vaccine passports for entry to nightclubs and other large events outweigh the concerns and are preferable to another lockdown.\nIn July, Mr Yousaf told the BBC he was sceptical about the passports due to fears of increasing the inequality gap.\nHowever, he now says circumstances have changed and steps have been taken to resolve the issues.\nThe passports are due to be brought in at the end of the month. \nThe plans will apply to indoor and outdoor events but will need to be approved by MSPs next week.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the move was needed to help stem the recent surge in the number of cases.\nLatest figures showed a further 6,107 people had tested positive, with the number of people in hospital doubling in the past 10 days. \nAnd several areas of Scotland are among the regions with the highest rates of the virus in Europe. \nThe new vaccine certification rules mean people over the age of 18 will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to: \nThe new rules will affect many sporting events in Scotland - particularly football matches - as well as concerts and music festivals.\nConcerns have been raised by nightclub owners about the fairness of passports being brought in for some venues and not others, while the SPFL  said it had \"a significant number of questions and real concern\" about the plan.\nIn July, Mr Yousaf highlighted concerns that the passports \"might increase the inequality gap, and there would be ethical issues\".\nAnd after the UK government set out its plans to introduce passports in England, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he did not believe it was right to exclude people who did not want to be vaccinated.\nOnce again we find ourselves at a worrying stage in the pandemic. So why not just bring back restrictions?\nFor one thing - vaccines are extremely effective at preventing serious illness, and in Scotland almost 70% of the entire population is now fully jagged.  For most of this group, visiting a restaurant, heading out to the shops or meeting up with a group of people should be relatively safe.\nThat's why there is no desire to impose blanket restrictions that would also be economically very hard to justify. \nBut the alternatives are limited.\nOne is to find incentives to encourage younger people to get vaccinated. That's why the government is now pushing for vaccine passports despite it being controversial.\nThey also need to step up efforts to target other groups where uptake is low. \nReminding people to use rapid lateral flow tests as more people head back into workplaces might help, as well as basic measures like wearing masks and improving ventilation in buildings.\nAlso encouraging people to follow the new isolation rules and get tested quickly if they have been in contact with a positive case. \nFor now this seems to be the plan as officials continue to scrutinise the data in the hope that this wave of cases is about to plateau. \nHowever, on Thursday, Mr Yousaf told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the problems of people who did not have smartphones being unable to access the QR codes needed had been resolved as, from Friday, paper copies would include the codes.\nHe said vaccine passports had never been ruled out. \n\"We have put on the table, quite clearly, what some of our concerns are,\" he said. \"But our circumstances have now changed. Cases have increased 80% in the last week. A month ago our test positivity was 5% - it's now over 11%.\"\nHe said that limiting the scheme to very specific events and venues was \"a demonstration of the fact that we still have concerns\".\nBut he added: \"The benefits of a certification scheme, in terms of a public health intervention, in terms of incentivising vaccination, those benefits outweigh the concerns that still remain.\"\nMike Grieve, director of the Night-Time Industries Association Scotland, told the programme the policy was \"incoherent\" and \"inconsistent\" as, for instance, a large pub could let hundreds of people in without the passports but they would be required at a small nightclub next door.\nHe said: \"There is zero consistency there. If you look at live music venues - standing capacity up to 500 - no vaccine passport - nightclub 250-300 capacity - vaccine passport. Where is the logic behind that?\"\nMr Yousaf said: \"Nightclubs have consistently been deemed high risk venues due to lack of ventilation and largely those attending are amongst the younger cohort where the uptake of the vaccine is lower. We also know that the behaviours exhibited in nightclubs in terms of close contact are high risk.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole Hamilton said the passports were actually \"health ID cards by any other name\".\nHe added: \"For the first time in Scottish society, private citizens will be asked to evidence treatment that they've had in order to access venues and services or provide their private medical data to a complete stranger in order to get into a football ground or a nightclub.\n\"We believe this is unnecessary. It's not been demonstrated to us how this is a tool of infection control - this feels more like state control.\" \nResponding to claims that the passports would mean people were more likely to \"drop their guard\", Mr Yousaf said: \"Even if you are in these settings with both doses of the vaccine, the virus is still there - you can still catch it. It's important that people still exhibit good behaviours and demonstrate caution.\"\nHe said the scheme was not being introduced immediately to allow time to gain parliament's approval, to give businesses time to prepare for it and to enable some tweaks to be made to the NHS app so it recognised the QR codes.\nMr Yousaf added: \"Ultimately, we are bringing this forward because we don't want to reimpose restrictions but that is always an option we have to consider, particularly if we see the rise in cases we saw last week.\"\nHe said early indications were that the rate of increase was beginning to slow down but the government would also \"want to keep an eye on the enormous pressure on the NHS\". \nMs Sturgeon said on Wednesday that although the hospitality industry as a whole would not be included in the certification scheme that decision would be kept under review.\nAnyone who has good reasons for not getting fully vaccinated - including children and people with particular medical conditions - will be exempt. \nSeveral other European countries - including France, Italy and Ireland - have already introduced certification."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nSchools are not \"drivers\" or \"hubs\" of Covid infection, Public Health England's medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle has said, although she added that she understood parents' nervousness about schools returning after the summer. She stressed that lots of measures to cut Covid spread remained in place. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the BBC it was right for children to have a \"much more normal education experience\", with adults being able to go back to the pub, music festivals and theatres.\nSchool pupils in Scotland returned to classrooms two weeks ago, and more than 32,000 were absent due to Covid this week, attendance figures show. The figure includes those who had the virus, and those who were self-isolating as a close contact. Due to the relaxation of the rules, many pupils are likely to be off school for just one or two days if their test is negative, rather than 10 days, and whole classes no longer have to isolate at home following a positive test. \nPlans for nightclubs and other large venues in Scotland to require proof of vaccination upon entry outweigh concerns and are preferable to another Covid lockdown, the nation's health secretary has said. Humza Yousaf had previously voiced scepticism about passports, including fears they could widen inequality. The passports are due to be brought in at the end of the month and will apply to indoor and outdoor events - but the proposal will need to be approved by MSPs next week.\nTom Cruise's films Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible 7 have been delayed due to a surge in US Covid-19 cases caused by the Delta variant. Movie studios are concerned that the highly contagious variant will deter cinemagoers. Paramount has pushed the Top Gun sequel back six months to May next year, while Mission: Impossible 7 has been moved from May 2022 to September that year. Both films have been repeatedly delayed because of the pandemic, and production on Mission: Impossible 7 in the UK was halted for two weeks in June due to positive Covid tests within the crew.\nYoung people strapped for space at home have helped to drive a \"rapid recovery\" in Gym Group's membership numbers, which jumped by a third since February as its sites reopened. Over two-thirds of the gym operator's members are under the age of 34, and the company said many younger people lacked space to do home workouts during lockdown. \"The physical gym will always be really important for people and I think that's coming through in our numbers,\" chief executive Richard Darwin told the BBC's Today programme.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAs the UK awaits a decision from its vaccine experts on whether the jab will be offered all 12 to 15-year-olds, we take a look at which children are already being vaccinated here.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

It also called for Amazon to allow British workers to unionise and to have a greater share of the firm's profits.\nIn July, the union described working conditions at Amazon as \"Charles Dickens meets 21st century Britain\".\nSome workers described having to run to the toilet to make it back to their workstation on time, and not being allowed to sit down for ten hours.\nOther workers described queues for toilets which meant they had to urinate in bottles.\nAmazon's recruitment and retention efforts come as UK job vacancies hit a record 953,000 in the three months to July.\nSome parts of the UK economy are struggling to recruit, including efforts to try to address a chronic shortage of HGV drivers.\nTesco has offered lorry drivers a \u00a31,000 joining bonus, and John Lewis plans to increase annual salaries.\nThe meat industry has said it is hoping to recruit prisoners and former inmates to fill roles in abattoirs and processing plants."

      "title": "Covid: Schools aren't infection hubs, says public health boss",
      "tags": "Schools,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Gavin Williamson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Schools are not \"drivers\" or \"hubs\" of Covid infection, Public Health England's medical director has said.\nDr Yvonne Doyle said she understood parents' nervousness about schools returning after the summer in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nShe stressed that lots of measures to cut Covid spread remained in place.\nBut Prof Calum Semple, a government scientific adviser, said with most adults vaccinated, schools were likely to be a \"greater part of the problem\". \nSome have suggested a surge in cases in Scotland, where pupils returned in August, could be linked to schools.\nFewer measures are in place in schools than during last term, with bubbles and masks no longer in use in England and Wales, while Northern Ireland has also scrapped social distancing requirements. \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Breakfast it was right for children to have a \"much more normal education experience\", with adults being able to go back to the pub, music festivals and theatres.\nHe said there needed to be a \"sensible balance\" and that was why mass testing of secondary school pupils was taking place.\nDr Doyle said there were lots of regimes in place already to prevent the spread, including extra cleaning, advice on ventilation and testing.\nShe said: \"We understand, and I understand fully, that parents may be nervous but I would stress again that schools are not the drivers and not the hubs of infection.\"\nShe added that PHE attributed some of the school-related coronavirus figures to the testing regime.\nProf Semple, professor of child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, said he believed schools should stay open \"nearly at all costs\" because the damage caused by a lack of education could be lifelong.\nHe said while pupils were unlikely to get sick themselves they could transmit the disease to others, and that this should be considered when discussing vaccines for 12 to 15-year-olds.\nA paper, published by the Royal Society, suggests the reopening of schools, and particularly secondary schools, is associated with an increased risk of transmission both among school-aged pupils and in the wider community. But it said the scale of that increase depended on control measures in the classroom and community as well as compliance with mass testing.\nProf Semple said his biggest worry was closing schools again because education was very important but he said school building stock was poor, with ventilation an issue.\nBoth experts agreed that school is the best place for children. \nBut vaccinating everyone else means that they'll look more like \"hubs\" than they did last year. \nIf your problems get smaller and mine stay the same, I start to look worse than you. \nLast September, older teenagers and younger adults saw the fastest rises in infections and cases in England. \nThis year, they'll be able to get vaccinated. Their place as \"leaders\" in infection rates and rises is likely to be taken by children because everyone else will have the vaccine to slow the spread. \nThe decision about vaccination for under-16s is finely balanced because the risks of illness for children from Covid are so low. \nParents have to balance the risks of Covid with the risks of disruption to education. Health experts currently appear more worried about missing education. \nScientists have already said it is \"highly likely\" that high levels of coronavirus will be seen in schools by the end of September.\nAnd there could be consequences for parents and carers, they say - but it remains to be seen what effect it will have on cases and hospital admissions.\nImperial College epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson said the UK could expect cases to surge in step with what has happened in Scotland when schools return but the big unknown was how long that surge would last. \nHe said that in a post-vaccine world the country could cope with much higher levels of cases and what ministers might consider an \"acceptable level of hospitalisation\" but he said that daily caseloads of 100,000 to 150,000 would put \"significant demands on the healthcare system\".\nIn Scotland more than 32,000 pupils have been off school due to Covid-19 as of Tuesday - with 6,471 having the virus, up from 3,500 the week before, while a further 25,622 were isolating.\nAmong the measures being implemented for safety in schools in England are carbon dioxide monitors to help improve ventilation, with 300,000 being made available, but when asked on BBC Breakfast Mr Williamson was unable to say how many were already in place.\nWhile CO2 monitors do not affect the transmission risk in schools, they can help to indicate how well ventilated a classroom is. \nHumans breathe out a higher concentration of carbon dioxide than is present in the atmosphere, so the monitors help to detect how much of the surrounding air has been breathed out, and how much is fresh air from outside.\nAsked about vaccinations for 12 to 15-year-olds the education secretary said parents would find it \"deeply reassuring to have a choice of whether their children should have a vaccination or not\" and that he was \"very keen\" to hear the decision from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nHe said that government was \"ready to go\" if it did decide to extend the eligibility to children that age.\nProf Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, said there were many arguments for and against vaccinating the age group but said whatever decision the committee reached would be in children's best interests.\nProf Semple, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was a \"really difficult judgement\" with a fine balancing act between a \"rare side effect\", in myocarditis, and the low risk from Covid to children themselves and the impact of transmission on wider society."

      "title": "Afghanistan: How can the West stop terror bases?",
      "tags": "Afghanistan,Islamic State group",
      "text": "\"The UK will fight Islamic State by all means available,\" says Dominic Raab. The foreign secretary added that the UK would \"draw on all elements of national power\" to pursue the group's leaders. \nSo what does that mean in practice? What exactly are the tools at Britain's disposal? Or is this, as some critics would maintain, just an empty boast?\nAfter Western defence and intelligence agencies collectively failed to foresee the speed at which Afghan National Security Forces would collapse, it seems they have since lost no time in making discreet approaches to the incoming Taliban government. \nIn a surprising move, the CIA Director, William Burns, reportedly flew to Kabul almost within hours of the Taliban takeover of that city, holding talks with their political chief, Mullah Baradar. \nA key aim is to stop Afghanistan becoming a haven for transnational terrorism. The former chief of MI6, Sir Alex Younger, told the BBC: \"I am not optimistic that the Taliban have the capability to do this, even if they had the intent.\"\nHe added: \"It will be important... to persuade neighbouring states that, for all our differences, we actually have the same problem and need to find some form of co-operation.\"\nPakistan plays a crucial role in achieving this goal, and Richard Moore, the current chief of MI6, has held talks with its army chief to discuss just that. Pakistan's shadowy Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) have supported numerous militant Islamist groups in the region. Yet at the same time, Pakistan has suffered multiple casualties from domestic jihadist terrorism.\nIntelligence officers from MI6 are also reported to have held talks with the Taliban in both Kabul and Doha with the simple message that if a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan is to have global legitimacy, then it cannot be allowed to again become a haven for terrorism. \nMI6 talking to the Taliban is not new. What is new is that the entire paradigm of US-backed counter-terrorism in Afghanistan changed at a stroke on the day the Taliban walked into Kabul on August 15th.\nThe Taliban takeover of nearly the whole of Afghanistan means that the West - and specifically the CIA, MI6 and other intelligence agencies - no longer has a trusted, in-country security service or Afghan special forces to work with. \nFor the nearly 20 years that Nato and other multinational forces have been in Afghanistan, the intelligence provided by the country's National Directorate of Security has been vital in disclosing the covert activities of al-Qaeda, ISIS-K (the Afghan affiliate of Islamic State group) and other jihadist militant groups. \nAfghan, US, British and other special forces were then able to swoop in, often by helicopter in the dead of night, and close down those bases before they could successfully launch any international attacks. \nHence the claim that for 20 years there has not been a single transnational attack launched from Afghanistan while Western forces were there. \nSo what now? What's left? \nThe loss of both its Afghan bases and an established network of human informants has forced the West - primarily the US and UK - to now rely on two other methods: cyber interception of messages, and \"over-the-horizon\" drone strikes. \nThe fact that the US was able to locate and strike an ISIS-K target in Nangarhar province so soon after last Thursday's deadly bomb attack at Kabul airport shows that it still has some skin in the game - that it is not completely blind to what its adversaries are up to in the more remote corners of that country.\nThe US Central Command facility at Al Udeid airbase in Qatar maintains oversight of operations in Afghanistan, and when a target is identified it can call on a number of \"assets\" in the region to attack it, most notably missile-armed drones which are able to hover, unseen, over a location for hours on end.\nBut there is no getting around the fact that Afghanistan has now become a hard target for intelligence agencies. Most of those human informants who were supplying tip-offs on militant activities have either fled the country or gone into hiding. \nBoth MI6 and the UK government's listening station GCHQ ultimately report to the foreign secretary, so Dominic Raab will be well aware of the challenges ahead. \nGCHQ, together with its US counterpart the National Security Agency, has been instrumental in locating ISIS terror cells in places like Syria and Iraq. \nBut for MI6 the reality is that it will need to rebuild an entire network of human informants if it is to successfully place agents \"upstream\" inside terrorist organisations in Afghanistan who can then give warning that an attack is being planned. And that could take years.\nIt is one of the bizarre oddities of the whole Afghan situation that the US and the Taliban, who have just spent the last 20 years fighting each other, now find themselves on the same page when trying to confront ISIS-K. \nISIS-K is a declared enemy of both the Taliban and al-Qaeda and is likely to become the new insurgent challenge to Afghanistan's new rulers. \nBut when it comes to al-Qaeda, the situation is a lot murkier. \nAccording to a UN report published in June there remain strong ethnic and marital ties between the Taliban and al-Qaeda. \nThe purported return to Afghanistan this week of Osama Bin Laden's former security chief Amin ul-Haq is a worrying sign. That such a high-value individual, classified by the US as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, should feel safe enough to return now the US has left will be deeply troubling for counter-terrorism officials in many countries. \nThey won't be taking their eyes off Afghanistan for many years to come."

It is not yet clear whether Elsheikh has reached a plea deal with authorities.\nThe two men were flown from US custody in Iraq last year to face the charges, which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.\nOriginally from west London, their alleged IS gang was given its Beatles nickname by hostages due to their British accents. They were stripped of their UK nationality in 2018.\nSome of the victims were beheaded, with their deaths filmed and broadcast on social media. The high-profile killings triggered outrage around the world.\nThe group's alleged ringleader, Mohammed Emwazi, known as \"Jihadi John\", was killed in a drone strike in 2015.\nAnother gang member, Aine Davis, was arrested and imprisoned in Turkey.\nKotey and Elsheikh remained at large until they were captured in 2018 by Syrian Kurds fighting IS.\nThe US government had wanted to put them on trial but was lacking evidence.\nThe men were in a legal limbo for several months, held by the US military in Iraq where the US attorney general threatened to hand them over to local courts, known for their summary justice and executions.\nBut the US said it would not carry out the death penalty if the men were convicted in a US court.\nBritish counter-terrorism officials have since shared crucial evidence with US officials.\nElsheikh is scheduled to go on trial in January.\nKotey's plea deal, meanwhile, carries a minimum sentence of life without parole. But after 15 years he would be eligible to be transferred to the UK to face any possible charges there.\nHis sentencing is due to take place in March next year."

She looked after him right up until the end.\n\"In many ways we thought - 'May you now enjoy the peace that you worked for so much in this life'.\""

      "text": "The US space agency has confirmed that its Perseverance rover has retrieved its first rock sample on Mars.\nThere were an anxious few days after the robot drilled into a thick slab dubbed \"Rochette\" that the core might have been dropped.\nBut new images of the drill head show the sample safely inside the mechanism.\nIt's a historic moment. The core represents the first ever rock section collected on another planet intended for return to Earth.\nThe rover is tasked with gathering more than two dozen such samples over the next year or so that will be fetched home by a joint US and European effort later this decade.\nNasa's Perseverance robot landed in Mars' Jezero Crater in February.\nThe deep, 45km-wide depression, some 20 degrees north of the planet's equator, looks to have held a lake billions of years ago. \nBecause of this, scientists think Jezero's sediments may hold traces of ancient microbial life - assuming biology ever took hold on Mars.\nFrom its touchdown location, the robot has driven more than 2km to a slightly raised ridge nicknamed the Citadelle. \nIt's here that the Perseverance team selected Rochette as the target for the latest drilling attempt.\nThe robot is equipped with a caching system that will take a finger-sized core of rock cut by the drill and place it in a titanium tube.\nBefore sealing this cylinder, however, the rover will image the contents. It was at this stage in early August during a first sampling attempt that Perseverance scientists realised they had nothing in the tube; the coring mechanism had shattered the rock to a powder that then fell back on to the ground around the drill hole.\nBut the mission team were encouraged by the first pictures downlinked by Perseverance on Thursday which appeared to indicate rocky material from Rochette in the corer head at the entrance to the cylinder. The very latest pictures confirm it.\nThe rover must now fully process the sample within its belly.\nPerseverance continues to be shadowed by its mini-helicopter, Ingenuity.\nOriginally taken to Mars as a technology demonstration, the drone is now being used routinely to scout the terrain ahead of the rover. \nIngenuity has made a total of 13 flights.

      "text": "The Wetherspoons chain has said some of its pubs have run out of some beer brands because of supply chain issues.\nThe group said Heineken, Carling and Coors were among the brands affected. \nHeineken and brewer Molson Coors said that like many in the industry, they had been hit by a shortage of HGV drivers.\nMeanwhile, a Coca-Cola bottling giant also said Diet Coke was unavailable in some supermarkets owing to the driver shortage. \nThe UK is facing a shortage of lorry drivers that hauliers have blamed on Covid and Brexit, and have called for immigration rules to be changed to allow EU drivers to return.\nBut the government has consistently said that the haulage industry and retailers need to be training new UK drivers.\nThe logistical problems have led to empty shelves at some supermarkets, while the retail industry has flagged concerns about Christmas supplies.\nFast-food chains have also been hit, with Nando's running short of chicken and McDonald's having to stop serving milkshakes.\nThere are also shortages of Diet Coke in some supermarkets due to the lack of HGV drivers, as well as problems sourcing aluminium cans, bottling giant Coca Cola Europacific Partners said.\nIt said its supply chain was working \"flat out\" to meet demand.\nWetherspoons also said on Wednesday that some of its pubs had seen some supply shortages.\nThe pub chain said there had been problems with Heineken and Molson Coors deliveries.\n\"We are experiencing some supply problems with both Carling and Coors, which means that some pubs do not have the products available,\" a Wetherspoons spokesman said.\n\"We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused. We know that the brewers are trying to resolve the issue.\"\nMolson Coors, which owns Carling and Coors, said: \"Like many in our great British brewing and pub sector, we have been hit by the HGV driver shortage.\n\"While overall our availability is good, there are intermittent pockets of pressure in our supply network that are unfortunately affecting a number of Wetherspoons pubs.\n\"After such a difficult period for our industry, it's heart breaking to be letting any customer down and we will continue to do everything in our power to get our much-loved brands back on every Wetherspoons bar,\" it said.\nWetherspoons said its problems had been caused by planned industrial action by Heineken drivers working for GXO Logistics. The Unite union said no industrial action had taken place.\nHeineken said: \"We're working tirelessly to find solutions to delivery issues caused by considerable disruption in the haulage and logistics market.\n\"Pubs won't run dry - if your favourite pint isn't immediately available, there will be a tasty alternative to try.\"\nThe logistics industry has said that driver shortages across the UK are due to a combination of Covid and Brexit.\nOn Wednesday Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin, a prominent supporter of Brexit, was taken to task by some critics on Twitter.\nSinger Billy Bragg wrote: \"Here's a lament for Tim Martin, whose Wetherspoons chain is struggling with the realities of the Brexit for which he campaigned so loudly.\"\nTwitter user Pearl Noir wrote: \"So how's Brexit working out for you so far Tim?\"\nThe UK is short of about 100,000 drivers, according to the Road Haulage Association, with new recruits to the industry facing problems getting driving tests due a Covid-related backlog.\nIn addition, when the pandemic struck last year, many European drivers went home, with few returning, according to hauliers.\nNow the UK has left the EU, it is no longer part of the single market, so it is easier for European drivers to find work in the EU.\nForeign drivers also now need visas and the Home Office is not keen on allowing lorry drivers on to a list of shortage occupations.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng this week rejected calls to loosen immigration rules, saying it would be a \"short-term temporary solution\" and that firms should employ UK workers, especially those facing an \"uncertain future\" when the furlough scheme ends next month.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We're working closely with industry to address sector challenges, which are similarly being faced by other countries around the world. \n\"This includes plans to streamline the process for new drivers to gain their HGV licence and to increase the number of driving tests able to be conducted. \n\"We want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce and make employment more attractive through offering training, careers options and wage increases.\"\nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC) said that retailers were doing all they could to avoid any possible disruption to supplies before Christmas.\n\"Government must address the HGV driver shortage by rapidly increasing the number of HGV driving tests taking place, providing visas for EU drivers, and looking for a longer-term solution,\" said Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC."

      "tags": "Companies,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Contact tracing,Hospitality industry,Restaurants,Pubs,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People who do not turn up to reservations they have made at pubs and restaurants are costing the hospitality sector \u00a317.6bn a year, a report says.\nData from hospitality technology firm Zonal said one in seven customers have not turned up for a reservation without telling the venue since April.\nIt said 18-34-year-olds were the \"worst offenders\" for no-shows, with more than a quarter not honouring bookings.\nIndustry group UK Hospitality said no-shows were \"deeply damaging to venues\".\nJacob Georgallis, general manager at Toast Bar in Leeds, said punters not turning up and not cancelling bookings had \"massively\" affected the business during times when some coronavirus restrictions remained.\n\"We'd be fully booked but then no-shows would happen and you've turned away three or four groups who could have taken the space,\" he said.\n\"It was a really gutting feeling for us, and a nightmare for staffing and forecasting.\"\nDuring Euro 2020, the bar took pre-orders on food and drinks and did not experience any no-shows, apart from customers unable to attend due to Covid-related reasons.\nMr Georgallis said he hoped there was a \"big push\" towards solving the problem and \"finding ways to take money up front\".\nThe research, conducted by Zonal and consultancy firm CGA, surveyed 5,000 people nationwide.\nAlthough younger people were found to be the most likely out of the sample to fail to turn up to bookings, compared to just 1% of those aged 55 and over, younger adults were more frequent bookers and ate out more often.\nIn its report, researchers said Londoners were found to be the worst no-show offenders in the UK, with 24% of consumers in the capital admitting to not notifying a venue that they weren't planning to turn up. \nThe figure was higher than the national average of 14%. The report said customers in Scotland, the South West and the South East were most likely to honour their reservations, with just 10% failing to show up.\nUK Hospitality said the \u00a317.6bn loss from no-shows equated to 13.3% of the sector's \u00a3132bn in pre-pandemic revenue.\nSource: Zonal and CGA's Technology survey\nVicky Liner, marketing director at West Midlands-based Suburban Inns, said no-shows had \"calmed down a little bit\" after the venue started asking patrons to hand over card details and put down deposits when making a booking. \n\"Taking deposits wasn't something we really wanted to do, but we've had to - and they're no bad thing if they help to change the culture,\" she said.\n\"We still want spontaneity in hospitality and give people the option to just walk in.\"\nIn response to the survey findings, Zonal and UK Hospitality have launched a campaign aimed at encouraging people to honour the bookings they make, or at least inform venues if they have to cancel a booking. \nUK Hospitality's chief executive Kate Nicholls said no-shows had been a blight on the industry for \"many, many years\". Added to the difficulties businesses were experiencing due to the pandemic, they were \"currently deeply damaging.\"\n\"Our pubs, bars and restaurants deserve our support and it's encouraging that this research shows there is a growing realisation among customers of the need to honour their booking or let the venue know they can't make it,\" she said.\n\"But it also highlights the fact that no shows still happen far too often, with younger customers particularly responsible, and that really can't go on.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nLong Covid is somewhat of a mystery but it seems being fully vaccinated cuts the risk of developing the condition. Research led by King's College London suggests that the odds of developing symptoms lasting longer than four weeks are cut by 50% in the minority of people who have caught the virus despite having two jabs. It's not known for sure what causes long Covid but symptoms include extreme tiredness, changes to taste and smell and joint pain.\nAlthough the government says it has already provided additional money to tackle backlogs, groups representing the NHS warn services may need to be cut in England unless an extra \u00a310bn in funding is received next year. The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers say money is needed to cover pandemic-related costs and reduce the backlog in operations and treatments. They're warning patients could be put at risk.\nMorgan is used to feeling hungry. Universal credit has kept him going since relations with his family broke down in 2018 and during the pandemic the government gave an extra \u00a320 a week boost. But it will soon come to an end. Morgan, 23, says a \u00a320 weekly drop in the payment is \"literally like taking food off my table\". Read more about his story here.\nA mental health ambulance team has been supporting patients during the pandemic by providing food parcels with their wages. There has been a 65% rise in calls to Linda Shrimpton's Merseyside-based team during the pandemic and after seeing what provisions some patients had they decided to help those most in need. \nThe Duke of Sussex made a surprise appearance at the GQ Men of the Year awards urging governments to tackle the \"huge disparity\" in access to Covid vaccines worldwide. Presenting a prize to the team behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine virtually, Prince Harry said until everyone could access the jab \"we are all at risk\". \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nBeing fully vaccinated reduces the risk of long Covid but what is it and what are the symptoms?

      "text": "New Orleans officials have imposed a citywide curfew as large parts of Louisiana and Mississippi remain without power following Hurricane Ida.\nMayor LaToya Cantrell said the curfew would last from 20:00 to 06:00 and police said there had been \"several\" incidents of looting in the city.\nEnergy companies are working to restore power but residents are being warned it could take weeks in some areas.\nMeanwhile water services and infrastructure have also been hit.\nTwo people were killed and at least 10 injured after a section of highway collapsed near Lucedale, Mississippi on Monday. \nSeveral cars were reported to have fallen into a hole that was 50 to 60ft (15 to 18m) long and 20 to 30ft deep, according to highway police. \nLocal authorities believe that some of the drivers may not have been able to see the road properly because of the heavy rains. The highway remains closed. \nOver eight inches (20cm) of rain fell in the area during Ida, which reached the US mainland as a Category 4 storm on Sunday. \nWhile Ida's speed has slowed, authorities continue to warn of storm surges and heavy rains across the southern US. \nBy Tuesday afternoon, Ida was in Tennessee, soaking the area with intense rain and prompting flash flood warnings.\nLocal officials have urged evacuated residents to delay their return home as more than one million homes and businesses remain without power, including most of New Orleans. \nMayor Cantrell said that she was hopeful \"that we should have some level of transmission\" by Wednesday but \"that does not mean we will immediately see all the lights on in the city.\"\nFederal officials say that some 441,000 people in 17 parishes across the region have no water, and a similar number may be without power for up to a month.\nIt comes as heat advisories have been issued, with some areas expected to reach 95F (35C), according to weather officials say.\nLouisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said some 25,000 line workers were working to restore power but admitted: \"There are an awful lot of unknowns right now.\"\nMeanwhile Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Bill Nungesser has warned the death toll from Ida will likely rise in the coming days. \nIn addition to the two killed during the highway collapse, at least two other people have been reported dead during the storm.\nIn Louisiana, a man died while attempting to drive across a flooded area of New Orleans. Another man died after being struck by a tree near Baton Rouge.\n\"Knowing that so many people stayed behind in places like Grande Isle and Lafitte where flood waters have devastated those areas, we expect there will be more people found who have passed,\" Mr Nungesser said.\nIda is expected to move next to the US northeast, with rain and threat of floods stretching from the Tennessee to the mid-Atlantic. \nWashington, DC, Baltimore and Philadelphia are among the cities now under flash flood watches.\nHow has Hurricane Ida affected you?

      "text": "On the day the Taliban took control of Afghanistan's capital Kabul, advertising posters outside beauty parlours showing women in bridalwear were painted over. Salons around the city were closed down too. While some businesses have vowed to return to full service soon, others fear for their futures. Afsoon (not her real name), a make-up artist in hiding, describes how much the beauty industry has meant to Afghan women.\nIt's hard to translate the exact meaning of the Dari phrase takaan khordum into other languages.\nRoughly, it describes a rare life event that shakes you to your core, after which you will have changed forever - like the death of someone you love, someone central to your life.\nAfsoon experienced the feeling of takaan for the first time on 15 August 2021.\nThat Sunday she woke at 10:00 to a call from a colleague at the beauty salon where she worked. Afsoon was at her happiest there, the smell of fresh shampoo and nail polish mixed with the whir of a hairdryer and chatter.\n\"Don't come in today,\" Afsoon's co-worker told her when she rang. \"We are closing up. It's over.\"\nSitting up in bed, Afsoon checked her mobile. Her thumb moved up and down the screen of her phone as she scrolled through dozens of texts from friends and family and then hundreds of social media posts. A torrent of dread slammed her with such force that she felt freezing cold and sick at the same time.\nThe messages were all the same. The Taliban had entered Afghanistan's capital Kabul. Within 16 days Western troops and their diplomats were gone from the country.\n\"It's over,\" she repeated to herself. It was time to hide.\nAfsoon is in her mid-20s and considers herself a modern Afghan woman. \nShe loves social media, she loves movies, she can drive and she has career ambitions.\nAfsoon can't remember the time in the 90s, the decade she was born, when the Taliban first banned beauty salons in her country. \nBut she grew up in an Afghanistan where beauty parlours were a regular part of her life. In the two decades since the US-led invasion that ousted the Taliban in 2001, more than 200 beauty parlours opened in Kabul alone, with hundreds more in other parts of the country.\nAs a teenager she would thumb through magazines and social media for glamorous looks, and she'd visit salons with women in her family. \nShe loved everything about that world. The multi-coloured nail painting, the make-up artists bent over women to paint smoky kohl eyeliners to frame thick brushed eyelashes on a dewy sparkling made-up face. The glossy blow-dries and swishy long hairstyles. \nEventually Afsoon fulfilled her dream of working in one of them as a successful make-up artist. There was nothing else she'd wanted. \nLike all beauty parlours in Kabul, Afsoon's salon had windows that were entirely covered with posters of glamorous and elegant women advertising a promise of beauty that could be yours inside. \nThe posters meant a passer-by in the hot, male-dominated streets of Kabul could not see inside the tranquil and multi-generational female space of Afsoon's salon. \nAt any one time there would be more than a dozen women inside, be it the stylists or the clientele - who varied from doctors to journalists, from singers and TV stars to brides prepping for their big day and teenage girls giggling with their mothers on a special bonding day out.\nBusiness was always healthy, be it weddings or simple pampering and the salon would be so busy during festivals like Eid that it would take days to book an appointment. \n\"I love women. I wanted to work and build spaces where women could be free and shine,\" Afsoon says. \"We could relax in a place away from men.\"\nBut on Sunday 15 August, the day the Taliban took control of Kabul's presidential palace, her years of hard work ended in a day. \nIt's almost midnight in Kabul and Afsoon speaks in a hushed tone down the phone to us. She's palpably afraid. She left her home that Sunday and found a safe house.\n\"Women in the beauty industry, especially people like me who were visible and public with our work are targets,\" she says.\nAfter the phone call from her friend telling her to not come in to work, Afsoon heard that any poster that represented female beauty was being painted over by scared Kabul residents. A friend of Afsoon's painted over some posters of models himself, a gesture to appease the Taliban and not attract attention to his female friends with beauty businesses. \n\"There is no way they would approve of seeing unveiled faces, or the necks of women on display,\" she says. \"They have always been very clear on their belief that a woman must not attract attention. \n\"It is the end of the beauty industry in Afghanistan.\"\nAfsoon has no invitation or paperwork that could have secured her a seat on a plane away from Kabul.\nThere is no way out for her.\nShe keeps in touch with her colleagues on a daily group chat. The last payment they received was on 24 August. No more will be coming in now. The parlour is closed and they've all accepted that they will not return to work. \nAfsoon cannot talk about the future, she says.\nWhat's next, she's not sure. She hasn't thought about how she will dress now, or even when she will venture outside. \nRight now, the colour of a future she imagined has been painted over in thick black paint, and she is in the midst of a shock that has no time limit to recovery.\n\"Staying alive is the only thing I can think about. I'm not afraid of dying - but not like this, terrified and hopeless,\" she says.\n\"Every second I feel like the Taliban will come for me.\"\nAfghanistan has been labelled one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a woman. One study suggested 87% of women in the country experience some form of domestic violence. Sodaba Haidare visited one place in the capital Kabul that offers hope to women escaping abuse.

When their profile is locked, people who aren't their friends can't download or share their profile photo or see posts on their timeline,\" Mr Gleicher tweeted.\nThe company also confirmed earlier this month that it will continue to ban Taliban content from its platforms as it considers the group to be a terrorist organisation.\n\"The Taliban is sanctioned as a terrorist organization under US law and we have banned them from our services under our Dangerous Organisation policies. This means we remove accounts maintained by or on behalf of the Taliban and prohibit praise, support, and representation of them,\" a Facebook spokesperson told the BBC.\nLast week, the World Bank halted funding for projects in Afghanistan, citing concerns over how the Taliban's takeover will affect \"the country's development prospects, especially for women\".\nThe move came just days after the International Monetary Fund suspended payments to the country."

      "text": "Unprecedented demand for film and TV production in Wales has led to a skills shortage in the industry.\nHollywood A-listers Forest Whitaker and Tom Hardy have been among the acting stars in Wales this summer as they have been filming Netflix crime drama Havoc.\nBBC fantasy drama His Dark Materials and Disney sci-fi drama War of the Worlds are also being filmed in Wales.\nBut Welsh government agency Creative Wales has said there are not enough people to work in behind-camera roles.\nIn the past 12 months, 37 television dramas and feature films have received public funding from Creative Wales which has helped a \"growing sector\".\nDeputy director Gerwyn Evans said, while the TV and film production industry in Wales was experiencing \"probably one of the busiest times it has ever had\", it needed more off-screen staff to help with productions.\n\"We know there are potential shortages in hair and make-up, shortages in production accountants, shortages in people working on the productions as well and shortages in supply chain,\" he said.\n\"It's about getting the message out to youngsters and people in Wales that this is a growing sector and there are a lot of opportunities.\n\"It doesn't just have to be on camera, it could be hair and make-up, electricians, set design.\"\nFrom Richard Burton and Sir Anthony Hopkins to Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Sheen, Wales has a history of producing superstar on-screen talent.\nNow it has become used to seeing production crews on the streets and countryside, shooting TV dramas such as Doctor Who, The Crown and Sex Education.\nMark Wahlberg's film Infinite was shot in Wales, which meant closing part of Cardiff city centre for a stunt, while Wonder Woman was also filmed in Wales a few years ago.\nNow, Creative Wales is concerned there is not enough off-screen talent to support the big productions when they get here.\nThe organisation has spent \u00a38m supporting screen projects in 2021, including 55 apprenticeships as it is trying to encourage more younger people into the business.\n\"The production sector in Wales is extremely busy at the moment - probably one of the busiest times it has ever had, which is fantastic coming out of Covid,\" added Mr Evans.\n\"But it does cause us concerns around skills and the demand for skills and the number of youngsters coming through.\"\nThe industry has expanded due to the rise in productions wanting to film in Wales but Creative Wales wants the film sector to operate all year-round.\nArwen Teagle is working as an apprentice on Disney blockbuster War of the Worlds. The 19-year-old, from Gilfach, in Caerphilly county, is a trainee camera operator at Urban Myth studios in Newport and has worked as an extra.\n\"It's really fun and everyone I work with on set is really nice,\" said Arwen, whose Creative Wales-funded apprenticeship involves setting up monitors, charging batteries and supporting other camera operators.\n\"It's just amazing. If I'd told myself I'd be working with Urban Myth on War of the Worlds, I wouldn't have believed myself.\n\"I watched the first season when it came out and it was amazing - and now I'm working on season three and it's quite a shock.\" \nChey Lewis is a production assistant on Havoc - the film starring Hardy and Oscar-winner Whitaker - written by Welsh director Gareth Evans, which will be streamed on Netflix from 2022.\n\"A usual day could involve anything the production needs, whether that's ordering equipment for different departments, doing some shopping or booking accommodation for cast and crew members,\" said the 21-year-old from Pontyclun in Rhondda Cynon Taf. \n\"It's definitely intense, and with 12-hour days sometimes, it's still not enough to get everything done. I've learnt a lot of accounting skills, purchase order and admin skills.\"\nChey is considering becoming a production coordinator and is being helped by producer Ed Talfan.\n\"We've got trainees across the whole project, whether it's in the art department, hair and make-up, costume or the office,\" he said,\n\"People tend to follow their nose. They have an idea about what they want to do in their career.\n\"We try to make sure they're in the right department for them and then they learn from those teams. Then the next time there's a new project, they're a fully-trained professional.\"\nDespite Wales' popularity as a big production destination there has been criticism of a lack of support for smaller, home-grown productions.\nFilmmaker Matt Hookings claimed in July he had to shift production of \"Prizefighter: The Life of Jem Belcher\" to Lithuania, blaming a lack of financial backing in Wales.\nCreative Wales said it was \"unfortunately\" not able to accommodate that production because of time factors. \n\"We have invested significantly in productions and it's not just big productions,\" Mr Evans said.\n\"We have supported a number of our indigenous, smaller production companies as well. It's about a balanced portfolio.\""

Where you are born should not affect your ability to survive when the drugs and know-how exist to keep you alive and well.\" \nVaccinologist Dame Sarah - who was recognised with her damehood in the Queen's Birthday Honours this year - began designing a Covid vaccine in early 2020.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is now the most widely used around the world, with doses sent to more than 170 countries.\nSpeaking after the pair received their award, Prof Green said the duke had given \"a really important message\". \n\"We didn't know that was going to happen, so suddenly Prince Harry's on stage [virtually],\" she said.\n\"And he said all of the things we wanted to say about the necessity to get vaccines to the world for people irrespective of their ability to pay.\"\nPrince Harry has previously called for fairer distribution of vaccines at a charity concert, Vax Live, in May.  \nHe and his wife Meghan were campaign chairs of the event, which raised millions of pounds for Covax, a scheme working to ensure Covid vaccines are available around the world. \nThe couple now live in the US, after stepping back from royal duties last year.

Austen? \n\"Start with Pride And Prejudice and Dickens's A Tale Of Two Cities. Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Think about Hardy. Think about Trollope.\n\"On January 4 you will tell me what you have read and I will test you on it.\"\nThe open letter, written by Hope Not Hate's chief executive Nick Lowles, stated: \"A suspended sentence and a suggested reading list of English classics for a terror conviction is unduly lenient for a crime of this nature.\n\"This sentence is sending a message that violent right-wing extremists may be treated leniently by the courts.\n\"That is a dangerous message to send when the far-right poses the fastest growing terror threat today. These sorts of lenient sentences risk encouraging other young people to access and share terrorist and extremist content because they will not fear the repercussions of their actions.\"\nA spokesman for the Attorney General's Office said: \"We have received a request for the sentence of Ben John to be considered under the unduly lenient sentence (ULS) scheme.\n\"The Law Officers have 28 days from sentencing to consider the case and make a decision.\"\nThe unduly lenient sentence scheme covers a variety of serious offences including certain types of hate crime and some terrorism-related offences. \nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Greece",
      "text": "Mikis Theodorakis, the celebrated composer best known for the music from the 1964 film Zorba the Greek, has died in Athens aged 96.\nTheodorakis was in the resistance to the Nazi occupation of Greece in World War Two and later served as an MP. \nHe was also a leading figure opposing military rule in Greece from 1967-1974.\nZorba the Greek told the story of an English writer in Crete whose life is transformed when he meets Alexis Zorba, a gregarious peasant. \nThe scene when Zorba dances barefoot on the beach became a popular image of Greek culture. The theme from the film, which won three Oscars, remains probably the most famous piece of Greek music more than half a century later.\n\"Today we lost a part of the soul of Greece,\" Culture Minister Lina Mendoni wrote on Twitter, calling him \"the one who made all Greeks sing poetry\". \nTheodorakis also wrote the film music for Serpico (1973) and a song cycle called the Mauthausen Trilogy, with lyrics based on poems of a concentration camp survivor. \nThe song Antonis from that work became popular with Afghans. It was sung by the residents of Kabul in 2001 who greeted troops of the Northern Alliance as they entered the city and expelled the Taliban.\nThe same song was the theme of the 1969 film Z, whose soundtrack won a Bafta Award for Best Film Music in 1970. The film, directed by Costa-Gavras, is a thinly fictionalised account of the assassination of a left-wing Greek politician. \nTheodorakis himself was for much of his life a leftist and at times a communist. In 1947, during the civil war that followed World War Two, he was arrested and tortured. \nThe BBC's Kostas Kallergis says Theodorakis expressed the will to fight against fascism and the sense of liberty Greeks felt after the fall of the military junta in 1974. \nTheodorakis's songs were always deeply political. He was repeatedly jailed for his beliefs and was sent into exile within Greece. \nHe remained politically active throughout his life. \nIn the 2010s he joined protests against austerity, calling for reparations from Germany for the wartime occupation. He also spoke out against the deal ending the 27-year dispute over the name of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, now North Macedonia. \nHe leaned towards the right at the end of the 1980s and even served as a minister in a right-wing government, but he was always an iconic figure for all Greeks, both leftists and conservatives, Kostas Kallergis says.

      "text": "If Covid rates keep rising, it could be a \"very difficult autumn and winter\" for the Welsh NHS, a doctor has warned.\nKelechi Nnoaham, director of public health at Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, said everything must be done to \"bend that trajectory\".\nHe said although hospital admissions were lower due to vaccinations, the current trend in cases was worrying.\nEven so, on Wednesday, there were 67 Covid patients in its hospitals - the highest since mid-February.\nOn Thursday, it also said three wards at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant had been temporarily closed to visitors because of rising cases. \nThe health board covers Bridgend, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr Tydfil, with about 451,000 people living in it.\nHywel Dda health board, which covers Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion, has taken some temporary measures to help it deal with \"an extremely challenging, ongoing pandemic\".\nThese include temporarily suspending elective orthopaedic surgery at Prince Philip Hospital in Llanelli and Withybush General Hospital, Haverfordwest, to provide more bed capacity in non-Covid areas.\nAdmissions and visiting to one ward at Glangwili General Hospital, Carmarthen, have also been stopped temporarily to manage a Covid-19 outbreak, with additional precautions being taken at two other wards. \n\"The rise in cases in Hywel Dda shows that, whilst hospital admissions are not as high as in previous waves, Covid-19 remains a serious risk to our health and our health service,\" said chief executive Steve Moore.\nThis comes after a critical care consultant said hospital staff felt \"demoralised\" to see the virus filling wards and intensive care units again.\nDr Ami Jones, who works at the Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran, Torfaen, believes misinformation has led to growing numbers of young, unvaccinated Covid patients in hospitals\nAcross Wales, the daily average of patients in hospital either with Covid or recovering from it was 383 on Wednesday, compared to 263 last week.\nOf these, 44 people are in critical care or on ventilation - up from 33 - there were about 70 at this point in the second wave.\nProf Nnoaham said: \"We recognise that, while the rates of hospital admission have not become very, very high, they are nonetheless increasing.\"\nHe said an audit of recently admitted Covid patients showed the majority were over 60, but a higher proportion of younger patients had been admitted with Covid compared with earlier waves.\n\"We did a deep dive on about 58 patients in recent days and weeks who have come into hospital as Covid patients, and we understand the profile much better.\n\"When you look at the numbers of young people in that cohort and compare it to the proportion of young people in any cohort of admitted patients during the first and second wave, it is higher this time.\n\"That is reflective of the fact that if you look at the age group that has the highest rates of infection now in Cwm Taf Morgannwg it is the people between the ages of 10 and 19, where the seven-day accumulative rates of infection are well over 800 cases per 100,000 people now.\"\nProf Nnoaham said schools would need to \"de-risk\" ahead of reopening to students, at a time when Covid rates among students were high.\n\"Covid is still with us, it is circulating massively in 10 to 19-year-olds - many of whom are going back to school from this week.\"\nHe said schools would need to have updated their risk assessments \"and identified where the biggest risks of transmission of Covid may be for students who are returning to school\".\nWelsh government guidelines are still that people should continue to take lateral flow tests, even if they do not have symptoms, because one in three patients with Covid are asymptomatic.\n\"For the schools, it means basic measures based on your risk assessment - like making sure that there is proper ventilation,\" he said.\n\"For some it may mean continued use of face masks in indoor classroom settings, and for some others it may mean just making sure that social distancing is happening as much as possible in places that are ordinarily likely to be crowded."

      "text": "Many businesses have been complaining about the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, which is still causing serious supply chain problems. \nThe coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes have all contributed to a lack of qualified drivers. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortfall of about 100,000 workers.\nThe BBC spoke to some people working for smaller operators to find out what is it like to be a heavy goods vehicle (HGV) driver in the industry.\nTom Reddy has been driving lorries for more than 15 years and his pay was recently increased from \u00a317.50 an hour to \u00a324.50 - a 40% jump. \n\"I've never known anything like it,\" he told the BBC's Wake Up To Money programme. \"But they could pay me \u00a380,000 a year and it wouldn't be enough, I want to leave.\"\nMr Reddy says it is difficult to have a family life with the unsociable hours the job demands. \nWhile Brexit is a factor, it is the shifts, regularly sleeping in a lay-by and the rude way in which members of the public talk to him that make him no longer want to continue in the job. \nHe also blames gender imbalance in the workplace, as well as racism and xenophobia on the road for his decision to leave.\nWhile he welcomes recent moves by the industry to give more attention to the mental health of drivers, this isn't enough for Mr Reddy.\nHowever he thinks it can be difficult for some people to leave the profession: \"For many of us, it is hard to get out of, because it doesn't give you the skills other employers want, even though it is a highly skilled job.\" \nSam Waine works as a delivery driver for automobile parts distributor Euro Car Parts, but she is now looking to make a switch to driving HGVs for a new challenge.\n\"I enjoy the quietness, you can do what you like as long as you get the job done - and you feel a bit more free.\"\nHaving previously worked as a care assistant, she doesn't have a problem with the long shifts.\nEven so, the process has not been without its challenges.\nShe initially applied for her licence in early January. Her provisional licence took a month to arrive, but had to be sent back after mistakes were made with the category she was awarded. \nAnd few theory and practical tests were available during the pandemic.\nNow desperate to get behind the wheel, Ms Waine says: \"It's very frustrating at the moment - I can't risk getting a full-time job and having to quit a few weeks or months later.\n\"I know a lot of companies need help and obviously we need a job. It's not our fault - we're just waiting.\"\nNick Downing, an HGV owner and driver, has been in the role for 43 years and seen how the industry and working conditions have changed over time.\nWhen he started out in the late 1970s, parking overnight and using free facilities in towns like public bathrooms was quite common. He says most have now closed, leaving few options available when driving in the UK.\n\"On the Continent, their facilities are a lot better than our own and I think that's a lot of the reason why the younger generation are not coming into the job.\"\nHe says that conditions \"get worse every week\" and people are often not very understanding.\n\"People don't want you parking in their back gardens or parking in lay-bys, and we don't want to either, to be honest,\" he adds.\n\"We're away five or six nights a week. We just want to feel secure and have facilities with a toilet and shower block. I don't think that's a lot to ask in the 21st century.\"\nHe says that the time taken to find somewhere suitable to park at night can have a knock-on effect, delaying deliveries and resulting in lost revenues the next day.\nDue to his experiences, Mr Downing says he cannot recommend his profession to young people.\n\"It's a sad thing to say, but I don't think you should. Maybe pay a bit more attention at school, instead of kicking a ball about like I did.\""

We know that the brewers are trying to resolve the issue.\"\nMolson Coors, which owns Carling and Coors, said: \"Like many in our great British brewing and pub sector, we have been hit by the HGV driver shortage.\n\"While overall our availability is good, there are intermittent pockets of pressure in our supply network that are unfortunately affecting a number of Wetherspoons pubs.\n\"After such a difficult period for our industry, it's heart breaking to be letting any customer down and we will continue to do everything in our power to get our much-loved brands back on every Wetherspoons bar,\" it said.\nWetherspoons said its problems had been caused by planned industrial action by Heineken drivers working for GXO Logistics. The Unite union said no industrial action had taken place.\nHeineken said: \"We're working tirelessly to find solutions to delivery issues caused by considerable disruption in the haulage and logistics market.\n\"Pubs won't run dry - if your favourite pint isn't immediately available, there will be a tasty alternative to try.\"\nThe logistics industry has said that driver shortages across the UK are due to a combination of Covid and Brexit.\nOn Wednesday Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin, a prominent supporter of Brexit, was taken to task by some critics on Twitter.\nSinger Billy Bragg wrote: \"Here's a lament for Tim Martin, whose Wetherspoons chain is struggling with the realities of the Brexit for which he campaigned so loudly.\"\nTwitter user Pearl Noir wrote: \"So how's Brexit working out for you so far Tim?\"\nThe UK is short of about 100,000 drivers, according to the Road Haulage Association, with new recruits to the industry facing problems getting driving tests due a Covid-related backlog.\nIn addition, when the pandemic struck last year, many European drivers went home, with few returning, according to hauliers.\nNow the UK has left the EU, it is no longer part of the single market, so it is easier for European drivers to find work in the EU.\nForeign drivers also now need visas and the Home Office is not keen on allowing lorry drivers on to a list of shortage occupations.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng this week rejected calls to loosen immigration rules, saying it would be a \"short-term temporary solution\" and that firms should employ UK workers, especially those facing an \"uncertain future\" when the furlough scheme ends next month.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We're working closely with industry to address sector challenges, which are similarly being faced by other countries around the world. \n\"This includes plans to streamline the process for new drivers to gain their HGV licence and to increase the number of driving tests able to be conducted. \n\"We want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce and make employment more attractive through offering training, careers options and wage increases.\"\nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC) said that retailers were doing all they could to avoid any possible disruption to supplies before Christmas.\n\"Government must address the HGV driver shortage by rapidly increasing the number of HGV driving tests taking place, providing visas for EU drivers, and looking for a longer-term solution,\" said Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC."

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,United States Army,Taliban,US-Taliban peace talks,United States",
      "text": "After 20 years of war, the Taliban has swept to victory in Afghanistan.\nThe group completed their shockingly rapid advance across the country by capturing Kabul on 15 August.\nIt came after foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan following a deal between the US and the Taliban, two decades after US forces removed the militants from power in 2001.\nThe conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions.\nTaliban forces have pledged not to allow Afghanistan to become a base for terrorists who could threaten the West.\nBut questions are already being asked about how the group will govern the country, and what their rule means for women, human rights, and political freedoms.\nBack in 2001, the US was responding to the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, in which nearly 3,000 people were killed. Officials identified Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, and its leader Osama Bin Laden, as responsible. \nBin Laden was in Afghanistan, under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamists who had been in power since 1996.\nWhen they refused to hand him over, the US intervened militarily, quickly removing the Taliban and vowing to support democracy and eliminate the terrorist threat.\nThe militants slipped away and later regrouped.\nNato allies had joined the US and a new Afghan government took over in 2004 but deadly Taliban attacks continued. President Barack Obama's \"troop surge\" in 2009 helped push back the Taliban but it was not long term.\nIn 2014, at the end of what was the bloodiest year since 2001, Nato's international forces ended their combat mission, leaving responsibility for security to the Afghan army.\nThat gave the Taliban momentum and they seized more territory. \nPeace talks between the US and the Taliban started tentatively, with the Afghan government pretty much uninvolved, and the agreement on a withdrawal came in February 2020 in Qatar.\nThe US-Taliban deal did not stop the Taliban attacks - they switched their focus instead to Afghan security forces and civilians, and targeted assassinations. Their areas of control grew.\nThey emerged in the civil war that followed the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, predominantly in the south-west and the Pakistan border areas.\nThey vowed to fight corruption and improve security, but also followed an austere form of Islam.\nBy 1998, they had taken control of almost all of the country. \nThey enforced their own hardline version of Sharia, or Islamic law, and introduced brutal punishments. Men were made to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka. TV, music and cinema were banned.\nAfter their overthrow they regrouped in Pakistani border areas.\nIn terms of lives lost, it is obviously not easy to say exactly. The number of coalition casualties is much better recorded than Taliban and Afghan civilians.\nResearch by Brown University estimates losses in the Afghan security forces at 69,000. It puts the number of civilians and militants killed at about 51,000 each.\nMore than 3,500 coalition soldiers have died since 2001 - about two-thirds of them Americans. More than 20,000 US soldiers have been injured.\nAccording to the UN, Afghanistan has the third-largest displaced population in the world. \nSince 2012, some five million people have fled and not been able to return home, either displaced within Afghanistan or taking refuge in neighbouring countries. \nBrown University research also puts the US spending on the conflict - including military and reconstruction funds in both Afghanistan and Pakistan - at $978bn (\u00a3706bn) up to 2020.\nHow the Taliban plan to govern Afghanistan remains unclear.\nWomen face an uncertain future. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen says the group will respect the rights of women and minorities \"as per Afghan norms and Islamic values\".\nThe militants had declared an amnesty across Afghanistan and said it wanted women to join its government.\nBut there are fears over women's freedom to work, to dress as they choose, or even to leave home alone under Taliban rule. \nAnother major fear is that the country will once again become a training ground for terrorism.\nTaliban officials insist that they will fully adhere to the US deal and prevent any group from using Afghan soil as a base for attacks against the US and its allies.\nThey say they aim only to implement an \"Islamic government\" and will not pose a threat to any other country.\nBut many analysts say the Taliban and al-Qaeda are inseparable, with the latter's fighters heavily embedded and engaged in training activity.\nIt is also important to remember that the Taliban are not a centralised and unified force. Some leaders may want to keep the West muted by not stirring up trouble but hardliners may be reluctant to break links with al-Qaeda.\nJust how powerful al-Qaeda is and whether it could now rebuild its global network is also unclear.\nThen there is the regional branch of the Islamic State group - ISKP (Khorasan Province) - which the Taliban oppose.\nLike al-Qaeda, ISKP has been degraded by the US and Nato but could use the post-withdrawal period to regroup.\nIts fighter numbers could be only between a few hundred and 2,000 but it may try to gain footholds in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and parts of Tajikistan, which could be a serious regional concern.

      "tags": "Floods,New Jersey,New York City,Severe weather",
      "text": "At least nine people have died after flash flooding and tornadoes hit the north-eastern US, local media report.\nSome people were trapped in flooded basements of their homes, while one body was found in a vehicle that was swept away.\nThe governors of New York and New Jersey declared a state of emergency, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called it a \"historic weather event\".\nAt least 3in (8cm) of rain fell in just one hour in New York's Central Park.\nAlmost all New York City subway lines have been closed, and non-emergency vehicles banned from roads. Many flights and trains out of New York and New Jersey have been suspended.\nThe mayor of the city of Passaic in New Jersey, Hector Lora, told CNN the body of a man in his 70s had been recovered from a vehicle that had been swept away in the floods.\nNBC New York has reported that at least one more person died in New Jersey. NBC and AFP reported that seven people had died in New York City, some after becoming trapped in their basements.\nA two-year-old boy was among the victims in New York City.\nFootage on social media showed water pouring into subway stations and people's homes, and flooded roads.\nNew York resident George Bailey told the BBC: \"Right in the middle of dinner I hear gurgling, and the water's coming up out of the shower drain in our bathroom.\n\"I went to check the main water line in the utility room, and by the time I walked back into the living room there was nearly a foot of water. It was incredible how fast it came through.\"\nThe US National Weather Service declared a flood emergency in New York City, Brooklyn, Queens and parts of Long Island, and issued tornado warnings for parts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\nA flood emergency, as opposed to a warning, is issued in \"exceedingly rare situations when a severe threat to human life and catastrophic damage from a flash flood is happening or will happen soon\", the NWS said.\nBBC's Laura Trevelyan in New Jersey\nAt 20:00 (01:00 BST Thursday) on Wednesday night, torrential rain began to fall as the Amtrak train I regularly get between Washington and New York approached New Jersey.\nSuddenly, my phone lit up with flash flooding alerts, and the rainfall intensified, vast sheets of water hammering the side of the train.\n\"It's like a car wash,\" said the cafe car attendant as we stopped at Metropark station. Soon came the announcement of flooding on the tracks ahead of us, making it impossible to reach New York.\nPassengers scrolled social media, swapping tales of flooding at Newark airport in New Jersey and streets underwater in Brooklyn. \nI called my husband at 01:00 and told him I was stuck. \"There is no alternate transportation,\" read a sign at Metropark station. The roads around us were flooded, there was no way out, so I settled in for the night.\nAt 02:00 came the announcement that our train was going back to Washington. I changed trains to one bound for New York - which still hadn't left as of 06:15. My husband is driving to get me, though he says many roads are closed. \nThis is the new world of extreme weather - severe, exacerbated by climate change.\nThe extreme weather has been caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Ida, which caused widespread devastation in southern Louisiana earlier this week.\nMany factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\nThe remnants of Hurricane Ida have been pushing north across the east of the country, having hit Louisiana as a Category 4 hurricane on Sunday.\nHundreds of thousands of homes in Louisiana remain without power and New Orleans is under a night-time curfew. \nTwo people died when a motorway in Mississippi collapsed, while two others died in Louisiana - one in flash flooding, and another who was hit by a falling tree. Two electrical workers in Alabama were killed while they were repairing damage caused by the hurricane.\nSome small towns in Louisiana were all-but destroyed. Tim Kerner, mayor of Jean Lafitte - about 20 miles (32 km) south of New Orleans - said the town had suffered \"catastrophic\" flooding. One estimate suggested 90% of homes had suffered serious damage.\nMore than 400 people had chosen to stay in the town ahead of the storm, and dozens needed to be rescued from attics and rooftops, the local police chief said.\nGalliano, on the Gulf Coast, was also badly hit, and the roof of the Lady of the Sea Hospital in the town was blown off by the heavy winds.\nAre you in New York?

      "tags": "Pakistan,Asia,India,Kashmir",
      "text": "Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani has died at his home in Srinagar at the age of 92. \nHe passed away after a lengthy illness.\nA veteran campaigner against Indian rule, he had been under house arrest for much of the past 11 years.\nIndian authorities have imposed a strict security clampdown in Srinagar, Kashmir's main city, placing barbed wire and barricades on the roads near Geelani's home.\nReports say that internet services and voice calling have been suspended in most areas and a curfew may follow. His burial took place in the early hours of Thursday.\nSuch measures are not unusual at moments of tension in Indian-administered Kashmir. Police typically describe them as precautionary, citing the need to stop online rumours fuelling potential violence.\nIndia and Pakistan control different parts of the Muslim-majority territory, but both say it is wholly theirs. There has been violence on the Indian-run side for 30 years, due to a separatist insurgency.\nGeelani was a divisive figure in India. Experts said he always talked about Kashmir's freedom but personally favoured the region's merger with Pakistan. \nTributes have come from Kashmiri leaders in India and also from Pakistani politicians.\nMehbooba Mufti, former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, said she was \"saddened\" by his death.\nWriting on Twitter, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan called Geelani a \"freedom fighter\" and declared Thursday a day of official mourning.\nHe said the separatist leader had \"struggled all his life for his people & their right to self-determination\".\nPolice in Kashmir allowed only close relatives to attend Geelani's funeral. \nAnnouncements were made from loudspeakers at the main mosque near Geelani's home after his death, asking local people to march towards it.\nHowever, Indian troops and armoured vehicles are said to be on the streets and police have urged residents to stay indoors.\nGeelani was a legislator for more than 15 years, representing Jamaat-i-Islami - a major political-religious organisation in Indian Kashmir, which was banned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in 2019.\nHe spent long spells in prison, including nearly 10 years after 1962, shortly after he began campaigning for Kashmir to merge with Pakistan.\nGeelani led a faction of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella group of almost two dozen separatist parties - but walked out in 2020, accusing others of \"revolting against his leadership\".  \nHe was known for his strong opposition to any kind of dialogue with India. He insisted that a plebiscite on whether Kashmir should remain under Indian rule should be held before talks could take place.\nThis often put him in conflict with younger colleagues, who were more open to holding talks with Indian leaders.\nIn 2020, Geelani was awarded the Nishan-e-Pakistan, Pakistan's highest civilian honour."

      "text": "Scotland has had its fourth hottest summer on record, according to provisional figures released by the Met Office.\nThe city of Glasgow, which will host the COP26 climate change conference, had its hottest ever summer since records began in 1884.\nThe Met Office said it was unusual for the UK's highest August temperature to come from Scotland.\nA high of 27.2C was recorded at Tyndrum, near Stirling, on 25 August.\nMost of the UK recorded lower than average rainfall, with the exception of Northern Ireland and parts of eastern Scotland, according to the Met Office figures.\nDr Mark McCarthy, head of the Met Office's National Climate Information Centre, said: \"Summer 2021 will be remembered very differently depending on where you are in the UK, with record-breaking warm conditions in parts of western Scotland and Northern Ireland, while in the south and east it's been much duller and wetter.\"\nEarlier this week, Scottish Water urged customers to help conserve supplies after levels at some reservoirs dropped to their lowest in 18 years.\nThe company said some parts of Scotland were experiencing their second driest summer in 160 years.\nIt said demand remained high at up to 100 million litres per day higher than average, after falling from a spike in demand during hot weather in July.\nThat month more than 30 water tankers were needed to supplement supplies. People watering plants and filling paddling pools pushed the demand for water by 200 million litres extra a day for about a week.\nAlso in July, Loch Ness dropped to its lowest level in five years, according to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa). Loch Ness is Scotland's largest freshwater loch by volume.\nSepa said drier than usual conditions in recent months were likely to be a \"significant contributing factor\" for the drop."

      "tags": "NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Services may have to be cut unless NHS England receives an extra \u00a310bn in funding next year, groups representing the health service have warned. \nThe NHS Confederation and NHS Providers said the money was needed to cover pandemic-related costs and reduce the backlog in operations and treatments. \nThey warned that patients could be put at risk without more funding. \nThe government said it had already provided additional money to tackle backlogs. \nThe organisations are concerned a three-year government spending review for England, some of which could be announced next week, will fall well short of what the NHS needs. \nThe extra \u00a310bn to run day-to-day services would be on top of the \u00a3140bn budget already planned. \nJust under half would cover extra costs associated with Covid and much of the rest would be allocated to tackling waiting lists for non-urgent operations and mental health. \nWaiting lists have hit record levels during the pandemic, with more than 5.45 million people waiting for NHS hospital treatment in England.\nBut the NHS Confederation and NHS Providers warned waiting lists could more than double if budgets increased by less than \u00a310bn. \nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other NHS trusts in England, said the government \"must fully recognise the extent, length and cost of the impact of Covid-19 on the NHS\". \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that when the NHS was given funding \"we deliver in spades\" - pointing to the Covid vaccine rollout as an example - but he warned that without additional cash the waiting list backlog could increase to 13 million people.\nThe NHS budget is already increasing. A five-year settlement will see the funding increase by \u00a333bn by 2023-24.\nBut, of course, Covid has added to costs in a way that could not have been envisaged when the May government agreed the settlement three years ago.\nNHS leaders say the pandemic has led to the sort of pressures that have never been seen in the history of the health service.\nThe layouts of hospitals have had to be overhauled, services have had to be moved off site and homed in new buildings, extra infection control procedures have been brought in and the scale of sickness being seen mean extra staff are needed to care for patients.\nAt the same time, there is a growing backlog of traditional care, such as hip and knee operations. \nSo it means next year instead of the NHS budget growing by \u00a34bn under the existing settlement, NHS leaders want close to an extra \u00a315bn.\nAnd that extra money may need to stay in the budget for the following year depending on what is happening with Covid.\nMatthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said trust leaders were worried that without the extra funding \"they won't be able to provide prompt, high quality, safe care to all who need it\". \nIn a joint statement, the two leaders said that \"health outcomes for millions of patients\" in the next three years are dependent on the \"crucial\" spending review decision.\n\"Patients genuinely are at peril,\" they added. \nA government statement said: \"We are committed to making sure the NHS has everything it needs to continue providing excellent care to the public as we tackle the backlogs that have built up during the pandemic.\n\"This year alone we have already provided a further \u00a329bn to support health and care services, including an extra \u00a31bn to tackle the backlog. This is on top of our historic settlement for the NHS in 2018, which will see its budget rise by \u00a333.9bn by 2023-24.\" "

      "text": "Pop legends Abba have surprised and delighted fans by announcing their first studio album for 40 years.\nAbba Voyage will be released in November, before a \"revolutionary\" set of concerts where virtual avatars will play hits like Mamma Mia and Waterloo.\nThe quartet, who split up in 1982, said they ended up back in the recording studio while working on the stage show.\n\"At first it was just two songs, and then we said, 'Well, maybe we should do a few others,'\" said Benny Andersson.\nIn the end, they recorded 10 tracks - two of which were premiered during a globally-streamed press conference on Thursday.\nThe first, I Still Have Faith In You, is an affectionate piano ballad portraying the bond the four band members share.\n\"When Benny played the melody, I just knew it had to be about us,\" said Bjorn Ulvaeus, explaining the song's origins.\n\"It's about realising that it's inconceivable to be where we are. No imagination could dream up that, to release an album after 40 years and still be the best of friends, and still be enjoying each other's company, and have a total loyalty. \n\"Who has experienced that? Nobody.\"\nThe second track, Don't Shut Me Down, is a mini-melodrama in the vein of the Abba classic The Day Before You Came, where a woman returns to her partner years after walking out.\n\"You asked me not to leave, well here I am again - and I love you still,\" sing Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad in their trademark stacked harmonies. \nBoth songs will feature on Abba Voyage when it is released on 5 November, with an eye on the lucrative Christmas market. The record will even include \"a little Christmas tune\", said Benny, as well as \"a number of pop songs\".\nHe added: \"I think it's pretty good. We've done as good as we could, at our age.\"\nThe reunion had, for many years, seemed unlikely. The band reportedly turned down $1bn to tour in 2000.\nIn an interview with the BBC in 2013, Agnetha said she preferred to leave Abba in the past. \"It was such a long time ago, and we are getting older, and we have our different lives,\" she explained.\nIn a statement accompanying Thursday's announcement, the singer said she \"had no idea what to expect\" when they finally reconvened in 2018.\n\"But Benny's recording studio is such a friendly and safe environment, and before I knew it I was really enjoying myself!\"\n\"It was so joyful to be together in the studio again, the four of us, and hearing Frida and Agnetha going for it again,\" added Benny. \nBut the pianist confessed to having nerves ahead of the initial recording session. \n\"Five minutes before they came into the studio, I was thinking, 'I should have asked if they can still sing,'\" he said. \"But they could and they can and you will hear it when you listen to the records.\"\nHowever, neither singer attended the press launch in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. \n\"They should have been here,\" said Bjorn, half-joking, \"but they don't enjoy this [publicity] as much as Benny does.\"\nThe band's new songs will also be played during the band's virtual concert, also titled Abba Voyage, which will open next year in a specially-built arena in east London.\nPlaying six nights a week, it will feature digital versions of Abba's band members, accompanied by a 10-piece live band performing 22 of their greatest hits. Tickets go on sale on 7 September, starting at \u00a321, with the opening night on 27 May.\nThe so-called \"Abba-tars\" were designed by Industrial Light and Magic - the visual effects company founded by Star Wars creator George Lucas.\nMore than 850 people worked on recreating Abba \"in their prime\" using motion capture technology to scan \"every mannerism and every motion\" of the musicians, who are now in their 70s, as they performed.\n\"Agnetha, Frida, Benny and Bjorn got on stage in front of 160 cameras and almost as many VFX geniuses, and they performed every song in this show, to perfection, over five weeks,\" explained producer Ludvig Andersson. \n\"So when you see this show, it is not four people pretending to Abba, it is actually them.\"\nBjorn said the band had chosen London to premiere the show because \"London is the best city to be in when it comes to entertainment, theatre, musicals\u2026 We have always felt that the Brits see us as their own.\"\nAsked what he enjoyed most about being in Abba, Benny replied with refreshing honesty: \"Not having to worry about the money\". \n\"It's been a good thing for all of us,\" he continued. \"You are free to do anything. I just keep on writing music.\"\nHere we are in 2021 with the first new Abba material since ET came out and, I'm happy to report, they haven't messed it up.\nWe join Abba not as the pant-suited disco voyeurs of Voulez-Vous and Dancing Queen, but as they are now - in their 70s, reminiscing about their lives, and looking back at the music they made in their prime.\nThe lead track, I Still Have Faith In You, is an ode to their friendship and to the bonds that have matured and survived despite divorce and heartbreak. \nStarting gently, it builds to an astronomical climax, full of power chords and dazzling harmonies, as the quartet declare: \"Through joy and the sorrow, we have a story and it survived.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Eight US states will accept driver's licences and other state IDs stored on an iPhone, Apple has announced. \nThe feature, first announced at a presentation in June, lets iPhone users store IDs in the Wallet app. \nSome had expressed privacy concerns about handing over smartphones to police or security officials. \nApple now says users do not need to unlock or hand over their phones for the system to work for airport security. \nBut it remains unclear if or how it might eventually work for other uses of ID, such as drivers stopped by police. \nArizona, and Georgia will introduce the system first, with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah also signed up. \nThe \"first locations\" to use the system will be airport security checkpoints run by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Apple says.\nAmericans usually need some form of state ID only to travel by air domestically, unlike other countries, in which a passport is widely used.\nTapping a phone at an identity reader at supported airports will prompt passengers to use their Face ID or fingerprint to authorise sending information to the machine.\n\"Users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device to present their ID,\" Apple said. \nTSA administrator David Pekoske said the new system \"will enable a more seamless airport security screening experience\".\nApple's announcement also stressed other security features of its new app, \"offering superior security and privacy over a physical wallet\". \nNeither Apple nor state authorities would know when or where ID was presented, it said, and all personal information was encrypted.   \nBut the concept of digital IDs remains controversial. \nCovid passports, which emerged over the past year, were initially met with some resistance by privacy campaigners.\nAnd digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation has said digital IDs \"might be a big step towards national identification, in which every time we walk through a door or buy coffee, a record of the event is collected and aggregated\".\nIt was \"troubled\" by the mobile-driver-licence technology, which could \"make demands for ID more frequent in American life\", the group said.\n\"They may also lead to the routine use of automated or 'robot' ID checks carried out not by humans but by machines, causing such demands to proliferate even more,\" the group added."

      "text": "The government is not confident that it knows how many people eligible to come to the UK remain in Afghanistan, Dominic Raab says.\nAround 15,000 have been evacuated since the country fell to the Taliban. \nAddressing MPs, the foreign secretary said he would be leaving for the region later for talks on those left behind.\nHe also said that the UK was \"caught out\" by the speed of the fall of Kabul, with intelligence expecting it to hold until the end of the year. \nBut the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Tom Tugendhat, said a Foreign Office risk report from 22 July predicted a \"very real danger of cities collapsing\" after US forces withdrew.\nThe Tory MP later told BBC Radio 5 Live that he was \"a bit surprised\" that Mr Raab did not seem to know about the document. \nThe Foreign Office said it was a standard monthly report which did not contain intelligence assessments.\nMr Raab was grilled by the committee's MPs on a number of aspects of the UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan last month.\nSince the Taliban took control of the country in August, the foreign secretary has faced scrutiny over his handling of the situation.\nThere were calls for him to resign from opposition MPs after it emerged he had been unavailable to make a phone call about evacuating interpreters from Afghanistan while he was on holiday in Crete.\nMr Raab later said that \"with hindsight\" he would not have gone away, but dismissed accusations that he was \"lounging on the beach\" as \"nonsense\".\nThe committee asked him for more specific dates for his holiday, but he refused to answer, saying the line of questioning was a \"fishing expedition\".\nThe last UK plane evacuating people from Afghanistan took off on Saturday, with the US following on days later to stick to the 31 August deadline declared by US President Joe Biden. \nBoris Johnson said the \"overwhelming majority\" of those eligible to come to the UK, such as UK nationals and Afghans working with the British, had been flown out.\nBut Mr Raab said he could still not give precise numbers. \nPushed by the committee on the number of UK nationals still in the country after the final flight, the foreign secretary said he believed it was in the \"low hundreds\".\nHe also said the UK had flown out a number of people at risk, including 287 journalists, 65 women's rights activists and nine judges. \nBut, while he stood by what the prime minister had said, Mr Raab was \"not confident with precision to be able to give you a set number\" of those who were eligible to come to the UK, but had not made it on to evacuation flights.\nThese groups include Afghan nationals and their families who worked with British forces during their time in the country and asylum seekers who could be eligible to come to the UK under international law. \nMr Raab also admitted that some of the people left behind included guards who had secured the British embassy in Kabul, after buses sent to pick them up and take them to the airport were not let through. \nAnalysis by Ione Wells, BBC political correspondent\nThe foreign secretary appeared to bristle at some of the questions thrown at him by MPs.\nMPs were frustrated by a lack of detail from Dominic Raab on key questions, like the specific number of people eligible for evacuation who had been left behind.\nMr Raab appeared equally irritated by questions on when exactly he went on holiday - refusing to provide any precise dates.\nHe had a heated exchange too with Labour's Neil Coyle, who accused him of refusing to answer questions as they proceeded to speak over one another.\nThe MPs are unlikely to leave the session satisfied with the answers they got, with chair of the Committee, Tom Tugendhat, wrapping up by accusing Mr Raab of fire-fighting.\nCertainly, as Parliament returns next week, questions for Mr Raab on key issues like how many people are left behind, how the government plans to get them out, and why ministers were taken by surprise by the speed of the Taliban's takeover will not go away until concrete answers are provided.\nHe faced more questions about the embassy, including around reports from the Times that documents identifying Afghan workers and job applicants were found after the building was abandoned.\nThe foreign secretary said he had ordered a \"full review\" of the embassy's closure as a result of the story, but said all the names that the newspaper passed on to the government were now safely in the UK. \nMr Raab was also pressed on reports that a portrait of the Queen had been left behind in the building, which the Taliban now had in its possession.\nHe told the Committee he had ordered anything linked to the government to be \"destroyed\" to stop an \"attempted propaganda coup\" by the Taliban. \nAnd Mr Raab was also pushed over intelligence assessments in the run up to Kabul falling. \nHe revealed the information he had been given predicted a \"steady deterioration\" in the country, rather than the swift fall that happened, and that it was thought unlikely that Kabul would be taken by the Taliban before the end of the year.\nBut he said the UK had been making contingency plans since June to be able to react if the situation moved faster. \nAsked by Tory MP Bob Seely whether the government had been \"caught on the hop\" because of an \"intelligence failure\", Mr Raab replied: \"We've got a very professional way of approaching these things but when they're wrong... you need to look at how you correct that.\" \nBut the foreign secretary seemed unaware of a risk report from his own department.\nMr Tugendhat read from the report dated 22 July that said: \"Peace talks have stalled. The US/Nato withdrawal is resulting in rapid Taliban advances. \n\"This could lead to fall of cities, collapse of security forces, Taliban return to power, mass displacement and significant humanitarian need. The embassy may need to close if security deteriorates.\"\nMr Raab asked: \"I'm sorry, [what's] the source of that?\"\nThe chair replied: \"It's your principal risk report.\" \nAn FCDO spokesperson said later after the hearing: \"The principal risk register is a standard monthly report for the management board which does not contain intelligence assessments.\n\"It is an internal document which sets out potential risks to the organisation for planning purposes including around duty of care to staff.\"\nShe added: \"It is simply wrong and misleading to suggest this document is in any way at odds with our detailed assessments of the situation in Afghanistan or our public position throughout the crisis.\n\"The July document makes clear that our central planning assumption at the time was that the peace process in Afghanistan would run for up to a further six months.\"\nThe foreign secretary told the MPs that the \"central assessment remained until late that the deterioration would be incremental\", but the government had continued to make contingency plans for a \"more rapid deterioration\". \nShadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy called her government counterpart's appearance \"a staggeringly poor showing\", saying he was \"out of his depth\". \nShe said Mr Raab was \"unprepared for hard questions, unwilling to admit mistakes, unable to answer basic questions about how many British nationals have been left behind. \n\"Unsure who he had spoken to, about what or when. Unable to offer any advice to those still in danger in Afghanistan.\"\nMs Nandy added: \"Britain is now weaker in the world and faces greater threats to our national security. Nobody could watch today's session and conclude we have a government capable of rising to the challenge.\""

      "tags": "Schools,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Gavin Williamson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Schools are not \"drivers\" or \"hubs\" of Covid infection, Public Health England's medical director has said.\nDr Yvonne Doyle said she understood parents' nervousness about schools returning after the summer in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nShe stressed that lots of measures to cut Covid spread remained in place.\nBut Prof Calum Semple, a government scientific adviser, said with most adults vaccinated, schools were likely to be a \"greater part of the problem\". \nSome have suggested a surge in cases in Scotland, where pupils returned in August, could be linked to schools.\nFewer measures are in place in schools than during last term, with bubbles and masks no longer in use in England and Wales, while Northern Ireland has also scrapped social distancing requirements. \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Breakfast it was right for children to have a \"much more normal education experience\", with adults being able to go back to the pub, music festivals and theatres.\nHe said there needed to be a \"sensible balance\" and that was why mass testing of secondary school pupils was taking place.\nDr Doyle said there were lots of regimes in place already to prevent the spread, including extra cleaning, advice on ventilation and testing.\nShe said: \"We understand, and I understand fully, that parents may be nervous but I would stress again that schools are not the drivers and not the hubs of infection.\"\nShe added that PHE attributed some of the school-related coronavirus figures to the testing regime.\nProf Semple, professor of child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, said he believed schools should stay open \"nearly at all costs\" because the damage caused by a lack of education could be lifelong.\nHe said while pupils were unlikely to get sick themselves they could transmit the disease to others, and that this should be considered when discussing vaccines for 12 to 15-year-olds.\nA paper, published by the Royal Society, suggests the reopening of schools, and particularly secondary schools, is associated with an increased risk of transmission both among school-aged pupils and in the wider community. But it said the scale of that increase depended on control measures in the classroom and community as well as compliance with mass testing.\nProf Semple said his biggest worry was closing schools again because education was very important but he said school building stock was poor, with ventilation an issue.\nBoth experts agreed that school is the best place for children. \nBut vaccinating everyone else means that they'll look more like \"hubs\" than they did last year. \nIf your problems get smaller and mine stay the same, I start to look worse than you. \nLast September, older teenagers and younger adults saw the fastest rises in infections and cases in England. \nThis year, they'll be able to get vaccinated. Their place as \"leaders\" in infection rates and rises is likely to be taken by children because everyone else will have the vaccine to slow the spread. \nThe decision about vaccination for under-16s is finely balanced because the risks of illness for children from Covid are so low. \nParents have to balance the risks of Covid with the risks of disruption to education. Health experts currently appear more worried about missing education. \nScientists have already said it is \"highly likely\" that high levels of coronavirus will be seen in schools by the end of September.\nAnd there could be consequences for parents and carers, they say - but it remains to be seen what effect it will have on cases and hospital admissions.\nImperial College epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson said the UK could expect cases to surge in step with what has happened in Scotland when schools return but the big unknown was how long that surge would last. \nHe said that in a post-vaccine world the country could cope with much higher levels of cases and what ministers might consider an \"acceptable level of hospitalisation\" but he said that daily caseloads of 100,000 to 150,000 would put \"significant demands on the healthcare system\".\nIn Scotland more than 32,000 pupils have been off school due to Covid-19 as of Tuesday - with 6,471 having the virus, up from 3,500 the week before, while a further 25,622 were isolating.\nAmong the measures being implemented for safety in schools in England are carbon dioxide monitors to help improve ventilation, with 300,000 being made available, but when asked on BBC Breakfast Mr Williamson was unable to say how many were already in place.\nWhile CO2 monitors do not affect the transmission risk in schools, they can help to indicate how well ventilated a classroom is. \nHumans breathe out a higher concentration of carbon dioxide than is present in the atmosphere, so the monitors help to detect how much of the surrounding air has been breathed out, and how much is fresh air from outside.\nAsked about vaccinations for 12 to 15-year-olds the education secretary said parents would find it \"deeply reassuring to have a choice of whether their children should have a vaccination or not\" and that he was \"very keen\" to hear the decision from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nHe said that government was \"ready to go\" if it did decide to extend the eligibility to children that age.\nProf Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, said there were many arguments for and against vaccinating the age group but said whatever decision the committee reached would be in children's best interests.\nProf Semple, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was a \"really difficult judgement\" with a fine balancing act between a \"rare side effect\", in myocarditis, and the low risk from Covid to children themselves and the impact of transmission on wider society."

      "tags": "Abortion,Women,Texas,US abortion debate,United States",
      "text": "A law banning abortion from as early as six weeks into pregnancy has come into effect in the US state of Texas.\nIt bans abortions after the detection of what anti-abortion campaigners call a foetal heartbeat, something medical authorities say is misleading.\nThe law, one of the most restrictive in the country, took effect after the Supreme Court did not respond to an emergency appeal by abortion providers.\nDoctors and women's rights groups have heavily criticised the law.\nIt gives any individual the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past the six-week point.\nThe so-called \"Heartbeat Act\" was signed into law by Texas Governor Greg Abbott in May. \nBut rights groups, including Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), then requested that the Supreme Court block the legislation. \nIn the early hours of Wednesday, the ACLU confirmed that the court had \"not responded to our request\", adding: \"Access to almost all abortion has just been cut off for millions of people.\" \nThe group, which says that up to 90% of abortions in Texas take place after six weeks of pregnancy, described the development as \"blatantly unconstitutional\". \nThe US women's health group Planned Parenthood also condemned the ban, tweeting: \"No matter what, we aren't backing down and we are still fighting. Everyone deserves access to abortion.\"\nIn a statement, President Joe Biden denounced the bill as \"extreme\", warning it would \"significantly impair\" access to abortion care, particularly for low-income Texans and racial minorities.\nThe Supreme Court still has the power to overturn the ban at a later stage.\nSince the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade, US women have had the right to an abortion until a foetus is viable - that is, able to survive outside the womb. This is usually between 22 and 24 weeks into a pregnancy.\nThe so-called Texas Heartbeat Act prohibits abortions after six weeks of a pregnancy - at a point when many women do not know they are pregnant. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has said the term \"heartbeat\" is misleading, and that what is being detected at this stage is \"a portion of the foetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops\".\nThe Texas law enforces its ban with an uncommon approach: it empowers any private citizen to sue anyone who \"aids and abets\" an illegal abortion.\nThe legislation makes an exception in the case of medical emergency, which requires written proof from a doctor, but not for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. \nTexan women who wish to have an abortion after six weeks will need to travel across state lines, or - as estimated by the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute - an average of 248 miles (399km).\nMost abortion restrictions that have been proposed before have relied on criminal penalties or some form of regulatory punishment.\nThe Texas law instead authorises \"a private civil right of action\", which allows people to sue to enforce the law even if they themselves have not been harmed.\nAn ordinary American, from Texas or elsewhere, may now be able to seek up to $10,000 (\u00a37,200) in damages in a civil court against abortion providers and doctors - and possibly anyone at all involved in the process. That means people like clinic staff, family members, or clergy who encourage or support the procedure could, in theory, be sued.\nTurning over enforcement of the Heartbeat Act to private citizens instead of government officials likely means that - in the absence of Supreme Court intervention - the law cannot be challenged until a private citizen seeks damages. \nKim Schwartz of the Texas Right to Life organisation, which supports the measure, told the BBC most anti-abortion laws are \"held up in the court system for years\" and this \"thwarts the will of the people\". She argued that courts would require \"a credible claim that an illegal abortion occurred\" and would still undergo fact-finding processes.\nBut the ACLU and other critics have suggested the Texas law will champion \"a bounty hunting scheme\" of costly \"vigilante lawsuits\" designed to harass women seeking an abortion. The ACLU noted tip lines have already been set up by anti-abortion groups.\nAbortion has long been one of the country's most contentious social issues. However, polls from the Pew Research Center indicate nearly six in 10 Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\nThis number has remained relatively stable over the past two decades, but masks a partisan divide: only 35% of Republicans support that position.\nIn conservative Texas, an April poll found nearly half of the state's voters support a six-week ban on abortions.\nThe Texas law is one of many recent efforts to limit abortions in states controlled by Republicans.\nThree others - Idaho, Oklahoma and South Carolina - have passed six-week ban bills this year, all of which have been stalled by legal challenges and are yet to go into effect.\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, 2021 has already seen more restrictions enacted in any year since the Roe v Wade decision nearly 50 years ago.\nSupporters of these measures have been emboldened by the makeup of the Supreme Court, which currently has a 6-3 conservative lean.\nPro-choice Americans have expressed fear that, if given the chance, a majority of the high court's jurists will opt to overturn national abortion rights. This would not make abortion illegal across the country, but rather, would return that decision to each of the states. \nSome Democrat-led states, like New York, have enacted measures to safeguard abortion access in the event of this scenario."

      "text": "Thousands of long Covid patients in Scotland are not being referred to a support service, a charity has claimed.\nChest Heart and Stroke Scotland (CHSS) launched the service in February - but say they cannot get in touch with patients because of \"NHS bureaucracy\".\nThe Scottish government said it was working with the NHS, but \"no one approach\" would fit all circumstances.\nThe latest figures from the ONS estimate 74,000 people in Scotland are living with \"self-reported\" long Covid.\nAbout 60,000 had experienced long Covid symptoms for more than 12 weeks and 28,000 for a year.\nHowever, CHSS said they are only managing between 55-60 patients per month.\nThe condition has more than two dozen common symptoms - though experts have said they are often unpredictable and affect patients in different ways - and can last months.\nNew research suggests that being fully vaccinated against Covid cuts the risk of an infection turning into long Covid.\nThe long Covid support service, funded by CHSS and the Scottish government, was described in February as a first step towards a comprehensive national service.\nIts aim was to work with GPs and develop a support plan for people early on in their experience with long Covid as they awaited further NHS treatment.\nIt came after repeated calls for specialist long Covid clinics, which were introduced in England last year. At the time Scotland was devoting resources to research.\nHowever CHSS chief executive, Jane-Claire Judson, said the service has not made the progress she expected, and instead was meeting patients at the \"sharp end\" of long Covid.\nShe said: \"They come to us as a self-referral, so we're supporting people at the worst points in their long Covid journey - but that's not what the service was for. \n\"It was to receive referrals from people going to primary care so that we could start working with them early on. That means that thousands of people are not getting the support they need from us or the NHS.\n\"It means the data sharing is not in place and bureaucracy is preventing us and the NHS from working together and having a massive impact on people with long Covid. That's not acceptable.\"\nNine months after contracting Covid-19, Mairead Johnson, 58, and her husband Henry, 62, are reluctant to leave their house in Greenock as they are suffering the effects of long Covid.\n\"We only go to the shops once a week at night because we don't want to catch Covid again,\" she said.\n\"I was really frightened of getting the vaccine because again you didn't know is it going to make the long Covid worse.\"\nMairead said she and Henry have experienced the symptoms commonly associated with long Covid - breathlessness and fatigue - but that other effects are often unnerving.\nShe said she has received some support, but often feels nothing can be done for new symptoms as medical professionals know little about the condition.\n\"My husband would smell burning when there was nothing burning,\" she said. \"My hair has stopped growing, my yawning reflex has gone, I get a racing heart and breathless just from standing up. I have joint pain in my foot, as if one toe is permanently broken.\n\"You get to that stage where something happens and you go that's long Covid. A doctor said to me that's quite a scary thing because there could be something else wrong that might be serious.\n\"We need research, but to do the research properly they've got to speak to us and it's got to be collated from every GP practice. It's a brilliant opportunity for them to find out what's happening because it's happening to so many people at the same time.\"\nCHSS have now published a long Covid action plan which calls on the Scottish government to make a number of changes.\nCrucially it wants a fund to be set up for health boards to establish local long Covid services - although a figure has not yet been established.\nIt also wants bureaucratic barriers in the NHS to be removed and data sharing to be improved so that it can speak to patients more quickly.\nAdditionally the document calls for patient care plans to be developed and for medical staff to be trained on long Covid - as the charity said some do not recognise it as a real condition.\nDuring FMQs on Thursday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the organisation had made a number of very important points.\nShe said she wanted to discuss the recommendations with the charity in detail and will give the capacity fund serious consideration in budget discussions. \nThe Scottish government says it recognises the impact long Covid is having and has responded by strengthening existing NHS services and investing \u00a32.5m in long Covid Research. \nA government spokesperson added: \"NHS Scotland continues to deliver its full range of services to support the needs of people with long Covid, and we are engaging with NHS boards as they co-ordinate pathways across primary, community and secondary care services to support a coherent patient journey. \n\"While long Covid clinics are one model that NHS boards may explore, we know no one single approach is likely to fit all areas and circumstances.\n\"We are keeping all aspects under review, including specialist services and funding to ensure people suffering from long Covid receive the best possible care and support.\""

      "text": "Pupils are returning to school in England amid warnings of a lack of funding needed for pupils to catch up on learning lost because of Covid. \nIn a letter to the government, school leaders say at least \u00a35.8bn is needed to avert \"serious long-term damage\".\nAnd the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) says by next year, spending per pupil will still be about 1-2% lower in real terms than in 2009-10. \nThe government says it has invested billions of pounds to support pupils. \nThe letter, sent by the heads of leading academy chains and head teachers, says children are months behind academically and facing mental-health crises.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was looking at what more could be done to boost the attainment of children.\n\"I'm working with the chancellor and the prime minister, because we all have an absolute priority in terms of delivering for our children,\" he said.\n\"We've seen \u00a33bn extra come into schools.\"\nThe IFS funding report analyses the impact of the extra \u00a37bn invested in education in England over three years from 2019 on budgets which were already 9% down on 2009 levels.\nThe independent analysis says this government investment over three years from 2019 has filled, and will continue to fill, much of the budget black hole, but not all of it. This leaves per pupil funding down on 2009.\nIt also finds that because of recent changes to school funding calculations nationally, secondary schools in more deprived areas lost more like 14% compared to the national average of 9%.\nA Department for Education spokesman said the government is providing the biggest uplift to school funding in a decade - \u00a314 billion in total over the three years to 2022-23. \nBut the National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said there was no escaping the fact that the schools have had, and will continue to have, to make cuts to provision until this is properly addressed. \nAt the start of the new term, schools in England will be able to access funds to use a national tutoring scheme or use their own teachers to offer pupils support.\nThe government hopes its tutoring programme will support up to six million pupils over the next three years.\nMr Williamson said he expected a greater sense of normality in schools this term thanks to vaccination programme.\n\"That extra protection helps us find that sensible balance between protecting staff and students and ensuring education is not disrupted,\" he said.\n\"Keeping children in the classroom helps them catch up.\"\nBut Labour is highlighting how UK schools under tighter restrictions have seen more disruption linked to Covid than all but one of their European counterparts.\nIt quotes House of Commons Library research showing a 44% disruption rate in the UK between January 2020 and July 2021.\nOnly Italy had a higher rate at 48%, the figures based on data from the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker said. \nDespite plans for regular Covid testing of staff and pupils this term, there are concerns among head teachers, school staff and scientists about high rates of virus in a largely unvaccinated population.\nScientists have warned that the increased mixing related to reopening schools, combined with reduced health and safety rules, could lead to a rapid raise in cases throughout September.\nIt is unclear how this might play out in terms of further disruption to education, with anyone testing positive still required to self-isolate for 10 days.\nThe government insists its decision to lift restrictions maintains the balance between precautions, and allowing schools and young people to get back to normal.\nThis includes the ending of social distancing, bubble groups and face mask requirements, although twice-weekly Covid testing remains.\nThe requirement for close contacts of Covid cases to self-isolate, which saw millions of school days lost by pupils, has also been lifted."

      "tags": "NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Services may have to be cut unless NHS England receives an extra \u00a310bn in funding next year, groups representing the health service have warned. \nThe NHS Confederation and NHS Providers said the money was needed to cover pandemic-related costs and reduce the backlog in operations and treatments. \nThey warned that patients could be put at risk without more funding. \nThe government said it had already provided additional money to tackle backlogs. \nThe organisations are concerned a three-year government spending review for England, some of which could be announced next week, will fall well short of what the NHS needs. \nThe extra \u00a310bn to run day-to-day services would be on top of the \u00a3140bn budget already planned. \nJust under half would cover extra costs associated with Covid and much of the rest would be allocated to tackling waiting lists for non-urgent operations and mental health. \nWaiting lists have hit record levels during the pandemic, with more than 5.45 million people waiting for NHS hospital treatment in England.\nBut the NHS Confederation and NHS Providers warned waiting lists could more than double if budgets increased by less than \u00a310bn. \nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other NHS trusts in England, said the government \"must fully recognise the extent, length and cost of the impact of Covid-19 on the NHS\". \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that when the NHS was given funding \"we deliver in spades\" - pointing to the Covid vaccine rollout as an example - but he warned that without additional cash the waiting list backlog could increase to 13 million people.\nThe NHS budget is already increasing. A five-year settlement will see the funding increase by \u00a333bn by 2023-24.\nBut, of course, Covid has added to costs in a way that could not have been envisaged when the May government agreed the settlement three years ago.\nNHS leaders say the pandemic has led to the sort of pressures that have never been seen in the history of the health service.\nThe layouts of hospitals have had to be overhauled, services have had to be moved off site and homed in new buildings, extra infection control procedures have been brought in and the scale of sickness being seen mean extra staff are needed to care for patients.\nAt the same time, there is a growing backlog of traditional care, such as hip and knee operations. \nSo it means next year instead of the NHS budget growing by \u00a34bn under the existing settlement, NHS leaders want close to an extra \u00a315bn.\nAnd that extra money may need to stay in the budget for the following year depending on what is happening with Covid.\nMatthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said trust leaders were worried that without the extra funding \"they won't be able to provide prompt, high quality, safe care to all who need it\". \nIn a joint statement, the two leaders said that \"health outcomes for millions of patients\" in the next three years are dependent on the \"crucial\" spending review decision.\n\"Patients genuinely are at peril,\" they added. \nA government statement said: \"We are committed to making sure the NHS has everything it needs to continue providing excellent care to the public as we tackle the backlogs that have built up during the pandemic.\n\"This year alone we have already provided a further \u00a329bn to support health and care services, including an extra \u00a31bn to tackle the backlog. This is on top of our historic settlement for the NHS in 2018, which will see its budget rise by \u00a333.9bn by 2023-24.\" "

      "text": "The International Paralympics Committee (IPC) has defended a decision to strip a Malaysian athlete of his gold medal.\nShot putter Muhammad Ziyad Zolkefli won gold in the F20 class, but was later disqualified for arriving three minutes late for the event. \nMr Zolkefli was allowed to compete because at the time he had a \"logical\" reason for being late, the IPC said.\nHowever, a referee later found there was no \"justifiable reason\" for him to be late. \nThe decision to strip Mr Zolkefli of his medal has been met with much anger on social media, especially from Malaysians.\n\"Absolutely disgraceful! You should not have allowed the athletes to compete if they were late. Don't steal this hard-earned, world record-breaking medal from Ziyad,\" said Malaysian MP Fahmi Fadzil. \nMalaysia's Youth and Sports Minister Ahmad Faizul Azumu said the country's National Sports Council had been ordered to investigate. He added that he was \"disappointed\" by the decision to strip Mr Zolkefli's medal. \n\"The athletes have waited for five years but their hopes and spirits were destroyed by a delay of not even five minutes... this is something which is very sad,\" he said in a report by local news outlet The Star. \nThe hashtag #Ziyad has been trending on social media, with a lot of anger directed at Ukrainian athlete Maksym Koval - who initially won silver, but was later bumped up to gold after Mr Zolkefli's disqualification. \nAccording to a report by Malaysian media outlets, Ukraine had lodged a protest that Mr Zolkefli was late to the call room before the event started. \nIPC spokesman Craig Spence said there had been \"very abusive\" comments online after the disqualification, much of it targeting the Ukrainians.\n\"I'm sorry. Rules are rules. The decision was taken. It wasn't the Ukrainians' fault that the Malaysian was late,\" he said, according to a report by the Associated Press. \nMr Spence said Mr Zolkelfi - along with two others who were late - said they had not heard \"the announcement or it was in a language\" they did not understand. \nAn appeal against the decision has been rejected. \nMr Zolkefli had taken part in the F20 shot put event, which is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.

      "text": "People over the age of 12 with severely weakened immune systems should have a third vaccine dose to top up protection against Covid-19, experts say.\nAbout 400,000 to 500,000 in the UK are eligible and will be contacted soon.\nThey include those with blood cancer, advanced HIV and recent organ or stem-cell transplants.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said a separate booster programme for other age groups was still being considered.\nWhether all 12- to 15-year-olds will be offered a vaccine is yet to be decided.\nThe advice means the most vulnerable - less than 1% of the population - will be offered a third dose, rather than all those on the original list of clinically extremely vulnerable people.\nIt follows research showing about 40% of people with weakened immune systems had a low antibody response, and potentially less protection, after two vaccine doses. \nPeople with severe immunosuppression are also more likely to become seriously ill if they catch Covid-19.\nProf Wei Shen Lim, who chairs Covid immunisation for the JCVI, said: \"We want people with severely suppressed immune systems to have the best chance of gaining protection from Covid-19 via vaccination. \n\"Therefore, we are advising they have a third vaccine dose on top of their initial two doses, as we hope this will reduce their risk of severe outcomes such as hospitalisation and death.\"\nHal Cohen, 40, from north London has been taking regular medication to stop his body rejecting a kidney donated by his father.\nBut these vital drugs also blocked his immune system from developing protection against Covid from two vaccine doses.\nHe is now looking forward to having a third dose.\n\"It's going to be really great for me, and will hopefully give me some vaccine protection and the ability to return to normal life.\n\"But it's not clear if the booster is going to work for people like me,\" he said.\n\"So we do need to carry on looking at other treatments too - to give us the best chance.\"\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said people would be contacted \"as soon as possible, to discuss their needs and arrange an appointment for a third dose\".\nHe said the separate booster programme prioritising those most at risk from Covid-19 was still planned to begin in September.\nThe JCVI says either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine are preferred as third doses, because studies suggest they lead to a heightened immune response in this vulnerable group.\nFor 12- to 17-year-olds, the Pfizer vaccine is preferred.\nProf Lim said \"timing was important\" and a specialist doctor should decide when to give the third dose - but it should be at least eight weeks after the second and at a time when patients were least likely to be immunosuppressed.\nThose eligible for a third dose include people:\nCharities representing people with these illnesses welcomed the decision on a third dose.\n\"There is good reason to think some people with blood cancer will see an improved immune response as a result of a third dose, and so we urge everyone with blood cancer to get it when they are offered it,\" said Gemma Peters, chief executive of Blood Cancer UK.\nBut she advised people to remain cautious after their third dose until it was clear how much protection it offered."

      "tags": "Abortion,Women,Texas,US abortion debate,United States",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has launched a \"whole-of-government\" response to oppose a new law in Texas that bans most abortions. \nHe called the Supreme Court's decision not to block the law an \"unprecedented assault\" on women's rights.\nAny individual now has the right to sue anyone involved with providing or facilitating an abortion past six weeks of pregnancy in Texas.\nThis is before many women know they have conceived. \nRights groups had asked the Supreme Court to block the law, but it refused following a 5-4 vote. \nThe judges said their decision was not based on any conclusion about whether the Texas law was constitutional or not, and that the door remained open for legal challenges.\nOne of the liberal Supreme Court judges, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, said those justices who had allowed the law to stand had \"opted to bury their heads in the sand\" over a \"flagrantly unconstitutional law\".\nPresident Biden accused the court of unleashing \"unconstitutional chaos\". \"The highest court of our land will allow millions in Texas in need of critical reproductive care to suffer while courts sift through procedural complexities,\" he said.\nMr Biden said he had asked the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice to see what steps the national government could take to \"insulate women and providers\", but did not provide further details. \nHe said the law violated the landmark Roe v Wade case in 1973, in which the Supreme Court legalised abortion across the US. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that the president had long wanted to see the \"codification\" of Roe v Wade - which would mean Congress voting to make the precedent federal law. \nTexas' Republican Governor Greg Abbott has said his state will \"always defend the right to life\".\nThe ruling was welcomed by Dan Patrick, Texas's Republican lieutenant governor, who tweeted: \"A tremendous #prolife victory! This lifesaving legislation reflects Texas' pro-life beliefs and our continued commitment to protecting the most vulnerable.\"\nAbortion providers in Texas were also looking for ways to challenge the new law, while dealing with its immediate impact.\n\"It has been truly devastating,\" said Andrea Ferrigno of Whole Woman's Health.\nPatients have been \"talking about their despair and how they've felt pressured and rushed to make a decision\", she told the BBC. \nFor people already beyond the six-week deadline, she said Whole Women's Health had been offering information about what they could do next. \nBut she said the company was also \"regrouping and consulting with our legal counsel\" to decide on its next steps. \nIn the city of San Antonio, Planned Parenthood said it had paused its abortion services \"while this plays in the courts\".\nIts director of public affairs, Mara Posada, said they were \"getting calls and having to either let a person know that they cannot get an abortion after six weeks here in Texas, or if they are early enough in their pregnancy, we are referring them to a provider that is currently providing abortion care under the limits\". \nShe added that in the week leading up to the law coming into force, they had seen twice the normal number of patients. \nHope Hanzlik, 21, had an abortion earlier this week, five weeks into her pregnancy. Her abortion provider told her they were having trouble finding appointments for everyone and that she was fortunate to get one. \nThe so-called Texas Heartbeat Act prohibits abortions after what anti-abortion campaigners call a foetal heartbeat.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says the term \"heartbeat\" is misleading, and that what is being detected at this stage is \"a portion of the foetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops\".\nThe Texas law enforces its ban with an uncommon approach: it empowers any private citizen to sue anyone who \"aids and abets\" an illegal abortion. \nThis means that an American may now be able to seek up to $10,000 (\u00a37,200) in damages in a civil court against abortion providers and doctors - and possibly anyone involved in the process. People like clinic staff, family members, or clergy who encourage or support the procedure could, in theory, be sued.\nTurning over enforcement of the Heartbeat Act to private citizens instead of government officials likely means that - in the absence of Supreme Court intervention - the law cannot be challenged until a private citizen seeks damages.\nThe legislation makes an exception in the case of medical emergency, which requires written proof from a doctor, but not for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.\nTexan women who wish to have an abortion after six weeks will need to travel to other states. \nAbortions were made legal across the US in a landmark 1973 Supreme Court judgement, often referred to as the Roe v Wade case.\nBy a vote of seven to two, the court justices ruled that individual state governments lacked the power to prohibit abortions.\nThe court's judgement was based on the decision that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy came under the freedom of personal choice in family matters as protected by the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.\nThe ruling came after a 25-year-old single woman, Norma McCorvey under the pseudonym \"Jane Roe\", challenged the criminal abortion laws in Texas that forbade most abortions.\nHenry Wade was the Texas attorney general who defended the anti-abortion law.\nThe case created the \"trimester\" system that:"

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Vaccine passports",
      "text": "Vaccine passports are to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from later this month, Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nThe plans will apply to indoor and outdoor events, and will need to be signed off by MSPs next week.\nMs Sturgeon said the move was needed to help stem the recent surge in the number of cases.\nA further 6,107 people have tested positive, with the number of people in hospital doubling in the past 10 days. \nAnd several areas of Scotland are among the regions with the highest rates of the virus in Europe. \nThe new vaccine certification rules mean people over the age of 18 will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to: \nThe new rules will impact on many sporting events in Scotland - particularly football matches - as well as concerts and music festivals.\nSPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said Premiership football clubs had \"a significant number of questions and real concern\" about the plan.\nHe added: \"It's not clear what IT infrastructure will be in place, what time-scales clubs will be asked to work to, or what can be done for those without smart phones.\n\"And it's not clear if it's going to cut across terms and conditions of seasons tickets already bought by people across the land.\"\nMs Sturgeon said the hospitality industry as a whole would not be included in the certification scheme - although that decision would be kept under review.\nAnd there are no plans to include key services or settings where people have no choice over attendance - such as shops, public transport, education and medical services. \nAnyone who has good reasons for not getting fully vaccinated - including children and people with particular medical conditions - will be exempt. \nPeople can already request a paper copy of their vaccination record to allow them to travel, and from Friday they will be provided with a QR code so they can download a copy of the record to keep on their phone.\nA similar scheme will be introduced in England at the end of this month, with people needing to have a \"Covid pass\" to access \"higher risk\" settings such as nightclubs. \nSeveral other European countries - including France, Italy and Ireland - have already introduced certification.\nScotland's health secretary, Humza Yousaf, said in July that he was \"sceptical\" about the case for vaccine passports, citing concerns that they \"might increase the inequality gap, and there would be ethical issues\".\nThe country's deputy first minister, John Swinney, also said he did not believe it was right to exclude people who do not want to be vaccinated after the UK government set out its plans to introduce passports in England.\nIn a statement at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that the certification scheme was now needed to \"help protect individuals and the country as a whole and reduce the risk of further restrictions being necessary\".\nThe first minister added: \"Many of the events and venues that are covered by the certification scheme are important - they matter to our economy, and to our cultural and social life. \n\"That's why we want to enable them to stay open safely - but they are not essential services.\n\"And the nature of them - which involves bringing many people together in relatively small areas - does mean that, despite their very best efforts, they can contribute significantly to the spread of the virus.\"\nShe also said it would be \"grossly irresponsible\" to rule out re-introducing further restrictions in the future.\nThe Scottish Greens are not keen on vaccine passports. The new minister for zero carbon buildings, active travel and tenants' rights, Patrick Harvie, has raised concerns about their introduction before.\nIn July he argued vaccine certification \"would deepen discrimination against those who have not yet been vaccinated\".\nToday the party's health spokesperson, Gillian Mackay, said it was essential the Scottish government ensures the introduction of vaccine certification doesn't adversely affect disabled people, those with underlying health conditions and those from the global south who may not be able to access proof of vaccination. \nBut the Greens are now in government. Vaccine certification isn't specifically excluded in the co-operation agreement they signed with the SNP and so the Greens are bound by collective responsibility on this issue and will have to support it when it's put to the vote at Holyrood. \nThe first minister said it was a \"significant move\" and would need to be signed off by MSPs, with a debate and vote to take place next week.\nHowever the SNP has a comfortable majority with the backing of the Scottish Greens - who have previously been opposed to the move - and the cooperation agreement between the two parties commits them to working together on Covid-related matters.\nThe Liberal Democrats were the only party to hit out directly against the plans following Ms Sturgeon's statement, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton saying vaccine passports were akin to \"medical ID cards\", adding: \"This is an illiberal step\".\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the Scottish government had \"wasted months\" that could have been spent making preparations, and was now \"introducing vaccine passports at the last minute\".\nHe added: \"It's a striking u-turn from what John Swinney said last month, where he emphatically claimed vaccine passports were \"the wrong way\" to go. \n\"We need businesses to get in-depth guidance around these certificates as soon as possible. They should be involved in the process and the government needs to clarify whether they will be expected to police these new rules.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the virus was now out of control and Scotland - and claimed the government had no strategy to deal with it. \nCase levels in Scotland are 80% higher now than they were last week, and five times higher than they were four weeks ago.\nThe number of people in hospital has more than doubled since 20 August, from 312 to 629.\nIntensive care admissions have not risen as quickly, but have still gone up from 34 to 59 over the same timescale.\nMeanwhile 4,108,804 people have had a first dose of vaccine, and 3,691,066 have had two.\nThat includes 95% of people over 40 who are now fully vaccinated, as well as 71% of 30 to 39-year-olds and 51% of 18 to 29-year-olds.\nThe Federation of Small Businesses said the many affected firms would not welcome the certificate scheme - but would accept it as an alternative to stricter restrictions. \nBut it said the system needed to be user-friendly for both businesses and the public, and warned against a \"rush\" to extend the scheme to other settings. \nThe Scottish Licensed Trade Association (SLTA) said the scheme was a \"threat hanging over the whole of the hospitality industry\", while the UK Hospitality Scotland said the move would \"cause dismay amongst businesses\" that had only recently been allowed to reopen."
