      "text": "Climate activists say they have deflated tyres on \"luxury\" vehicles parked in Glasgow, to raise awareness of carbon emissions during COP26.\nA number of SUVs in the city's upmarket West End were left with flyers that branded them a \"climate violation\".\nPolice Scotland said it was aware of the incidents and it had upped patrols in the area.\nThousands of campaigners travelled to Glasgow in recent weeks for the UN climate summit, which ends on Friday.\nPharmacist Jamie MacConnacher discovered the two front tyres of his Land Rover had been flattened on Thursday morning.\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme  that several other cars in the area had been targeted.\nHe said: \"I don't think targeting individuals that have these vehicles is the right way to do it. They don't know what the reason for somebody having that car is.\"\nHe added: \"I understand that there is a need for change, I'm totally for that. I would have an electric car but it's the logistics in the west end of Glasgow. \n\"There's nowhere to charge outside your flat so it just doesn't work for me.\"\nA flyer left on Mr MacConnacher's vehicle said it was \"driving the climate breakdown\", particularly in poor countries.\nThe activist group Tyred of SUVs later claimed responsibility, saying they had deflated tyres of around 60 vehicles in the \"rich neighbourhood\".\nThe group said: \"If 4x4 drivers were a nation, they'd be the seventh biggest polluters on the planet. If the 1% won't take responsibility for the climate destruction they wreak, we'll make them.\" \nTyred of SUVs member, Fin, told BBC Radio Scotland: \"We feel we need to do this because we need to point to the people who are responsible - rich people in the global north.\n\"This is a minor inconvenience that is not going to disrupt them in a huge way. What is really going to disrupt people's lives and kill them is the climate crisis caused by rich people -  basically SUV owners.\"\nShe added: \"The importance of this message made it necessary and warranted this disruption.\"\nMr MacConnacher, who drives 25 miles to Aberfoyle, Stirlingshire, each day for work, said he needs a large car as he often faces \"challenging conditions\" on the road in winter.\nOn Thursday he was 45 minutes late for work as he had access to a tyre pump - but said there could have been consequences for his patients.\n\"It's not something that's going to cost me any money, but it's still tampering with someone else's vehicle,\" he added.\n\"I have to get to my patients - fortunately I wasn't that late for work but if I hadn't had a pump I could have been hours late.\n\"The knock-on effect of that could be quite significant. We could have a lot of antibiotics needing given out, we've got palliative care patients that need access to care at end of life.\"\nPolice Scotland said: \"We are aware of these incidents and there will increased patrols in the  area to provide reassurance to local residents.\""

      "tags": "Belarus,Russia,Europe migrant crisis,European Union,Poland",
      "text": "Belarus's leader has threatened to cut off gas supplies to Europe if sanctions are imposed over an escalating migrant crisis at the country's western border.\nThousands of people, mostly from Iraq, Syria and Yemen, are at the border with Poland, enduring freezing conditions in the hope of crossing into the EU.\nEU officials have accused Belarus of provoking the crisis to undermine its security, an allegation it denies.\nIn retaliation, the EU is reportedly planning a fresh package of sanctions.\nBut on Thursday the country's long-time authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko warned: \"If they impose additional sanctions on us... we must respond\".\n\"We are heating Europe, and they are threatening us,\" he said, referring to a Russian gas pipeline that runs through Belarus and into the EU.\n\"And what if we halt natural gas supplies? Therefore, I would recommend the leadership of Poland, Lithuanians and other empty-headed people to think before speaking.\"\nHis comments raised fresh fears amid worsening natural gas shortages and rising prices in Europe. \nThe EU's economy commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said the 27-member bloc \"should not be intimidated\". Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya accused the president of \"bluffing\" over his gas ultimatum.\nBut Katja Yafimava, from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said Mr Lukashenko's threat should be taken seriously.\n\"If the EU pushes Belarus too hard, it may act on this threat,\" Dr Yafimava said, adding that this could push up gas prices across Europe, including in the UK.\nMore EU sanctions could be introduced as early as Monday. Possible measures include stopping international airlines carrying migrants from landing at the airport in the Belarusian capital Minsk. \nTurkey's national carrier Turkish Airlines has said it will be restricting the sale of tickets on some routes for citizens of Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\nIraq has said it is organising repatriation flights for Iraqi nationals from Belarus.\nThe EU is also reportedly considering sanctions against the Russian state airline Aeroflot for transporting migrants to Belarus, an allegation Aeroflot denies.\nBelarus' Belavia national carrier was in May banned from EU skies after a Ryanair flight was forced to divert to Minsk and a dissident journalist arrested.\nThe EU has accused Belarus of mounting a \"hybrid attack\" on its territory by encouraging thousands of people to cross into Poland.\nIt claims the country's leadership had enticed them with the false promise of easy entry to the EU as part of an \"inhuman, gangster-style approach\". \nMr Lukashenko, who was declared the winner after last year's discredited election, has repeatedly denied that Belarus is sending migrants over the border in revenge for existing EU sanctions.\nAnastasiia Stognei, BBC Russian, Moscow \nIt is hard to tell how realistic Alexander Lukashenko's threats are.  \nOn the one hand, he's a leader known for extravagant antics. In August last year, during mass protests opposing his re-election, he was pictured arriving at his Minsk residence by helicopter, wearing a flak jacket and carrying an assault rifle.  \nAt the same time, when Mr Lukashenko says that he won't stop at anything to protect his country's \"sovereignty and independence\", he might indeed try to implement his threats. \nNonetheless, shutting off the gas transit would be disastrous for Belarus' impoverished economy - though Mr Lukashenko has made economically irrational decisions before. \nBut it is also a question of international politics. The gas Mr Lukashenko is threatening to shut off is not his - it belongs to Russia. Any decisions about its fate will be taken in Moscow. And the Russian capital is a far more pragmatic place than Minsk.  \nMr Lukashenko has no incentives to argue with the Kremlin - after all, his authority is propped up by financial support from Russia.  \nJudging from what Moscow had said about the future of Nord Stream-2 pipeline, the question of gas supply to Europe can be used for leverage. But that is a question of supply, not of shutting it off altogether. \nIn other developments on Thursday:\nMeanwhile at the Polish border, stranded migrants threw rocks and attempted to break a razor wire fence.\nPoland has been accused of pushing people back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum.\n\"There's no way to escape,\" 33-year-old Shwan Kurd told the BBC, who described arriving in Belarus at the start of November. \n\"Poland won't let us in. We are so hungry. There's no water or food here. There are little children, old men and women,\" he said.\nThe migrants are mainly young men - but there are also women and children. They are camping in tents just inside Belarus, trapped between Polish guards on one side and Belarusian guards on the other.\nAt least seven people have died on the Polish side of the border, many from hypothermia in recent months."

      "title": "COP26: Coal compromise as leaders near climate deal",
      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "A draft agreement at the COP26 climate summit has watered down commitments to end the use of coal and other fossil fuels, as countries race to reach a deal after two weeks of talks. \nWhile the language around fossil fuels has been softened, the inclusion of the commitment in a final deal would be seen as a landmark moment.\nA deal must be agreed by the end of the summit, which is in its final hours.\nThe UN meeting is seen as crucial for limiting the effects of global warming.\nThe draft agreement, which was published early on Friday following all-night talks, also asks for much tighter deadlines for governments to reveal their plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \nAnd it also strengthens support for poorer countries fighting climate change.\nNegotiations over a final deal could stretch late into Friday, or potentially even longer.\n\"This text is the bare minimum. The next few hours are going to determine the new dawn,\" says Simon Stiell, climate resilience minister for Grenada, a small island that is highly vulnerable to climate change.\n\"If the text withstands the battering it may get, we are holding onto 1.5C by our fingernails,\" he says, referring to the ambition to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C degrees to avoid the worst effects of climate change.\nNegotiators from countries that depend on fossil fuels may still attempt to amend the text before the summit ends.\nClimate groups cautiously welcomed signs of progress in the draft but said there is a long way to go yet.\n\"The key line on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies has been critically weakened, but it's still there and needs to be strengthened again before this summit closes,\" says Jennifer Morgan of Greenpeace International.\n\"But there's wording in here worth holding on to and the UK presidency needs to fight tooth and nail to keep the most ambitious elements in the deal,\" she says.\nProf Jim Watson at University College London said the draft agreement had encouraging elements, but that overall it was \"nowhere near ambitious enough\". \nThe draft comes after UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that COP26 would probably not achieve its aims and the crucial goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C is on \"life support\".\nLimiting warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels is a key part of the Paris agreement that most countries signed up to. It requires cutting global emissions by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by 2050.\nOne example of the impact of global temperature rise above 2C is the death of virtually all coral reefs, scientists say.\nA previous version of the agreement called upon parties to \"accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels\".\nThis has been changed to call for \"accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels\".\nUnabated coal is coal produced without the use of technology to capture the emitted carbon.\nBut the draft requests that countries submit their plans - known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change by next year's climate summit. Previous agreements asked countries to submit these NDCs every five years.\nThis latest draft of the decision has gained in strength in many areas - but as in every negotiation, there are some losses too.\nOne small but important change is in relation to 1.5C - the text formerly said that the world should aim to keep global temperatures under this threshold \"by 2100\".\nSome scientists for the IPCC [the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] saw this as allowing temperatures to go well beyond 1.5 as long as they were brought back down by the end of the century. This has been changed to simply say \"limiting temperatures to 1.5C.\"\nThe commitment of countries to come back next year with a new carbon-cutting plan is still in the draft, although the language around it has been softened. \nPerhaps of greater concern though is the inclusion of the phrase \"taking into account different national circumstances\". \nWhile this is being seen as a way of allowing vulnerable states and other low-emitting countries to avoid having to update their plans, could it also be used by China to do the same thing?\nWhere the new document really gains strength is in relation to finance and loss and damage, two key issues for developing nations.\nMoney for adapting to the worst impacts of climate change will be doubled, and the baseline year will be 2021. \nThis is a first step on a road that will please the most vulnerable nations.\nA key sticking point at COP26 is climate finance - the money promised by richer countries to poorer countries to fight climate change. It is controversial because developed countries are responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions, but developing countries see the worst effects of climate change.\nDespite the promises made at COP26 so far, the planet is still heading for 2.4C of warming above pre-industrial levels, according to a report by Climate Action Tracker. \nA series of agreements between groups of countries have been announced so far:"

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "The UK presidency team have set out an ambitious stall in their first attempt to capture progress here at COP26.\nAs well as the specific items mentioned in the document, it also gives us a sense of how the negotiations are going more generally.\nIt's clear that there's a sense of urgency, and a willingness to go high on the key question of cutting carbon more rapidly.\nIf this idea survives the next couple of days, then Glasgow may well be seen as a success.\nBut there's a long way to go until the final gavel comes down.\nThe idea of getting countries to come back more regularly started with the most vulnerable nations.\nThis meeting floated the idea of countries coming back with new plans every year - and this draft nods to that by asking everyone to come back next year with a new nationally determined contribution (NDC), which outlines their pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nBut there are some interesting wrinkles in that request.\nParties are urged to come back in 2022 with plans that \"align with the Paris temperature goal\".\nWhich one do they mean - 1.5C or 2C?\nThat will need clarifying in the hours and days ahead. \nThe UK have attempted to copper-fasten the idea of rapid improvement in national plans by asking all countries to attend a high-level ministerial meeting on climate change every year.\nThey've also asked the UN Secretary-General to convene a world leaders meeting in 2023, just ahead of a global stock-take, which will examine how countries are performing on restricting emissions.\nThat all sounds like a nice day out for presidents and prime ministers, but doesn't commit them to do anything.\nThere is also some quite progressive language in this draft decision that will hearten campaigners, specifically the mention of coal. \nAccording to seasoned observer this is the first mention of the \"c\" word in a UN climate change document. \nHowever, before everyone gets carried away, the give and take nature of the drafting process means that there is no end date given, meaning it is an aspiration and not a timeline. \nThe same paragraph also mentions the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, but there's no specific mention of oil and gas.\nIs that to try and keep Saudi Arabia, Russia and other major producers on board?\nThere is some nice language on doubling the amount of finance given for adaptation. \nBut there's no baseline against which to measure the increase and no timeline for delivery.\nThe issue of loss and damage finally gets its own significant section in the draft decision. This is the idea that rich nations bear a historical responsibility for global warming and should compensate poorer ones for the harms visited on them. \nIts inclusion will hearten many developing nations, which have been asking for a clear financial commitment to tackle the impacts of climate change that they can't adapt to. However, the document is very woolly on this question.\nNow that the UK has played its main negotiating card, much will likely change over the next two days of hardball negotiations.\nThere will be pressure from countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia, China and India to water down the idea of coming back next year with a new plan.\nStrangely there are many developing nations who might also oppose this - the time, effort and costs associated with a new NDC should not be underestimated. \nDeveloping nations will also seek more clarity on two key issues. \nThey will want a strengthening of the language around finance so that a new goal for 2025 represents a significant increase on the much derided $100bn. \nThey will also want to see a stronger emphasis on spending up to half that money on adaptation.\nThe other question is over the loss and damage issue.\nRight now, the UN's response to this amounts to a single website for countries affected. \nEmerging economies will want to see this strengthened in the draft decision, with a new secretariat dedicated to the question - and most importantly a separate stream of funding. \nThe serious horse trading has already started.\nMatt McGrath has been covering climate change for the past 15 years, reporting from 10 COPs along the way.

      "text": "A US appeals court has temporarily denied a bid by US Capitol riot investigators to access ex-President Donald Trump's White House records.  \nThe ruling comes two days after a court ordered the documents to be turned over to the congressional committee leading the inquiry. \nLawmakers are trying to find out if Mr Trump had foreknowledge of the riot.\nTrump supporters stormed the Capitol building on 6 January as Congress was meeting to certify the election result.\nMr Trump has refused to acknowledge losing the election to President Joe Biden last year, making claims - without evidence - of mass voter fraud.  \nThe inquiry is being conducted by a committee set up by the House of Representatives, which is dominated by President Biden's Democrats.\nThe panel wants to see phone records, visitor logs and other White House documents that could shed light on events leading up to the attack on Congress. \nBut on Thursday, the US Court of Appeals in Washington placed a temporary hold on a lower court's order to hand over the trove by Friday.\nThe appeals court said it will schedule a hearing for 30 November. The case will be heard by three judges who were selected at random, according to US media. All three were appointed by Democratic presidents. \nMr Trump's lawyers had said in their emergency filing to the appeals court that their client could \"suffer irreparable harm through the effective denial of a constitutional and statutory right to be fully heard on a serious disagreement between the former and incumbent President\".\nThe legal battle is likely to wind up at the Supreme Court.\nMr Trump - a Republican - has argued his White House communications were protected by executive privilege, under which presidential documents can be kept secret. But Mr Biden has waived executive privilege on the files.\nAnd on Tuesday, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected Mr Trump's argument, writing in a 39-page decision: \"Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President.\" \nThe House Select Committee has issued dozens of subpoenas in the last week, calling on many former Trump officials to hand over documents and testify about the riot. \nThey include Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, Stephen Miller, who was Mr Trump's senior adviser, Mark Meadows, former White House chief of staff, and Michael Flynn, former national security adviser.\nOn Thursday, Mr Meadows notified the committee that he would refuse to co-operate until a final court judgement. The move led the committee's top investigator to threaten him with criminal contempt charges.  \nFollowing the Capitol riot, Mr Trump was impeached by the lower house of Congress, but cleared by the then Republican-dominated upper house, the Senate, of inciting an insurrection. \nMore than 670 people have been arrested for the invasion of the Capitol complex."

We'll have another update for you on Saturday.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has stressed the urgent need for Britons to get their Covid booster jabs, as he warned coronavirus \"storm clouds\" gathering over parts of Europe could reach the UK. While new infections currently remain steady in the UK, countries such as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands have seen steep rises in positive cases, with some moving to bring in tougher Covid restrictions. Mr Johnson said there was no room for complacency in the UK, warning that if booster jabs were not in arms fast enough \"we can see the potential risks to the state of the pandemic in what's happening in other parts of Europe\".\nThe Dutch government has announced Western Europe's first partial lockdown of the winter after record infections and rising intensive care cases in hospitals. Three weeks of restrictions will affect shops, sport and catering. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the partial lockdown would start on Saturday evening with non-essential shops having to shut at 18:00 while cafes, restaurants and hotels will close at 20:00. Professional sport will continue, but behind closed doors\nDrugs giant AstraZeneca will start to draw an income from its Covid vaccine through a string of for-profit deals next year. Other vaccine makers, including Pfizer and Moderna have been making profits from their jabs. AstraZeneca had been providing its vaccine - which was developed with the University of Oxford - to countries on a not-for-profit basis, and previously said it would only start to make money from it when Covid-19 was no longer a pandemic. AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot says the disease is becoming endemic in society. The firm will continue to supply its vaccine on a not-for-profit basis to poorer countries.\nDozens of military personnel will continue to help ease pressure on two Scottish health boards after the Ministry of Defence granted an extension to assistance efforts. The support for NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Borders was due to end on 10 November but the MoD has approved its continuation into December in both areas, with some 84 personnel remaining to help. \nA woman whose TikTok videos of her singing in a supermarket - which have been viewed millions of times during the coronavirus lockdown - has landed her dream job in the West End. Hannah Lowther, 24, from Reading, took the retail job when theatres shut during the pandemic. She posted the videos while at work, changing lyrics to popular songs, including Dolly Parton's hit 9 to 5, while using props from the shelves. Hannah has now been cast in Heathers The Musical when it opens in London later this month. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThe weekday morning coronavirus briefing is being paused for two weeks to tell you five things you need to know about the COP26 climate summit.\nThe government has announced that NHS staff in England will have to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by 1 April.

      "title": "COP26: Coal compromise as leaders near climate deal",
      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "A draft agreement at the COP26 climate summit has watered down commitments to end the use of coal and other fossil fuels, as countries race to reach a deal after two weeks of talks. \nWhile the language around fossil fuels has been softened, the inclusion of the commitment in a final deal would be seen as a landmark moment.\nA deal must be agreed by the end of the summit, which is in its final hours.\nThe UN meeting is seen as crucial for limiting the effects of global warming.\nThe draft agreement, which was published early on Friday following all-night talks, also asks for much tighter deadlines for governments to reveal their plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \nAnd it also strengthens support for poorer countries fighting climate change.\nNegotiations over a final deal could stretch late into Friday, or potentially even longer.\n\"This text is the bare minimum. The next few hours are going to determine the new dawn,\" says Simon Stiell, climate resilience minister for Grenada, a small island that is highly vulnerable to climate change.\n\"If the text withstands the battering it may get, we are holding onto 1.5C by our fingernails,\" he says, referring to the ambition to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C degrees to avoid the worst effects of climate change.\nNegotiators from countries that depend on fossil fuels may still attempt to amend the text before the summit ends.\nClimate groups cautiously welcomed signs of progress in the draft but said there is a long way to go yet.\n\"The key line on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies has been critically weakened, but it's still there and needs to be strengthened again before this summit closes,\" says Jennifer Morgan of Greenpeace International.\n\"But there's wording in here worth holding on to and the UK presidency needs to fight tooth and nail to keep the most ambitious elements in the deal,\" she says.\nProf Jim Watson at University College London said the draft agreement had encouraging elements, but that overall it was \"nowhere near ambitious enough\". \nThe draft comes after UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that COP26 would probably not achieve its aims and the crucial goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C is on \"life support\".\nLimiting warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels is a key part of the Paris agreement that most countries signed up to. It requires cutting global emissions by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by 2050.\nOne example of the impact of global temperature rise above 2C is the death of virtually all coral reefs, scientists say.\nA previous version of the agreement called upon parties to \"accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels\".\nThis has been changed to call for \"accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels\".\nUnabated coal is coal produced without the use of technology to capture the emitted carbon.\nBut the draft requests that countries submit their plans - known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change by next year's climate summit. Previous agreements asked countries to submit these NDCs every five years.\nThis latest draft of the decision has gained in strength in many areas - but as in every negotiation, there are some losses too.\nOne small but important change is in relation to 1.5C - the text formerly said that the world should aim to keep global temperatures under this threshold \"by 2100\".\nSome scientists for the IPCC [the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] saw this as allowing temperatures to go well beyond 1.5 as long as they were brought back down by the end of the century. This has been changed to simply say \"limiting temperatures to 1.5C.\"\nThe commitment of countries to come back next year with a new carbon-cutting plan is still in the draft, although the language around it has been softened. \nPerhaps of greater concern though is the inclusion of the phrase \"taking into account different national circumstances\". \nWhile this is being seen as a way of allowing vulnerable states and other low-emitting countries to avoid having to update their plans, could it also be used by China to do the same thing?\nWhere the new document really gains strength is in relation to finance and loss and damage, two key issues for developing nations.\nMoney for adapting to the worst impacts of climate change will be doubled, and the baseline year will be 2021. \nThis is a first step on a road that will please the most vulnerable nations.\nA key sticking point at COP26 is climate finance - the money promised by richer countries to poorer countries to fight climate change. It is controversial because developed countries are responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions, but developing countries see the worst effects of climate change.\nDespite the promises made at COP26 so far, the planet is still heading for 2.4C of warming above pre-industrial levels, according to a report by Climate Action Tracker. \nA series of agreements between groups of countries have been announced so far:"

      "text": "A man who admits strangling a 16-year-old girl to death said he wanted revenge on her mother.\nWenjing Lin died at her family's Chinese takeaway in Ynyswen, Rhondda Cynon Taf, on 5 March.\nChun Xu, 32, denies murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\nWhen questioned by a psychologist, Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Mr Xu replied: \"I didn't mean to hurt the little girl. I wanted revenge on her mother.\"\nHe added: \"She upset me on many times and didn't listen to what I say.\"\nMr Xu also denies attempting to murder Wenjing's stepfather Yongquan Jiang at the Blue Sky Chinese takeaway, near Treorchy.\nHe admitted attacking 38-year-old Mr Jiang with two knives, but denied intending to kill him or cause him serious harm.\nProsecutor Michael Jones QC told the court Mr Xu had cut his own throat after the attack.\nThe jury heard an hour before Wenjing was killed, Mr Xu had used a search engine to ask \"can fingerprints be destroyed by fire?\"\nThe court was also shown body-worn camera footage of emergency services arriving at the scene, which included firearms officers moving around the building and the defendant receiving treatment for his self-inflicted injuries.\nMr Xu was a heavy gambler and owed Wenjing's family about \u00a314,000, the court heard.\nAlthough they were not blood relations, he was described as being seen as like a nephew to Wenjing's mother, Meifang Xu, but there had been disagreements between their families.\nIn December 2020, the family entrusted Mr Xu with \u00a320,000 that he said he would send back to China for them to pay a friend who had loaned them money to start their business in the UK.\nHowever, Mr Xu only sent some of the money back and gambled away \u00a314,000, which he had then begun paying back.\nOn 4 March, the jury heard Mr Xu travelled from the Pontypridd area where he was living and working in a different Chinese restaurant. \nHe brought with him one of the knives used to attack Mr Jiang. \nThe court heard he had asked for no-one to be told about his visit, during which he ate with the family and stayed the night.\nThe following morning, Wenjing was getting ready for school and messaging friends on Snapchat.\nMr Jones told the court she sent her last message just before 09:30 and did not respond to messages after that because \"she had by now been killed by the defendant\".\nLater, at about 11:00, Mr Jiang heard someone pacing around downstairs and found Mr Xu who invited him into the basement for a cigarette and to get some fish from the freezer, the court heard.\nAs Mr Jiang opened the freezer, the jury heard Mr Xu attacked him with two knives, stabbing him in the neck and body.\nDuring the struggle, Mr Jiang asked Mr Xu why he was attacking him, to which he replied: \"Money, money, money\".\nMs Xu then came down the basement stairs and saw the two fighting. She tried to ring a friend, and Mr Xu bit her.\nMr Jiang managed to get back onto the ground floor where he found his stepdaughter lifeless on a black mat by the takeaway counter.\nDespite attempts made by the emergency services, she could not be revived.\nThe jury was told that the defendant was found in the kitchen with a self-inflicted injury to his throat, which was later treated at University Hospital of Wales.\nMr Jones described how \u00a3900 was found in Mr Xu's pockets, as well as Wenjing's mobile phone and keys.\nWhen he was interviewed by police, he gave no explanation for his actions.\nMr Jones told the jury: \"We do not accept he had no intention to kill or cause serious harm\".\nA statement from Rhiannon Davies, the deputy headmistress at Treorchy Comprehensive school, where Wenjing was a pupil, said she was an \"exceptional student\". \nMs Davies said that on the day of her death, Wenjing had logged on for a Maths lesson, adding she would be \"sorely missed\".\nThe trial continues."

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Queen Elizabeth II",
      "text": "The Queen will attend the upcoming Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph in central London, Buckingham Palace has confirmed. \nDoctors had advised the monarch to rest until mid-November after medical checks in hospital last month. \nThe palace said the Queen, 95, would view the service from the balcony of a Whitehall building as she has done in previous years.\nPrince Charles will lay a wreath on her behalf as has been custom since 2017.\nHowever, palace officials said she had been \"mindful of her doctors' recent advice\", deciding not to attend the Church of England's General Synod at Westminster Abbey next week.\nThey had previously said it was the Queen's \"firm intention\" to attend the annual Remembrance service to honour the country's war dead.\nEarlier today, the Queen's son and the heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales, was asked about his mother's health by a bystander during an engagement in Brixton, south London. Prince Charles gave him a pat on the arm, and appeared to say: \"She's alright, thank you.\"\nOn Tuesday, the Queen returned to Windsor Castle following a long-planned weekend away at her Sandringham home in Norfolk.\nWhen the cancellation of a fortnight of engagements was announced almost two weeks ago, the palace went out of its way to say it was the Queen's \"firm intention\" to be in Whitehall on Remembrance Sunday.\nIt is the most important day in her calendar - her tribute to those who gave the most extraordinary service, in war.\nIt can be a hard day, with a fair amount of standing at a cold time of year. We are so used to the Queen just getting on with the job that some may forget that she is 95 years old.\nBut she remains at the heart of the National Service of Remembrance, a day she has barely missed in almost seven decades as sovereign.\nHer withdrawal from the General Synod will have been been a difficult decision.\nThe palace stresses that it is as a result of recent medical advice. They have given no details, but it's not unreasonable to suspect that it may be the start of somewhat slower pace of engagements for the Queen.\nIt will be the Queen's first Remembrance Sunday since the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, in April.\nThe UK's longest-reigning monarch spent a night in hospital in October for preliminary medical checks, after cancelling an official visit to Northern Ireland. \nIt was her first overnight stay in a medical facility for eight years and was said to be for practical reasons.\nSince then she has undertaken a handful of public duties, including holding a Privy Council meeting with government ministers via video link on Wednesday.\nShe also recorded a video message for world leaders at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow after deciding not to attend in-person, held her weekly meeting with the prime minister via telephone, and spoke to ambassadors via video call. \nLast week, she was spotted driving her car near Windsor Castle, in an area where she is known to take her Corgi dogs out for walks. She was photographed in a headscarf and sunglasses behind the wheel of a green Jaguar estate car."

      "text": "The mother of a 10-year-old boy who was killed by a dog has paid tribute to her \"beautiful\" and \"sweet\" son.\nJack Lis died at a house in Caerphilly on Monday afternoon.\nThe dog was destroyed by police, who said it was \"extremely aggressive\".\nHis mother Emma Whitfield wrote on Facebook: \"With so much heart break and before close friends and family see his name in the news, I have to announce our beautiful boy Jack was taken so tragically yesterday.\"\nShe said it was \"not our dog, nor did it happen at our family home\". \n\"He was out to play. We love you so much our sweet, sweet boy.\"\nPolice have not yet been able to confirm the breed of the dog which has been described as \"large and powerful\".\nGwent Police said the animal belonged to the occupant of the house where Jack was killed.\nA neighbour said someone had gone running to intervene and wrestle the dog off at the house in Pentwyn, Penyrheol.\nJack was a pupil at Cwm Ifor Primary School in Caerphilly, whose head teacher, Gareth Rees, said the whole school community \"has been rocked by the tragic events of the past 24 hours\".\nOfficers were called to the house at 15:55 GMT on Monday following reports of a dog attack. \nCh Supt Mark Hobrough, of Gwent Police, confirmed the attack \"did not happen in the house owned by Jack's family, but inside another property on a nearby street\". \nHe said the dog had been acting \"extremely aggressively\".\nThe force is waiting for an expert witness to formally identify the traits of the dog.\nCh Supt Hobrough said it was \"no doubt dangerous, hazardous and harrowing\" for both the officers attending and the local community. \nPeople at the scene used a distraction technique to get Jack out at \"the first available opportunity\", he said.\nPeople have started to leave flowers at the house where the attack happened - \"RIP Little One\" is one of the messages.\nMany have described the panic and chaos of the scenes yesterday as police arrived on the scene.\nThose officers remain outside the house today, with forensic officers now in and out gathering evidence.\nThe house is in the middle of a large housing estate, family homes with kids' toys in the gardens of many of the houses. \nToday, the shock and sadness in the community is clear - a murky and wet day in Caerphilly mirrors the mood of many. \nParamedics were also called to the scene, where Jack was pronounced dead.\n\"My condolences and thoughts are with Jack's family, friends, school friends and everyone affected by this within the community,\" Ch Supt Hobrough added.\n\"Officers are continuing to make further inquiries at this time and will remain at the scene as the investigation progresses.\"\nNeighbours described being alerted to \"screaming\" in the street on Monday afternoon. \nResident Lorraine Irvine said: \"The kids - they were hysterical. \n\"And within minutes I've never seen so many police cars in my life.\"\nNeighbour Tracey Lawrence said: \"The little boy that lives there ran over to a neighbour saying the dog was attacking his friend and the neighbour couldn't help and couldn't save the boy.\"\nAnother resident, Ricky Willis, said: \"The first I heard of it my neighbour knocked on my door, it's a big shock.\n\"I've lived on this road for 46 years and I've never seen anything like this happen.\"\nOne neighbour, who asked not to be named, described the scene as \"chaos\".\nWhile another said: \"I feel sick to my stomach thinking about what happened to that boy.\"\nHead teacher Mr Rees described Jack as a \"bright and caring pupil who was popular amongst his peers and the teaching staff\".\n\"Our thoughts are very much with his family at this difficult time and we now need time and space to heal together as a school community.\"\nHe said support was being made available for pupils and staff over the coming days \"as we come to terms with this devastating news\".\nCouncillor Steven Skivens, who represents the Penyrheol ward on Caerphilly council, described it as \"an absolutely devastating incident with the loss of such a young life\".\nHe said Jack's family would need time to grieve and \"will need space to get over this incident, if that's possible\".\nSpeaking at First Minister's Questions, Mark Drakeford said: \"You can just imagine the impact this will have on those very young children who know him and who would have, in some cases, very sadly witnessed those awful events.\"\n\"Members here will be thinking about Jack and his family,\" he said, in response to a question by Hefin David, the Member of the Senedd for Caerphilly.\n\"I'm sure that everyone in this chamber would wish to send their condolences and best thoughts to the family and the community of Penyrheol who undoubtedly will rally round in these circumstances,\" said Mr David.

      "tags": "Belarus,Russia,Europe migrant crisis,European Union,UN Security Council,Poland",
      "text": "Western members of the UN Security Council have condemned Belarus for the escalating crisis over migrants stranded on its border with Poland.\nIn a strongly worded statement, they accused Belarus of using the migrants to destabilise the European Union's eastern border.\nRussia, Belarus's main ally, rejected the accusations.\nEarlier, Belarus's authoritarian leader threatened to cut off gas supplies to Europe if new sanctions were imposed.\nThousands of people, many of them Kurds arriving from the Middle East, are camping at the border with Poland, enduring freezing conditions in the hope of crossing into the EU. The migrants are mainly young men - but there are also women and children.\nCrowds have tried to cut through a barbed wire fence to enter Poland this week - only to be pushed back by Polish border guards and the army. However, some migrants have managed to slip through.\nOvernight temperatures have fallen to freezing and at least seven people have died in recent weeks, many from hypothermia.\nAt Thursday's emergency UN Security Council meeting, Western member states issued a joint statement, accusing Belarus of putting migrants' lives in danger \"for political purposes\". \nThey also said Belarus was trying to divert \"attention away from its own increasing human rights violations\".\nThe statement was issued by France, the UK and the US, all permanent Council members. They were joined by Albania, Estonia and the Republic of Ireland. \nRussia, also a permanent Council member, rejected the accusations and blamed Poland and neighbouring Lithuania for mistreating migrants. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council all have the right to veto resolutions.\n\"There are a lot of cases when Polish and Lithuanian border guards beat migrants and pushed them back to Belarusian territory,\" said the Russian deputy ambassador to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy. \n\"I would say that this is total shame and a total violation of any possible international conventions and rules.\"\nEarlier on Thursday, Belarus's leader Alexander Lukashenko said his country would have to respond if the EU imposed a fifth series of sanctions. \nThe EU says he started the border crisis by luring migrants in retaliation for sanctions imposed over his brutal crackdown of protesters and critics. Belarusians took to the streets last year after he claimed a widely discredited election victory.\n\"We are heating Europe, and they are threatening us,\" he said, referring to a Russian gas pipeline that runs through Belarus and into the EU.\n\"And what if we halt natural gas supplies? Therefore, I would recommend the leadership of Poland, Lithuanians and other empty-headed people to think before speaking.\"\nHis comments raised fresh fears amid worsening natural gas shortages and rising prices in Europe. \nThe EU's economy commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said the 27-member bloc \"should not be intimidated\". Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya accused the president of \"bluffing\" over his gas ultimatum.\nBelarus receives significant transit fees for the pipelines transporting Russian gas to the EU. Any decision would have to be approved by Russia, which is anxious for its new Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany to be certified.\nBut Katja Yafimava, from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said Mr Lukashenko's threat should be taken seriously.\n\"If the EU pushes Belarus too hard, it may act on this threat,\" Dr Yafimava said, adding that this could push up gas prices across Europe, including in the UK.\nMr Lukashenko has repeatedly denied Belarus is sending migrants to its borders with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia in revenge for existing EU sanctions.\nHowever, a new round of EU measures could be introduced as early as Monday. Possible measures include stopping international airlines carrying migrants from landing at the airport in the Belarusian capital Minsk. \nTurkey's national carrier Turkish Airlines has said it will be restricting the sale of tickets on some routes for citizens of Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\nIraq has said it is organising repatriation flights for Iraqi nationals from Belarus.\nThe EU is also reportedly considering sanctions against the Russian state airline Aeroflot for transporting migrants to Belarus, an allegation Aeroflot denies.\nBelarusian national carrier Belavia was in May banned from EU skies after a Ryanair flight was forced to divert to Minsk and a dissident journalist arrested.\nMeanwhile, at the Polish border, stranded migrants have continued to try breaching the razor-wire fence.\nPoland has been accused of pushing people back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum.\n\"There's no way to escape,\" 33-year-old Shwan Kurd told the BBC, who described arriving in Belarus at the start of November. \n\"Poland won't let us in. We are so hungry. There's no water or food here. There are little children, old men and women,\" he said."

      "tags": "Carbon capture and storage,Greenhouse gas emissions,COP26,Electric cars,Climate change,Renewable energy,Carbon neutrality",
      "text": "The COP26 climate summit in Glasgow has been billed as a last chance to limit global warming to 1.5C. \nBut beyond the deals and photo opportunities, what are the key things countries need to do in order to tackle climate change?\nBurning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and especially coal, releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, trapping heat and raising global temperatures. \nIt's an issue which has to be tackled at government level if temperature rises are to be limited to 1.5C - the level considered the gateway to dangerous climate change. \nHowever, many major coal-dependent countries - such as Australia, the US, China and India - have declined to sign a deal at the summit aimed at phasing out the energy source in the coming decades. \nA recent UN report has suggested that reducing emissions of methane could make an important contribution to tackling the planetary emergency. \nA substantial amount of methane is released from \"flaring\" - the burning of natural gas during oil extraction - and could be stopped with technical fixes. Finding better ways of disposing of rubbish is also important, because landfill sites are another big methane source.\nAt COP26, nearly 100 countries agreed to cut methane emissions, in a deal spearheaded by the US and the EU. The Global Methane Pledge aims to limit methane emissions by 30% compared with 2020 levels.\nElectricity and heat generation make a greater contribution to global emissions than any economic sector. \nTransforming the global energy system from one reliant on fossil fuels to one dominated by clean technology - known as decarbonisation - is critical for meeting current climate goals. \nWind and solar power will need to dominate the energy mix by 2050 if countries are to deliver on their net zero targets.\nThere are challenges, however.\nLess wind means less electricity generated, but better battery technology could help us store surplus energy from renewables, ready to be released when needed.\nWe'll also need to change the way we power the vehicles we use to get around on land, sea and in the air. \nDitching petrol and diesel cars and switching to electric vehicles will be critical. \nLorries and buses could be powered by hydrogen fuel, ideally produced using renewable energy. \nAnd scientists are working on new, cleaner fuels for aircraft, although campaigners are also urging people to reduce the number of flights they take. \nA UN report in 2018 said that, to have a realistic chance of keeping the global temperature rise under 1.5C, we'll have to remove CO2 from the air. \nForests are excellent at soaking it up from the atmosphere - one reason why campaigners and scientists emphasise the need to protect the natural world by reducing deforestation. \nProgrammes of mass tree-planting are seen as a way of offsetting CO2 emissions. \nTrees are likely to be important as countries wrestle with their net zero targets, because once emissions have been reduced as much as possible, remaining emissions could be \"cancelled out\" by carbon sinks such as forests. \nEmerging technologies that artificially remove CO2 from the atmosphere, or stop it being released in the first place, could play a role. \nA number of direct-air capture facilities are being developed, including plants built by Carbon Engineering in Texas and Climeworks in Switzerland. They work by using huge fans to push air through a chemical filter that absorbs CO2. \nAnother method is carbon capture and storage, which captures emissions at \"point sources\" where they are produced, such as at coal-fired power plants. The CO2 is then buried deep underground. \nHowever, the technology is expensive - and controversial, because it is seen by critics as helping perpetuate a reliance on fossil fuels. \nAt the Copenhagen COP summit in 2009, rich countries pledged to provide $100bn (\u00a374.6bn) in financing by 2020, designed to help developing countries fight and adapt to climate change. \nThat target date has not been met, although the UK government, as holders of the COP presidency, recently outlined a plan for putting the funding in place by 2023. \nMany coal-dependent countries are facing severe energy shortages that jeopardise their recovery from Covid and disproportionately affect the poor. These factors stop them moving away from polluting industries.  \nSome experts believe poorer nations will need continuing financial support to help them move towards greener energy. For instance, the US, EU and UK recently provided $8.5bn to help South Africa phase out coal use. "

      "text": "The size of Wales is a common unit of measurement - but the country's outline could slightly change over the next century due to climate change.\nNatural Resources Wales (NRW) said protecting all areas was \"difficult against the forces of nature\".\nMore than 71,000 properties are currently at risk of flooding in Wales from tidal sources, the environment body added.\nNRW has said coastal flooding and erosion is \"a big risk for Wales\".\nJeremy Parr, its head of flood and incident risk management, said in decades to come there will be \"some tough decisions in some locations where we might need to relocate some small communities and certainly make space for water and look after our environment.\"\nWales has 1,680 miles of coastline which surrounds the country on three sides, and about 60% of the Welsh population live in coastal areas.\nMr Parr said coastal flooding and erosion would be \"a big risk for Wales\" and \"all indications are it's going to get worse.\"\n\"We can expect sea level rise for one thing and some of the predictions around that are quite scary,\" he added.\n\"The coastline is a dynamic environment. Parts of the coast will erode and fall away into the sea.\"\n\"You get increased storminess and increase in winds. That can increase the water level even further and make conditions along the coast, really, really treacherous - and it means that there will be more flooding and it means that there will be more erosion.\"\nPeople are able to check the long term flood risk of their area or street online.\nThe warning follows a major landslide on the north Wales coastline earlier this year when cliffs of about 40m (131ft) wide fell onto a beach at Nefyn in Gwynedd.\nNRW said it \"makes sense\" to protect some vulnerable coastal towns and areas that are home to Wales' key infrastructure - like major roads and railways - and heritage sites such as castles.\nThe environmental watchdog has been working with local authorities and the Welsh government for several years to develop shoreline management plans for areas where climate change posed a particular challenge.\nBut NRW acknowledges that losing areas of land to the seas was a difficult topic and needed to be handled sensitively so that people were not frightened.\nAs the COP26 climate summit draws to a close in Glasgow, the Royal Meteorological Society said cases of such extreme weather were on the increase, and global warming had serious implications.\n\"The Royal Met Society has been around since 1850 and we've seen a lot of extreme events here in the UK over that time,\" said chief executive Liz Bentley.\n\"But what we're finding because of climate change is that those events are becoming more frequent.\n\"One degree has made a big shift in what we're seeing in rainfall patterns. It also means we've started to see a significant increase in sea levels. So the sea level has risen by about 16 centimetres, which again, doesn't sound very much, but for low-lying areas that has a huge impact.\"\nOne leading geographical professor said Wales' coastline would \"change a lot\" in low lying areas with the sea moving inland.\n\"On the higher elevation areas there won't be that much change but there will be cliff falls,\" said Prof Richard Lucas, from Aberystwyth University's geography and earth sciences department.\nHe said that although the landscape had changed in the past, the pace of change was a new phenomenon.\n\"It's the speed of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the speed that sea levels and other factors like flooding are changing.\n\"So the sea level is rising more rapidly than in the past, and ecosystems and people have to respond to that. And sometimes it's just too fast for them.\" \nHe added that to avoid a change in the shape of Wales, sea defences would \"need to be strengthened into the future\". The situation \"depends on the actions of people and how we respond to changing climate.\"\nRead more about the COP26 summit here."

      "tags": "Immigration,Refugees and asylum seekers,Europe migrant crisis,Dover",
      "text": "A further 1,185 people crossed the English Channel by boat to reach the UK on Thursday, a new record for migrant crossings in a single day - as mild weather made the journey less risky.\nFour Border Force vessels intercepted boats that were spotted off the coast and escorted them into Dover.\nThree people are feared lost at sea as two kayaks were found adrift near Calais, French authorities said.\nA Whitehall source accused France of losing control of the situation.\nMore than 23,000 people have made the crossing from France to the UK by boat so far this year, a sharp rise on the 8,404 in 2020 - and far more than in years before the pandemic, when most asylum seekers arrived by plane, ferry or train.\nOn Friday the Home Office confirmed the exact numbers, saying 1,185 people were rescued - or intercepted and brought to shore - by the Border Force, while French authorities intercepted and prevented 99 people from reaching the UK.\nAccording to authorities in France, the three people who are unaccounted for were reported missing by other migrants. Others have also been reported missing in recent weeks, and two people are confirmed to have died.\nUK officials say they want to stop the Channel crossings - describing them as dangerous and unnecessary.\nA Home Office spokesperson said the number of migrant crossings on Thursday was \"unacceptable\". The previous record was 853 people crossing on 3 November.\n\"The British public have had enough of seeing people die in the Channel while ruthless criminal gangs profit from their misery and our New Plan for Immigration will fix the broken system which encourages migrants to make this lethal journey,\" the spokesperson said.\nBy Simon Jones, BBC News\nIn previous years, the onset of autumn has seen a big drop in the number of people making the perilous crossing. This year, though, that hasn't happened.  \nIt's partly down to the recent mild and calm conditions. But it also suggests that the method of crossing the Channel by boat is seen as the most successful way of getting to the UK - and migrants in northern France are prepared to wait for the right weather to do that.  \nThe British government has repeatedly promised to make the route unviable. \nIt has explored the idea of turning boats back at sea, but that tactic has yet to be used - and has been condemned by the French authorities.  \nThe big hope now for ministers is their New Plan for Immigration - currently passing through the Commons - which would make it harder for anyone arriving by boat to claim asylum successfully.  \nBut that is likely to face legal challenge - and refugee groups have condemned the idea as cruel.  \nThe head of the Immigration Service Union - the union that represents Border Force staff - earlier told the BBC that conditions at the building which houses migrants at Dover docks were not good. \nLucy Moreton said at one point this week, more than 490 migrants had spent more than 24 hours in the centre - which has only two portable toilets - and migrants sleep on a concrete floor.\nUnder the government's proposed changes to immigration, which are being considered by MPs, people seeking protection as refugees would have their asylum claim partly assessed on how they arrived in the UK.\nPeople arriving by what the government calls illegal means would no longer have the same entitlement to claim asylum.\nBut the Refugee Council has said people fleeing war and terror are forced to take extraordinary measures and do not have a choice about how they seek safety.\nIt said the government's plan would create a two-tier system in which some refugees would be unfairly punished for the way they are able to reach the UK.\nOther charities are calling on the government to change its approach to migrants, with the British Red Cross saying: \"Nobody puts their life at risk unless they are absolutely desperate and feel they have no other options.\"\nAnd Amnesty International said people are making such journeys \"largely because there are no safe and legal routes open to them\".\nThe people who cross the Channel come to the UK from the poorest and most chaotic parts of the world - including Yemen, Eritrea, Chad, Egypt, Sudan and Iraq.\nUnder international law, people have the right to seek asylum in whichever country they arrive, and there is nothing to say you must seek asylum in the first safe country. It is very hard to apply to the UK for asylum unless you are already in the country. \nMost migrants arriving into the UK in small boats can expect to be granted refugee status by the Home Office, according to analysis of official figures.\nIn the 17 months to May this year, 70% of the 12,000 people arriving in small boats came from five countries: Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria and Vietnam, according to data obtained by the Refugee Council under Freedom of Information legislation.\nFull details of the data will be in a report to be published next week.\nOfficial figures show that most asylum seekers from all those countries, except for Iraq, are granted refugee status at their first hearing.\nAmong the top five nationalities arriving by boat, 60% can expect to be accepted as refugees at their initial assessment.\nSome of those initially refused asylum will go on to get refugee status on appeal. For example, 59% of appeals by Iranians are successful, 69% by Sudanese asylum seekers and 73% by Syrians.\nThe figures suggest only about a third of those arriving are not deemed to be refugees.\nApplications for asylum in the UK fell in the months after global travel was limited due to Covid-19, and numbers remain slightly lower than before the pandemic.\nIn 2019, there were 35,737 asylum applications, which fell to 29,815 in 2020. Figures for the first half of 2021 showed 14,670 applications.\nThe UK is also paying \u00a354m to France to increase Channel patrols, but John Vine, former independent chief inspector of borders and migration, told BBC Newsnight he did not think the measures would be effective.\nHe said it was possible to patrol the 200km of French coast for \"a long, long period of time\" without ever coming across migrant boats or criminal gangs.\n\"There needs to be much more focus I think on organised crime, where the money is going,\" he said.\nAre you in the area?

      "text": "Bangladeshi climate scientist, Saleemul Huq, is at COP26 to advise the world's least developed countries. In the latest in a series of first-person accounts, he describes the mood as the UN climate conference nears its conclusion.\nThis is my 26th COP, I've actually been to every single one. I'm not here as a negotiator but as an adviser to the group of Least Developed Countries - the 46 countries who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. \nMy own country is badly affected - there are nearly 170 million people in Bangladesh living on less than 150,000 sq km on the delta of two of the world's biggest rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Because of this, vast numbers of people are extremely vulnerable.\nI originally started advising the group of Least Developed Countries on the issue of adaptation to climate change, but now that we're suffering the impacts of climate change we're no longer simply able to adapt to it. So, more recently, I've been advising them on a new and emerging topic - loss and damage from climate change. It's a highly politically contentious issue - rich countries don't like talking about it because they feel it will open them up to liability and compensation claims. \nYesterday, we saw the first draft of the agreement. There's a great deal of disappointment in the lack of ambition in that draft, but in calling for more support for developing countries and recognising that more finance is needed, I think they've done something quite positive on loss and damage. That's the one issue that I was wishing and fighting for and we can now build on this for COP27 next year, which will be an African COP.\nMy Day at COP26:\nThere have been two weeks of meetings here. They go through ups and downs. Some are more important than others, some very technical, some highly political. But the core business is the negotiations.\nNow that we have asked for revisions to the draft agreement, we are waiting to see what the presidency does next. These last-minute deals are all dependent on how strongly countries express their views on what they want included and what they want excluded. \nWe have a history of going into overtime at COP which muddies the waters and makes people angry and not willing to compromise. We have just over 24 hours to go and I get a sense that things are moving in the right direction. The atmospherics are positive. Yesterday, we had a big announcement from China and the US that they would work together - so that's a very good thing. \nThe only caveat is that anything we achieve here in Glasgow is not going to be enough. But it will be something, and so we'll celebrate something, while knowing that it isn't enough.\nAs told to Sarah McDermott\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "Health minister Robin Swann is finalising proposals to improve pay for social care staff in Northern Ireland.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health said officials have been in discussion with employers and a decision was due \"in the very near future\".\nConcern has been growing about a shortage of staff in the sector.\nSome domiciliary care companies have had to withdraw services as they struggle to recruit. \nThe spokesperson said: \"The department can confirm that discussions have been ongoing in respect of funding for remuneration of staff in the domiciliary care and the wider social care sector and that proposals are being finalised. \n\"Notwithstanding ongoing budgetary pressures, the minister intends to announce his decision in the very near future.\n\"In developing these proposals, we have had constructive engagement with social care employers with the shared objective of improving terms and conditions for employees.\"\nAt present, about 75% of home care in Northern Ireland is provided by the independent sector.\nOn Thursday, Dr Bob Brown of the Western Health and Social Care Trust told councillors in Londonderry the domiciliary care sector was struggling to recruit and retain staff.\nHe said an additional \u00a32 per hour could have a \"significant impact\".\nDr Brown, the trust's director of care and older people's services, told the council's health committee the department has been working with the trust \"to identify ways this winter to incentivise domiciliary care\".\n\"Terms and conditions are a key issue,\" Dr Brown said.\nHe added: \"There has been some calculations that indicate, that assuming an increase in the hourly rate gets straight into the carers' hands rather than the provider's hands, it could have a very significant impact on recruitment, even a \u00a32 per hour increase.\"\nThe Western Trust said that proposals on domiciliary care staff pay \"are under active consideration\".\n\"To clarify, these are not Western Trust proposals but NI-wide proposals led by the minister and department,\" the trust said, in a statement.\n\"They form part of a package of measures being finalised to support the domiciliary care sector through this winter.\n\"In addition, proposals for the longer-term reform of adult social care will shortly be the subject of a public consultation launched by the minister.\n\"The consultation will include the vital issue of properly rewarding and recognising social care staff - which the minister has made clear is a priority for him.\"\nAbout 1,600 people across Northern Ireland have been assessed as needing a care package - that is they need help with washing, dressing or cooking, or adaptations to their home.\nMany are waiting in hospitals or care homes because there is not enough home-based carers to provide the level of care they require.\nDomiciliary or home care packages allow those who are ill or vulnerable to be cared for in their own house.\nBut, according to the Northern Trust, some independent providers have raised concerns about the sustainability of their service as they do not have enough staff.\nThe trust said the problem is particularly acute in the Mid Ulster area with concerns also emerging in Causeway area too.\nWhile it is mostly the independent sector that is affected, BBC News NI understands that the trust's own service is experiencing challenges which may mean reducing the number of calls. \nFigures from the Department of Health show that as of October the number of people waiting for a care package, many of whom are in care homes, has dropped to 1,657.\nThat includes:\nBBC News NI understands that many front-line care staff feel the number waiting on care packages could be much higher."

      "text": "The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has welcomed what he says is \"a changing tone of discussion\" in talks about the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nMaro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d was talking after a meeting in London with Lord Frost.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said he was hopeful the two sides could make progress on the supply of medicines next week.\nMeanwhile, Lord Frost said there were still \"significant gaps\" to be bridged between the bloc and the UK, and that talks would be \"intensified\". \nThe protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods.\nThat means that goods can flow freely between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, removing the threat of a \"hard border\".\nHowever, goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control - amounting to what is being referred to as an \"Irish Sea border\".\nThe UK wants fundamental changes to the operation and governance of the protocol. \nThe EU has proposed a package of measures which would reduce its practical impact.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said there would still need to be a \"reciprocal\" move from the UK.\nHe added: \"We need to make serious headway in the course of next week.\n\"This is particularly important as regards the issue of medicines. I stand by my commitment to do whatever it takes to address this issue in line with what industry tells us.\"\nHe said agreement in this area could be a \"blueprint\" for reaching a wider deal\".\nIn a statement, a UK government spokesperson said the preference \"remained to find a consensual way forward\", but that Article 16 was a \"legitimate safeguard\".\n\"Lord Frost also underlined the need to address the full range of issues the UK had identified in the course of discussions, if a comprehensive and durable solution was to be found that supported the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and was in the best interests of Northern Ireland.\n\"In this context, although talks had so far been conducted in a constructive spirit, Lord Frost underlined that in order to make progress, it was important to bring new energy and impetus to discussions.\"\nThe spokesperson said next week's talks would be \"intensified\".\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the UK government needed to take \"decisive action within weeks\". \nHe added: \"It is essential that either the government gets agreement with the EU, and in the absence of such an agreement that it does move to trigger Article 16.\"\nThe protocol means Northern Ireland is still in the EU's pharmaceutical regulatory system.\nHowever it continues to get most of its medicines from Great Britain which is outside the EU's system.\nThis is creating potential supply complications which have lead some firms in GB to indicate they will stop supplying products to NI.\nNothing has changed so far as a \"grace period\" means the protocol is not yet being implemented for medicines.\nThe EU's acknowledges that as it stands the protocol creates too much of a burden in this area and should be changed.\nIn October it published proposals to tackle the difficulties, which will include changing EU law.\nIf the protocol is causing serious difficulties either side can unilaterally suspend the relevant parts of it by using the Article 16 safeguards clause.\nHowever, UK ministers have said such a move is not imminent."

      "tags": "Our Planet Now,COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "The president of the COP26 climate summit said the talks had reached a \"moment of truth for our planet\".\nAs the meeting entered its final hours, he urged delegates to agree to a draft agreement aimed at averting dangerous global warming.\nBut he faced late objections from India and others to a clause on cutting fossil fuels, and calls for more financial help for developing nations.\nIt's still not clear what needs to happen for these issues to be resolved.\n\"You all know that the world is willing us on to be bold - to be ambitious\" said the UK's Alok Sharma, who is chairing the talks. \n\"So much rests on the decisions we collectively take today,\" he told delegates, urging them to get on board with the draft plan published earlier on Saturday.\nThe key achievements of the draft so far are the inclusion of a commitment to phase-out coal, re-visiting emissions-cutting plans on a more regular basis and increased financial help for developing countries.\nBut India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav told the meeting that \"consensus remains elusive\".\nIn an apparent reference to coal, he said: \"Targeting any particular sector is uncalled for. Every country will arrive at net zero as per its national circumstances.\"\n\"Developing countries have a right to their fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels,\" he added.\nHe also objected to proposals to end \"inefficient fossil fuel subsidies\" - financial benefits provided to producers of oil, gas and coal.\nChina, which is understood to have earlier raised concerns about the wording, said it hoped that \"all parties will show excellent flexibility\" and said it now wanted only small edits to the text.\nSouth Africa's negotiator backed objections over the section on fossil fuels saying: \"We don't feel that one size fits all is a good approach.\" \nBut Mr Sharma said the text was a \"balanced package\".\nUS climate envoy John Kerry said: \"If it's a good negotiation all the parties are uncomfortable. And this, I think, has been a good negotiation.\"\nLia Nicholson, from Antigua and Barbuda's delegation, and speaking on behalf of small island states, said they were \"extremely disappointed\" by the lack of progress on loss and damage - the principle that richer countries, which bear the main responsibility for the global warming, should pay compensation to poorer ones because of climate impacts.\nShe said: \"We will express our grievances in due course,\" but added: \"We implore all parties to support our common outcome and move forward.\"\nPromises in Glasgow will not be enough to limit global warming to 1.5C. It is a key part of the 2015 Paris agreement that most countries signed up to.\nScientists say that limiting temperature rise to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels will protect us from the most dangerous impacts of climate change. \nMeeting the goal requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by 2050. One example of the impact of global temperature rise above 2C is the death of virtually all tropical coral reefs, scientists say.\nOne estimate by the Climate Action Tracker calculated that the planet is still set to warm by 2.4C if the current pledges are all met. \nAt COPs, it often all comes down to a huddle. Inside the main Plenary Room, the days of negotiations turn into a face-to-face discussion, like merchants in a souk. \nAround them, delegates cluster, keen to be there at the moment when key differences between the groups or countries are resolved. \nThis afternoon, US climate envoy John Kerry and chief US negotiator Sue Biniaz stood toe-to-toe with Ahmadou Sebory Toure, the delegate from Guinea, who also represents the G77 group of nations, a large part of the developing world. \nAt stake, how much money the developed world may have to pay to the developing world to compensate for the loss and damage done to developing countries because of climate change. \nInterest in that ends when Mr Kerry sweeps across the room to talk to the UK President of the COP, Alok Sharma and his chief negotiator, Archie Young. \nThen, all eyes move to the EU's chief negotiator, Frans Timmermans, as his team work out the repercussions of the G77 huddle. \nEventually, the COP chairman decides enough is enough and further discussions must take place elsewhere. The session ends and so do the huddles. For now.\nBut experts say the 1.5C target is still achievable: at COP15 in Copenhagen more than a decade ago, estimates suggested the world was heading for between 3.5 and 4.2C of warming.\nIf the references to phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies remain in the final deal, it would be an historic moment in climate negotiations.\nGabriela Bucher, Oxfam's international executive director, said: \"Clearly some world leaders think they aren't living on the same planet as the rest of us. It seems no amount of fires, rising sea levels or droughts will bring them to their senses to stop increasing emissions at the expense of humanity. \n\"The world's poorest have done the least to cause the climate emergency, yet are the ones left struggling to survive while also footing the bill.\nClimate finance, or the money promised by richer countries to poorer countries to fight climate change, continues to be one of the most contentious points. In 2009, developed nations pledged to provide $100bn per year to emerging economies by 2020. But this target was not met.\nA series of agreements between groups of countries have been announced so far:"

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the COP26 climate change conference on Friday.\nAs the UN's COP26 climate summit enters its final day, fears are growing it will not meet its goals. A final deal has been tabled in Glasgow but representatives must now discuss the details until all 197 countries agree. And UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres says governments are unlikely to make the pledges necessary to cut CO2 emissions by enough to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.  However, he told the Associated Press news agency hope remained \"until the last moment\".\nThe summit is scheduled to close at 18:00GMT, although negotiations could continue overnight.\nWhile delegates work towards reducing carbon emissions, an initial assessment for the UK government suggests emissions from the summit itself are likely to reach the equivalent of 102,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide. That's similar to the annual emissions from about 10,000 UK households and double those from the last climate summit. The government points out more than 39,000 participants have been in Glasgow, against 27,000 in Madrid in 2019.\nWales joined a new global alliance of countries pledging to stop licensing oil and gas production, along with Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Greenland, the Republic of Ireland, Quebec, California and New Zealand - but not the rest of the UK. Meanwhile, representatives from Ghana, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Tuvalu held a news conference claiming the US was blocking progress at COP26. They say the US is dismissing the financial concerns of the poorest and most vulnerable nations.\n4. How will COP26 change our day-to-day lives?\nWhile climate scientists and politicians wrestle with cutting carbon emissions in a bid to limit climate change, you could be forgiven for wondering about the impact of policies on daily life. \"How is the average family going to find the extra \u00a320,000 needed to buy an electric vehicle?\" wonders Nicola Hippisley, of London. Our correspondent Chris Morris answers this - electric cars may soon be similarly priced to petrol or diesel models - and more of your questions. \nWhen Nandi Bushell, from Ipswich, penned a climate change song after learning about the subject in school, she couldn't have imagined it would end up being shared by Barack Obama. The 11-year-old had already performed with Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl after publicly challenging him to a \"drum off\". But she said it was \"incredible\" to have the former US president praise the song she wrote with Roman Morello, son of Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello.\nCOP26 PUSH NOTIFICATIONS: If you want to keep up with the latest around the climate summit, tap here to receive alerts on your phone.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThere has been criticism of the number of people who have flown to the summit, including some in private jets. Aviation contributes about 2% of the world's global carbon emissions, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and it creates non-CO2 emissions at altitude, which have an additional warming effect. An economy-class return flight from London to New York emits an estimated 0.67 tonnes of CO2 per passenger. That's equivalent to 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK, or about the same as those produced over a year by someone in Ghana.\nWhat questions do you have about changes in our climate? \nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Teenagers in England will be given advance warning of some exam content next year because of disruption caused by Covid, the government says.\nNew plans also say GCSE and A-level students should sit three sets of mock exams to help decide grades, if exams are cancelled.\nTeacher-assessed grades have been used for the past two years.\nThe headteachers' union said schools would be relieved - but that it placed \"a great deal of pressure\" on pupils.\nLabour criticised the government for a \"delay\" in confirming a Covid backup plan.\nUnder plans confirmed by the Department for Education (DfE), AS and A-level students will be given some indication of the content exams will focus on, to help with revision.\nThere will be more changes to GCSEs - with formulae provided in maths exams, and equations in physics and combined science assessments.\nIn English literature, history and geography, schools will be advised to focus on a narrower range of content.\nAdvance warnings about content for both sets of exams will be issued by early February.\nThe DfE has also issued a back-up plan in the \"unlikely\" event that exams are cancelled.\nIt advises that, for subjects which are usually assessed with exams, schools assess pupils three times: in the second half of the autumn term, in the spring term and in the first half of the summer term.\nIt says these should be held \"under exam-like conditions wherever possible\" - meaning they should be timed, and without access to books and revision notes.\nJulie McCulloch from the Association of School and College Leaders said having a contingency plan would mean a lot of extra work.\nShe said it would \"probably\" mean that students take both mock exams - which \"may or may not count\" towards their ' final grades - and formal exams.\n\"This is far from ideal and places them under a great deal of pressure,\" she said.\n\"But not having a contingency plan would risk a repeat of the chaos of the past two years, and therefore, on balance, this seems like the right course of action, and the confirmed set of measures appears to be sensible enough.\"\nTwo years of replacement grades, after exams were cancelled in the pandemic, have had significantly higher results for GCSEs and A-levels.\nThe cancellations mean that next summer more than 700,000 teenagers in England will sit high-stakes real exams for the first time in their lives.\nThe regulator Ofqual said overall grades would be moderated to be halfway between 2019 and 2021.\nJo Saxton, its chief regulator, said in a letter to students \"exam boards will set the grade boundaries so that more students get higher grades in 2022 than before the pandemic\".\nShe said this would provide a \"safety net\" for students who may otherwise \"just miss out\" on a higher grade.\n\"We have taken this decision to reflect the disruption that you as a cohort have experienced already in your course,\" she wrote.\nKate Green MP, Labour's shadow education secretary, said that students and teachers had already \"had weeks of unnecessary uncertainty waiting for confirmation of assessment and contingency plans for 2022\".\nShe said Labour had published a \"plan B\" for exams at the beginning of the academic year, adding: \"The government's dither and delay has left teachers with less time and capacity to gather the samples of work needed.\"\nMinisters have made clear they expect exams to go ahead in 2022, unless there are exceptional circumstances.\n\"The government believes that exams and other formal assessments are the best and fairest means of assessment, and the government's firm intention is that students will take national exams in summer 2022, set and marked by the exam boards,\" the DfE said."

      "tags": "COP26,Glasgow,Antonio Guterres",
      "text": "The COP26 climate summit in Glasgow is entering its final day, amid growing fears that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C is unlikely to be met.\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres bluntly told the Associated Press news agency that goal was on \"life support\".\nHe said the summit would probably not see governments make the pledges needed to cut CO2 emissions by enough.\nEarlier, COP26 President Alok Sharma warned that time was running out to close a deal before the summit ended.\nScientists say limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C will help humanity avoid the worst climate impacts. This is compared with pre-industrial temperatures.\nAt Paris in 2015, world leaders pledged to try to keep the world from warming by more than between 1.5C to 2C through sweeping greenhouse gas emissions cuts. Latest projections are for a rise of 2.7C.\nMr Guterres warned that promises to reduce emissions were meaningless while governments continued to invest in fossil fuels.\n\"Promises ring hollow when the fossil fuels industry still receives trillions in subsidies,\" he said.\nHe called the announcements made so far in Glasgow \"far from enough\", adding: \"We know what must be done.\"\nBut he said hope remained \"until the last moment\".\nMeanwhile, Mr Sharma called on negotiators to find solutions to difficult issues before the official closing of the summit scheduled for 18:00 GMT.\n\"Whilst the window on keeping 1.5 within reach is closing, it is still possible to get there,\" he said. \nMr Sharma also said more work was needed on Article 6, which is about carbon markets and how countries balance their fossil fuel use.\nMary Robinson, former Irish president and head of a group of senior political leaders on climate, accused some of the world's major carbon emitters of sabotaging any attempts to secure a more ambitious action-plan at COP26.\nShe told the Associated Press that Russia and Saudi Arabia were \"pushing back hard\" to block any mention in the final deal out of Glasgow of working to phase out coal, or to reduce government subsidies to fossil fuels.\nCOP26 is the biggest climate change conference since the landmark Paris talks. Some 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions - which cause global warming - by 2030.\nOn Thursday, a small group of countries announced an alliance to phase out oil and gas production. Led by Denmark and Costa Rica, Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance also includes France, Wales and Ireland - but not the UK.\nActivists and politicians cautiously welcomed Thursday's surprise declaration from the US and China to try to keep warming limited to 1.5C - but campaigners said both countries needed to take concrete action.\nMeanwhile, representatives from Ghana, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Tuvalu held a press conference claiming that the US was blocking progress at COP26. They say the US is dismissing the concerns of the poorest and most vulnerable nations over climate finance.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "A protester has climbed on top of a train near a power plant in North Yorkshire.\nThe Axe Drax campaign group said one of its activists \"halted the train\", which was carrying wood pellets and heading to Drax Power station in Selby. \nImages on social media show the activist, dressed in orange, waving a flag bearing the Extinction Rebellion logo. It comes as the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow draws to an end.\nDrax said there had been \"no impact\".\nAxe Drax said the demonstration was being carried out \"to send a clear message to COP26 - stop the fell\". \nIt said no other trains had been affected.\nThe activist, who goes by the name of Coffee, said: \"We need to keep the trees in the ground, we need a U-turn on the decision to phase out deforestation by 2030, we need to slam on the brakes.\n\"Halt the felling. Bring a moratorium on tree felling for six months whilst a plan is made for a future world economy.\"\nA Drax spokesperson said: \"Everyone has the right to peaceful protest but trespassing on railway lines puts the safety of train staff, as well as the protesters themselves, at risk.\"\n\"Drax Power Station has not been impacted by this action - it continues to generate renewable power for millions of homes and businesses.\"\nThe company said the power station had \"slashed our emissions from power generation by 90%\" since converting from using coal to \"sustainable biomass\".\nIt added Drax was \"helping the UK's electricity system to decarbonise faster than any other major economy\".\nBut in a tweet, the activist said the biofuel industry was more carbon intensive than coal.\nBy Paul Murphy, BBC Look North environment correspondent\nDrax is one of the UK's most controversial power stations and has been on the receiving end of environmental protest and direct action for more than a decade. \nCampaigners originally targeted it because of the huge quantities of coal it burned to make electricity. But now protesters are focused on Drax's use of wood pellets to generate power. \nDrax calls this fuel \"sustainable biomass\" and says it's good for the planet because the CO2 produced from burning wood is absorbed by the replenishment of forests where the wood comes from. \nBut scientists disagree over whether this process works as well as it should. \nThis direct action against a Drax freight train follows several days of environmental protest against the power station at the COP26 summit in Glasgow.\nIn the COP26 climate summit's first major deal, more than 100 world leaders promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, including Brazil where stretches of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down. \nAxe Drax said biomass production \"harms both people and planet\" and linked deforestation to \"an increase in flooding, soil degradation, biodiversity and habitat loss, noise and air pollution for local communities\". \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Celebrity and businesswoman Paris Hilton wrote on Twitter the \"moment is so long overdue\", adding: \"Your best days are yet to come!\"\nOn Monday, the Baby One More Time and Toxic singer wrote on Instagram that she hadn't \"prayed for something more in my life\".\n\"I know I've said some things on my Insta out of anger and I'm sorry but I'm only human... and I believe you'd feel the same way if you were me!\"\nIn a court appearance in June, the star asked the judge to end the \"abusive\" arrangement and said she was \"traumatised\". \nAddressing the court remotely, she said she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from getting married and having more children.\nHer testimony led her father to agree to step aside.\nA conservatorship is used for people who cannot make their own decisions and was put in place because of concerns about her mental health.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

I wouldn't even open the post because in my head I thought every letter was going to contain bad news,\" she said.\nShe would frequently wake in the middle of the night with panic attacks but was \"too terrified\" to go to the doctor because she thought she was going mad.\nMs Danzebrink added: \"Eventually it got to the point where I remember standing in my bedroom and thinking if this is my life, I don't think I want it any more.\"\nAfter coming \"within a whisper\" of attempting suicide, Ms Danzebrink said, she sought medical help.\nHer doctor recognised her behaviour was a result of the menopause and she started Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).\nShe said: \"We have successfully campaigned for menopause to be included in the school curriculum to ensure that all young people have a basic understanding, that will help them as they move through their lives.\n\"But we need better information for the entire population now so that people can help themselves or their partners, family, friends or colleagues.\"\nMr Salmon said he now wanted to help other partners and families spot symptoms so he can prevent others from suffering as he has.\n\"We need to talk about it and make people aware. It's the mental side of it, not just the physical side,\" he said.\n\"If you are in a similar situation, I would say help your wife, hold her hand, get her through it. \n\"You don't want to be where I am today, nobody needs to do that.\" \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Health minister Robin Swann is finalising proposals to improve pay for social care staff in Northern Ireland.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health said officials have been in discussion with employers and a decision was due \"in the very near future\".\nConcern has been growing about a shortage of staff in the sector.\nSome domiciliary care companies have had to withdraw services as they struggle to recruit. \nThe spokesperson said: \"The department can confirm that discussions have been ongoing in respect of funding for remuneration of staff in the domiciliary care and the wider social care sector and that proposals are being finalised. \n\"Notwithstanding ongoing budgetary pressures, the minister intends to announce his decision in the very near future.\n\"In developing these proposals, we have had constructive engagement with social care employers with the shared objective of improving terms and conditions for employees.\"\nAt present, about 75% of home care in Northern Ireland is provided by the independent sector.\nOn Thursday, Dr Bob Brown of the Western Health and Social Care Trust told councillors in Londonderry the domiciliary care sector was struggling to recruit and retain staff.\nHe said an additional \u00a32 per hour could have a \"significant impact\".\nDr Brown, the trust's director of care and older people's services, told the council's health committee the department has been working with the trust \"to identify ways this winter to incentivise domiciliary care\".\n\"Terms and conditions are a key issue,\" Dr Brown said.\nHe added: \"There has been some calculations that indicate, that assuming an increase in the hourly rate gets straight into the carers' hands rather than the provider's hands, it could have a very significant impact on recruitment, even a \u00a32 per hour increase.\"\nThe Western Trust said that proposals on domiciliary care staff pay \"are under active consideration\".\n\"To clarify, these are not Western Trust proposals but NI-wide proposals led by the minister and department,\" the trust said, in a statement.\n\"They form part of a package of measures being finalised to support the domiciliary care sector through this winter.\n\"In addition, proposals for the longer-term reform of adult social care will shortly be the subject of a public consultation launched by the minister.\n\"The consultation will include the vital issue of properly rewarding and recognising social care staff - which the minister has made clear is a priority for him.\"\nAbout 1,600 people across Northern Ireland have been assessed as needing a care package - that is they need help with washing, dressing or cooking, or adaptations to their home.\nMany are waiting in hospitals or care homes because there is not enough home-based carers to provide the level of care they require.\nDomiciliary or home care packages allow those who are ill or vulnerable to be cared for in their own house.\nBut, according to the Northern Trust, some independent providers have raised concerns about the sustainability of their service as they do not have enough staff.\nThe trust said the problem is particularly acute in the Mid Ulster area with concerns also emerging in Causeway area too.\nWhile it is mostly the independent sector that is affected, BBC News NI understands that the trust's own service is experiencing challenges which may mean reducing the number of calls. \nFigures from the Department of Health show that as of October the number of people waiting for a care package, many of whom are in care homes, has dropped to 1,657.\nThat includes:\nBBC News NI understands that many front-line care staff feel the number waiting on care packages could be much higher."

      "tags": "James Gallagher,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There is a never-ending stream of data about Covid and at times it can seem completely contradictory. So where do we stand at the moment?\nThe number of people testing positive is continuing to fall, but are we wrong to constantly tout this number around? It is looking certain that the epidemic in schoolchildren is in decline, but why, and will it last? And do we need to pay more attention to infections in older age groups? After all, they are the people at highest risk.\nThe main ways of tracking Covid are:\nEach has its own quirks that makes them flawed and yet revealing in different ways. It's only when you bring them all together that you get closer to the reality. \nNearly every source of data agrees that there is a lot of coronavirus around, but that has started to fall. \nThe latest number of cases (ie people who take a test and it's positive) is 34,029 on Friday, down from 43,467 on the same day last week.\nThe issue with that figure is that it is heavily influenced by the number of people choosing to get tested and some don't, especially if their wages depend on being free of Covid. \nThe React study at Imperial and the ONS both test people at random, whether they're sick or not, to see if they're harbouring the virus. \nThat makes them less biased, but people test positive for some time after catching the virus, so the picture they paint is always a bit out of date. \nReact recorded the highest levels of coronavirus since it started after the first wave, but says it may have started to fall in recent days. The ONS estimates one in 55 people in the UK has Covid - that's about 1.27 million of us. However, their data goes up only to 30 October, so is doubly out of date.\nThe R number for the UK, that's the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to, is between 0.9 and 1.1. That suggests the level of infections is roughly stable, but the way it is calculated means it again reflects what was happening weeks ago.\nThe Zoe Covid study app, which works in real time by getting people to log their symptoms, has recorded a 5% fall in Covid in the past week. \n\"Hopefully we're over the last great peak of Covid in 2021,\" said Prof Tim Spector, who analyses the data at King's College London.\nBut there is a danger in just looking at the headline number of cases - even though it is the mainstay of Covid coverage.\nProf Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, told me: \"We're tempted to be very concerned when cases rise sharply, and there seems to be a mood that we can relax when it starts to decline.\n\"I don't think it's helping anyone right now.\"\nProf Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick, agreed: \"Putting those figures in the public's eye every day does distract from what we should be looking at.\"\nWithin the data, there are two epidemics currently worth considering.\nThe big one in school pupils who are still mostly unvaccinated, but at relatively low risk from Covid. And an emerging one in at-risk groups, who are now being offered their booster doses.\nThe number of cases in school-age pupils surged through September and October, but is now in decline. That has become apparent, even in the laggy ONS data. \n\"For the first time in several weeks, we are seeing a decrease in infections among secondary school-aged children in England, although rates do remain high,\" said the ONS's Sarah Crofts. \nThe fall is likely to be a mix of a rampant outbreak in schools building up natural immunity, pupils who have been vaccinated, and the half-term effect when kids are no longer mixing in the classroom. The React scientists say they witnessed a similar effect 12 months ago, and cases rose once the school gates reopened. \nThe precise balance of those effects on Covid in children remains uncertain - is it a school break or herd immunity?\n\"That's the real question, I'm cautiously optimistic that it's that latter and it's a very significant moment if it is,\" said Prof John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nThe sheer scale of the rise and then fall in infections in young people means the overall picture is dominated by people who are generally at low risk of needing hospital treatment for Covid. \nProf Woolhouse said: \"Over-interpreting those large fluctuations in low-risk groups is misleading and I'm quite worried about those at high risk.\n\"Underlying those waves, there's been a rather steady increase in older age groups and I'm concerned about that.\"\nIt is worth stressing infections in older age groups are at low levels, and it is not yet clear how much the rise will matter.\nThe number of people being admitted to hospital looks to have plateaued at just over 1,000 a day in the UK.\n\"We haven't seen the massive increase in hospital admissions that some were concerned about, but we're not out of the woods yet,\" Prof Tildesley told BBC News. \nProf Spector, whose Zoe app data also showed continuing increases in infections in older age, said the pattern was \"worrying\" but that hopefully the booster campaign would prevent it becoming a major problem.\nProf Edmunds said: \"There's an enormous epidemic in children, it filters through to their parents and from them to others even more vulnerable, vaccines are stopping this being a disaster.\"\nBut he says if cases in children do turn a corner, then that should reduce the risk for everyone. \nIt is abundantly clear we are in an infinitely better position than last year which culminated in lockdowns. \nHowever, there is no certainty about how winter will go. \nWill cases in children continue to fall? If they do, will that lead to falls in other age groups? How will the booster campaign go? What will the weather be like (and will we all meet indoors as the temperature drops)? What will other diseases do and how will they pressure the NHS?\nChanges in behaviour could still change the course of the epidemic. While children's lives look much closer to pre-pandemic norms, that is not the same in adults. There is also the potential of new variants, such as the offshoot of delta - AY.4.2 to cause problems. \n\"It's an extremely complex picture and very hard to predict what is going to happen,\" said Prof Woolhouse.  \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "A man has been jailed for a minimum of 30 years for murdering a 16-year-old girl in a Chinese takeaway. \nChun Xu, 32, of no fixed address, was found guilty of strangling Wenjing Lin at the Blue Sky takeaway in Ynyswen, Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf on 5 March.\nWhile handing down the sentence at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, judge Paul Thomas told Xu: \"You killed her as a wicked act of revenge upon her mother.\"\nHe was sentenced to life and will serve a minimum of 30 years.\nHe was also convicted of the attempted murder of Wenjing's stepfather Yongquan Jiang who he stabbed in the face and neck 20 times.\nXu refused to enter the dock for sentencing but Judge Paul Thomas QC, addressing the dock as if he was present, said: \"You cruelly murdered an innocent 16-year-old girl in her own home.\n\"You killed her as a wicked act of revenge upon her mother; Wenjing had done nothing wrong to you at all.\n\"You, however, ended her life by strangling her with your hands, face to face.\"\nHe added that Xu's actions had left Wenjing's mother \"utterly bereft\" by someone she \"considered to be a member of her extended family\".\nThe judge added that Wenjing had had \"a life of infinite promise and all that potential\" but that was now \"unfulfillable\".\nThe trial heard Xu was considered to be a close family friend but he owed them money and wanted \"revenge\" on Wenjing's mother.\nHe strangled the schoolgirl as her parents slept nearby. \nHe then lured her stepfather into the basement of the takeaway and repeatedly stabbed him with two knives before attempting suicide by cutting his own throat. \nWenjing's mother, Meifang Xu, told the court via an interpreter that even though her daughter was no longer here, \"every morning I still wake up and make her breakfast. I still make her a cup of tea every night and put it in her empty bedroom\". \nShe also paid tribute to her daughter's friendship group.\n \"I cannot bear to look at her friends as they always look so sad, they are missing her terribly,\" she said.\nShe told the court that every day she watches video of Wenjing, \"trying to be close to her and to hear her voice\".\nWenjing's stepfather Yongquan Jiang told the judge he treated Wenjing as his own daughter. He said \"I loved her with all my heart and she treated me back the same.\n\"She was brutally murdered and I feel my heart is empty.\"\nHe added that he has repeated nightmares.\nHe said: \"I see Wenjing lying on the floor in the reception. \n\"I see Chun Xu face to face in my nightmares I don't know how to stop them. I don't know why he was so brutal to Wenjing and my family.\"\nShe described Wenjing as her \"walking stick\", someone who would translate for the family. She said the family now struggle to run their business without Wenjing's English language skills.\nThe judge told Xu: \"You will be in your 60s before you can even apply for parole to be released. That will be in the year 2051. \n\"You may never leave prison if it is not deemed safe and appropriate to release you.\" \nSenior prosecutor from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) Thomas Edwards said: \"Chun Xu took the life of an innocent girl who had a bright future ahead of her, and whilst this conviction will see him answer for that, it can never change what happened.\n\"The evidence presented by the CPS at court showed that he had also brought a knife with him to the property and used it to attack someone.   \n\"Our thoughts have been with the victims and their family throughout and will remain with them.\""

      "text": "Alok Sharma is hopeful a climate agreement can be reached at Glasgow's COP26 on Saturday.\nThe summit president said that a revised text would be released by about 08:00 with the aim to finish negotiations by \"Saturday pm\".\nNegotiators talked through the night on Thursday with a new draft deal produced on Friday morning\nMr Sharma called on countries for a \"final injection of that can-do spirit\" to get a deal over the line.\nThe climate talks had been due to end at 18:00. \nNicola Sturgeon said on Friday evening that she was \"cautiously optimistic\" about the outcome and that there were signs a deal was \"inching forward\" in the right direction as negotiations moved beyond the deadline. \nShe told COP26 leaders \"don't fail\" and said she wanted negotiators to be able to \"look the next generation in the eye\" with an agreement that would increase global temperatures by no more than 1.5C and urged them not to leave until a good deal had been achieved.\nThe first minister said there had been \"big concessions\", including from the United States on adaptation funding for developing countries. \nShe told BBC Scotland the final agreement would depend on the political will, determination and leadership that is shown in the hours ahead. \nOn the last scheduled day of the 13-day summit, hundreds of delegates walked out of COP26 to join a protest outside the UN blue zone.\nActivists took to the stage to express frustration at a lack of results.\nMembers of environmental groups and trade unions were among those who sang \"power to the people\" as they left the arena to join hundreds of protesters in the street outside the blue zone.\nThe latest draft agreement has watered-down commitments to end the use of coal and other fossil fuels.\nWhile the language around fossil fuels has been softened, the inclusion of the commitment in a final deal would be seen as a landmark moment.\nProtests, however, took place throughout the day with campaigners claiming the summit was falling far short of what is required. \nFollowing a \"People's Plenary\" session in one of the main halls organised by the Cop26 Coalition, activists from around the world marched through the venue with a group of indigenous activists leading the procession.\nThey carried banners and red ribbons to represent the red lines crossed by negotiators.\nAt a rally next to the COP26 venue, campaigners gathered for a street disco which turned sombre as speakers who came from inside the blue zone addressed the crowd. \nOne of the speakers, a 15-year-old from Chad, told how Lake Chad has dried up by 95% since the 1950s. \nBut despite being accredited for the summit the teenager said she has been excluded from key meetings. \nShe added: \"No one is listening. No one is doing anything.\"\nAnother speaker alluded to the weather and praised those who have braved the wet conditions.  \nShe told the audience: \"I hope you leave drenched in hope.\"\nSarah, 29, an Extinction Rebellion activist from Glasgow, was helping to hold up sign outside the UN blue zone which read: \"A Giant COP Up\". \nShe told the BBC: \"We are here today because COP has failed. \n\"COP has essentially been a giant trade show in which the fossil fuel executives have a bigger presence than delegates from countries most affected by climate change. \n\"It has shown that leaders, such as our own government, are content to let people suffer and let people die rather than take the action that is required.\"\nSarah said solutions to the climate crisis lie outside the barricaded SEC and on the streets, where some of the most affected groups had gathered to make their voice heard.\nThe atmosphere outside the UN blue zone was good natured, with activists even taking part in a mass Macarena dance.\nAround midday they were joined by delegates who filed out of the Scottish Event Campus.\nThe rally that followed featured contributions from a diverse range of international speakers and a common theme - politicians are not doing enough to address the climate crisis.\nThe event was on a much smaller scale than the colourful protests which snaked through the city last Friday and Saturday.\nBut shortly after 14:15, as I was taking pictures of the distinctive Extinction Rebellion red dancers, I heard a commotion to my left. \nI looked round to see a man attempting to scale the barrier.\nHe was immediately grabbed by three police officers and pinned to the ground. \nSeconds later, a few yards away, another protestor took advantage of the chaos and also tried to climb over the fence. He got his right leg over it before he was also hauled onto the road.\nDr Caroline Palmer travelled to Glasgow for the day from Colne, Lancashire, with her husband Malcolm Redford.\nThe retired GP, 67, said: \"I have got grandchildren and I feel very worried about what life is going to be like for them. It is our duty to do what we can to hold our government to account.\n\"They keep making promises but what we need is action. It's getting critical now.\"\nMr Redford, 68, wants to see an end to the extraction of fossil fuels and more affordable electric cars.\nThe former teacher said: \"We need to make real choices to keep 1.5 alive otherwise we have lost.\"\nNayara Castiglioni Amaral has been in Scotland for the last fortnight as part of a delegation from a Brazilian youth organisation.\nCarrying a cardboard cut-out of the country's environment minister she expressed concern about the impact of her government's policy on indigenous communities.\nThe 29-year-old said: \"We need more ambitious goals and we need to protect our tribal people as they take care of our environment.\"\nNayara said one of the highlights of her trip was last Saturday's march which organisers say attracted 100,000 people. \nShe added: \"It was one of the biggest protests that we have ever seen and it was beautiful. It was really powerful to be there.\""

      "tags": "Ynyswen,Treorchy",
      "text": "Wenjing Lin was a 16-year-old \"model student\" who passed all her GSCEs with top A and A* grades.\nBut she never found out about her exam success. She was strangled by a family friend at her family's Chinese takeaway in Rhondda Cynon Taf on 5 March.\nWenjing's mother Meifang Xu said her daughter would never know the results \"she had worked so hard for\".\nHer killing has also become part of wider calls for more action on violence against women.\nChun Xu, 32, has now been sentenced to a minimum of 30 years for her murder and the attempted murder of her stepfather.\nDuring the trial Wenjing's mother described her only child as a \"gentle and quiet soul\", who was good at school and helped with the family business. \nOn the morning of her death, Wenjing was getting ready for school, messaging friends on Snapchat and had already logged on for a maths lesson.\nWenjing sent her last message just before 09:30 and did not respond to messages after that because \"she had by now been killed by the defendant\", prosecutor Michael Jones QC told the trial.\nJennifer Ford, her head teacher at Treorchy Comprehensive School, said she was a \"model student\".\nVery strong academically and a hard worker, Wenjing was a \"good mathematician\" with her sights set on studying further maths the following year.\nShe was known for her a \"quirky sense of humour\" and was \"very much the centre\" of a group of friends.\nHer English teacher, Huw James, said she was missed by her friends and all the staff \"immensely\".\nShe was the main English speaker in her family, and he said there was a \"great sense of pride\" from Wenjing's parents and the staff over her academic success.\nWenjing had \"made the most of opportunities offered\" to her, including becoming part of a cadet force and going on a school trip to Patagonia.\nWhen she died, it had a \"huge impact\" on older and younger students as well as her own year group, Mrs Ford said.\n\"She'd made a really strong connection, not just with her own year group, but across the school,\" she said.\nHer head teacher added that as the school came to deal with her loss, there were tears but also an enjoyment of the stories around Wenjing.\nThe Duchess of Cornwall named Wenjing alongside other victims of male violence, including Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa, at an event on the culture around violence towards women.\n\"Each one of these women endured unimaginable torment,\" she said.\nShe also questioned whether people had become \"indoctrinated into believing that violence against women is normal\".\n\"How many more women must be harassed, raped or murdered before we truly unite to forge a violence free world?\"\nGwendolyn Sterk, of Welsh Women's Aid, said the details of Wenjing's murder were \"incredibly traumatic\". \nThe fact her murderer was known to and trusted by her family was \"sadly all too familiar a story\", she said.\n\"We are horrified that yet another life has been taken at the hands of male violence and devastated to witness the grief of another family.\n\"Wenjing was attacked in the place she lived and worked, a place where she should have enjoyed safety and been able to thrive,\" she added.\nMs Sterk also said male violence against women and girls was at \"epidemic rates\" across Wales and the UK.\n\"It is imperative that prevention is highly prioritised by government and education systems, to tackle the systemic issues of a misogynistic society where such violence and abuse continues to thrive across communities in Wales,\" she said.\nMr Jenkins said it was \"essential\" to highlight the fact that violence against women and girls was taken seriously.\n\"Where we see such cases and the evidence exists, we will prosecute it as hard as we can in the courts with the appropriate charges.\"\nWenjing's murder was \"shocking\", said Iwan Jenkins, of the Crown Prosecution Service.\nChun Xu admitted strangling Wenjing to death, telling the jury that he wanted revenge on her mother. He also admitted attacking her 38-year-old stepfather Yongquan Jiang with two knives.\nAn hour before Wenjing was killed, the trial heard Xu had used a search engine to ask \"can fingerprints be destroyed by fire?\"\nWenjing was found lifeless lying on a black mat by the takeaway counter by her mother and stepfather.\nXu was thought of as a nephew to the teenager's mother, although there had been disagreements between their families in the past. He was a heavy gambler and owed Wenjing's family \u00a314,000.\n\"I'm sure for the community that knew the deceased both in school and her family and friends, the death of such a young life in that way must be massively impacting upon them and disturbing,\" said Mr Jenkins.\n\"When it happens in small communities that are close, the impact is much greater and the importance therefore of ensuring thorough investigations and proper prosecutions is paramount,\" he said.\nHe added that the \"callousness\" of Xu's premeditation and Wenjing's young age made it an \"unusual case\".\n\"Gathering and taking a knife the day before, to where the incident was going to happen, the research that he undertook on the internet to gather ways of concealing evidence and in that way, certainly it was unusual.\""

Aside from Abba, Sheeran and One Direction, only Adele's 25 has breached the 200,000 barrier for first-week sales in the past decade.\nVoyage is also the fastest-selling vinyl release of the century, overtaking the Arctic Monkeys' Tranquillity Base Hotel & Casino from 2018.\nOnly The Beatles and Elvis have now spent longer at number one than Agnetha, Bj\u00f6rn, Benny and Anni-Frid.\nWhile it's clearly been a hit with music fans, the 10-track album Voyage divided opinion among critics.\n\"It's vintage Abba, on par with their classic 1970s run,\" declared Rolling Stone in a four-star review. But The Guardian's two-star write-up said it was a \"disappointment\" that languishes in \"often bafflingly retrograde settings\".\nOn Friday, Abba singer Anni-Frid Lyngstad told the BBC \"don't be too sure\" that their comeback album is their last, in her first interview about the reunion.\n\"I have learned to say never to say never,\" she told BBC Radio 2's Zoe Ball about the prospect of future projects.\nElsewhere on Friday, another returning star, Adele, secured a fourth consecutive week at the top of the singles chart with Easy on Me.\nThe ballad was the first track to be released from her hotly-anticipated fourth album, which will be released next Friday, 19 November.\nEasy on Me held off strong competition from Sheeran, who kept second and third spots on the singles rundown with Shivers and Bad Habits respectively, while his latest album = (Equals) was knocked into second place on the album chart by Abba.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Heysham",
      "text": "A \"composed and calculating\" student who murdered his stepfather's mother in a house fire has been jailed for life.\nTiernan Darnton, 21, trapped 94-year-old Mary Gregory in a blaze at her home in Heysham, Lancashire in 2018. \nHer death was treated as an accident until Darnton, who had confessed to the killing in a game of truth or dare, made a similar confession during counselling in 2019.\nHe was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 15 years. \nDarnton had denied murder but was convicted by a jury on Thursday at Preston Crown Court.\nAt the sentencing hearing, the judge said she rejected the notion that it had been \"an act of mercy\" by the then 17-year-old.\nDarnton claimed he had disabled a fire alarm and started the fire because he did not want Mrs Gregory to suffer any longer from dementia.\nBut Mrs Justice Yip said: \"No-one could seriously think that trapping an elderly woman in a burning building was an act of mercy.\"\nShe added: \"Murder had been on your mind for some time... You were fascinated by serial killers and their crimes. You had dark thoughts.\"\nThe court also heard that \"disturbing material,\" which was not presented to the jury during the trial, had also been found in Darnton's possession, including plans to stalk and attack women and a \"kill list\" with people's names on.\nThe jury was told an initial investigation had concluded that Mrs Gregory, who was a heavy smoker, had died in an accidental fire on 28 May 2018. \nHowever, police reopened the case in May 2019 after Darnton told a counsellor he had killed his stepfather's mother by using a lighter to set a curtain on fire at the house in Levens Drive.\nThe court heard he had also confessed several weeks after Mrs Gregory's death, during a game of truth or dare with two friends in which he revealed his \"darkest secret\".\nBut he later claimed he only wanted to impress his \"edgy\" friends in the truth or dare game and was \"attention-seeking\" with the counsellor, who he claimed had fabricated parts of their conversation.\nThe judge told him: \"It is hard to imagine the horror Mrs Gregory must have felt when she realised her house was on fire and was filling with smoke.\n\"Neighbours heard her screams. Despite her frailty, she tried to get out, but she had been trapped. \n\"The fire service found her near to the conservatory doors, where you had blocked her exit.\" \nShe added that he had been \"composed and calculating\" when giving \"untruthful evidence\" to the jury and his actions pointed to \"a significant degree of planning and premeditation\". \nThe jury was shown detailed drawings found at Darnton's home which outlined the floorplan of Mrs Gregory's home.\nThey contained labels including \"good hiding place\" and \"quick exit\" and references for needing a \"good alibi\".\nDetectives also found searches on his mobile phone and computer from June 2018 which read \"murderer filled with despair\" and \"I'm a monster and I'm going to hell\".\nMrs Gregory's son Peter told the court that the actions of Darnton, who had \"no biological or legal connection with our family whatsoever,\" continue to have repercussions throughout his family. \n\"Having learnt that my mum's death was at the hands of Tiernan Darnton, whom we had willingly welcomed into our family home, is disgusting and shattering,\" he said.\n\"He was frequently in mum's house in the final months leading to [her] death. \n\"She despised and distrusted him, and did not want him anywhere near her.\"\nHe said he must \"live with the burden\" that his brother, Chris Gregory, Darnton's stepfather, \"did not heed [his mother's] warnings\" and \"even gave him keys\".\nHe added that he never accepted that Mrs Gregory died in an accident. \nVictoria Agullo, senior crown prosecutor at CPS, said Darnton had deliberately started the fire and then \"took steps to prevent [Mrs Gregory] from calling for help and escaping\".\n\"I cannot begin to imagine the devastation this has caused to the family, losing their beloved relative in this way,\" she said. \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "title": "Brexit: UK looks likely to trigger Article 16 - then what?",
      "tags": "Boris Johnson,European Union,Brexit",
      "text": "This has not been a good week for Boris Johnson. \nThe Conservative Party has been battered by allegations that some of its MPs are on the take. \nThe way the prime minister has reacted to the situation has been publicly criticised, and privately slammed by many on his own side. \nEven some of Boris Johnson's most stalwart backers in parts of the Conservative press have called foul. \nBut if you think this has been bumpy, it's not impossible that the government might find itself in a much more dramatic and risky situation with much further-reaching consequences for us all. \nIt sounds harmless enough: Article 16, an obscure set of three paragraphs agreed as part of the Brexit withdrawal deal between the UK and EU.\nSo first off, it's important to understand it is part and parcel of the agreement that both sides grappled to achieve, and then signed up to in October 2019. \nYou might remember that the Brexit arrangements left Northern Ireland, of course part of the UK, essentially in the EU's huge trading bloc for goods. \nThis meant that goods could go backwards and forwards over the land border on the island of Ireland without hassle. \nThat sorted out one aspect of the geographic reality - but it also meant that there would be checks and controls on goods going into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. \nFrom the off, that created an inbuilt difference between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. \nBoth sides were perfectly aware that these arrangements might be tricky in practice, so the deal included Article 16. \nThe Article gives either side the ability to cry foul and take their own \"safeguard measures\" if it's all going wrong - if trade is going haywire, or the deal is causing real suffering. \nEither the UK or the EU has the right to take its own action, after giving a month's notice. \nThat could mean, for example, the UK stopping checks on goods that are being sent across the Irish Sea, intended only for use in Northern Ireland. \nIn other words, if something's made in Bolton, but sold in Belfast, it wouldn't go through customs checks. \nBut the actions could be more dramatic, suspending more of the deal the two sides agreed, whether that's product standards, customs checks, or VAT rules. \nWorking out how far to go, and what is justified, is a hard first step. \nAs one cabinet minister told me: \"The mechanics aren't controversial, the difficult decision is how far you want to go.\" \nArticle 16 could be used to carry out a few tweaks, or to tear through the existing agreements. In turn, that would also have an impact on how the EU reacts. \nWhy though would the UK want to go down that road in any case, whether using it as a big bazooka or just trying to fiddle around with a few elements? \nOne diplomat told me that triggering Article 16 would be \"lose, lose, lose\", and could cause a \"total breakdown of trust, and a deep freeze in relations\" between the EU and the UK. \nFormer Prime Minister Sir John Major, who it's fair to say is no fan of the current occupant of Downing Street, has said it would be \"absurd\". \nThe main opposition parties would likely condemn the move. \nBut for months, the UK government has been saying the impact of the arrangements and how they are being implemented can't last, even though, as things stand, the part of the deal relating to Northern Ireland - known as the protocol - is certainly not being implemented in full. \nBut its effects have already caused lots of different concerns - whether that would be, as one source describes it, companies being \"buried under mountains of new paperwork\", warnings over shortages of medicines, difficulties moving pets around, or the issue that's taken up most column inches, the so-called \"sausage wars\" over the sale of chilled meats. \nThe UK believes the EU adopted an overly vigorous approach to pursuing the rules, when a lighter touch would do.  \nIn turn of course, the EU says the UK signed up to the deal, why are they surprised when Brussels insists its followed in full? \nAs ever in high-tension diplomatic spats like this, the situation is not binary, and both sides have reasons for frustration. \nOf course, intense politics are at play here too. \nUnionist politicians in Northern Ireland largely can't stand the protocol, and have deep concerns about being able to keep a lid on tensions. \nOne source warns \"if the government doesn't move and show a bit of teeth, things could implode\". \nThe DUP leader has even said if there isn't movement he could pull his support.\nWith an election due by May 2022, they are pushing for action as soon as possible. \nThere's political mistrust between the UK and the EU side too over Boris Johnson's original attitude to the deal, and whether he ever intended to stick to the legal promises he made. \nThat was stoked by his controversial former adviser, Dominic Cummings, who said publicly the government had always intended to \"ditch\" the bits they didn't like. \nAnother source familiar with the negotiations told me \"Article 16 was the route we thought we would go down from the beginning\", adding: \"it was always clear that unless the EU was willing to back down, we wouldn't be able to stick with it long term\".\nNow it is not exactly unusual for political deals to leave ambiguities, and some issues unresolved. \nGiven that the European Court did retain a role in supervising the protocol, that source suggests it was never likely to be \"compatible with the autonomy of the UK\".\nBut the admission that Boris Johnson's team believed there was something seriously up with the deal to start with has not exactly put the EU in the mood for compromise. \nAnd what Brussels has been willing to budge on so far has not been nearly enough to satisfy No 10.\nFor political and practical reasons therefore, it seems almost inevitable that unless the European Union changes its position in a significant way, and soon, that the UK will trigger Article 16. \nTalks are continuing, and while one source says, \"it's not definite\", they acknowledge that \"optimism has been waning\". \nIn fact, the UK has said publicly since July that the conditions for the trigger to be pulled have indeed been met. \nSince then, the UK view is clearly that \"the EU solution is just not good enough\". \nBut on the other side, there's sceptism over the UK's desire even to find a way out. Lord Frost, the PM's Brexit lieutenant, is \"in problem-finding, not problem- solving mode\", one source said. \nI'm told that diplomats were reassured by government that the action wouldn't be taken this week, after the talks between that will take place between the two sides on Friday. \nBut I'm told there have been discussions about starting the process, even early next week. \nDon't panic, this does not seem to have yet been resolved. \nSome in government are arguing for more explanation of the case to the public before drastic action is taken. \nOne insider described a \"reasonableness test\". Another said that the UK government wanted to build an \"evidence base\" to demonstrate why they felt the action had to be taken, before going public. \nSome of the smart money is on the bust-up not coming until December, with one government source suggesting on Thursday: \"We're going to see a bit more time pass before it happens.\"\nWhatever the moment, unless something very unexpected happens, or the negotiators and politicians on both sides have personality transplants, it seems like Article 16 will be introduced before too long. \nThe likely impact of the move seems less certain than whether Boris Johnson and Lord Frost take the decision. \nIt hasn't happened before, so there is no real precedent. \nAnd there are different schools of thought. First, it's important to understand that triggering Article 16 is starting a dispute process. \nIt's not one moment, but the start of many. \nOne source says some Brexiteer MPs \"think you trigger it and everyone starts singing Rule Britannia - no one is asking themselves what happens after you trigger\". \nTheoretically, the process begins with a month of intense technical talks to try to resolve the dispute. \nIf that doesn't work, there would probably then be an emergency meeting of EU leaders, to take the decision up to prime ministers, not just the EU Commission. \nThere could be different forms of restrictions on trade, specific sanctions, or they could give notice that they would tear up the whole trade agreement, which Ireland warned might happen this week. \nWithout getting too technical, the trigger could end up with grumpy talks dragging on over many months with lots of politicking but not much changing practically. \nBoth sides could, in a genuine way, join together to try to work things out. \nOr the trigger could, as one observer warned, boil over into a \"full scale trade war that undermines the UK and the EU's post-Covid economic recovery\".\nThe economic consequences of that could be profound for us all, if the argument really went that far. \nAnd what would Number 10 do in the end, if the UK didn't get what it wanted? \nIf, as another source suggests, Boris Johnson \"triggers the process, it finds against the UK\u2026.and ultimately the European Court says you must comply - he's snookered\".  \nAs explained here, the UK may well want to strip the European Court of Justice of its role overseeing the Protocol. \nTechnically, the Article 16 process itself does not come directly under the European Court. But if, as some fear is likely, the argument tips into a wider dispute about the application of EU law then the European Court would end up as the final arbiter. \nAt the risk of hammering the point, the UK could try to reduce the European Court's influence on Northern Ireland by starting a huge legal argument, but actually end up with its influence being confirmed. \nMid-November has been pencilled in for several months, as the moment when an actual decision was going to have to be made. \nThat final conclusion has not yet been reached. \nAnd given what could be at stake, both sides would still, in theory, like the negotiations to work. \nBut we are approaching a moment where Downing Street may decide that the huge political and economic risks of triggering Article 16 are worth it, that the downsides of the protocol are no longer tolerable, and efforts to find a compromise have run their course. \nYet the potential outcomes might make the last stormy seven days look like a moment of deep calm.

He said he was shocked to hear what had happened. \nThe street is in the middle of a large housing estate and a few police vehicles remained parked at the end of the road on Monday night. \nAnother resident, Lorrine Urvine, said: \"We couldn't see anything other than the screaming. The kids - they were hysterical. \n\"And within minutes I've never seen so many police cars in my life.\"\nNeighbour Tracey Lawrence said: \"The little boy that lives there ran over to a neighbour saying the dog was attacking his friend and the neighbour couldn't help and couldn't save the boy.\"\nThere has been some police presence here where Gwent Police are continuing their investigation this morning.\nAnd we are expecting an update at some point from police as to how their investigation is progressing. \nThey have told the public that there will be an increased presence in the area at the moment as they continue their investigation but not to be alarmed. \nFor a time yesterday evening, this road was cordoned off and I think it has only come down in the early hours of the morning as the police continue their investigation.\nA nearby resident told the PA news agency: \"The dog has been a nuisance on the estate for a bit of a time. \n\"I took our son down to the local shop a few days ago, and he was down there then and he was lunging at my son.\n\"My son is three years old and I had to pick up my son just to move around the dog because of the size on him.\"\nDozens of emergency service vehicles were on the scene on Monday.\nCh Supt Mark Hobrough said: \"Officers will be making further inquiries at this time and will remain at the scene as the investigation progresses.\n\"It is possible that you may see ongoing police activity in Caerphilly as part of this work.\"\nHe urged the public not to be alarmed adding: \"If you have concerns or information then please do stop and talk with us.\"\nMember of the Senedd (MS) for Caerphilly Hefin David said: \"My thoughts tonight are with the families involved.

      "tags": "Foreign & Commonwealth Office,Iran nuclear deal,James Cleverly,Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case",
      "text": "The UK has urged Iran to back a deal that would revive the international agreement curbing the country's nuclear activities, at a meeting in London. \nUnder the original 2015 deal, Iran said it would curb its nuclear ambitions in return for other countries lifting economic sanctions.\nThe agreement collapsed when the US pulled out in 2018, but President Joe Biden has said it could rejoin.\nTalks are set to resume in Vienna on 29 November after a four-month hiatus. \nAhead of those talks, Iran's deputy foreign minister and lead negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, came to the UK Foreign Office to set out his country's demands.\nAt the meeting, Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly told his counterpart that Iran should take the opportunity of the new talks to conclude a deal that he said was already on table. \nThe Iranians said merely the nuclear deal was discussed, without noting any specifics. \nThey want the focus of the Vienna negotiations to be on lifting sanctions, and getting guarantees from the United States that it will not pull out of the deal again. \nBut Western countries want the talks to pick up where they left off in June, including on how to tackle Iran's growing stockpile of enriched uranium. \nThe potential deal being discussed in June centred on lifting sanctions against Iran, while also curbing its nuclear programme. \nWhat was still to be agreed was which sanctions, which nuclear activities, in what order and when. \nToday's meetings at the Foreign Office were a chance for Iran to set out its stall ahead of crucial talks later this month. \nThere is not a huge upswelling of optimism that these new talks in Vienna will succeed. \nIran has a new hardline government since the election of new president Ebrahim Raisi.\nJoe Biden is under political pressure in the United States not to concede too much.\nAnd the more time passes, the value of resuming the nuclear deal diminishes - because it contains many time limited provisions. \nIran has always insisted its nuclear programme is peaceful. But there are suspicions, particularly in Israel, that the country wants to develop a nuclear bomb.\nIsrael opposes the deal, and earlier it warned it was \"speeding up its plans\" to deal with what it called \"Iran's nuclear threat\".\nHostilities between the two countries have escalated recently, with Iran blaming Israel for the assassination of its top nuclear scientist last year and an attack on one of its uranium enrichment plants in April. \nThe UK government says Mr Cleverly also raised the case of British nationals detained by Iran with the country's deputy foreign minister, including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.\nThe 43-year-old mother-of-one from London has been held in Iran for five years on spying charges, which she has always denied.\nHer husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has been holding a hunger strike outside the Foreign Office for over a fortnight to put pressure on the government to do more to secure her release.\nThe Foreign Office says Mr Cleverly met Mr Ratcliffe on Thursday \"to reaffirm our commitment\" to reuniting Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her family.\nAfter the meeting, Mr Ratcliffe told reporters the meeting had been \"depressing\", and he didn't have \"any hopes\" of a breakthrough.\n\"I don't feel they moved forwards today,\" he added.\n\"It may be that there are parts of the conversation I am not privy to, and there are parts the minister shares down the line.\""

      "text": "A man who was considered a close relative has been found guilty of murdering a 16-year-old girl at her family's Chinese takeaway.\nWenjing Lin died in Ynyswen, Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, on 5 March.\nChun Xu, 32, of no fixed address, had denied murder but admitted manslaughter at the Blue Sky takeaway.\nDuring the trial at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, jurors heard that he said he \"did not mean to hurt the little girl. I wanted revenge on her mother\".\nHe was also found guilty of the attempted murder of Wenjing's stepfather Yongquan Jiang.\nAfter the verdict, the judge said Xu could expect \"a sentence of life imprisonment\".\nSpeaking afterwards, Wenjing's mother, Meifang Xu, said she still could not comprehend Xu's actions, but was \"so relieved justice has been done\".\nDuring the trial the court heard Xu was regarded as a nephew to the teenager's mother, although there had been disagreements between their families in the past.\nBefore the murder, Xu had stayed with the family overnight, bringing with him a knife from another Chinese restaurant he was working at.\nThe following morning, Wenjing was getting ready for school and messaging friends on Snapchat.\nShe had sent her last message to friends at 09:30, and did not respond after that as she had by then been killed by Xu.\nLater that morning, Mr Jiang heard someone pacing around downstairs and found Xu, who invited him into the basement for a cigarette and to get some fish from the freezer, the court heard.\nAs Mr Jiang opened the freezer, he was stabbed in the neck and body with two knives by Xu, the trial heard.\nDuring the struggle, Mr Jiang asked him why he was attacking him, to which he replied \"money, money, money,\" jurors heard.\nWenjing's mother Meifang Xu, then came down the basement stairs and saw the two fighting. As she tried to ring a friend, Chun Xu bit her.\nMr Jiang managed to get back onto the ground floor where he found his stepdaughter's body on a black mat by the takeaway counter.\nDespite attempts made by the emergency services, the 16-year-old could not be revived.\nAfter the attack, the defendant was found in the kitchen with a self-inflicted injury to his throat.\nSpeaking after the verdict, Wenjing's mother, Meifang Xu, said: \"Our lives have been turned upside down.\n\"I was crying every day... I cannot imagine what my life will be like without her, she was my only child.\n\"The perpetrator has broken our family.\"\nMs Xu also revealed Wenjing passed all of her GCSEs with A grades \"but she will never know the results she had worked so hard for\".\nShe said her partner Mr Jiang was previously a strong, fit man, but since the attack he struggles to work and also has \"nightmares of Wenjing Lin lying on the floor by the counter\".\nShe added that she could \"never forgive\" Xu since her daughter's murder, describing Wenjing as \"my everything - everything of me\".\n\"I hope there won't be any innocent victims like Wenjing,\" she said.\nA statement from Rhiannon Davies, the deputy headmistress at Treorchy Comprehensive school, where Wenjing was a pupil, said she was an \"exceptional student\".\nMs Davies said that on the day of her death, Wenjing had logged on for a maths lesson, adding she would be \"sorely missed\".\nIn December 2020, the family entrusted Xu with \u00a320,000 that he said he would send back to China for them to pay a friend who had loaned them money to start their business in the UK.\nHowever, Xu only sent some of the money back and gambled away \u00a314,000, which he had then begun paying back.\nSentencing is due to take place on Friday."

      "tags": "Belarus border crisis,Belarus,European Union,Poland,Migration",
      "text": "For almost two weeks, Shwan Kurd has been stuck in limbo. The 33-year-old from Iraq is one of thousands of migrants currently stranded at the Belarus-Poland border.\nThey have been caught up in a political tussle between the European Union and Belarus's leader, Alexander Lukashenko. He has been accused of funnelling migrants through Belarus to destabilise EU nations in revenge for sanctions - something his government denies.\nCold, hungry and exhausted, Mr Kurd is convinced Poland will let him cross the border, allowing him to seek a new life of opportunities in the EU.\nBetween him and that life stands a forbidding barbed-wire fence and hundreds of Polish soldiers. In a landscape reminiscent of a war zone, the crisis on the Poland-Belarus border has reached a chaotic stalemate.\n\"We're still at the border line,\" Mr Kurd told the BBC on Thursday. \"There are so many Polish soldiers.\"\nThose soldiers have markedly increased in number since a large group of migrants attempted to cross the border on Monday. The group came from the capital, Minsk, and converged on a crossing at Kuznica, near Grodno in north-west Belarus.\nThere, some migrants tried to force their way through Poland's barrier, using tools to cut the barbed wire. \nPoland accused Belarusian border guards of helping them, calling it a major provocation. While some migrants managed to slip through, most did not, leaving them with few options.\nPoland won't let them cross but, according to some migrants, nor will Belarusian border guards allow them to return to Minsk either. Unsure about where to turn next, many of the migrants have settled in a make-shift camp near the Kuznica crossing.\nMr Kurd spoke to us from the camp, where he had been sleeping for days in freezing overnight temperatures, metres from Poland's barbed-wire fence.\n\"We need supplies, there are children here. No food has been given to us,\" Mr Kurd said.\nJournalists and aid groups say they have not been able to access the area since Poland declared a state of emergency on its border with Belarus in September. The measure gave Poland powers to restrict the movement of people along the frontier.\nAras Nader, a British-Iraq, has been working as an interpreter for Grupa Granica, a network of Polish NGOs. He told the BBC he attempted to reach the border recently to find his wife and children, who were on the Belarusian side.\n\"I begged the police because my family is stuck. I told them on the phone, they are hungry, they don't have anything,\" he said. \n\"I just asked them to let me through with food and water. But they didn't let me and asked me to pay a fine.\"\nHis family eventually managed to get through the border despite the strict controls, which haven't stopped migrants arriving in ever-greater numbers.\nMr Kurd said he flew to Minsk from the Iraqi capital Baghdad at the start of November. \nHe said there was no work for him in his country, which has been ripped apart by war in recent decades and has an economy that's heavily dependent on oil.\n\"We have nothing. There's no life in our country,\" he said. \"We hope to arrive and enjoy life, that's all. We want to do our jobs. We have so many good people - doctors, scientists, teachers.\"\nMr Kurd may soon be followed by many others. Some 300km (186 miles) from the Polish border in Minsk, many more migrants are preparing to tread the same uncertain path.\nBy Tuesday morning, about 300 mostly Iraqi migrants had gathered in Minsk's central square.\nBBC journalist Will Vernon spoke to several of them in the square. Their stories were all the same. They were waiting, they said, to go to the Polish border - a four-hour drive away, at least.\nThey said they had paid for a visa and flights as part of a package costing several thousand dollars.\nMazyar and his friends, from Iraq, said they paid about $3,000-4,000 (\u00a32,200-2,900). \"We want to get to Germany or the UK,\" he said.\nOthers on the square alleged they had been beaten and badly treated by Belarus police officers and soldiers, who had tried to force them towards neighbouring Lithuania instead of Poland.\nOne man said he had been sleeping on the street, braving Minsk's sub-zero night-time temperatures.\nThe EU has accused Belarus of enticing these migrants with the false promise of easy entry to its member states. They are flown in and pushed towards the border by Belarusian forces as part of an \"inhuman, gangster-style approach\", the EU has alleged.\nThis week, as the crisis reached fever pitch, the EU listed some 20 countries from which migrants have flown into Minsk, mainly on tourist visas. Many have come from countries in Asia and the Middle East, particularly Iraq.\nEarlier this year, the BBC followed the journey of one group from Iraq to the EU via Belarus. They bought their visas and flights from a travel agency in Iraq before paying smugglers to take them to the border.\nThey made it to EU countries, but others are not so fortunate.\nOn the Belarusian side of the border, the mood flickers between hope and desperation. For Mr Kurd, the new life he covets is so close, yet so far.\n\"So many people's lives are in danger if we don't arrive,\" Mr Kurd said.\n\"So many little children and old people. Some people are sick, some people can't walk. But there are no supplies and no medicine here. Every night, the temperature is under zero. It's so, so cold.\""

The ruling is due at a later date.\nThis long ongoing court case is an attempt to protect the privacy of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex but in bringing the action it is, in some ways, doing the opposite.  \nThe obvious anger and distress caused by the Mail on Sunday publishing extracts of a deeply personal letter has led to the release of a series of court documents which reveal arguments and disagreements from behind closed doors.   \nThe fact that Harry and Meghan felt under pressure from the Royal Family to resolve the difficult relationship with her father, Thomas, has been discussed at length in court. \nThese text messages which mention what she feels was the \"constant berating\" of her husband over the issue of her father reveal something of the level of feeling in the days leading up to the letter being written.  \nIt is also worth noting that this was taking place in the summer of 2018, just three months after the happy scenes at their wedding when Prince Charles walked Meghan down the aisle at Windsor. \nThe latest revelations come a day after the Court of Appeal heard Mr Knauf, the couple's former communications chief, \"regretted\" not giving evidence in her High Court case against ANL.\nAfter extracts of texts and emails between Meghan and Mr Knauf were used in court, further messages were released on Friday following an application by the PA news agency and the Times newspaper.\nIn the newly released text messages, sent to Mr Knauf while she was drafting the handwritten letter to her father, the duchess said she was motivated to write to her father due to the \"pain\" the situation was causing Prince Harry.\nShe wrote: \"Even after a week with his dad and endlessly explaining the situation, his family seem to forget the context - and revert to 'Can't she just go and see him and make this stop?'\"\nShe accused the Royal Family of \"fundamentally\" failing to understand and that by writing to her father, her husband would be able to tell them \"she wrote him a letter and he's still doing it\".\nThe duchess added that she was doing this to \"protect my husband from this constant berating and while unlikely perhaps it will give my father a moment to pause\".\nHowever, she told Mr Knauf the letter \"does not open the door for a conversation\".\nOn Wednesday Mr Knauf, who is due to stand down from his current role as the chief executive officer of the Royal Foundation at the end of the year, said in a witness statement that the duchess had written the letter to her father with the understanding that it could be leaked.\nThe Court of Appeal also heard this week that Mr Knauf had been asked by Meghan to pass information to Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, the authors of the Finding Freedom biography - leading to the duchess apologising to the court for forgetting about emails sent about the book."

      "text": "Police in the Netherlands have used water cannon on protesters opposed to a new partial lockdown imposed amid record coronavirus infections and rising intensive care cases.\nThree weeks of restrictions for shops, sport and catering were announced by Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday.\nMuch of Europe is facing a surge in cases, blamed partly on low vaccine take-up in several countries.\nAustria is expected to back a lockdown for unvaccinated people this weekend.\nRestrictions are to be be imposed first in the two provinces of Upper Austria and Salzburg from Monday, according to Health Minister Wolfgang M\u00fcckstein.\nDenmark, which had downgraded coronavirus as no longer a \"socially critical\" disease, has re-instated a Covid pass that was phased out in September. The government wants to push through a law allowing workplaces to require the pass for staff.\nThe Dutch prime minister said that fortunately the vast majority of people in the Netherlands had been vaccinated. But he said the three-week partial lockdown would start on Saturday evening:\nCinemas and theatres will stay open. Social distancing of 1.5m (5ft) is being reintroduced where Covid passes are not in operation. The caretaker cabinet is also working on a change in the law to allow businesses to choose whether they want to limit entry to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered.\nThe catering industry has reacted angrily to the news; a spokesman told public broadcaster NOS the government had \"crossed a line\". Last weekend, thousands of protesters marched through The Hague in anger at existing Covid restrictions.\nLatest daily figures on Saturday showed 13,902 new Covid cases - the third-highest daily rate since the start of the pandemic - and 33 deaths. Dutch vaccination rates are relatively high, with 82.4% of over-12s having two doses, or 73% of the total population.\nProtesters took to the streets in The Hague after Mr Rutte's announcement. Police fired water cannon after some of the crowd started throwing stones and fireworks at them.\nIn Austria, vaccine take-up is at 65% and Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg says he will talk to provincial governors on Sunday before the green light is given for a national lockdown for the unvaccinated.\n\"The situation in Austria is worrying and infection numbers are rising rapidly, especially in Upper Austria and Salzburg,\" the health minister warned. The two provinces have a combined population of more than two million. \nUpper Austria governor Thomas Stelzer says people who have not been vaccinated will be able to leave home only for essential reasons such as going to work, buying food or to exercise. It is unclear how that would be enforced.\nGermany, which has also seen record Covid numbers this week, declared Austria a high-risk area on Friday, so that anyone visiting who has not been vaccinated or recovered from Covid will have to quarantine for 10 days.\nEastern European countries have for weeks been fighting record infection rates, as they grapple with the lowest vaccine rates on the continent:"

      "tags": "Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "While many European countries are seeing steep rises in coronavirus cases and preparing to step up Covid restrictions, the UK has been going in the other direction. \nExperts say differences in levels of immunity and people's behaviour are the likely explanations.\nThe UK had been seeing the highest rates of cases and deaths in Western Europe, but these have been falling.\nHowever, Boris Johnson has warned there is no room for complacency.\nThe PM said the wave of infections sweeping across Europe was a reminder that the pandemic had not gone away.\nHe said: \"I'm seeing the storm clouds gathering over parts of the European continent.\n\"What I'm saying today is that the urgency of getting that booster jab is more evident than ever.\n\"If we don't do it fast enough, we can see the potential risks to the state of the pandemic in what's happening in other parts of Europe.\"\nThe latest daily figure for the number of people testing positive in the UK is 40,375. This week has seen 7% fewer cases than the week before, while deaths are down 8.9%. \nThe UK figures have - like a cruising aeroplane dealing with turbulence - been bouncing around roughly the same level since the summer.\nCovid cases are now taking off in large swathes of Europe, with some countries already climbing to a higher altitude than the UK.\nIf you look at the rate per million people, around 500 test positive for Covid each day in the UK. In Austria the figure is more than double this. \nThe Netherlands, which has also overtaken the UK, has declared three weeks of restrictions in Western Europe's first \"partial lockdown\" of winter.\nSimilar countries such as Germany are marginally lower, but the trajectory is causing concern and led to warnings of 100,000 deaths in the country this week. \n\"Cases are rising quite quickly across most of Europe at this stage, it's a very fluid situation,\" Prof Francois Balloux, from University College London, told the BBC.\nHe added: \"A couple of weeks ago not many would have predicted this rapid increase in Europe.\"\nThe driving force behind the spike is a combination of two things - human behaviour and the amount of immunity in the population. \nDr Simon Clarke, from the University of Reading, said we're \"probably seeing the start of winter\" in Europe. \n\"When the circumstances are wrong and infection is just more possible you can expect numbers to start climbing and more socialising and mixing indoors means there's more opportunity for transmission, even in vaccinated individuals.\" \nThe sustained high levels of Covid in the UK - which \"ran hotter\" than Europe all summer - will have added to the amount of immunity being provided by the immunisation campaign. \n\"In the UK, the proportion of the population who have antibodies due to vaccination or infection or both is very high, so essentially more people are protected,\" said Prof Balloux. \nWaning immunity may also be a bigger factor in Europe. Many European countries stuck to giving the two vaccine doses three weeks apart. The UK, controversially at the time, spaced them out further which could lead to a stronger and more durable immune response, say experts. \nThe increase in cases will not be an equal threat to all European countries. The main job of vaccines is to stop people dying from Covid and to keep people out of hospitals rather than stop all infections, although it does help cut those too. \nCountries with low vaccine uptake can expect a more difficult winter. \nThere is still debate about what will happen next in the UK - will cases cruise around the same level for a while or come down quickly. \nEstimates from the Office of National Statistics, based on Covid tests done by households, suggest that nearly 1.1 million people in the UK would test positive for coronavirus in the week ending 6 November.\nThat's 1.7% of the population - or one in 60 people - down from nearly 2% last week. \n\"The half-term break may have played a part, though infections were decreasing prior to this time. Over the next few weeks we will see if this decline continues,\" said Sarah Crofts from the ONS.\nWhat is happening to people who have received a booster dose is also being closely monitored. Evidence suggests the levels of protective antibodies in their blood has shot back up. It is too soon though to tell if the declines in cases among the over 80s are due to extra protection from boosting or less Covid circulating due to half term school holidays. \nDr Clarke warned: \"International comparisons are never very useful, countries don't work in lockstep, even relatively similar countries don't work in lockstep. \n\"There will be times when the UK has a bad patch and others do well, and vice versa.\""

      "text": "The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has welcomed what he says is \"a changing tone of discussion\" in talks about the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nMaro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d was talking after a meeting in London with Lord Frost.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said he was hopeful the two sides could make progress on the supply of medicines next week.\nMeanwhile, Lord Frost said there were still \"significant gaps\" to be bridged between the bloc and the UK, and that talks would be \"intensified\". \nThe protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods.\nThat means that goods can flow freely between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, removing the threat of a \"hard border\".\nHowever, goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control - amounting to what is being referred to as an \"Irish Sea border\".\nThe UK wants fundamental changes to the operation and governance of the protocol. \nThe EU has proposed a package of measures which would reduce its practical impact.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said there would still need to be a \"reciprocal\" move from the UK.\nHe added: \"We need to make serious headway in the course of next week.\n\"This is particularly important as regards the issue of medicines. I stand by my commitment to do whatever it takes to address this issue in line with what industry tells us.\"\nHe said agreement in this area could be a \"blueprint\" for reaching a wider deal\".\nIn a statement, a UK government spokesperson said the preference \"remained to find a consensual way forward\", but that Article 16 was a \"legitimate safeguard\".\n\"Lord Frost also underlined the need to address the full range of issues the UK had identified in the course of discussions, if a comprehensive and durable solution was to be found that supported the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and was in the best interests of Northern Ireland.\n\"In this context, although talks had so far been conducted in a constructive spirit, Lord Frost underlined that in order to make progress, it was important to bring new energy and impetus to discussions.\"\nThe spokesperson said next week's talks would be \"intensified\".\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the UK government needed to take \"decisive action within weeks\". \nHe added: \"It is essential that either the government gets agreement with the EU, and in the absence of such an agreement that it does move to trigger Article 16.\"\nThe protocol means Northern Ireland is still in the EU's pharmaceutical regulatory system.\nHowever it continues to get most of its medicines from Great Britain which is outside the EU's system.\nThis is creating potential supply complications which have lead some firms in GB to indicate they will stop supplying products to NI.\nNothing has changed so far as a \"grace period\" means the protocol is not yet being implemented for medicines.\nThe EU's acknowledges that as it stands the protocol creates too much of a burden in this area and should be changed.\nIn October it published proposals to tackle the difficulties, which will include changing EU law.\nIf the protocol is causing serious difficulties either side can unilaterally suspend the relevant parts of it by using the Article 16 safeguards clause.\nHowever, UK ministers have said such a move is not imminent."

      "text": "The size of Wales is a common unit of measurement - but the country's outline could slightly change over the next century due to climate change.\nNatural Resources Wales (NRW) said protecting all areas was \"difficult against the forces of nature\".\nMore than 71,000 properties are currently at risk of flooding in Wales from tidal sources, the environment body added.\nNRW has said coastal flooding and erosion is \"a big risk for Wales\".\nJeremy Parr, its head of flood and incident risk management, said in decades to come there will be \"some tough decisions in some locations where we might need to relocate some small communities and certainly make space for water and look after our environment.\"\nWales has 1,680 miles of coastline which surrounds the country on three sides, and about 60% of the Welsh population live in coastal areas.\nMr Parr said coastal flooding and erosion would be \"a big risk for Wales\" and \"all indications are it's going to get worse.\"\n\"We can expect sea level rise for one thing and some of the predictions around that are quite scary,\" he added.\n\"The coastline is a dynamic environment. Parts of the coast will erode and fall away into the sea.\"\n\"You get increased storminess and increase in winds. That can increase the water level even further and make conditions along the coast, really, really treacherous - and it means that there will be more flooding and it means that there will be more erosion.\"\nPeople are able to check the long term flood risk of their area or street online.\nThe warning follows a major landslide on the north Wales coastline earlier this year when cliffs of about 40m (131ft) wide fell onto a beach at Nefyn in Gwynedd.\nNRW said it \"makes sense\" to protect some vulnerable coastal towns and areas that are home to Wales' key infrastructure - like major roads and railways - and heritage sites such as castles.\nThe environmental watchdog has been working with local authorities and the Welsh government for several years to develop shoreline management plans for areas where climate change posed a particular challenge.\nBut NRW acknowledges that losing areas of land to the seas was a difficult topic and needed to be handled sensitively so that people were not frightened.\nAs the COP26 climate summit draws to a close in Glasgow, the Royal Meteorological Society said cases of such extreme weather were on the increase, and global warming had serious implications.\n\"The Royal Met Society has been around since 1850 and we've seen a lot of extreme events here in the UK over that time,\" said chief executive Liz Bentley.\n\"But what we're finding because of climate change is that those events are becoming more frequent.\n\"One degree has made a big shift in what we're seeing in rainfall patterns. It also means we've started to see a significant increase in sea levels. So the sea level has risen by about 16 centimetres, which again, doesn't sound very much, but for low-lying areas that has a huge impact.\"\nOne leading geographical professor said Wales' coastline would \"change a lot\" in low lying areas with the sea moving inland.\n\"On the higher elevation areas there won't be that much change but there will be cliff falls,\" said Prof Richard Lucas, from Aberystwyth University's geography and earth sciences department.\nHe said that although the landscape had changed in the past, the pace of change was a new phenomenon.\n\"It's the speed of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the speed that sea levels and other factors like flooding are changing.\n\"So the sea level is rising more rapidly than in the past, and ecosystems and people have to respond to that. And sometimes it's just too fast for them.\" \nHe added that to avoid a change in the shape of Wales, sea defences would \"need to be strengthened into the future\". The situation \"depends on the actions of people and how we respond to changing climate.\"\nRead more about the COP26 summit here."

      "text": "An important trial will test how to boost Covid jab protection in vulnerable patients whose immune systems are weakened by drugs they need for other health conditions. \nAbout 1.3 million people in the UK are on methotrexate for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. \nIt stops flare-ups, but can make the body less able to fight infections or respond to vaccines. \nThe team will check if a two-week drug holiday timed to vaccination will help. \nA previous study from Korea showed that a fortnight's break from methotrexate immediately after the flu vaccine increased the patients' immune response to that jab. \nThe University of Nottingham researchers, working with other universities and hospitals, will recruit 560 methotrexate patients, and half of them will try the two-week break when they are due to have their third, or booster, Covid jab. \nAlthough the Vroom study will take one to two years to complete, scientists hope it will provide confidence for some of the most vulnerable patients at risk from Covid.\nOne of the participants is 48-year-old Nottingham mum Annabelle Imray. \nShe takes methotrexate for her psoriatic arthritis to help treat her swollen joints and dry skin. At times, she feels so tired because of her condition that she has to plan her days carefully.\nShe was shielding earlier in the year, and says she is still very cautious now because she is worried about catching Covid.\n\"I explain to the kids that if I catch it, I'm much more likely to be seriously ill than them. \n\"When I do go out, I'm worried walking close to strangers, or if someone is coughing without a mask I would be worried about the potential of catching something. \n\"Hopefully the trial will make a big difference for people on immune-suppressing medicines giving reassurance and confidence to do things they enjoy in their lives and know that we are more protected. It's the uncertainty that is the worst.\"\nProf Abhishek Abhishek, the chief investigator, said people on immunosuppressants faced being more at risk of getting ill if they catch Covid, as well as potentially being less able to mount the strongest possible immune response to vaccines against the virus.\nHe said: \"We hope to find out whether they can safely take a break from medications for their inflammatory conditions and an improved protection from the booster jab, without the risk of flare-up of their long-term illness which affects their daily lives so heavily.\n\"Many people take methotrexate for more than 10 to 20 years, so we hope to provide high quality evidence which can help them with their day-to-day lives going forward.\"\nProf Andy Ustianowski from the National Institute for Health Research, which is funding the work, said: \"This pivotal study will help develop our understanding of immune responses in people taking this widely-prescribed medicine.\"  "

We should focus on that because the science is clear and it is terrifying, and we must act.\"\nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nHe added: \"Change will be very difficult for some communities, it is the role of government to help those communities make the change. \n\"If tackling climate change is seen as a great sacrifice, people are going to be reluctant to do it. \n\"Our role is to show that it's possible to change, and change can improve things. We can have a better quality of life if we do this in a managed way.\"\nHe said he had taken \"courage\" from the summit to \"continue to keep pushing forward and not be distracted by people who are not willing to make the change\". \nAlthough there are numerous projections, the most optimistic view is promises made in Glasgow put the world on course for a 1.8C increase in average global temperature. \nBut this depends on action being taken this decade. \nPrevious pledges predicted a rise of 2.7C of warming by the end of the century.\nMr Waters is one of many politicians, campaigners and charities from Wales who have made their way to Scotland for the conference. \nAmong them are the Youth Climate Ambassadors for Wales, who have been speaking at events, meeting delegates and campaigning.  \nShenona Mitra, from Bangor, Gwynedd, said it had been an \"intense\" experience. \n\"It'll be really interesting to see after this whether the momentum stays and whether promises turn into actions,\" she said.\nAnother of the youth ambassadors, Ellie Sanders, from Swansea, described being at the conference as \"an amazing opportunity.\"\nMeanwhile, Leo Carey-Read, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said he found COP to be an \"eye-opening experience\". \nHe added he felt \"hopeful in some senses, but I think I'd be na\u00efve to think that the 26th COP would be the final one\", but he \"definitely\" felt progress had been made. \nLeading climate change academic, Prof Mary Gagen of Swansea University, said side events involving young climate activists at Glasgow had been \"energising\". \nShe said: \"It's really uplifting. I'm a climate scientist, one of the generations and generations of us who've been working on climate science since Guy Callendar first discovered human-induced climate change in 1938. \n\"We need the energy of these sessions to keep working. It's lovely to hear youth activists, indigenous leader from Brazil and Peru, talking about the impact of climate change on their lives and their hopes for the future.\" "

      "text": "Nearly 180,000 children in England who care for a relative may be missing out on support because they are not known to their council, BBC News analysis suggests. \nLocal authorities have a duty to identify, assess and support children who provide a caring role.\nBut experts say many are not getting the help and time off they need.\nMinisters said councils had a duty to support carers but the Local Government Association called for better funding. \nA young carer is someone under 18 who cares for a family member or friend with a physical or mental health illness or disability. \nThey carry out a high level of care such as washing, dressing, giving medication, looking after family finances, cooking and cleaning.\nIf they are known to their local council they could access young carers clubs and activities, help at home or one-to-one support.\nBut analysis by the BBC suggests 75% of young carers in England are not known to councils.\nResponses to a Freedom of Information request showed local authorities were aware of just over 58,000 young carers in 2019-20. \nResearch by BBC News and Nottingham University in 2018 estimated that 7% of children aged 11-15 years were caring at a high level.\nThe analysis compared the national trends from the 2018 findings to the FOI responses and the results suggest nearly 180,000 young carers are unaccounted for.\nProfessor Saul Becker, a specialist on young carers, said that if every one of those was known to local authorities, they would not be able to meet demand.\nHe said: \"The system does rely, to some extent, on it only meeting the needs of a certain number of those young people. It couldn't cope with the sheer demand from all of those hidden armies of young carers out there.\"\nPaige, 15, and Beth, 12, from Herefordshire, help their disabled mum to get out of bed, shower, apply her morphine patches and assist with cooking and cleaning. \nThey said they had not had an assessment or were really sure what one was, and the pressure of their caring roles affected their mental health. \n\"We have anxiety\u2026 and we've got separation anxiety as well,\" Paige said.\n\"We hate being away from mum. That makes it worse,\" Beth added.\n\"I feel quite isolated as a young person and as a young carer. Sometimes it takes a toll on you,\" Paige explained. \"I think you just get overwhelmed.\"\nThe sisters go to Herefordshire Young Carers Club (HYCC) which offers weekly activities and support. \nSusan Brace, one of the support workers at the charity, said: \"It's really important young carers get to access the same opportunities as anybody else. \n\"A lot of them have got a huge amount of responsibility. And it's really hard for them to sometimes socialise after school or have friends around to play.\"\nEdwina Roberts, another support worker at HYCC, said: \"There are so many hidden young carers, we are forever trying to raise awareness to try and find them. Here they're having respite from their caring role and they're just allowed to be a child and to have fun.\"\nProfessor Becker said: \"We should never underestimate the importance and the power of having a few hours off where you do not have to worry about who's looking after your parent - who's looking after your brother and sister - so you can escape. \n\"And so respite care is critical. Supporting the family is critical, one-to-one support is important for many young carers.\"\nThe number of young carers reported by councils varied dramatically across the country. \nSome areas including Leeds, Bolton, Tower Hamlets and Derby responded saying they had less than 50 young carers, while others including Suffolk, Lincolnshire and West Sussex said they had over 1,000.  \nNo council reflected the suggested number of young carers in their area.Lancashire County Council said they had nine young carers in their area, but the BBC analysis suggested that figure could be nearer to 5,000, based on national trends. \nThe council said: \"This data is only for young carers who care for an adult service user that we have on our adults system.\" After rechecking its figures the council responded saying its commissioned service supported 224 new referrals in 2019-20.\nWarwickshire County Council highlighted 2,080 young carers, which was only around 200 less than trends would suggest.\nSix local authorities replied saying it would cost too much to retrieve the data, while 11 councils couldn't give data for the year April 2019 to March 2020. \nTwo councils only provided census information dating back to 2011, while another council claimed it was unable to release the numbers as it was personal information.\nThe Local Government Association said: \"Councils across the country work hard to make sure young carers are able to access the support they need.\n\"With adequate funding for children's services and adult social care, councils can do more to help young carers and prevent them from having to pick up any shortfalls in support.\"\nThe Department for Education said: \"Young carers make an invaluable contribution and we recognise the challenges they face. \n\"Local authorities have a duty to assess and support young carers' needs, making sure a young carer is not taking on excessive or inappropriate caring responsibilities.\""

Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. \nCoal\nFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  \nHowever, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. \nDeveloping countries\nThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.\nThere's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed.\nWhile some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. \nFossil fuel subsidies\nWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.\nHowever, no firm dates have been set.\nA flurry of other announcements were made:\nThe world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.\nChina has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. \nLeaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.\nThis is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. \nSimilar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.\nA scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. \nMethane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. \nThe big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.\nFinancial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back \"clean\" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.\nThe initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.\nHowever, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. \nMost commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.\nOnly a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. \nCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. \nSix years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.\nCOP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. \nThe goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.\nNext year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "text": "A Myanmar military court has sentenced US journalist Danny Fenster to 11 years in jail.\nFenster was found guilty of breaching immigration law, unlawful association and encouraging dissent against the military. \nHe was earlier this week slapped with two additional charges of sedition and terrorism, which carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. \nHis trial on the new charges will begin on 16 November.\nFenster, 37, who was the managing editor of online site Frontier Myanmar, was detained at Yangon international airport in May. He is one of dozens of local journalists that have been detained since a military coup in February.\nAccording to Frontier, Fenster had earlier worked for Myanmar Now, an independent news site that has been critical of the military since the coup. \n\"The charges were all based on the allegation that he was working for banned media outlet Myanmar Now. Danny had resigned from Myanmar Now in July 2020 and joined Frontier the following month, so at the time of his arrest in May 2021 he had been working with Frontier for more than nine months,\" said the news site. \n\"There is absolutely no basis to convict Danny of these charges.\"\nHis sentencing on Friday comes months after a Japanese freelance journalist was arrested in Myanmar and charged with spreading fake news. \nYuki Kitazumi, who was reporting for many of Japan's major news outlets, was one of a few foreign reporters in the country. Myanmar authorities maintain he violated the law but released him because Japan had requested it.\nThe trial of Danny Fenster took place behind closed doors, literally, inside Insein prison, where he and many of those detained since the February coup are being held. \nWe know only what his lawyers can tell us about the process. But the charges the military authorities filed against him are clearly absurd. The prosecutor stated that they relate to his employment by the independent news organisation Myanmar Now, one of five media organisations the military targeted after the coup, cancelling their licences to broadcast. \nBut Danny Fenster left Myanmar Now in May 2020, and joined the news magazine Frontier. This was made clear in court by his lawyers, supported by document, yet ignored by the judge, who gave him the maximum sentence for the three charges.\nSo why is the military junta going after an American journalist like this, piling even more serious charges on him in the past week? \nThe Biden administration has increased pressure on the regime, in particular through sanctions targeting high-profile military officers, and calling for a restoration of the elected government. It is hard to see the US softening its stance to get Fenster out. Perhaps the military is hoping for a gesture, a photo-op with a US official; friendless and isolated, the junta might consider that a worthwhile prize for releasing him. \nIt also sends a chilling message to all journalists in Myanmar. If they are willing to snub a superpower like the US, and hold one of its citizens hostage, the treatment of local journalists may be even harsher. \nAs always with Myanmar's generals, their true motives are hard to guess.\nThe US has pressed the military government to release him, but a military spokesman insisted that Fenster needed to be held in custody. \nIn a statement before the sentencing, the US state department commented that \"the profoundly unjust nature of Danny's detention is plain for all the world to see. The regime should take the prudent step of releasing him now\".\nThe US has not yet commented on the ruling. \nPhil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, told the BBC that the verdict was \"a travesty of justice by a kangaroo court\" intended to intimidate all remaining journalists working inside Myanmar. \nMeanwhile, Richard Horsey, a senior adviser at Crisis Group Myanmar, described the sentence as \"outrageous\".\n\"It sends a message not only to international journalists... but also Myanmar journalists that reporting factually on the situation is liable to get them many many years in prison,\" he told the AFP news agency.\nHe added that US diplomats were working to secure Fenster's release but noted that \"obviously this sentence is a big setback to US efforts.\"\nMyanmar's military leaders seized power in February after suffering a massive election defeat at the hands of the ruling National League of Democracy.\nIt claimed it had no choice but to orchestrate the coup because of widespread fraud in the poll, despite the country's election commission saying there was no evidence to support these claims. \nNews of the coup sparked off large-scale civilian demonstrations across the country, which the military dispersed with brutal force.\nSince then, at least 1,178 people have been killed and 7,355 arrested, charged or sentenced in a crackdown on dissent, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP).\nAround 80 local journalists are known to have been detained for their reporting so far. According to the AAPP, 50 of them are still in detention and half have been prosecuted."

      "tags": "Asia,Nature,New Zealand",
      "text": "A penguin has found itself on the shores of New Zealand, at least 3,000 kilometres (1,864 miles) away from its natural habitat of Antarctica.\nThe Ad\u00e9lie penguin, who has now been affectionately named Pingu by locals, was found looking lost on the coast.\nHarry Singh, the local resident who found him, said he thought he was a \"soft toy\" at first. \nIt is only the third recorded incident of an Ad\u00e9lie penguin being found on New Zealand's coast. \nMr Singh and his wife first came across the penguin when they were out walking after a long day of work on the beach at Birdlings Flat, a settlement south of the city of Christchurch. \n\"First I thought it (was) a soft toy, suddenly the penguin moved his head , so I realized it was real,\" Mr Singh told the BBC.  \nFootage of the penguin posted on Mr Singh's Facebook page showed the penguin appearing lost and alone. \n\"It did not move for one hour... and [looked] exhausted\" Mr Singh said. \nMr Singh proceeded to call penguin rescuers as he was concerned that the penguin was not getting into the water, thereby making it a potential target for other predatory animals roaming the beach. \n\"We did not want it to end up in a dog's or cat's stomach,\" he said. \nHe eventually got through to Thomas Stracke, who has been rehabilitating penguins on New Zealand's South Island for about 10 years. \nMr Stracke was shocked to find that the penguin was an Ad\u00e9lie penguin - a species that lives exclusively on the Antarctic peninsula. Mr Stracke, along with a veterinarian, rescued the penguin that same evening. \nBlood tests performed on Pingu showed that it was slightly underweight and dehydrated. It has since been given fluids and fed via a feeding tube. \nThe bird will eventually be released onto a safe beach on Banks Peninsula, which is free of dogs. \nThe discovery is only the third in history that an Ad\u00e9lie penguin has been found on New Zealand's coasts, following two incidents in 1993 and 1962.\nAd\u00e9lie spottings remain rare in New Zealand, but if more of them appear in the future, it could be a worrying sign, say experts. \n\"I think if we started getting annual arrivals of Ad\u00e9lie penguins, we'd go actually, something's changed in the ocean that we need to understand,\" Otago University zoology professor Philip Seddon told news site The Guardian. \n\"More studies will give us more understanding where penguins go, what they do, what the population trends are like - they're going to tell us something about the health of that marine ecosystem in general.\"\nReporting by the BBC's Zubaidah Abdul Jalil"

      "tags": "Flexible working,Careers,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "Women who work mostly from home risk seeing their careers stall now workers are returning to the office in large numbers, according to Bank of England (BoE) economist Catherine Mann.\nShe said office interaction was vital to advance in companies, but many women were still tied to home working.\nMs Mann said it was a particular issue for mothers facing school disruptions and difficulty accessing childcare.\nEarlier this year, Rishi Sunak warned about young people's careers.\nThe chancellor said he doubted his banking career would have been successful if he had started it in virtual meetings, and that being in the office helped build skills.\nMs Mann, a member of the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee that sets interest rates, said online communication was unable to replicate the spontaneous office conversations that were important for recognition and advancement in many workplaces.\nShe told an event hosted by Financial News magazine: \"Virtual platforms are way better than they were even five years ago. But the extemporaneous, spontaneity - those are hard to replicate in a virtual setting.\"\nDifficulty accessing childcare and pandemic-related disruption to schooling meant many women were continuing to work from home, while it had been easier for men to return to the office.\n\"There is the potential for two tracks,\" she said. \"There's the people who are on the virtual track and people who are on a physical track. And I do worry that we will see those two tracks develop, and we will pretty much know who's going to be on which track, unfortunately,\" she said.\nMs Mann was an economics professor and chief economist at investment bank Citi and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, before joining the BoE in September.\nBusinesswoman Justine Roberts, co-founder of the Mumsnet website, agreed that there was a risk women's careers could suffer from not being in the office. But it was up to companies to be aware of this.\nBut the flipside, she told the BBC, was that the flexibility of home working was a huge benefit to women, and mothers in particular. Presenteeism and long-hours culture had been eroded by new ways of working.\n\"Let's not forget that one of the best things to come out of [the pandemic crisis] is the ability to work flexibly,\" especially for mothers juggling childcare and school runs, she said.\nAccording to a BBC survey, just over half (56%) of women said they thought working from home would help them progress at work, as childcare and caring duties become less of a hindrance to working full-time.\nIn all, 65% of managers felt that working from home helps advance women's careers. However, a quarter of the women polled said homeworking was unlikely to advance their careers.\nDanielle Harmer, chief people officer at insurance giant Aviva, said companies need to set out a framework to ensure that people working remotely are not an afterthought for company bosses. Otherwise, she said, career prospects and the gender pay gap would suffer.\n\"I think if organisations leave it up to their employees, you could have a potential situation where those with caring responsibilities, who tend to be female, tend to work from home more often, and we look back in two years and think: hang on a second, why has the gender pay gap widened? Or why are female promotions slowing down a little?\" she said.\n\"It's taken us a long time to make progress on things like the gender pay gap, and I think it would be terrible if we went backwards on it.\"\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said British businesses reported that on average 60% of their staff were fully back at their normal place of work. About one-in-six employees are estimated to be using a hybrid model of working, the ONS said.\nVincent Keavney, Partner at the law firm DLA Piper and Lord Mayor of London told the BBC's Today programme that he thought it was \"important\" for younger members in the sector to be in the office in order get the training they need.\n\"The buzz around the office and the buzz around the city is fantastic.\"  \n\"I don't think we should be micromanaging companies but there is a very strong message the the city is open,\" he added.  \nHowever, proportions vary widely by sector. In professional services, 34% of staff are in the office, 24% are fully working from home, and 35% are doing a mix, the ONS said.\nSeparate ONS data showed a slightly higher percentage of male workers than females worked from home for at least some of the time in late October. \nPrevious ONS analysis showed women were more likely than men to say working from home allowed them more time to work, with fewer distractions. But men said working from home helped them come up with new ideas, while women found it a hindrance."

We have so many words we want to say about our beautiful boy, but they do not seem enough. \n\"We love him more than words can describe. Our boy made us the proudest parents and family on the planet. \n\"He was the sweetest of boys. He's forever in our hearts. Sweet dreams Jack, our perfect boy.\"\nGwent Police said the dog involved in the attack was 15 months old but it is still working to identify the breed it was.\nChief Superintendent Mark Hobrough said: \"Once this is completed, we will be able to establish if the breed features on the list of illegal dogs to own in this country and any other criminal offences identified will be investigated fully officers.\" \nAt the opening of the inquest at Newport Coroner's Court, the provisional cause of death was given as \"severe injuries to the head and neck\".\nThe court heard Jack was outside his house \"playing with a friend\", and then went to his friend's home.\nSenior coroner for Gwent, Caroline Saunders, said upon entering the home \"Jack was attacked by a dog\".\nThe court heard paramedics were called but Jack's injuries were \"unsurvivable\" and he was pronounced dead at 16:14 GMT on Monday.\nJack was identified by photos provided to the mortuary manager, the hearing was told.\nThe coroner said the circumstances surrounding Jack's death were \"violent and unnatural\" and so formally opened an inquest into his death.\nShe then adjourned the inquest for \"further inquiries\" to be made and it will be resumed at a later date.\nBBC Wales was told the dog, known as Beast, had been kept at a home in Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taf, until two days prior to the attack.\nIt was shot \"several times\" by firearms officers, a senior officer said.\nCh Supt Hobrough told ITV Wales the force had \"no records or reports of this dog, or any incident involving this dog, prior to this incident, but it's clear there are things that are known by the community that can assist this investigation\".\nThe dog is thought to have previously belonged to Lee Jenkins, 34, who voluntarily attended an interview with police on Wednesday.\nMr Jenkins has denied ownership of Beast.\nHe said: \"I am not the owner of that dog. I told the police everything I know. They know I have nothing to do with it.\n\"It's not my dog and it's since been re-homed from me.\"\nA neighbour of Mr Jenkins has told BBC Wales that Beast was used as a breeding stud. He is known to have fathered at least 10 puppies by Mr Jenkins' other dog, Beauty.\nOn 29 October, Mr Jenkins posted an advert to rehome Beast on a Facebook page, describing him as \"grate (sic) with people\", but adding that he did \"not like other dogs at all\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "Firmus Energy is putting gas prices up by 38% from 3 December across its Ten Towns network area.\nThe company said rising global energy costs had \"forced\" its hand to put prices up for the third time this year.\nFirmus gas prices increased by 35% in October and by 18% earlier in the year.\nThe move will affect about 55,000 customers in the Ten Towns area, which includes Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Londonderry and Newry.\nThe Consumer Council said the increase would mean the annual bill of a typical household will rise by about \u00a3268 a year or \u00a3255 a year for those with a prepayment meter.\nFirmus customers in Greater Belfast and in the Gas to the West network area will not be affected by the tariff change.\nFirmus chairman Dr David Dobbin said: \"This is a not a Firmus issue but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs.\n\"We know this is an unwelcome increase, which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable.\"\nFirmus said it would be introducing a support scheme to offer targeted help to those most in need, which would open at about the same time as the increase takes effect.\nWholesale costs make up 50% of customers' gas bills, which is why global increases have such a big effect locally.\nRising gas prices this year come in stark contrast to last year's low prices, which were described by one economist at the time as a \"consumer sweet-spot\".\nThe Utility Regulator has warned that high prices are likely to continue throughout the first half of next year.\nSome analysts have warned the volatility could last for between 18 to 36 months while others have suggested that the short answer is: we don't really know.\nOne thing most are agreed on is that while prices will come down they aren't likely to fall by as much as they have risen.\nThere are only two gas suppliers in Northern Ireland, which is why the Utility Regulator has to agree any price increase before it is passed on to customers.\nThe regulator caps suppliers' profits at 2%.\nNatasha Toman is a mum of four in Craigavon, County Armagh, and is a Firmus customer worried about what the price rise will mean for her.\n\"This is two price rises in such a short space of time - it's going to be a tough winter,\" she said.\n\"I topped my card up with the maximum amount, which is \u00a349, before 1 October so I would be getting it at the cheaper rate and now it is going up again.\n\"We don't have the luxury to change suppliers - there is only Firmus in this area.\n\"So you just have to get on with it and make the money stretch but it's tough going and it's going to be cutting in other areas as your home needs to be warm, particularly with four young children.\"\nThe Utility Regulator has capped the amount of profit gas providers can make at about 2%.\nBut it has no control over wholesale energy costs, which is one of the key reasons for the price rises.\nSo although a company's profit is capped that doesn't stop prices going up as the cost of commodities increases.\nThe actual cost of the energy makes up about half of our bills and the rest goes to the companies that manage the pipes and to cover other expenses.\nSo if the price of energy goes up the amount companies have to charge to make that 2% profit also increases.\nRead more: Why are energy bills going up?\nEddie Lynch, the commissioner for older people, said there was a \"real growing fear\" among elderly people about the increasing cost of household bills.\nMore than 50,000 pensioners in Northern Ireland are living in poverty, he said.\n\"What really concerns me is the perfect storm our older people are facing with higher energy bills and on top of that they have less opportunities to get out of the house because there are a lot less social activities since Covid hit,\" said the commissioner.\n\"That's how many of them actually managed their energy bills in the past - it was about getting out of the house so they didn't have to put the heat on.\n\"We're now at a stage where people have to spend much more time at home and are faced with huge bills coming down the line.\"\nUlster Unionist assembly member Andy Allen said the Stormont executive had to intervene \"swiftly and robustly\" to deal with the winter cost-of-living crisis.\nThis month he put a motion before the assembly asking members to create a winter energy emergency fund - it was passed unanimously.\n\"We welcome the confirmation from the minister for communities that she will be bidding for the entirety of the \u00a313.7m derived from UK Vulnerable Households fund in order to try and bring forward a support package,\" Mr Allen told BBC News NI.\n\"We need to see this in days, weeks - not months, not after Christmas. People on the ground need this now.\"\nHe said that charities were already having to support people in topping up gas and electric meters.\nThe Utility Regulator, which regulates the suppliers in the market, had warned that substantial rises in the price of gas were coming.\nIts chief executive John French said: \"Unfortunately over the last six months we have seen unparalleled increases in the cost of wholesale energy at a global level.\n\"If wholesale prices begin to reduce our system of regulation in Northern Ireland allows us to act to make sure that reductions are fully passed onto consumers as quickly as possible.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Caoimhe Archibald said the UK government should remove VAT\u00a0on energy bills, cutting the costs by 5%.\nDemocratic Unionist Party MP Carla Lockhart said anyone who was struggling with their bills should check whether they were eligible for the universal credit benefit."

      "text": "AstraZeneca has started to move away from providing its Covid-19 vaccine to countries on a not-for-profit basis.\nThe drugs giant has signed a series of for-profit agreements for next year, and expects to make a modest income from the vaccine, it said.\nThe company had previously said it would only start to make money from the vaccine when Covid-19 was no longer a pandemic.\nIts chief executive Pascal Soriot said the disease was becoming endemic.\nThe jab will continue to be supplied on a not-for-profit basis to poorer countries.\nMr Soriot had said previously: \"We decided to provide it at no profit, because our top priority was to protect global health.\"\nHe told the BBC he had \"absolutely no regrets\" about not making a profit when competitors had been, despite having to deal with political criticism in various countries.\nHe said the vaccine, which was developed with the University of Oxford, had saved a million lives around the world.\n\"I absolutely don't regret it,\" Mr Soriot said. \"We are proud as a company of the impact we have had - we've saved millions of hospitalisations. The [AstraZeneca] team continues to do a stellar job.\"\nHe said that the contracts that had been signed are for next year, adding: \"The virus is becoming endemic which means we have to learn to live with it.\n\"We started this to help, but we said we would transition [to making a profit on the vaccine],\" he said. \"It's not something we see as a huge profit-earner.\"\nThere will be tiered pricing for countries to make sure the vaccine is affordable, Mr Soriot said.\nBy the end of the year AstraZeneca expects to have supplied 250 million doses of its vaccine to the Covax programme for developing countries.\nOther vaccine manufacturers including Pfizer and Moderna have been making profits from their vaccines.\nA normal profit margin in the drugs industry is about 20%, but Mr Soriot said AstraZeneca, which charges about $5 per shot for the Covid vaccine at cost price, would not be making as much profit as that.\nHowever, Nick Dearden, director of campaign group Global Justice Now, said AstraZeneca's decision to start profiting from the vaccine while the coronavirus pandemic was continuing \"shows the utter folly of giving away publicly-funded science to big pharma\".\n\"This moment was always going to come - and it's exactly why public health experts have demanded a waiver of intellectual property on Covid-19 vaccines,\" he said.\nIn its latest financial results, AstraZeneca said: \"The company is now expecting to progressively transition the vaccine to modest profitability as new orders are received.\n\"Covid-19 vaccine sales in [the fourth quarter of 2021] are expected to be a blend of the original pandemic agreements and new orders, with the large majority coming from pandemic agreements.\"\nBy the end of September, AstraZeneca and its sub-licensees had supplied 1.5 billion doses.\nThe company reported revenues for the first nine months of the year of $25.4bn (\u00a319bn), but said its overall profit margins had declined, mainly due to providing the Covid-19 vaccine at cost price.\nAstraZeneca said a rise in profits in the fourth quarter from the Covid-19 vaccine would balance out costs related to developing a Covid-19 antibody treatment, as it kept its overall profit forecast for the year the same.\nShares in the drugs giant fell more than 4% on Friday.\nMeanwhile, another company that has developed a Covid vaccine, US giant Johnson & Johnson, said on Friday that it would split its consumer healthcare division, which makes products including Baby Powder and Listerine, from its drugs and medical devices businesses.\n\"The new Johnson & Johnson and the new consumer health company would each be able to more effectively allocate resources to deliver for patients and consumers, drive growth and unlock significant value,\" said Joaquin Duato, who is expected to become chief executive in January."

      "text": "A teacher who has been the target of abuse on TikTok says others in the profession are being \"pushed over the edge\" by online harassment.\nTom Rogers is one of dozens of teachers who have reported harassment on social media in recent weeks, some of whom have signed off sick.\nThe posts often feature footage from learning resources used by teachers during lockdowns.\nTikTok says it is taking extra measures to remove videos targeting teachers.\nAnd the government plans to introduce laws to make social-media companies more accountable.\nHistory teacher Mr Rogers had been unaware that a clip from one of his virtual lessons had been uploaded to TikTok until a colleague alerted him last week.\nWhen he searched the platform, he found two videos posted from an anonymous account with a combined total of about 12,000 views.\n\"You're thinking when you go in that kids are laughing at you and everyone's seen it,\" he told the BBC. \"You don't know who's seen it, but you know probably a lot of kids have.\"\nMr Rogers - whose school the BBC is not naming - reported the videos, but the police were unable to act. \nHe had not heard back from TikTok by the time he spoke to the BBC, and footage targeting him remained online at the time this story was published.\nMr Rogers said he tried not to let online trolls affect him, but was worried about other teachers who are not as used to social media.\n\"I think it's pushing some over the edge because of everything we've been through in the last two years,\" he said, adding that some people were \"quite fragile coming out of the pandemic\".\n\"They will quit their jobs, they will have to go off work with stress-related illness because of this. This will be the tipping point,\" he added.\nTom Quinn, a headteacher and chief executive of the Frank Field Education Trust in the North West of England and West Midlands, told the BBC that two of his teachers were off sick because of the abuse - and that social-media platforms needed to react more quickly in removing the offending videos.\n\"Over the years teachers and pupils have had relationships and joking relationships and have names for each other. This is different now,\" he said.\n\"When a child posts defamatory remarks, or humiliating remarks, on TikTok, it can be seen by up to two million people across the world. That has a really big impact when there is crucially no right to reply for the teacher.\"\nHe said the trust was working with the parents of children who had posted videos to ensure they understood the severity of the issue.\n\"In some of the largely viewed videos, the children are horrified that this has happened. They're the victims, as well, in all of this,\" he said. \"We would urge TikTok to consider that these are children we're talking about, who make mistakes and get it wrong.\"\nA spokesman for TikTok said harassment and bullying had \"no place\" on the platform.\n\"We regret the distress caused to some teachers as a result of abusive content posted to our platform,\" he said. \n\"We've already deployed additional technical measures and guidance, and we continue to proactively detect and remove violative content and accounts.\"\nThe spokesman said TikTok would increase its funding for an online helpline for professionals, which he said would help teachers report content. \n\"We'll be writing to every school in the country to ensure all staff have access to the resources they need, and we'll continue to work with affected schools, teachers, parents, unions and other partners to stamp out this intolerable abuse.\"\nHeadteachers' union the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said it had received more than 50 reports of \"disgraceful abuse\" and said there were likely to have been \"many more\" instances.\nGeneral secretary Geoff Barton welcomed TikTok's response and said he hoped \"this matter can be resolved swiftly\".\nBut he warned that the trend \"reinforces the urgent need for regulation of social-media platforms\", as teachers were spending time getting the content removed as well as dealing with the fallout of so much disruption during the pandemic.\n\"Social-media platforms should be legally responsible for ensuring they have processes in place which prevent offensive and abusive material from being posted in the first place,\" he said.\n\"This material is extremely distressing for the staff who are targeted. And the young people who are posting it are involved in behaviour which could lead to them being excluded from school and, in extreme cases, being the subject of a police investigation.\"\nSchool System Minister Baroness Diana Barran said on Twitter that the Department for Education (DfE) was \"engaging with TikTok on the steps they are taking to address the issue\".\nA DfE spokeswoman said the harassment of education staff was \"never acceptable\" and that online criminal attacks should be reported to the police. \n\"We are clear that social-media companies need to take action against harmful content on their platforms and we are introducing laws which will usher in a new era of accountability for these social-media companies,\" she said. \nWatch Elaine Dunkley's report on the BBC News at Six on BBC ONE or on iPlayer at 18:00 GMT on Friday 12 November."

      "text": "An ex-aide to the Duchess of Sussex \"regretted\" not giving evidence in her High Court case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday, the Court of Appeal has heard.\nMeghan won the privacy case when a judge found the publication of a letter to her father was unlawful - a ruling the publisher is trying to overturn.\nPapers released on the appeal hearing's final day revealed the regret of Jason Knauf, her ex-communications secretary.\nThe ruling is due at a later date.\nAssociated Newspapers' legal team have been seeking to overturn the High Court judgement at the Court of Appeal, disputing that Meghan's letter to her father Thomas Markle - sent in August 2018 - was simply a private and personal letter.\nIn written evidence, Meghan denied she thought it likely that her father would leak the letter and said she did not want any of it to be published.\nOn Wednesday Mr Knauf - who is due to stand down from his current role as the chief executive officer of the Royal Foundation at the end of the year - said in a witness statement that the duchess had written the letter with the understanding that it could be leaked.\nAlso on Wednesday, a statement from Meghan contained an apology to the court for not remembering an email exchange in which she agreed Mr Knauf could provide information to the authors of the Finding Freedom biography, written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand.\nOn Thursday, documents were released revealing that a confidential source contacted the publisher with the information that Mr Knauf regretted not giving evidence during the High Court case.\nKeith Mathieson, solicitor for Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), said in a witness statement that, in April, Mr Knauf's then legal team contacted ANL's lawyers to say his position was \"strictly neutral\" and he did not wish to have any involvement in the proceedings.\nBut after Meghan won the case, ANL was contacted by the source in July and approached Mr Knauf, who wished to provide a statement for the appeal.\n\"Mr Knauf was plainly a central figure in the events he describes,\" Mr Mathieson said, saying the former aide was a \"senior and trusted member of the royal household staff\".\nMr Mathieson described Mr Knauf's witness statement as \"measured in tone\" and \"honest and credible\".\nHe said the former aide had been \"careful not to include evidence of matters beyond his own personal knowledge\".\n\"Given the high profile nature of this litigation and the likelihood of his evidence (if admitted) being widely reported, as well as the position he holds, it is hardly conceivable that he would say anything he did not believe to be true,\" he said.\nAndrew Caldecott QC, representing ANL, told the court on Thursday that Mr Markle had faced \"nasty and untrue\" allegations in an article published by People magazine in the US and there had been a public interest in correcting them.\nDescribing the allegations, he said: \"In the teeth of his daughter being always dutiful and supporting him throughout with incredible generosity, first he cold-shouldered her at the wedding, in one of the most important parts of her life.\n\"He gave a cynical and self-interested response ignoring her pleas for reconciliation in a loving letter.\"\nHe said the letter to Mr Markle from Meghan was \"not a loving letter, not a generous letter\", contrary to how it was presented in the People article.\n\"When we come to the very first allegation about cold-shouldering her at the wedding... this allegation is demonstrably false, we say,\" Mr Caldecott said.\nJustin Rushbrooke QC, for Meghan, previously described the case as \"very straightforward\" and said her human rights were \"triply engaged\" by the publication of part of the letter.\nIn her written evidence, Meghan said she did not think her father would sell or leak the letter \"primarily because it would not put him in a good light\".\nShe \"merely recognised that this was a possibility\".\n\"To be clear, I did not want any of it (the letter) to be published, and wanted to ensure that the risk of it being manipulated or misleadingly edited was minimised, were it to be exploited,\" she said.\nThe duchess said the \"main purpose\" of the letter was to encourage her father to stop talking to the press.\nThe Court of Appeal judges - Sir Geoffrey Vos, Dame Victoria Sharp and Lord Justice Bean - said they will give their ruling at a later date."

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,Glasgow",
      "text": "The consequence of not acting on global warming after the COP26 conference will be \"profound\" for Wales, the deputy climate change minister has said. \nLee Waters warned the stakes were \"very, very high\" and the science was \"terrifying\" as the global climate conference in Glasgow draws to a close.\nDelegates from 200 countries have been discussing how to limit global warming.\nBefore the conference, First Minister Mark Drakeford said it must give a \"sense of hope for the future\". \nExperts in Wales have warned extreme weather events will threaten lives and make people poorer if global warming is not curbed. \nMr Waters said climate change targets would continue to be key in Wales, regardless of the outcome of the conference. \nHe said: \"Achieving net zero [emissions] exists separately, in my view.\n\"We have to do it regardless of whether COP agrees, and each individual member has his own responsibility.\n\"Wales has a contribution to make - every person in Wales has a contribution to make, as does the government. We should focus on that because the science is clear and it is terrifying, and we must act.\"\nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nHe added: \"Change will be very difficult for some communities, it is the role of government to help those communities make the change. \n\"If tackling climate change is seen as a great sacrifice, people are going to be reluctant to do it. \n\"Our role is to show that it's possible to change, and change can improve things. We can have a better quality of life if we do this in a managed way.\"\nHe said he had taken \"courage\" from the summit to \"continue to keep pushing forward and not be distracted by people who are not willing to make the change\". \nAlthough there are numerous projections, the most optimistic view is promises made in Glasgow put the world on course for a 1.8C increase in average global temperature. \nBut this depends on action being taken this decade. \nPrevious pledges predicted a rise of 2.7C of warming by the end of the century.\nMr Waters is one of many politicians, campaigners and charities from Wales who have made their way to Scotland for the conference. \nAmong them are the Youth Climate Ambassadors for Wales, who have been speaking at events, meeting delegates and campaigning.  \nShenona Mitra, from Bangor, Gwynedd, said it had been an \"intense\" experience. \n\"It'll be really interesting to see after this whether the momentum stays and whether promises turn into actions,\" she said.\nAnother of the youth ambassadors, Ellie Sanders, from Swansea, described being at the conference as \"an amazing opportunity.\"\nMeanwhile, Leo Carey-Read, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said he found COP to be an \"eye-opening experience\". \nHe added he felt \"hopeful in some senses, but I think I'd be na\u00efve to think that the 26th COP would be the final one\", but he \"definitely\" felt progress had been made. \nLeading climate change academic, Prof Mary Gagen of Swansea University, said side events involving young climate activists at Glasgow had been \"energising\". \nShe said: \"It's really uplifting. I'm a climate scientist, one of the generations and generations of us who've been working on climate science since Guy Callendar first discovered human-induced climate change in 1938. \n\"We need the energy of these sessions to keep working. It's lovely to hear youth activists, indigenous leader from Brazil and Peru, talking about the impact of climate change on their lives and their hopes for the future.\" "

      "title": "Yvonne Fletcher murder: Libyan instrumental in PC's shooting, court hears",
      "tags": "Libya,Metropolitan Police Service",
      "text": "A Libyan man, said to be close to the country's former leader Colonel Gaddafi, was \"instrumental\" in orchestrating the shooting of PC Yvonne Fletcher, a court has heard.\nPC Fletcher, 25, was killed outside the Libyan Embassy on 17 April 1984 during a protest by anti-Gaddafi activists.\nA civil case has been brought by her former friend and colleague John Murray against Salah Ibrahim Mabrouk.\nThe court heard the shooting plan came from \"way up the hierarchy\" in Libya.\nMr Mabrouk was one of the key figures in a \"revolutionary committee\" that had taken over the Libyan Embassy on Gaddafi's orders just before the shooting, leading it to be renamed the Libyan People's Bureau, the court was told.\nGaddafi took power in Libya in 1969 but was driving the country in an increasingly radical direction and targeting his enemies abroad, including the UK.\nOn 17 April, two Sterling sub-machine guns were used to fire on anti-Gaddafi protesters outside the building from a first floor window, killing PC Fletcher and injuring others.\nThe court heard evidence that the shooting was the result of a clear plan.\nThere had been warnings to the Foreign Office in London and British Embassy in Tripoli the previous evening that violence was possible.\n\"Not only was there a plan but that plan went way, way up the hierarchy,\" Phillippa Kaufmann QC, acting for John Murray, told the court.\n\"It was known in Tripoli in Libya that something was going to go down the very next day - there was going to be some form of violence.\" \nMr Mabrouk had told a meeting that he had spoken directly to Gaddafi who had told him to \"use the facilities, the guns, the weapons and the power of the embassy\" to target anti-Gaddafi activists, according to a witness statement provided by an individual who had infiltrated pro-Gaddafi students.\nMr Mabrouk was said to be \"very close\" to Gaddafi and witness statements said Mr Mabrouk was one of only a small group of people who had authority to organise such a shooting. \n\"This was an individual... not only committed to the plan but instrumental in its orchestration,\" the court was told by Ms Kauffmann.\nMr Mabrouk was identified as having asked for a Libyan solider to be brought to the embassy on the morning of the shooting to show others \"how to put together and dismantle a gun,\" according to a statement from an anonymous Libyan witness.\nMr Mabrouk is not alleged to have fired the actual shots.\nThe court heard one of two possible gunmen may have left the embassy from a garage before fleeing to Morocco. But Mr Mabrouk was carrying some of that man's documents, which he said had come into his possession because he had picked up his jacket by accident that morning.\nThe court was told Mr Mabrouk was \"plainly helping\" this individual. This gunman was said to have died in 2011.\nMr Mabrouk was also alleged to have told pro-Gaddafi counter-protesters where to stand so they would not get shot that morning, indicating he knew not just that a shooting would take place but the direction of fire.\nThe evidence about Mr Mabrouk came largely in the form of written statements previously collected from Libyans.\nLibyans close to Gaddafi had described opposition activists as \"stray dogs\" who should be killed.\nMr Mabrouk had asked for names, addresses and telephone numbers of anti-Gaddafi students, the court was told, while others had talked of \"teaching them a lesson\".\nThe court also heard evidence that a video had been made from inside the building to show Gaddafi the shooting. This video has never surfaced.\nMr Mabrouk has been barred from re-entering the UK and he is not defending the case but in an email to Mr Murray's lawyers he denied any involvement.\nOn Thursday, Mr Murray gave evidence about the day of the shooting. He explained how he and PC Fletcher were due to be undertaking other duties that day but at the last moment were asked to fill in and help police a demonstration outside the Libyan Embassy.\nMr Murray said he and PC Fletcher had talked to the demonstrators and swapped where they stood a number of times. Then suddenly he heard what sounded like a firecracker and turned to see his colleague and friend lying bleeding on the pavement.\n\"I blamed myself. I felt responsible for Yvonne's murder,\" he said in emotional testimony.\n\"If I had changed places with her once more, it would have been me\u2026 she died in my place as far as I was concerned.\"\nThe events left a deep personal impact, he said. \"I was in a dark place,\" he said of the aftermath, adding that 37 years on he still dreams about that day. \"It's always there.\"\nAs she was dying, Mr Murray promised he would find those responsible. \"The last words she would hear was me saying I would find who did this to her and why. That was the promise I made to her and I intend to keep.\"\nMr Murray said he felt \"disgusted\" and \"very depressed\" when he discovered that Prime Minister Tony Blair had not raised the issue of PC Fletcher's killing when he met Gaddafi in 2004, despite having been told that it would be top of the agenda.\nMr Mabrouk was deported after the shooting but then returned to live in the UK. In 2015 he was arrested in connection with the killing but in 2017 the case was dropped because crucial evidence could not be used on grounds of national security. That led to the civil case brought by Mr Murray.\nA judgement is expected next week."

      "title": "UK bucks Europe Covid trend but concern over winter",
      "tags": "Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "While many European countries are seeing steep rises in coronavirus cases and preparing to step up Covid restrictions, the UK has been going in the other direction. \nExperts say differences in levels of immunity and people's behaviour are the likely explanations.\nThe UK had been seeing the highest rates of cases and deaths in Western Europe, but these have been falling.\nHowever, Boris Johnson has warned there is no room for complacency.\nThe PM said the wave of infections sweeping across Europe was a reminder that the pandemic had not gone away.\nHe said: \"I'm seeing the storm clouds gathering over parts of the European continent.\n\"What I'm saying today is that the urgency of getting that booster jab is more evident than ever.\n\"If we don't do it fast enough, we can see the potential risks to the state of the pandemic in what's happening in other parts of Europe.\"\nThe latest daily figure for the number of people testing positive in the UK is 40,375. This week has seen 7% fewer cases than the week before, while deaths are down 8.9%. \nThe UK figures have - like a cruising aeroplane dealing with turbulence - been bouncing around roughly the same level since the summer.\nCovid cases are now taking off in large swathes of Europe, with some countries already climbing to a higher altitude than the UK.\nIf you look at the rate per million people, around 500 test positive for Covid each day in the UK. In Austria the figure is more than double this. \nThe Netherlands, which has also overtaken the UK, has declared three weeks of restrictions in Western Europe's first \"partial lockdown\" of winter.\nSimilar countries such as Germany are marginally lower, but the trajectory is causing concern and led to warnings of 100,000 deaths in the country this week. \n\"Cases are rising quite quickly across most of Europe at this stage, it's a very fluid situation,\" Prof Francois Balloux, from University College London, told the BBC.\nHe added: \"A couple of weeks ago not many would have predicted this rapid increase in Europe.\"\nThe driving force behind the spike is a combination of two things - human behaviour and the amount of immunity in the population. \nDr Simon Clarke, from the University of Reading, said we're \"probably seeing the start of winter\" in Europe. \n\"When the circumstances are wrong and infection is just more possible you can expect numbers to start climbing and more socialising and mixing indoors means there's more opportunity for transmission, even in vaccinated individuals.\" \nThe sustained high levels of Covid in the UK - which \"ran hotter\" than Europe all summer - will have added to the amount of immunity being provided by the immunisation campaign. \n\"In the UK, the proportion of the population who have antibodies due to vaccination or infection or both is very high, so essentially more people are protected,\" said Prof Balloux. \nWaning immunity may also be a bigger factor in Europe. Many European countries stuck to giving the two vaccine doses three weeks apart. The UK, controversially at the time, spaced them out further which could lead to a stronger and more durable immune response, say experts. \nThe increase in cases will not be an equal threat to all European countries. The main job of vaccines is to stop people dying from Covid and to keep people out of hospitals rather than stop all infections, although it does help cut those too. \nCountries with low vaccine uptake can expect a more difficult winter. \nThere is still debate about what will happen next in the UK - will cases cruise around the same level for a while or come down quickly. \nEstimates from the Office of National Statistics, based on Covid tests done by households, suggest that nearly 1.1 million people in the UK would test positive for coronavirus in the week ending 6 November.\nThat's 1.7% of the population - or one in 60 people - down from nearly 2% last week. \n\"The half-term break may have played a part, though infections were decreasing prior to this time. Over the next few weeks we will see if this decline continues,\" said Sarah Crofts from the ONS.\nWhat is happening to people who have received a booster dose is also being closely monitored. Evidence suggests the levels of protective antibodies in their blood has shot back up. It is too soon though to tell if the declines in cases among the over 80s are due to extra protection from boosting or less Covid circulating due to half term school holidays. \nDr Clarke warned: \"International comparisons are never very useful, countries don't work in lockstep, even relatively similar countries don't work in lockstep. \n\"There will be times when the UK has a bad patch and others do well, and vice versa.\""

      "text": "The man who organised the flight which killed footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson has been sentenced to 18 months in prison. \nDavid Henderson, 67, of Hotham, East Riding of Yorkshire, was found guilty last month of recklessly endangering the safety of an aircraft. \nHe also admitted to a charge of trying to arrange a flight for a passenger without permission or authorisation. \nSala and Mr Ibbotson died in January 2019 in a crash in the English Channel.\nThe footballer's body was found about two-and-a-half weeks after the crash, though Mr Ibbotson, the pilot, has never been found. \nThe judge, Mr Justice Foxton said Henderson had shown \"a cavalier attitude\" and had not kept even the most basic records. \nHe added that Henderson had intentionally breached Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations \"for reason of profit\", and was \"reckless, not merely negligent\". \nDavid Henderson's lawyer has said his legal team will consider an appeal against his conviction.\nThe Argentine striker had completed a \u00a315m transfer from Nantes to Cardiff City and was travelling between the two cities at the time of the crash. \nThe charge of endangering the safety of an aircraft related to two flights, an outward flight from Cardiff to Nantes on 19 January and the return flight, which crashed near Alderney, on 21 January. \nThe trial heard Mr Ibbotson, 59, of Crowle, Lincolnshire, regularly flew for Henderson, but he did not have a commercial licence for carrying passengers, nor did he have the correct certification to fly at night and his rating to fly the aircraft used - a single-engine Piper Malibu - had expired. \nHenderson was supposed to fly the plane, but was on holiday with his wife in Paris, so asked Mr Ibbotson to do the journey. \nJust moments after finding out the plane had gone down, Henderson texted a number of people telling them to stay silent, warning it would \"open a can of worms,\" the jury was told.\n\"Ibbo has crashed the Malibu and killed himself and VIP! Bloody disaster. There will be an enquiry,\" he texted one person.\nIn another message, he wrote: \"Questions may be asked about his flying.\"\nThe father-of-three and former RAF officer admitted in court he had feared an investigation into his business dealings.\nThe trial also heard how the owner of the plane had told Henderson not to allow Mr Ibbotson to fly the aircraft again after he committed two airspace infringements while piloting it. \nHenderson's wife wept in court as Mr Justice Foxton sentenced her husband to 18 months in prison for endangering an aircraft, with a three-month sentence, to run concurrently, for attempting to discharge a passenger.\nAfter the hearing, Henderson's lawyer said his client wished to pay his respects to the families of the two men, and was considering an appeal.\nSpeaking outside court, former Argentinian rugby player Christian Martin, a friend of Sala said: \"It's a tragedy that could have been avoided and it happened, and it took away a young Argentinian, a young countryman with a lot of dreams and hopes\".\n\"This happened a long way from Santa Fe, and a long way from Argentina, and people will be searching for more answers in the coming months.\"\nAn inquest into Sala's death is due to be held next year.\nRob Bishton, group director of safety and airspace regulation at the UK Civil Aviation Authority, said: \"Our thoughts remain with the families and friends that were affected by this tragic accident in January 2019. \n\"Illegal commercial flights represent a significant safety risk and that is reflected in the court's decision today.\n\"The aviation system relies on the integrity of all those involved. Anyone operating a commercial flight should always have the necessary licence and approvals in place.\" \nHenderson was accused in court of running a \"cowboy outfit\" more focused on profit than the safety of his passengers.\nThe Air Charter Association said the sentencing would set a precedent for the future.\nChief executive Glenn Hogben said: \"There's more that can be done but it will certainly serve as a significant deterrent to people who are either currently involved in these types of practices or make people think twice about taking that sort of direction.\""

      "tags": "Social media,Belarus,Kurds,European Union,Poland",
      "text": "\"I swear to God, guys, gathering is the best thing.\"\nWith winter approaching and frustrations rising in the forests of western Belarus, the word went out among thousands of desperate would-be migrants.\nThe best way to get to Poland, the messages said, was to try going en masse, rather than in furtive groups, creeping through the forest, hoping to cross into the European Union (EU) unnoticed.\n\"All immigrants go to this site,\" the messages said, complete with images of the Azs-16 Belorusneft petrol station, just over 1.6km (one mile) from the border.\n\"Many immigrants here.\"\nAnd so, last Monday, thousands of migrants converged on the petrol station close to the Belarusian village of Bruzgi and started walking to the nearby border. Their target area was a crossing at Kuznica, where they believed they could enter Poland, hopefully unimpeded.\nThe crowd was mostly made up of Iraqi Kurds, escaping political and economic hardships at home in the hope of finding better lives in the EU.\nVideos from Monday show Belarusian soldiers standing by, unwilling or unable to stop the crowd reaching the border.\nThe country's authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, stands accused by the EU of orchestrating this entire crisis, which has been building since the summer.\nHis neighbours call it a form of \"hybrid warfare\" against the EU, waged in revenge for successive waves of sanctions against his repressive regime.\nIt's a charge he denies, despite warning, back in May, that he would no longer attempt to stop migrants and drugs passing into Europe.\nBut while there is now ample evidence that the Lukashenko regime has encouraged tens of thousands of migrants to fly to Minsk and then pointed them in the direction of the borders with Lithuania and Poland, it's clear that social media is playing a significant role in shaping the actions of the migrants.\nOn Monday, Poland accused Belarus of sending a large group of migrants to breach the border, calling it a major provocation. But it appears the mass move to a single crossing point may have been orchestrated by the migrants themselves, not the Belarusian authorities.\nOver a period of several days from late last week, Kurdish Telegram and Facebook groups with thousands of members were full of messages, telling migrants to head for a single location, with a specific purpose in mind.\n\"The convoy of hope stands here on the map, marked with a red balloon,\" read one message, repeated several times in a group called Iraqi Immigrants.\n\"Tomorrow at 9:30 behind the station all be ready for a few hours then leave,\" read another. \"Please join. It's the only solution.\"\nMigrants and family members contacted by the BBC say that the convoy consisted of some who travelled directly from the Belarusian capital, Minsk, but also large numbers who had been trapped in the nearby forest for days, unable to find a way across the border.\nShwan Kurd, a 33-year-old from Iraq, was among those who were already in the forest. He witnessed Monday's rush to the border but didn't know if it was planned.\n\"Everyone came to one place,\" he said. \"Maybe people came because of the social media posts.\"\nA large crowd, they reckoned, would be impossible to ignore.\n\"For those in Belarus,\" another Telegram message read, \"thousands of people have gathered to create a mass influx.\"\nThe migrants have an eye on past precedent.\n\"The refugees said 'let's repeat 2015',\" Barwa Nusreddine Ahmed told me from his home in the northern Iraqi city of Sulaymaniyah. From there, he's closely following the progress of his brother, who's travelling with his pregnant wife and three children.\nIn 2015-16, hundreds of thousands of migrants poured into Europe from Turkey, triggering a major crisis. There were dramatic scenes as desperate people pushed their way through the Greek-Macedonian border.\nThe German chancellor, Angela Merkel's decision to open Germany's doors contributed to the stampede and won the fierce admiration of migrants. The gesture has not been forgotten, and those flooding into Belarus this year hope, even believe, that the gesture will be repeated.\n\"They said we must do that thing again, so the world will see us,\" Mr Ahmed said.\n\"The refugees say\u2026 we want to show the world how many people we are. Everybody is waiting for Germany to take action.\"\nBut the historical parallels don't stop there. \nThe Kurds, as a stateless and frequently persecuted people, have not failed to notice that 2021 marks a grim anniversary.\nIn 1991, 1.5 million Kurds fled Iraq into neighbouring countries as former President Saddam Hussein sought to punish them for rising up in the wake of that year's Gulf War. It was an epic, harrowing struggle, as desperate refugees fled through the mountains in appalling conditions.\nIn recent days, social media posts have noted the 30th anniversary of this traumatic event, and made explicit parallels with what is happening now.\n\"It's not something new to the Kurds,\" Mr Ahmed said."

      "text": "Paramedics fear they cannot do their job safely due to being forced to work with the armed forces on ambulances, a union has warned.\nMore than 100 military personnel were brought in to help the Welsh Ambulance Service cope with Covid pressures. \nBut the GMB said they provide \"very little assistance\", put more pressure on the trained medics and that without action the service will collapse.\nThe union has raised its concerns with Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan.\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"Operational issues are decisions for the Trust to take and we are aware the Trust is working with staff and staff representatives to listen to concerns and resolve these in partnership at an organisational level.\"\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service said it was aware of concerns but insisted it would not \"stand by\" at a time of unprecedented demand and that the extra manpower provided by the armed forces had enabled it to deploy extra vehicles and crews.\nThe Trust is due to meet with union officials next week.\nHowever the GMB also said its members are being threatened with suspension or disciplinary action if they raise the problems and \"being bullied and forced to split from their regular trained crew partner to crew up with the untrained military\". \nSince mid-October 129 personnel from the Army, Navy and RAF have been working with the Welsh Ambulance Service, and are due to continue doing so until the end of November.\nThe deployments were announced last month, to work as non-emergency drivers on lower priority calls and free up ambulance resources for emergency calls.\nBut the union says military personnel are being sent to \"emergency situations\".\nIn a letter to Ms Morgan, the GMB says \"military personnel are not able to drive the ambulances on emergency status with the use of 'blue lights and sirens' and, as they are not trained as paramedics, they are providing effectively very little assistance to our members\".\nThe union says ambulance staff \"are having to not only assess and treat the patient and their family, but keep an eye open for the military personnel working with them, giving them instructions on what is needed to be done rather than being able to rely on a trained medic\".\nIt added: \"Our members are reporting that some military personnel are reporting to them that they are not comfortable dealing with emergency work and have not had to deal with medical emergencies like death before. \n\"This is putting extra pressure on already pressured medics and also putting the military personnel into situations that could harm them with the knock on affect of endangering the public.\"\nThe union says the situation is making staff ill.\n\"Several of our members have informed us that the reason for their ill health is directly as a result of being forced to work with untrained unqualified people which has affected their ability to sleep due to increased pressures,\" it told the health minister.\n\"We believe this is a perfect storm, that if not dealt with quickly, will result in the complete collapse of the service.\"\nThe GMB says it is entering into dispute with the Welsh Ambulance Service on the matter.\nThe service said it was committed to working with the union to address concerns but had seen examples of staff and military personnel \"working positively\" and no evidence of a systematic issue.\nJason Killens, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service, said: \"We understand some colleagues are concerned about the appropriateness of military support.\n\"But given high levels of absence, greater demand than ever before and extended delays at hospitals, the Welsh Ambulance Service has taken a decision that it is not prepared to stand by and see a significant number of patients experience distressingly long waits in the community because of a lack of available resources.\n\"In the month since the latest military deployment, and whilst delays at hospitals have remained challenging, we have had the capacity to respond to more patients and in a more timely way.\n\"This is the result of being able to make more vehicles and crews available because of the support we are receiving from military colleagues.\""

      "text": "Austrians are days away from a first lockdown for anyone not fully vaccinated, after record infections were reported across the country.\nUpper Austria province will impose restrictions from Monday if it gets the go-ahead from the federal government. Salzburg also plans new measures.\nChancellor Alexander Schallenberg said a national lockdown for the unvaccinated was \"probably inevitable\".\nTwo-thirds of people should not suffer because others were hesitant, he said.\nUpper Austria, which borders Germany and the Czech Republic and has a population of 1.5 million, has the country's highest level of infection and the lowest vaccination rate. \nNationally, a record 11,975 Covid-19 infections were recorded in the past 24 hours and Austria's coronavirus commission has warned of a threat that \"must be taken seriously\".\nAustria is currently seeing the highest daily infections since the pandemic began, and it is keen to avoid a lockdown for the vaccinated.\nIt has already banned the unvaccinated from going to restaurants, cinemas, ski lifts and hairdressers, but things are about to get even tougher in Upper Austria.\nThe province is introducing a lockdown for the unvaccinated. \nThe chancellor says this means that people who have not been vaccinated won't be able to leave home, unless it is for essential reasons like going to work, buying food or exercise.  \nCritics say the lockdown will be very hard to enforce. \nIf infections continue to rise, the authorities say lockdowns for the unvaccinated could be introduced in other areas. \nThe far-right opposition Freedom Party has been campaigning on a platform of vaccine scepticism, a message that has found favour with many Austrians. It says the move will create a group of second-class citizens. \nAustria's seven-day incidence rate is far higher than in neighbouring Germany, where Health Minister Jens Spahn recently warned of a pandemic of the unvaccinated. \nOn Thursday, Germany recorded more than 50,000 daily infections for the first time. Germany's 67.3% vaccination rate is higher than in Austria, but not by much.\nUnvaccinated people will in effect be barred from restaurants, hotels, cinemas and theatres in the state of Brandenburg from Monday, by a \"2G\" rule limiting access to people who have been vaccinated or have recovered from Covid.\nThe Netherlands is also facing a surge in cases and hospital admissions, with a record 16,364 daily infections announced on Thursday.\nThe caretaker Dutch government is expected to announce Western Europe's first partial lockdown of the winter later on Friday.\nReports suggest a three-week tightening of restrictions is planned, with non-essential shops along with cafes, restaurants and hotels required to shut at 19:00. Public sports events including professional football would go ahead behind closed doors, sources say.\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "text": "Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon has been charged with contempt of Congress after refusing to give evidence about the US Capitol riot.\nHe was summoned to testify on what he knew about plans for the protest that ended with the storming of Congress.\nThe House of Representatives voted last month to send the case to the justice department, which opted on Friday to prosecute Mr Bannon, 67. \nHe could face up to a year in prison and a $100,000 (\u00a374,500) fine.\nTrump supporters raided the US Congress building on 6 January as lawmakers were meeting to certify the election result.\nMr Trump, a Republican, has refused to acknowledge losing the election to Democratic President Joe Biden last year, making claims - without evidence - of mass voter fraud.\nThis was the first such indictment to come out of the House of Representatives Select Committee's inquiry of the 6 January invasion of the Capitol complex.\nOne of the contempt counts against Mr Bannon is linked to his refusal to appear for a deposition and the other is for his refusal to produce documents for the committee.\nThe political advisor - who was fired from the White House in 2017 but remained loyal to former President Donald Trump - is expected to surrender to authorities on Monday, when he will appear in court.\nIn a statement released on Friday, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said the indictment reflected the justice department's \"steadfast commitment\" to the rule of law. \nSubpoena documents quote Mr Bannon - who currently hosts the right-wing War Room podcast - as saying on the eve of the riot that \"all hell is going to break loose tomorrow\".\nThe 67-year-old's lawyers argued that his communications involving the former president were protected.\nMr Trump has urged his former aides to reject all requests to submit to depositions. He argued they have the right to withhold information because of executive privilege - a legal principle that protects many White House communications. \nThe US Court of Appeals in Washington is scheduled to hold a hearing at the end of this month to rule on Mr Trump's claim of executive privilege, after it was rejected by a lower court. \nThe former president is also attempting to block a trove of phone records, visitor logs and other White House documents that congressional investigators are chasing for their Capitol riot inquiry.\nPresident Biden has argued that executive privilege does not apply in this case.\nContempt of Congress cases are notoriously difficult to litigate.\nThe last successful prosecution was in 1974, against a conspirator in the Watergate scandal that forced President Richard Nixon out of office.\nIf Mr Bannon is cleared it will not be his first scrape with the legal system. Before leaving office in January, Mr Trump pardoned Mr Bannon of charges that he had defrauded donors who gave money to fund construction of a southern border wall.\nMr Bannon's indictment came on the same day that Mark Meadows, a former White House chief of staff in the Trump administration, defied a similar subpoena to appear before the committee.\nHis lawyer said on Friday that Mr Meadows had a \"sharp legal dispute\" with the committee because of Mr Trump's claims of executive privilege.\nIn a statement, committee chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said that Mr Meadow's decision \"to defy the law\" may force the committee to pursue contempt proceedings like those applied to Mr Bannon.\n\"It's unfortunate that Mr Meadows has chosen to join a very small group of witnesses who believe they are above the law,\" Mr Thompson said.\nHe added that efforts from Mr Meadows, Mr Bannon and others \"won't prevail in stopping the select committee's effort getting answers for the American people about January 6th\".\nThe House Select Committee has issued dozens of subpoenas in the last week, calling on many former Trump officials to hand over documents and testify about the riot.\nThey include Kayleigh McEnany, the ex-White House press secretary, Stephen Miller, who was Mr Trump's senior adviser, and Michael Flynn, former national security adviser."

      "tags": "Companies,Construction industry,Employment,UK economy,Brexit,Coronavirus pandemic,Haulage",
      "text": "Prisons are facing difficulties recruiting enough officers amid a surge in job vacancies, a union has said.\nThis comes as job adverts have soared to a record high in the run-up to Christmas, according to recruiters.\nDriving instructors, prison officers and forklift truck drivers are among the jobs in highest demand, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said.\nMeanwhile demand for construction roles dropped due to supply chain problems.\nPrisons were among the employers with the most demand for staff in late October and early November, REC data suggested, with adverts for prison officer rising by 13%.\nThe Prison Officers Association (POA) union said prisons are facing severe recruitment difficulties. \"Staff are voting with their feet and leaving\" after a recent pay review, said POA assistant general secretary Mick Pimblett. \nThe prison service is \"close to breaking point\" in the run-up to Christmas, he added.\nThe POA gave Berwyn prison in north Wales as an example - 134 prison officers have left over the past three months.\nThere has been an increase in violence and self-harm among prisoners, and violence directed at prison officers, after coronavirus restrictions on prisoners mixing were lifted, said Mr Pimblett. \nDue to crown courts processing cases again after postponements from coronavirus lockdowns and people being convicted, the number of prisoners is reaching capacity, putting more strain on the system, he added. \nA HM Prison Service spokeswoman said: \"Vacancies across the estate have been stable for six months and these figures include recruitment to our brand new prison, HMP Five Wells, which will open in the new year.\" \nIn October, the HM Prison Service announced that all staff earning less than \u00a324,000 will receive a \u00a3250 pay rise, and all staff yet to reach the top of their pay band will continue to receive progression pay of up to 5%.\nVacancies for driving instructors saw the biggest jump, the REC data suggested, rising by about a third.\nAn REC spokesman said that pent-up demand from the pandemic for driving lessons and tests was likely to be behind the rise.\nKaren Bransgrove, general manager of the Driving Instructors Association (DIA), said she had not noticed more adverts, but there was a lot of demand for tests and lessons.\n\"There is a huge backlog of tests,\" she said, adding that people could not learn to drive for 18 months during the pandemic so \"naturally there's pent-up demand\". She added that the number of instructors had also fallen. \n\"Lots of people took early retirement or dropped out [of driving instruction] due to the pandemic,\" Ms Bransgrove said.\nLoveday Ryder, chief executive of the Driver Vehicle and Standards Agency (DVSA) said it was doing \"all we can\" to provide as many tests as possible services get back to normal.\n\"I know learners will be keen to take their test now, but it is important that candidates are properly prepared and don't rush to take it,\" she said.\n\"With more than half of candidates failing, and demand currently extremely high for tests, learners should only take their test only when they are confident they can pass.\"\nThis would prevent a further backlog of tests and lengthy waits for retests. \nThe REC figures also suggested a sharp rise in vacancies for forklift truck drivers.\nThere is a chronic shortage of HGV drivers in the UK, which the logistics industry has blamed on factors including Covid and Brexit.\nThere is also a shortage of forklift truck drivers, which the UK Warehousing Association said was also linked to Brexit.\nClare Bottle, the association's chief executive, said that prior to Brexit, 34% of forklift truck drivers were EU nationals, but now many had gone back to their home countries.\nDriver pay went up between 20-30% because of the labour shortages that followed, she said, which was unsustainable for warehousing businesses, the majority of which were small to medium-sized.\nThese businesses were already operating on thin margins, with 60-70% of costs already taken up by staffing.\nIn the short term, those businesses had put prices up for their retailer customers to survive, but Ms Bottle said those price rises could ultimately be passed onto consumers, adding to inflationary pressures.\nIn the longer term, the industry needed to attract more younger people and women, she said.\nMs Bottle added that warehousing was \"dominated\" by older people, mainly men: \"We've got an image problem that we need to tackle.\"\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are closely monitoring labour supply and working with sector leaders to understand how we can best ease particular pinch points. Similar challenges are being faced by other countries around the world.   \n\"We want to see employers make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad. Our Plan for Jobs is helping people across the country retrain, build new skills and get back into work. \n\"The government encourages all sectors to make employment more attractive to UK domestic workers through offering training, careers options, wage increases and investment.\"\nJob adverts surged in many parts of the country between 25 October and 7 November, the REC data suggested, but in some sectors there was a sharp fall in demand.\nDuring the pandemic the UK construction industry has boomed, driven by factors including more house sales during the stamp duty holiday and an increased appetite for home improvements.\nBut Covid has also seen a global squeeze on supply chains, with the costs of building materials rising rapidly.\nThe REC's chief executive Neil Carberry said adverts for construction jobs saw a drop-off last week as supply issues \"constrained the industry's ability to work to capacity\".\nAdverts for painters and decorators were down more than 17%, while demand for roofers, plasterers, bricklayers and carpenters also fell.\nThe Federation of Master Builders said the drop in adverts \"may be indicative of the overall cooling off of the market, following a 24-year-high in construction activity earlier in the year as lockdown restrictions eased\".\nBrian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, said: \"Small, local builders are also facing lengthy delays, with 89% having to press pause on work because of skills and materials shortages.\n\"These [REC] figures could suggest that builders are unwilling or unable to take on more work while skills and materials are running short, causing uncertainty when planning for new jobs.\""

      "tags": "Aviation safety,Cardiff,Civil Aviation Authority,Nantes,Hotham,Emiliano Sala death,Air travel",
      "text": "The organiser of the flight in which footballer Emiliano Sala died has been found guilty of endangering the safety of an aircraft.\nSala, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, died in the crash in the English Channel in January 2019.\nDavid Henderson, 67, of Hotham, East Riding of Yorkshire, was found guilty after a trial at Cardiff Crown Court.\nHe had also previously admitted trying to arrange a flight for a passenger without permission or authorisation.\nIt took the jury seven-and-a-half hours to convict Henderson by a majority verdict. He will be sentenced on 12 November.\nLawyers speaking on behalf of Sala's family said Henderson's convictions were welcomed but his actions were only \"one piece of the puzzle\" of how the plane came to crash.\nArgentine striker Sala and Mr Ibbotson died after their single-engine Piper Malibu plunged into the English Channel on a flight between Cardiff and Nantes in January 2019, set up by Henderson with football agent William \"Willie\" McKay.\nThe footballer was involved in a \u00a315m transfer to Cardiff City from Nantes and was travelling between the two cities at the time of his death.\nThe court heard how Ibbotson, who regularly flew for Henderson, did not hold a commercial pilot's licence, a qualification to fly at night, and his rating to fly the single-engine Piper Malibu had expired.\nHenderson had asked Mr Ibbotson to fly the plane as he was away on holiday with his wife in Paris.\nJust moments after finding out the plane had gone down, Henderson texted a number of people telling them to stay silent, warning it would \"open a can of worms\", the jury was told.\nThe father-of-three and former RAF officer admitted in court he had feared an investigation into his business dealings.\nProsecutor Martin Goudie QC said Henderson had been \"reckless or negligent\" in the way he operated the plane, by putting his business above the safety of passengers.\nMr Goudie said Henderson had created a culture of breaching the air navigation regulations among the pilots he hired.\nFay Keely, who owned the plane, had told Henderson not to allow Mr Ibbotson to pilot the plane again after being contacted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) about two airspace infringements he had committed.\nDespite this, Henderson allowed Mr Ibbotson to continue flying, and his message to the pilot read: \"We both have an opportunity to make money out of the business model but not if we upset clients or draw the attention of the CAA.\"\nHenderson did not have the permit needed to fly passengers in the American plane, or an Air Operator Certificate (AOC), which was also required.\nMr Goudie accused Henderson of lying in his statements to investigators, and of running a \"cowboy outfit\" after questioning him over failings to keep basic information on his pilots.\nIn his closing speech, he claimed Henderson ran an \"incompetent, undocumented and dishonest organisation\".\nHowever Stephen Spence QC, defending, had said his client's actions were \"purely a paperwork issue\" and had not led to a likelihood of danger.\nHe said his client knew Mr Ibbotson, who had been flying for decades, was an experienced pilot.\nMr Spence told the court the only difference between a commercial licence and the private licence held by Mr Ibbotson was whether you could carry passengers for money or not, rather than ability.\nHenderson also argued on the stand that he had phoned Ms Keely after she forbade Mr Ibbotson from flying and convinced her to let him pilot again.\nMs Keely said she does not remember such a call.\nBBC Wales understands that Cardiff City FC welcomes the verdict and hopes that the outcome will provide a sense of justice and closure to the families.\nDaniel Machover, of Hickman & Rose solicitors, representing the Sala family, said in a statement after the verdict: \"Mr Henderson's convictions are welcome and we hope the CAA will ensure that illegal flights of this kind are stopped. \n\"The actions of David Henderson are only one piece in the puzzle of how the plane David Ibbotson was illegally flying came to crash into the sea on 21 January 2019. \n\"We still do not know the key information about the maintenance history of the aircraft and all the factors behind the carbon monoxide poisoning revealed in August 2019 by AAIB.\n\"The answers to these questions can only be properly established at Emiliano's inquest, which is due to start in February next year.\" \nThe statement added that the Sala family \"fervently hope\" all involved in the inquest, including Piper Aircraft Inc and the AAIB, would provide full disclosure of material.\n\"Only if that happens will Emiliano's family finally know the truth about this tragedy enabling all the lessons to be learned, so that no family goes through a similar preventable death,\" it said.\nKate Staples, the UK CAA's general counsel, extended sympathies to families and friends affected by the fatal crash.\n\"Aviation safety relies upon the integrity of everyone involved in the industry,\" she said.\n\"Unlawful and unsafe activity such as Mr Henderson's is unacceptable and the UK Civil Aviation Authority will always look to prosecute illegal activity.\"\nKevin Ducksbury, the chairman of the Air Charter Association (ACA), said the trade body was \"deeply dismayed\" that \"so many fundamental safety rules, and basic rules of airmanship were disregarded and broken\" in this case. \n\"The ruling confirms that Mr Henderson arranged and coordinated this flight illegally, in which footballer Emiliano Sala tragically lost his life.\n\"The association is profoundly disturbed that this flight was allowed to happen but welcomes the UK CAA's representation in this case,\" he said.\nMr Ducksbury added that the ACA would continue its work to educate the public and wider aviation community, with it's primary cause to stamp out illegal transport."

      "text": "Senior military officers buried evidence that British troops were executing detainees in Afghanistan, the High Court has been told.\nMinistry of Defence documents reveal UK Special Forces officers suspected their men were killing unarmed Afghans who posed no threat.\nThey also show the allegations were kept secret and not reported to the Royal Military Police (RMP).\nThe MoD says the evidence is not new and has already been investigated.\nThe court case follows a 2019 investigation by BBC Panorama and the Sunday Times that raised allegations of unlawful killings by special forces during the war in Afghanistan.\nThe High Court is considering whether the allegations were investigated properly by the armed forces.\nThe man bringing the case, Saifullah, claims four members of his family were assassinated in the early hours of 16 February 2011. \nHis lawyers were asking the court to order the defence secretary to release more documents before a full judicial review hearing.\nDocuments already disclosed were presented to the court. They showed nine Afghan men were killed in a raid on 7 February 2011 and eight more were killed by the same special forces assault team two days later. \nMore than a dozen detainees were killed after they were taken back into buildings to help search them. British troops claimed they were forced to shoot them after they reached for hidden weapons. \nThe documents show that in one email, a British lieutenant colonel expressed disbelief at the official accounts.\nHe said it was \"quite incredible\" the number of prisoners who decided to grab weapons after being sent back into a building. \nA fellow officer replied: \"I find it depressing it has come to this. Ultimately a massive failure of leadership.\" \nA week later, the four members of Saifullah's family were shot dead in similar circumstances by the same special forces assault team. \nThe documents show the killings were described as \"astonishing\" by a senior officer. \nAnother senior officer later dismissed a soldiers' description of events, saying \"the layers of implausibilities\" made the official account \"especially surprising and logic defying\". \nThe court heard a British officer provided a written statement to a commanding officer after a member of the special forces told him all fighting-age males were being killed regardless of the threat they posed. \nThe officer said: \"It was also indicated that fighting-age males were being executed on target inside compounds, using a variety of methods after they had been restrained. In one case it was mentioned a pillow was put over the head of an individual being killed with a pistol.\" \nAll the anecdotal reports of unlawful killings were locked away in a top secret \"controlled-access security compartment\", the court heard. \nThe court documents show the allegations were raised with a \"very senior officer\" at UK Special Forces headquarters. \nThe special forces leadership did not notify the RMP. Instead, the high-ranking officer ordered an internal review. \nIt examined 11 raids where the special forces unit had killed people in similar circumstances in the previous six months. \nThey had all been taken back inside buildings to help with the search after surrendering. \nThe final report was written by the commanding officer of the special forces unit accused of carrying out the executions. He accepted the version of events given in the official accounts of the raids. \nIn 2014, the RMP started investigating the alleged executions after receiving reports from Afghan families and whistleblowers from the British military. \nIts investigation, called Operation Northmoor, was closed in 2019 without resulting in any prosecutions. \nThe MoD claimed at the time the RMP had \"found no evidence of criminal behaviour by the armed forces in Afghanistan\". \nBut the documents quoted in court suggest there were serious weaknesses in the investigation. \nA summary of Operation Northmoor states it only investigated three of the original 11 incidents in detail and two senior officers identified as suspects were later dropped without being interviewed. \nThe summary also shows a decision was taken not to view video footage of special forces raids.\nThe MoD maintains the four members of Saifullah's family were killed by British troops in self-defence. \nIt has previously said: \"These documents were considered as part of the independent investigations, which concluded there was insufficient evidence to refer the case for prosecution. \n\"The Service Police and the Service Prosecuting Authority of course remain open to considering allegations should new evidence, intelligence or information come to light.\" \nMr Justice Swift ordered the defence secretary to release additional documents related to the allegations. \nThe MoD had argued the defence secretary had adopted a duty of candour and that requests for documents should be proportionate.
