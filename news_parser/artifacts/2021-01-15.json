      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Northern Ireland Assembly",
      "text": "Passengers arriving into NI from outside the UK and Republic of Ireland will soon have to produce a negative Covid-19 test before departure.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster confirmed the executive had agreed the plan on Thursday.\nPeople arriving from countries not on the government's travel corridors list will also still have to self-isolate for 10 days.\nThe move has already been agreed in the Republic of Ireland.\nPassengers arriving there will be subject to the new rules from Saturday, with the measure taking effect in England and Scotland from Monday.\nNegative tests 72 hours prior to arrival are already a requirement in the Republic of Ireland for passengers travelling from Great Britain and South Africa.\nSpeaking at Stormont's press conference on Thursday, the first minister said Northern Ireland's R-number had also fallen to between 0.7 and 0.9 for new cases of the virus.\nThe reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the drop showed the \"very real\" effect of lockdown restrictions imposed on 26 December, but she warned there was still \"no room for complacency\".\nShe said she still believed there needed to be an \"two-island approach\" to travel restrictions, including discussions with the British and Irish governments as a \"matter of urgency\".\nMrs Foster said Stormont ministers had also expressed frustration at the executive meeting over a lack of data-sharing from authorities in the Republic of Ireland, and called for it to be escalated.\nPSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said 40 penalty notices a day are being handed out to those who breach the Covid-19 regulations.\nHe told the press briefing that if people continued flouting rules, they could expect \"firm and swift enforcement\".\n\"We won't turn a blind eye when people break the rules.\"\nOn Thursday, 16 more deaths related to Covid-19 were reported by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 1,533. \nThere have been 973 new cases diagnosed in the past 24 hours, while 58 Covid-19 patients are being treated in ICUs across Northern Ireland, of which 44 are on ventilators. \nMrs Foster said she found it \"incredible and frankly unbelievable\" that some people were still holding house parties and gatherings, despite the pandemic rates and the lockdown. \nOn Wednesday, health officials warned that levels of the new, more transmissible variant of the virus are rising.\nMr Swann said that meant more \"difficult decisions\" on lockdown restrictions could be required.\nNorthern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19.\nThe executive is due to review the current restrictions on 21 January.\nThe first and deputy first ministers said they would take evidence from health officials before deciding whether an extension of the lockdown would be required.\nMinisters have also expressed concerns about some larger retailers \"gaming\" the regulations and keeping open non-essential parts of their businesses.\nA meeting between the first and deputy first ministers and representatives of the retail sector is due to happen on Friday afternoon.\nElsewhere, the Chief Medical Officer has confirmed that unpaid carers looking after Clinically Extremely Vulnerable individuals should receive the first dose of their vaccine when phase two of the vaccination programme begins next month.\nDr Michael McBride told Stormont's Health Committee they are provided for on a list of prioritisation provided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which decides the order of vaccination delivery.\nMr Swann was asked if his department was \"putting all its eggs in the vaccine basket\".\nHe said it was \"not the entirety of the answer\", adding: \"It will take time for the benefits of it to bed in.\n\"And while it is doing it, we still have to follow those restrictions that are in place.\n\"We may actually have to introduce more.\"\nOn Thursday afternoon the department tweeted that 121,711 vaccines have been administered in Northern Ireland.\nMrs Foster said that by end of this month, it is hoped all care home residents, health staff and those aged over 80 in Northern Ireland will have received their first vaccination.\nShe said that would be an \"incredible achievement\" and make Northern Ireland one of the top-performing countries in rolling out its vaccination programme. \nMeanwhile, the chairman of the Police Federation for NI (PFNI) has said officers need more powers to enforce Covid-19 regulations.\nAt present officers can only issue guidance and advice on the public health regulations.\nPFNI chairman Mark Lindsay said that puts officers in a \"difficult position\".\nThe federation represents thousands of rank and file PSNI officers.\n\"I think we are well past the stage where police officers are the people that should be giving advice around the guidance,\" Mr Lindsay told BBC Radio Foyle."

      "title": "Capitol riot: Prosecutors get first guilty plea 100 days after attack",
      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,FBI,United States",
      "text": "Exactly 100 days since the 6 January riot that saw a pro-Trump mob storm the US Capitol, prosecutors have their first guilty plea.\nJon Schaffer, 53, a member of the Oath Keepers militia group, pleaded guilty to two charges - obstruction of an official proceeding and entering a restricted building with a dangerous weapon.\nSchaffer, who is also a heavy metal guitarist in the band Iced Earth, had originally faced six charges including using a chemical irritant designed for grizzly bears on police officers during clashes.\nHe turned himself to FBI agents in Indiana two weeks after his arrest, and after a photo of him inside the Capitol wearing a hat reading \"Oath Keepers Lifetime Member\" appeared on the front pages of US newspapers.\nHe is facing 30 years in prison and is expected to co-operate with investigators. \nThe suspects in the Capitol riot are a varied group: they include an ousted West Virginia lawmaker, several police officers and a left-wing activist from Utah.\nMost of the rioters were allowed to leave the crime scene, forcing investigators to conduct a national manhunt for the pro-Trump crowd that stormed the halls of Congress.\nInvestigators for the District of Columbia says they have identified over 540 suspects and charged some 400 people in connection with the Capitol siege. \nJust weeks after the rampage in January, FBI officials said they had already been inundated with 140,000 videos and photos from members of the public.\nOfficials say they are considering filing serious charges of seditious activity against some individuals who were involved in the siege on the Capitol.\nAccording to federal criminal code, seditious conspiracy means an effort to conspire to overthrow the US government. The punishment is severe: up to 20 years in prison.\nThe rioters facing federal charges hail from 42 out of the 50 US states and the District of Columbia, according to the George Washington University extremism tracker.\nOnly a few came from pro-Trump strongholds. Most came from districts that voted for Joe Biden in the November election.\nIn March, the FBI made its first arrest of a Trump appointee, former State Department aide Federico Guillermo Klein. Mr Klein, 42, is accused of multiple felonies related to the riot, including beating police with a stolen riot shield. He was still employed by the State Department as a staff assistant when he joined the mob on 6 January. He is also a former Trump campaign employee, US media report. \nFive of those arrested were police officers. Nearly 30 were active-duty or retired members of the military.\nAbout 90% of those arrested have been white, according to an analysis by the Chicago Project on Security and Threats.  \nMost have been over the age of 40, surprising given that the average age for those involved in political violence around the world is late 20s to early 30s.\nMany of those arrested were employed, or even wealthy, including Dr Simone Gold, 55, from Beverly Hills, California. \nShe was among a group of doctors that last year spread misleading claims about the coronavirus, including that hydroxychloroquine - a drug touted relentlessly by Mr Trump - was an effective treatment.\nJenna Ryan - a real estate broker from Dallas, Texas - garnered attention on social media after she flew to DC by private jet to join the march to the Capitol.\nAnalysis by BBC Monitoring and BBC Reality Check\nRobert Keith Packer\nOne of the most striking images from that day showed a man wearing a hoodie with the words: \"Camp Auschwitz\". Auschwitz was a Nazi extermination camp where more than a million people, mostly Jews, were murdered during World War Two by Germany.\nMr Packer was arrested in Virginia and has been charged with trespassing in a federal building and \"violent entry and disorderly conduct\" on Capitol grounds.\nJake Angeli - 'Q Shaman'\nJacob Anthony Chansley, known as Jake Angeli or as he describes himself the \"Q Shaman\", is a well-known follower of the unfounded QAnon conspiracy theory who lives in Glendale, Arizona.\nQAnon supporters believe Mr Trump and a secret military intelligence team are battling a deep state cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles in the Democratic Party, media, business and Hollywood.\nKnown for appearing with a painted face, fur hat and horns while carrying a \"Q sent me\" banner in public, Mr Chansley, 33, has been charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct after appearing in multiple images inside the halls of Congress and the Senate chamber.\nIn videos posted to his social media accounts, he shouts about child-trafficking in front of government buildings or inside shopping malls, and attends pro-Trump or QAnon-linked \"save our children\" rallies.\nLike many of his fellow QAnon followers, Mr Chansley says he believes Covid-19 is a hoax.\nMr Trump - viewed as a hero by the movement - has stopped short of endorsing the conspiracy theory but has described QAnon activists as \"people who love our country.\"\nDoug Jensen - QAnon \nDoug Jensen, 41, from Des Moines, Iowa, appeared in one video showing a lone African American officer holding back the mob.\nMr Jensen has been arrested and faces five federal charges, including violent entry and disorderly conduct and obstructing a law enforcement officer during a civil disorder.\nIn it, he can be seen chasing a police officer up a flight of stairs inside the Capitol wearing a shirt with the QAnon slogan \"trust the plan\".\nMr Jensen later identified himself on his Twitter account, tweeting: \"You like my shirt?\" and \"Me\u2026\" under images of him inside the Capitol shared by fellow QAnon supporters.\nOn his Twitter, Mr Jensen regularly expresses support for President Trump, engages with well-known QAnon accounts, and tweets QAnon phrases such as WWG1WGA - short for \"where we go one we go all\" - a rallying cry for the conspiracy's adherents.\nNick Ochs - Proud Boys\nNick Ochs was arrested at an airport in Honolulu, Hawaii, by the FBI, as he returned home from Washington DC.\nHe's accused of unlawful entry of restricted buildings or grounds, after he posted a picture smoking a cigarette inside the Capitol building, tweeting: \"Hello from the Capital lol\".\nMr Ochs describes himself as a \"Proud Boy Elder from Hawaii\". The Proud Boys is an anti-immigrant and all male far-right group founded in 2016.\nPresident Trump addressed this group specifically in the first presidential debate. In response to a question about white supremacists and militias he said: \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.\"\nRichard Barnett\nRichard Barnett is the man pictured with his feet on a desk in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office. He was also pictured outside the Capitol with a personalised envelope he took from her office.\nHe's been arrested for unlawful entry, disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and theft of public money, property, or records.\nMr Barnett is 60 years old and from Arkansas.\nLocal media reports say Mr Barnett is involved in a group that supports gun rights, and that he was interviewed at a \"Stop the Steal\" rally following the presidential election - the movement that supports Mr Trump's unsubstantiated claims of election fraud.\nDerrick Evans\nLess than a month after he was sworn in as a Republican delegate in the West Virginia state legislature, Mr Evans filmed himself pushing through the crowd as he stormed the Capitol wearing what appears to be a motorcycle helmet.\n\"We're going in,\" he said in the now-deleted Facebook live stream. \"We did it! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!\" he yelled, adding, \"patriots inside, baby!\"\nHis participation in the riot led lawmakers in his home state to consider cutting off his access to the West Virginia statehouse. \nBut within a week of the riot, he had resigned. He is facing federal charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct.\nRiley June Williams\nThe 22-year-old Pennsylvania woman, is accused of stealing a laptop from the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\nThe FBI has said that Ms Williams' former romantic partner told them that she had appeared in pictures of the Capitol riot. \nShe allegedly had said that she hoped to sell the laptop to Russian intelligence agents.\nAn aide to Mrs Pelosi said the computer was only used for presentations. It has yet to be recovered by investigators.\nFederal cases are ongoing across the country and could lead to some significant prison sentences for those involved.\nActing US Attorney Michael Sherwin said in February: \"The scope and scale of this investigation in these cases are really unprecedented, not only in FBI history but probably [Department of Justice] history.\"  \nDozens of suspects have requested public defenders - lawyers provided by the government - leaving taxpayers to pay millions of dollars in defendants' legal bills. \nThe cases have also flooded the Washington DC legal system, where semi-returned judges have been called upon to hear the influx of cases. At least one defendant has argued that their case should be heard out of Washington because they would be unable to get a fair trial there.\nAt least seven of the key suspects have told investigators that they travelled to the Capitol after President Trump told them to go in a speech that preceded the riot.\nThe so-called Q Shaman requested a pardon from Mr Trump before he left office, citing \"the peaceful and compliant fashion in which Mr Chansley comported himself\" during the riot.\nAccording to a local ABC news station, a judge has agreed that Mr Chansley should be \"provided food in line with a shaman's strict organic diet\" after he refused to eat the meals provided at the jailhouse.\nRiley June Williams, the woman accused of stealing a congressional laptop, was ordered to stay off the internet after she allegedly attempted to delete her information and encouraged others to do the same.\nA man allegedly seen in viral photos carrying a Confederate flag in the Capitol during the riots was charged on 14 January.\nAuthorities in Delaware charged Kevin Seefried and his son Hunter with entering a restricted building, violent entry and disorderly conduct.\nAccording to court documents cited by the Delaware News Journal, the duo got into the Capitol building through a window that Hunter helped break, before they \"verbally confronted\" US Capitol Police officers and the son took a selfie.\nThe Confederate flag is widely seen as a racist symbol as it was the banner of the slaveholding southern states that lost the US Civil War (1861-65).\nA left-wing activist was also arrested after tweeting video of himself inside the US Capitol as protesters breached security.\nJohn Sullivan, 26, was charged with entering a restricted building and violent entry or disorderly conduct. He claimed in media interviews that he was just \"documenting\" the rampage, though the affidavit notes he has no press credentials.\nThe court document says Mr Sullivan can be heard saying in a video he filmed of the Capitol riot: \"Let's burn this shit down.\" He has identified himself in media interviews as a Black Lives Matter supporter, but rejects any association with antifa, a loosely affiliated group of far-left protesters.\nFollowing the death of George Floyd last year, Mr Sullivan founded an activist group in Utah that advocates for racial justice. He was charged in July 2020 with felony riot and criminal mischief over civil unrest in Provo, Utah.\nTwo men who were allegedly pictured bringing plastic restraints into the Capitol were also arrested this month.\nAuthorities say Eric Gavelek Munchel is the individual seen carrying a number of plastic zip ties inside the Senate chamber. He was detained in Tennessee. Larry Rendell Brock, who is accused of entering the Capitol with a white flex cuff - a restraining device used by law enforcement - was arrested in Texas.\nSo far, neither has been accused of plotting to use the restraints, but face disorderly conduct and violent entry charges."

      "tags": "Portugal,Coronavirus testing,Brazil,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A ban on travellers to the UK from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde will begin on Friday due to a new Covid variant identified in Brazil.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the rules would come in from 04:00 GMT.\nBritish and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights will still be able to travel but must isolate for 10 days.\nOn Thursday the UK reported a further 1,248 coronavirus deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nThe previous day had seen a record figure of 1,564. There were also another 48,682 daily Covid cases.\nThe number of people in the UK to have received the first dose of a vaccine has risen to 2,918,252 - up by 278,943 from Wednesday.\nThe new travel ban applies to people who have travelled from, or through, the South American countries of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela in the last 10 days.\nPortugal, including the islands of Madeira and the Azores, is also banned, along with the central American nation of Panama and the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde, off the West African coast. \nMr Shapps said he \"can't provide an end date\" to the new rules.\nHe said the current restrictions on global travel meant he didn't \"expect a large number of Brits to have jaunted off to South America and we're not expecting to see a big repatriation issue as a result\".\nPortugal had been included \"given its strong travel links with Brazil\", he said, but added that there would be an exemption for hauliers travelling from the country to allow the transportation of essential goods.\nHe said suspending travel from that European country would act \"as another way to reduce the risk of importing infections\".\nQatar and the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba have also been removed from the UK's travel corridor lists, meaning anyone arriving from these countries after 04:00 GMT on Saturday will have to quarantine for 10 days.\nJon Dent, 31, from Wolverhampton, travelled to Brazil with his wife Carla, 32, in October so that her family - who live in Goiania - could see their daughter Luiza, one, for the first time. \nThey are due to fly back to the UK on 6 February but Jon now fears they may be stuck out there for months due to the travel ban. \n\"We had planned to visit in February 2020 but we had to postpone because of the lockdown and that was rough on my wife, she suffered a lot.  \n\"Now I think my mum is suffering as she's expecting Luiza to be back, but who knows now? \n\"My initial reaction was worry because it's so unknown. The thought of not being able to return home and being stranded is not a nice feeling. \n\"I'm hoping British residents will be able to get home but I don't know if the government will organise flights. I think it's a long shot. I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months.\n\"We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible.\" \nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"very concerned\" about the Brazilian variant of the virus.\nNew variants of Covid-19 have previously been identified in the UK and South Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations.\nSeveral Central and South American nations had already restricted travel from the UK, including Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama, while others such as Argentina and Uruguay have closed their borders to non-resident foreign nationals. \nThe Department for Transport said under the ban no exemptions would apply, including those for employment, and people who live with someone who has travelled from one of the banned countries will have to self-isolate for 10 days.\nBBC News online health editor Michelle Roberts said there was no sign that any of the new variants were more dangerous, with scientists confident that vaccines would work against them.\nFelipe Naveca, deputy director of research at the Brazilian state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said the new variant was \"of concern\" and its origin was \"undoubtedly\" from the Amazon region.\nHe told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson the new variant had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same mutations.\n\"Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern,\" he said, adding: \"We have to stop the virus from circulating, because we're giving it the opportunity to evolve.\"\nBy Vanessa Buschschl\u00fcter, News Online Latin America editor\nThe Covid pandemic may have arrived in South America later than in Europe but it did so with a vengeance. In May, the World Health Organization warned that it had become the new epicentre of the pandemic with Brazil soon joining the top three countries with the most confirmed cases.\nBut the travel ban is not about numbers; some of the countries on the list have had relatively few Covid cases, like Guyana with fewer than 7,000.\nThis is about the new strain and how it could spread quickly through travel in the region. Brazil borders 10 countries and cross-border business is brisk.\nPanama, also on the list even though it is further to the north, is a major travel hub for flights from South America to Europe and the US.\nAnd tourism has not stopped either. On 25 December, Brazil suspended all flights from the UK over the new UK strain, but air travel from other countries continued, especially over Christmas - the main holiday season in the southern hemisphere. \nThe travel ban comes after it was announced a requirement for arrivals into England to test negative for coronavirus 72 hours before their journey will now come into force at 04:00 GMT on Monday. The Scottish government said the delay meant it would also wait until Monday.\nWales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce their own plans in the coming days.\nMr Shapps said the new rules had been delayed from Friday to allow British nationals to be able to get home, but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said people would be \"bewildered\" by the delay and would \"feel that we're exposed\".\nMeanwhile, Covid-19 case rates have fallen in most regions of England, according to the latest data from Public Health England's weekly surveillance report. \nLondon continues to have the highest rate of any region but its rate of new cases stood at 864.9 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 10 January, down from 1,043.9 in the previous week. \nThe North East, East Midlands, East, South East and Yorkshire & the Humber also recorded a week-on-week fall. \nHowever, the rate increased in the North West, South West and the West Midlands. \nIn other developments:\nAre you due to travel back to the UK from any of the affected countries?

      "tags": "Travel,Boris Johnson,Air travel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK is to close all travel corridors from Monday morning to \"protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains\" of Covid, the PM has said.\nAnyone flying into the country from overseas will have to show proof of a negative Covid test before setting off.\nIt comes as a ban on travellers from South America and Portugal came into force on Friday over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil.\nBoris Johnson said the new rules would be in place until at least 15 February.\nA further 1,280 people with coronavirus have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total to 87,291.\nThe latest government figures on Friday also showed another 55,761 new cases had been reported - up from 48,682 the previous day.\nMeanwhile, more than two million people around the world have now died with the virus since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.\nSpeaking at a Downing Street press conference, the prime minister said it was \"vital\" to take extra measures now \"when day by day we are making such strides in protecting the population\".\n\"It's precisely because we have the hope of that vaccine and the risk of new strains coming from overseas that we must take additional steps now to stop those strains from entering the country.\"\nAll travel corridors will close from 04:00 GMT on Monday. After that, arrivals to the UK will need to quarantine for up to 10 days, unless they test negative after five days.\nMr Johnson, who said the rules would apply across the UK after talks with the devolved administrations, added that the government would be stepping up enforcement at the border and in the country.\nTravel corridors were introduced in the summer to allow people travelling from some countries with low numbers of Covid cases to come to the UK without having to quarantine on arrival.\nTrade body Airlines UK said it supported the latest restrictions \"on the assumption\" that the government would remove them \"when it is safe to do so\".\nChief executive Tim Alderslade said travel corridors were \"a lifeline for the industry\" last summer but \"things change and there's no doubting this is a serious health emergency\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was the \"right step\" but called the timing of the decision \"slow again\", adding that the public would be thinking \"why on earth didn't this happen before\".\nThe prime minister warned that the NHS was facing \"extraordinary pressures\", having had the highest number of hospital admissions on a single day of the pandemic earlier this week.\nHe said that came on Tuesday when there were 4,134 new admissions, while the UK currently has more than 37,000 Covid patients in hospitals.\nMr Johnson said that once the most vulnerable have been vaccinated by mid-February \"we will think about what steps we could take to lift the restrictions\".\nEngland is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. \nSimilar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAlso speaking at the No 10 briefing, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said the restrictions would need to be lifted gradually by \"testing what works, and then if that works going the next step\".\nHe said the peak of people entering hospital would be in the next week to 10 days for most places, but \"we hope\" the peak of infections \"already has happened\" in the south-east, east and London.\n\"The peak of deaths I fear is in the future, the peak of hospitalisations in some parts of the country may be around about now and beginning to come off the very, very top,\" he said.\nA ban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde entering the UK came into force on Friday morning as a result of a new, potentially more infectious variant of coronavirus linked to Brazil. \nThe government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the press briefing that some of the new variants may be able to \"get round\" the Covid vaccines but it was \"really quite easy\" to adjust the vaccines to deal with mutations in the virus.\nNew variants causing concern have previously been identified in the UK and South Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations.\nPublic Health England said a total of 35 genomically confirmed and 12 genomically probable cases of the Covid-19 variant which originated in South Africa have been identified in the UK as of 14 January.\nEarlier, a leading scientist said one of the two variants first detected in Brazil had been found in the UK - but not the variant that was causing concern.\n\"I think it is likely that the vaccine we have now is going to protect against the UK variant and is going to provide protection I suspect against the other variants as well,\" said Sir Patrick. \"The question is to what degree.\" \nLatest figures show that more than three million people in the UK have now received the first dose of a vaccine - 3,234,946 - an increase of 316,694 from the previous day.\nSir Patrick said he expected the vaccines would reduce transmission of the virus but that \"we shouldn't go mad\" as jabs are rolled out because a risk would remain.\n\"Just because you've been vaccinated doesn't mean you can't catch this and pass it on, it means you're protected against severe disease,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, the latest estimate of the UK's R number - which is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to on average - is 1.2 to 1.3, compared with 1-1.4 last week.\nBut in London, where tight restrictions came in earlier, the R number is lower - between 0.9 and 1.2.\nIn Wales, new laws for shoppers and staff are to be introduced after \"significant evidence\" coronavirus is being spread in supermarkets.\nAre you due to travel back to the UK from overseas?

      "tags": "Jamie Oliver,Boris Johnson,Marcus Rashford,Tom Kerridge,Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall,Free school meals,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Marcus Rashford and a group of celebrity chefs and campaigners have called on Boris Johnson to review the government's free school meals policy.\nThe group, including Jamie Oliver, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Tom Kerridge, have written to the PM asking him to \"fix\" the system long-term.\nThey called for a strategy to help \"end child food poverty\" before the summer holidays.\nNo 10 said \"no child will ever go hungry\" because of the Covid pandemic. \nThe call for a wide review comes after another row over free school meals during February half-term.\nThe government has said food will be provided to children by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme while schools are closed for the holiday.\nCouncils and unions say the government should provide food vouchers instead, with the Local Government Association's Councillor Richard Watts telling BBC Radio 4's PM programme the grant had already been allocated for other support. \nBut Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are down to semantics whether it is the school delivering the meal or whether it is the local authority - fortunately there is quite a lot of different support available.\"\nAs well as getting the backing of Rashford - who has led campaigns around child poverty over the course of the pandemic - the letter has been signed by chefs Oliver, Kerridge and Fearnley-Whittingstall, along with actor Dame Emma Thompson and over 40 charities and education leaders.\nOrganised by the Food Foundation charity, the letter said it was time to \"step back and review the policy in more depth\".\nThey called for an \"urgent comprehensive review into free school meal policy across the UK\" to feed into the government's next Spending Review, saying it should look at:\nThe signatories praised the Department for Education's \"swift response\" to reports earlier this week of inadequate food parcels sent to families, saying the \"robustness of the message from you and the secretary of state on this issue was very welcome\".\nBut, they added that \"following the series of problems which have arisen over school food vouchers, holiday provision and food parcels since the start of the pandemic\", now was the time for a review. \nAnna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation charity, said the last few months had seen \"crisis after crisis with the provision of free school meals\". \n\"The result of that is disadvantaged children have often paid the price,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \n\"Our view is that really unless we do a root and branch review these problems are going to still keep appearing.\"\nChef Fearnley-Whittingstall also called for a more consistent, long-term response to the issue of food poverty. \n\"We need to get out of this fire-fighting, highly reactive series of actions by the government,\" he told the same programme. \nThe signatories want a review to be published and debated in Parliament before the 2021 summer holidays. \n\"We are ready and willing to support your government in whatever way we can to make this review a reality and to help develop a set of recommendations that everyone can support,\" the letter said.\n\"School food is essential in supporting the health and learning of our most disadvantaged children. \n\"Now, at a time when children have missed months of in-school learning and the pandemic has reminded us of the importance of our health, this is a vital next step.\"\nAnti-poverty campaigner and food writer Jack Monroe welcomed the letter to the PM, but told the BBC: \"We need to be feeding children right now.\"\nShe added: \"While it is great to be looking longer term... having an underpinning strategy that means that children aren't put into poverty in the first place, we need to also immediately be putting resources in to ensure people aren't going hungry, today, tonight, next week and in the February half-term. \n\"This isn't a rhetorical thing. It isn't a dinner party discussion. We need to be doing this now.\"\nA Downing Street spokesperson said: \"It is great that celebrities and groups across society see the importance of school food. The PM thanks Marcus Rashford for his letter and will reply soon. \n\"School food is essential in supporting the health and learning of the most disadvantaged pupils. The prime minister has been clear that no child will ever go hungry as a result of the pandemic\"."

      "text": "Police investigations have been compromised by an error that led to hundreds of thousands of records being deleted from UK-wide databases, according to a letter seen by the BBC.\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council said 213,000 records were deleted - more than the 150,000 first reported.\nThis resulted in a couple of \"near misses\" for serious crimes when trying to identify an offender, it said.\nThe Home Office has said it is assessing the impact of the mistake. \nData including fingerprint, DNA, and arrest histories was wiped from the Police National Computer (PNC) - which stores and shares criminal records information across the UK - after being inadvertently flagged for deletion.\nThe PNC is used in police investigations and provides real-time checks on people, vehicles and crimes, as well as whether suspects are wanted for any unsolved offences.\nThe Home Office said the lost entries related to people who were arrested and then released without further action.\nBut the letter from the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) says officers are aware of at least one instance where the DNA profile from a suspect in custody did not generate a match to a crime scene as expected, potentially impeding the investigation.\nIt says that some of the records had been marked for indefinite retention following earlier convictions for serious offences.\nAnd it reveals that a \"weeding system\", developed and deployed by a Home Office PNC team, started to delete records wrongly last November. \nThe process was only brought to a halt at the start of this week.\nThe letter was sent on Friday afternoon by Deputy Chief Constable Naveed Malik of the NPCC to chief constables and police and crime commissioners.\nThe deletion of the records has been blamed on a coding error.\nThis resulted in records that had been flagged for deletion being lost from the database before checks had been carried out to determine whether they could be lawfully held or not.\nPolicing minister Kit Malthouse said the problem had been identified and the process corrected so \"it cannot happen again\".\nHe said the Home Office, National Police Chiefs' Council and other law enforcement partners were working \"at pace\" to recover the data.\nThe Home Office said no records of criminal or dangerous persons had been deleted.\nBut Labour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called on Home Secretary Priti Patel to take responsibility for the error and be clear about the impact it had had.\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, he described the situation as \"extraordinarily serious\", adding: \"Priti Patel will be responsible for criminals walking free. We're not going to be able to link suspects to crime scenes without the DNA and fingerprint evidence.\"\nA home office source said the accusation was \"scaremongering and irresponsible\".\nFormer Cumbria Police Chief Constable Stuart Hyde told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday the \"very large\" loss of arrest records presented a \"risk to public safety\".\nThe records are linked to police investigations that were terminated before charge (No Further Action or NFA cases) or to those where an individual had been acquitted at court.\nIt is not yet known how many records of each type were lost and full extent of deletions is still being investigated. A minister is expected to update the House of Commons on Monday.\nIt comes after about 40,000 alerts relating to European criminals were removed from the PNC following the UK's post-Brexit security deal with the EU.

      "text": "A respiratory doctor at Belfast's Mater Hospital has warned that hospital oxygen supplies are under \"extreme pressure\".\nDr Nick Magee also said more younger patients were now being treated in hospital than during the first and second waves of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nHe said in the past they did not have to consult other NI hospitals about how much oxygen they had.\n\"That was never a thing in previous January flu problems,\" he told the BBC. \n\"But that is something we are now having to think of,\" he added.\nEarlier this week Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said there is enough oxygen to cope with the current demand.\nBut according to Dr Magee the current level of oxygen being used in \"bays\" at the Mater means patients cannot charge their mobile phones by their bedside because of the \"fire risk\".\n\"It is all well controlled and we are making sure that we can share out that oxygen burden. That is something we are having to think about,\" he said.\n\"I can't say specifically about other regional hospitals but I know that they are under extreme pressure and it's just something we have to think of as a region.\n\"Can we supply oxygen adequately for the amounts of oxygen we are using in hospitals?\"\nThe number of Covid positive hospital in-patients has increased significantly since last week - up from 599 a week ago to 850 on Thursday.\nThe number of people in ICU has also risen from 44 to 58 in the past week.\nDr Magee said staff were concerned about having to cope with \"large volumes\" of patients requiring respiratory support.\nHe said the number of younger patients becoming increasingly sick with the virus was growing.\nOn Wednesday, the Mater Hospital moved six patients who had been on wards into ICU and also took patients from the Southern Health Trust.\n\"Recently I saw a 29-year-old patient, also three who were in their mid 30s that all required respiratory support on a ward,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\"They are frightened they are wearing specialist masks CPAP masks that help them breathe. They are scared.\" \nThe relentless pressure of the past 10 months and the prospect of a further surge in admissions over the next fortnight is weighing heavily on the minds of medics.\n\"We are really worried about next week,\" said Dr Magee. \n\"It's very busy this week, we are coping well but we are particularly concerned about next week.\n\"Normally, if we had somebody who needed a lot of respiratory support we would involve a high dependency unit but all the respiratory wards are becoming like high dependency units. \n\"Volume of sicker, younger patients is much greater and it's not something that I would [have] ever seen before,\" he added.\nThe Southern Health and Social Care Trust said its hospitals had limited infrastructure to manage high numbers of patients requiring oxygen so a regional agreement was in place to share resources across Trusts to support Covid-positive patients. \n\"As a result some patients have been diverted to Belfast or SE Trust to help reduce pressure on the Southern Trust hospital system,\" a statement said. \n\"Craigavon and Daisy Hill hospitals remain very busy with high numbers of Covid-19 positive patients who are dependent on oxygen therapy. \n\"These protocols are in place as part of regional surge planning to ensure that we can safely manage the current high volume of Covid-19 patients needing hospital care. \n\"Patients who are currently being treated in Craigavon and Daisy Hill have secure supplies of oxygen.\""

      "text": "Richard Leonard has resigned as Scottish Labour leader, saying it is in the best interests of the party for him to stand down.\nMr Leonard said he believed speculation about his leadership had become a \"distraction\".\nAnd he said he would be stepping down with immediate effect.\nHis resignation comes just months ahead of the Scottish Parliament election, which is scheduled to be held  in May. \nMr Leonard had been leader of the party for three years after succeeding Kezia Dugdale.\nThe former union official had faced open calls to quit from some of his own MSPs last year amid concerns that his leadership style could damage the party in the forthcoming Scottish Parliament election. \nPolls have suggested that many Scottish Labour supporters struggle to recognise him, and he is closely associated with former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. \nScottish Labour had dominated politics in Scotland for decades, but is currently the third largest party at Holyrood behind the SNP and Conservatives.\nAnd Mr Leonard's critics had questioned whether he was capable of turning the party's fortunes around. \nIn a statement, Mr Leonard said the decision to resign had not been easy - but he felt it was the right one for him and his party. \nHe said: \"I have thought long and hard over the Christmas period about what this crisis means, and the approach Scottish Labour takes to help tackle it. \n\"I have also considered what the speculation about my leadership does to our ability to get Labour's message across. This has become a distraction.  \n\"I have come to the conclusion it is in the best interests of the party that I step aside as leader of Scottish Labour with immediate effect.\"\nHe also insisted that Scotland now needs a Labour government more than ever, and accused both the Scottish and UK governments of mishandling the coronavirus pandemic.\nMr Leonard added: \"While I step down from the leadership today, the work goes on - and I will play my constructive part as an MSP in winning support for Labour's vision of a better future in a democratic economy and a socialist society.\"\nHis decision leaves Scottish Labour looking for its fifth leader since the independence referendum in 2014 - with Johann Lamont, Jim Murphy and Kezia Dugdale all having held the job since then.\nA Procedures Committee, to oversee the election of Mr Leonard's successor, has been formed and will have its first meeting on Friday.\nMeanwhile, Labour's Scottish Executive Committee will also meet in the coming days to agree a timetable for the process.\nMSP Jackie Baillie, who was Scottish Labour's deputy leader, has taken charge of the party on an interim basis.\nThis sudden resignation four months from the Holyrood elections seems to have taken Scottish Labour by surprise.\nMSPs I've spoken to said they did not see it coming. \nThere have been times when Richard Leonard has been under severe pressure from some in his party to stand down.\nWhen several MSPs publicly called for him to quit because the party had gone backwards at successive elections on his watch, he stood firm.\nHis critics seemed to have accepted that he would lead them and a divided party into the Holyrood election.\nThat has now changed and interim leader Jackie Baillie has to quickly organise a contest to replace him.\nIt's a contest in which Anas Sarwar, if he stands, would be an obvious frontrunner - even although he lost last time to Mr Leonard, who was seen as much closer to the then UK party leader, Jeremy Corbyn.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Leonard should be \"very proud\" of his achievements as leader of the party in Scotland.\nSir Keir added: \"I would like to thank Richard for his service to our party and his unwavering commitment to the values he believes in.\n\"Richard has led Scottish Labour through one of the most challenging and difficult periods in our country's history, including a general election and the pandemic.\"\nMr Leonard had been due to face a confidence vote at the party's ruling Executive Committee last September - but the motion was withdrawn at the last minute.\nIt came after four Scottish Labour MSPs called for him to go, warning that the party faced \"catastrophe\" at the ballot box under his leadership.\nThey pointed to the party's dismal performance in previous elections under Mr Leonard.\nScottish Labour finished fifth in the European election in May 2019, and then lost all but one of its MPs in the general election in December of the same year. \nMr Leonard insisted at the time that he intended to lead the party into this year's Holyrood election, and accused his opponents of waging \"internal war\" against him.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who faced Mr Leonard in her weekly question session in the Scottish Parliament, tweeted that she had \"always liked Richard Leonard\" despite their political difference. \nShe added: \"He is a decent guy and I wish him well for the future.\"\nRuth Davidson, who quit as leader of the Scottish Tories in 2019 before returning to lead the party at Holyrood, said she had always found Mr Leonard to be a \"thoroughly decent man and a committed campaigner.\"\nAnas Sarwar, who was defeated by Mr Leonard in the leadership contest in 2017 and is seen as one of the favourites to replace him, said he was sure Mr Leonard would \"continue to fight for a fairer, more just and more equal society today, tomorrow and long into the future.\"\nBut Labour MSP Neil Findlay, an outspoken supporter of Mr Leonard, took aim at those who had sought to oust him last year - describing them as \"flinching cowards\" and \"sneering traitors\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,GDP,Economic growth,UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK economy shrank by 2.6% in November as England was placed in lockdown for a second time, official figures show. \nThe Office for National Statistics said it meant gross domestic product was 8.5% below its pre-pandemic peak.\nNovember's decline came after six consecutive months of growth.\nPubs and hairdressers were badly hit as the service sector suffered, the ONS said, but some manufacturing and construction activity improved.\nThe hit to the service sector - which accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy - meant it contracted by 3.4% in November, and is now 9.9% below the level of February 2020.\nSome economists said the November figure was better than expected, and it appeared many companies were better prepared for the second lockdown, with some sectors staying open for business and many firms having already put in place plans to expand online operations.\n\"Steps taken by businesses earlier in the year to Covid-proof their operations - combined with the time-limited nature of the restrictions, and schools remaining open - meant more companies were able to continue trading safely,\" said Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI employers' group.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures showed \"it's clear things will get harder before they get better and today's figures highlight the scale of the challenge we face\". \nBut he said the vaccine roll-out and economic support measures meant there were reasons to be hopeful. \"With this support, and the resilience and enterprise of the British people, we will get through this,\" he said.\nShadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the figures showed the UK has an economic \"mountain to climb\". \nSpeaking to the BBC, she said it would be a \"serious mistake\" if Mr Sunak waited until the Budget in March before providing more support and confidence for business.\nONS director for economic statistics Darren Morgan said: \"The economy took a hit from restrictions put in place to contain the pandemic during November, with pubs and hairdressers seeing the biggest impact.\"\nHowever, he said many firms adjusted to the new pandemic working conditions, such as by expanding click and collect and other online operations.\nHe added: \"Manufacturing and construction generally continued to operate, while schools also stayed open, meaning the impact on the economy was significantly smaller in November than during the first lockdown.\n\"Car manufacturing, bolstered by demand from abroad, housebuilding and infrastructure grew and are now all above their pre-pandemic levels.\" Construction activity grew by 1.9% during the month.\nGross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy.\nBut the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year.\nIf the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. That generally means more wealth and more new jobs.\nIf it is negative, the economy is shrinking.\nDespite the GDP figure being better than some analysts had forecast, there are still concerns that the UK could be heading back into recession. \nEconomists have warned the UK could see a double-dip recession if restrictions remain in place in the first three months of 2021.\nRory Macqueen, from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the November figures confirm a significant slowdown in the last quarter of 2020, \"despite November's lockdown in England clearly having a far smaller effect than the first\". \nJames Smith, research director of the Resolution Foundation, said there would be a lot of comment about whether these figures point to the UK heading for only its second-ever double-dip recession on record. \nBut, he said, the real \"story of the year will be a vaccine-driven bounce back in economic activity for sectors like hospitality and leisure\".\n\"The chancellor must do everything he can to support that recovery once public health restrictions ease,\" he added.\nAnalysts at Capital Economics also said there was cause for optimism, saying that the current third lockdown could have less impact than feared.\n\"The economy has built up a fair bit of immunity to lockdowns, as November's lockdown was much less painful for the economy than the first lockdown.\n\"As a result, the Covid-19 economic hole is smaller than we thought, the economy may get back to its pre-crisis crisis level a bit sooner and it makes us more confident that the Bank of England probably won't resort to negative interest rates.\"\nThe fall in the economy in November was still considerable, but the figures show businesses adapting to difficult conditions. The hit was a fraction of what occurred in the first lockdown last April, and was mainly confined to the service sector, with pubs and hairdressing for example in sharp decline.\nManufacturing and construction largely remained open, as did previously shut public services such as schools. By November car manufacturing and house building were back above the level of output before the pandemic.\nThe trade figures also showed a \u00a37bn increase in EU imports in the three months to November as traders stockpiled car parts, medicines and other goods ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period.\nThe renewed regional tiered restrictions in December, and more severe national lockdowns this month, still indicate a possible return to overall recession in this tough winter.\nBusiness groups continue to argue that extra support is required to support jobs and cash flow well before the Budget in March. But a more sustained lifting of restrictions as vaccines are rolled out should see growth return after the spring."

But tours in Germany and Spain, for instance, will now require extra visas for paid work, while those in France and The Netherlands will not.\nPopular European touring routes could now see them take on extra costs and paperwork.

There is a mutual benefit,\" he said.\nAn EU spokesperson told the BBC: \"The UK has chosen to no longer allow the free movement of EU citizens to the UK. It also refused to include a chapter on mobility in the agreement.\n\"These choices inevitably mean that travel between the EU and the UK - including for business purposes - will no longer be as easy as it was while the UK was a member state.\"\nHe added that the UK \"refused to include a commitment on visa-free short stays\", which could have meant people like musicians, sportspeople and journalists would not have needed individual visas.\n\"As a result, it is now up to each member state to determine if a visa is required for short-stay visits for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. This is fully in line with EU law.\"\nThe EU would not be drawn on whether it would re-open talks around music touring visas.\nThe government has previously said it \"pushed for a more ambitious agreement with the EU on the temporary movement of business travellers, which would have covered musicians and others, but our proposals were rejected by the EU\".\nOn Tuesday, it added that \"the door remains open should the EU change its mind\".\nThen on Wednesday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden blamed the EU for \"letting down music on both sides of the Channel - not us\".\nProf Catherine Barnard, deputy director of research organisation UK In A Changing Europe, told BBC News: \"The bottom line is that the EU did offer up to 90 days, and with the possibility of being paid.\n\"I suspect the UK probably said no because they have a very hard line on anything that may even look like free movement of persons, which of course the UK had committed itself to stopping.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK's epidemic is still officially estimated to be growing, according to the latest R number, but data suggests new cases are beginning to fall.\nThe R number - which takes into account cases, hospitalisations and deaths - is estimated to be between 1.2 and 1.3, compared with 1 and 1.4 last week.\nThis suggests the total number of people with the virus is still rising across the UK.\nBut in London, where tight restrictions came in earlier, the R number is lower.\nIn the capital, the estimate - based on data up until 11 January - is between 0.9 and 1.2, compared with 1.1 and 1.4 the previous week.\nIt comes as a further 1,280 people with coronavirus have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total to 87,291.\nThe latest government figures on Friday also showed another 55,761 new cases had been reported.\nMeanwhile, more than three million people in the UK have now received the first dose of a vaccine - latest figures show the number at 3,234,946.\nAlthough the number of people sick with coronavirus is growing in the UK, data from various sources suggests new infections are declining. \nThis provides early signs that lockdown restrictions may be taking effect.\nThe government's scientific advisory group Sage, which calculates the R number, said areas that have been under tougher restrictions for a longer period of time - including east of England, London, and the south east - are showing \"a slight decline in the number of people infected\".\nHowever, they warned that regions such as north-west and south-west England continue to see infections rise, where the spread of the new UK variant may be playing a role.\nThe R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. In theory, it describes the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus onto, on average.\nIn reality, though, the government's estimate of R gives a wider view of the epidemic's general trend since it also looks at what is happening in hospitals.\nCases, hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 have been alarmingly high since the beginning of the year and the latest estimate of the R number indicates that the pandemic is continuing to grow.\nBut because of the way the data to estimate R is collected - it reflects the situation a week ago. More up to date indicators suggest that there's a slight decline in infections in the east of England, London, and the South East.\nThese areas have had the highest prevalence and therefore the toughest restrictions the longest but infections are continuing to rise in the North West and South West probably because of the spread of the new variant of the virus. \nDespite this there's some relief at these figures among the government's scientific advisors.  They were not sure whether the current restrictions would be enough to prevent the more contagious variant getting out of control. Now they expect Covid-related deaths to level off in a week or so and then decline as the benefits of the vaccine programme begin to take effect.\nCases should also begin to decrease in the coming weeks. But all this depends on people continuing to observe the government's social distancing guidelines - and come into contact with others only if it is essential.\nProf Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, said coronavirus deaths were likely to peak in the next week to 10 days.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's The World At One that the lockdown measures were having an impact, with the peak in infections having passed \"a good few days ago\" which would lead to a reduction in the numbers dying from the disease.\n\"They are likely to level off in a week - 10 days maybe - at a peak which is probably going to be bigger than the first wave peak of 1,000-a-day, but then should decline due the reductions in cases that we are seeing and, of course, the vaccine programme.\"\nData from the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app gives its own estimate of 0.9 for the virus's R or reproduction number. This is based on cases alone, rather than a wider number of data sources included in the official estimate. \nWhile this leaves out the fact that hospitals are still filling up, looking at cases on their own allows assessment of whether lockdown restrictions are working.\nBut the large number of infections recorded at the end of December and the beginning of January means, despite receding cases, hospitalisations and deaths will inevitably continue to rise for some time. \nMeanwhile, a ban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde entering the UK came into force on Friday as a result of a new, potentially more infectious strain linked to Brazil. \nProf Wendy Barclay, a scientist at Imperial College London advising the government, said this \"variant of concern\" had not been detected in the UK but another variant from Brazil was already in circulation.\nIt is not clear whether this second strain is more contagious or not.

It is a very difficult circumstance,\" he said.\n\"We are trying to do the best and what is right for as many pupils as possible in looking at various permutations and combinations of criteria\". \nEducation Minister Peter Weir said it was \"a very disappointing day\" for many families.\n\"The transfer test, while it has never been about being compulsory for either a school or indeed an individual parent, does enable a level of parental choice and that has been dramatically reduced as a result of that,\" he told Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"But sadly what we have seen is for this year, the pandemic has prevented those transfer tests taking place, and I am very disappointed and entirely understand the disappointment and frustration of many families today.\"\nMr Weir said there had been \"a lack of consistency\" from AQE.\n\"I don't think the way things have worked out from AQE's point of view, particularly over the last couple of weeks, have been particularly helpful,\" he said.\nThe minister also apologised for \"clumsy language\" in a statement he issued on Wednesday night.\nWriting on Twitter about the cancellation of the transfer test, Mr Weir said: \"This severely limits parental choice and children's opportunities.\"\n\"There was no adverse intention towards non-selective schools,\" he said in relation to his tweet.\n\"I think both selective and non-selective schools have got excellent records in Northern Ireland.\"\n\"But once the opportunities for entry to any school is reduced then that is a reduction in opportunities for all.\"\nUUP MLA Robbie Butler has proposed that pupils' results in tests in primary schools could be given to parents and then used by grammar schools to decide which children get a place.\nMr Butler said that he had some favourable responses from some grammars and some primary schools to that proposal.\n\"Whilst I don't think my solution is absolutely perfect I do believe it to be absolutely fair and absolutely compassionate,\" he told MLAs on the committee.\n\"We have the genesis of a solution for these P7 pupils.\"\nBut, speaking on Wednesday, Mr Weir replied that there were issues with that approach.\n\"There are very major problems, I'm being honest with you, in terms of the models that have been put forward for academic selection without the test,\" he said.\nThe minister said it would be difficult to get comparable information for pupils across all primaries.\n\"While it's not entirely ruling out those and there is the option for schools to do it, it does leave them in a very difficult position making comparability between pupils on a fair basis,\" he said"

      "title": "Covid-19 in the UK: How many coronavirus cases are there in my area?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "The sight of some of the world's biggest tennis stars touching down for the forthcoming Australian Open has frustrated many Australians unable to return home because of the pandemic.\nAustralia currently has a weekly cap on the number of international arrivals, with people having to undergo quarantine in a designated facility.\nThere are roughly 37,000 Australians waiting to return, ABC News reports.\nA number of airlines have suspended routes making it harder to travel back.\nOn Friday, Emirates airline announced it would be stopping its flights to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.\nMeanwhile, organisers of the Australian Open have been putting on chartered flights for the players and other members of staff.\nPlayers had to test negative before boarding flights and were then placed in designated Australian Open quarantine hotels in Melbourne and Adelaide. They are, however, allowed out of their rooms for up to five hours a day to practise on court.\nBut 47 players who were on flights where passengers later tested positive will now have to be confined to their rooms for two weeks.\nThe first of these groups, on a flight from Los Angeles, reportedly includes two-time champion Victoria Azarenka and former US Open champion Sloane Stephens. \nTennys Sandgren, who tested positive but was cleared to fly by organisers after his medical file was reviewed, is also believed to have been on the flight.\nA second group of 23 players on a flight from United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi suffered the same fate. Both flights arrived on Friday.\nThose players will have less than 10 days to practise before the tournament starts on 8 February. Reports say they will have gym equipment delivered to their rooms.\nUK player Johanna Konta, who was not on either of the affected flights, tweeted about workouts in her hotel room to encourage fitness in confined spaces.\nMeanwhile former tennis world number one Andy Murray has been unable to fly out to Australia after the Briton tested positive for coronavirus.\nThe arrival of the tennis players, while so many Australians are still trying to return home, has drawn criticism. \n\"I can't comprehend the fact that one week they announce they're halving the caps for citizens and the following week they announce they've found 1,200 spaces for tennis players and support staff,\" Sarah, a key worker who lives in London but is from Sydney, told the BBC.\nShe has been trying to return to Sydney since October and her most recent flight was cancelled. \n\"All I want to do is return home. I've had to watch my sister's wedding on Zoom. My flight was timed so I get out of quarantine in time for her baby shower but it looks like I'll miss this and the birth\". \nOn Saturday, the Australian government said it would arrange for a further 20 international repatriation flights to bring its stranded nationals home from \"priority areas\". Those returning would not be counted within the existing traveller caps, a minister confirmed. \nDr Alyse Brown is currently based in Cambridge in the UK and has flights booked to Sydney next month. She has been trying to raise awareness about the issue.\n\"While the Australians back home watch the tennis, I'll be reading on support pages the daily horror stories of stranded Australians entering into homelessness,\" she told the BBC, speaking before the latest announcement on flights from the government.\n\"It has always been apparent to us that Australia has means to get their people home, they just lack the political will to do so and this makes me unspeakably mad. It's heartless economic decision making and the tennis for us is just another group of people we see the government prioritised above us.\"\nPeople have taken to Twitter using the hashtag #strandedaussies to share their views. \nOne user said: \"Thousands of Australian citizens are still stranded overseas. I've been a huge tennis fan for close to 40 years, but this is just wrong. I will not be supporting this Australian summer of tennis.\"\nEarlier this week, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said that if Melbourne cancelled the tournament, it would be picked up by another country. \nAustralia has strict limits on the number of arrivals allowed to enter the country. Authorities say this is to ensure there is enough room in a government quarantine facility. \nUnlike other countries, those arriving in Australia must quarantine in a designated facility or hotel instead of their own homes. \nThe cap on people entering was cut further last week after a hotel worker in Queensland contracted the UK variant of the coronavirus. \nUntil 15 February, New South Wales will have a weekly cap of 1,505 arrivals, Western Australia will permit 512 people and Queensland will have a cap of 500. \nVictoria and South Australia have kept their caps the same. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territories had their own \"bespoke arrangements\" for those arriving. \nThe Australian government has operated a number of repatriation flights but demand has been high. \nLast month, in an interview on the Seven TV network, Mr Morrison said Australians overseas were his \"first priority in terms of people coming back into the country\". \n\"We want you to come home and you have every right to come home,\" he said.

      "tags": "France,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "French Prime Minister Jean Castex has announced a new evening curfew will begin nationally across France starting at 18:00 (17:00 GMT) on Saturday.\nThe move is a tightening of a curfew already in place since December, which restricts movement from 20:00-06:00.\nAnnouncing the measure on Thursday, Mr Castex described the country's situation as \"worrying\" with infections remaining at a \"high plateau\". \nHe also announced new restrictions for people arriving into the country.\nFrance has so far recorded more than 69,000 coronavirus deaths - the seventh-highest death toll in the world. \nThe new national curfew will stay in place for at least 15 days and means everyone must be at home, unless they are returning from school or work, by 18:00 every day.\nAll shops and businesses will have to close when the curfew begins, except for emergency services. \nThe tighter evening restriction was already in place in some hard-hit eastern regions of the country before Thursday's announcement and, according to the French Scientific Council, has led to infection rates slowing. \nHowever some people have criticised the curfew, claiming that it will create larger groups of people, all trying to get home in time before it comes into force. \nWomen's rugby coach Felicie Guinot lives in Marseille, where an earlier curfew is already in place. She told AP news agency that rush hour traffic in Marseille was heavy.\n\"It's a scramble so everyone can be home by 6pm,\" she said. \nAll those arriving from outside the EU will now have to test negative for the virus within 72 hours before their travel into France, and then isolate for seven days and test negative again, Mr Castex said.\nThe border controls are partly to limit the extent to which new mutant strains of the virus spreading abroad can become dominant in France. There is particular concern over the more transmissible variant first detected in the UK - which the French health minister says now accounts for about 1-1.5% of new cases nationally.\n\"We must do everything to prevent this variant from spreading in France,\" Health Minister Olivier Veran told a Thursday news conference.\nThe prime minister said Thursday that the situation in France is \"under control compared to neighbouring countries but still fragile\" with pressure on hospitals remaining high.\nThe curfew is seen as a way to avoid a full national lockdown, but Mr Castex said further restrictions would be imposed \"without delay\" if the situation deteriorated further.\nIt is hoped that an earlier curfew will put a stop to people gathering for drinks in the evenings, despite the government advising citizens to limit their social contacts to six people. \nThe country will aim to carry out at least one million Covid-19 tests per month in schools to help keep them open, but indoor sport activities have been banned again.\nThe government is also aiming to have more than one million people vaccinated against the virus by the end of January, amid criticism of a slow rollout by some. So far, 318,000 people have been vaccinated, according to the Health Ministry. \n\"The sooner we can vaccinate the most vulnerable, the sooner our hospitals will be spared the risk of being overwhelmed,\" Mr Castex said Thursday. \nThe earlier six o'clock curfew is important because it should help to \"counter the ap\u00e9ro effect\". These words are from Stanislas Gu\u00e9rini, a leading figure in President Macron's party.  \nWhat he means is that the two hours between six and eight o'clock have been identified as a weak spot in the government's anti-Covid strategy because that is when - even after all the warnings - people still can't resist getting together for post-work, pre-dinner aperitifs.  \nThe six o'clock measure is already in force in a quarter of France, where apparently it is having an effect. Extending it nationwide represents a graduated response to a situation which the government says is worrying, but not alarming.\nAn average of 16,000 new cases a day is way more than the official target, but it is also a lot less than daily case numbers in the UK. Covid uptake in intensive care hospital beds is likewise on a \"high plateau\" - persistent but not out of control. \nSo the French government will continue with this weekly fine-tuning, hoping that - with a vaccination programme that is at last gathering speed - the skies will possibly clear by the summer.\nFrance is one of several countries to currently enforce a curfew to curb the spread of the virus. \nIn Hungary, people must have a written note from their employers in order to leave their homes between 20:00 and 05:00. \nLatvia has brought in a curfew every Friday, Saturday and Sunday until 25 January. People cannot go outside between 22:00 and 05:00 unless they have a certificate. \nBelgium has different curfews depending on which region you are in. Flanders has a curfew from midnight until 05:00, while Brussels and Wallonia have asked residents to stay at home from 22:00 until 06:00.\nIn Italy, people must stay inside from 22:00 until 05:00. \nMinisters in the Netherlands are said to be looking into a possible curfew there, according to local media.

They determine how many fish of each species each country's fleets are allowed to catch.\nThe SFF said that Brexit quota gains \"can hardly be claimed as a resounding success\" and that the Brexit deal \"actually leaves the Scottish industry in a worse position on more than half of the key stocks\".\n\"This industry now finds itself in the worst of both worlds,\" said SFF chief executive Elspeth Macdonald, accusing Prime Minister Boris Johnson of broken promises on quotas.\nThe \"desperately poor deal\" reached on quotas, under which the EU \"have full access to our waters\" means that the UK has \"no ability to leverage more fish from the EU\", she said.\n\"This, coupled with the chaos experienced since 1 January in getting fish to market, means that many in our industry now fear for their future, rather than look forward to it with optimism and ambition,\" Ms Macdonald added.\nThe Scottish National Party said the letter was \"an utterly devastating verdict on Brexit from Scotland's fishing industry\".\nAn SNP spokesperson said the Scottish fishing industry was \"right to be angry\" about the Brexit deal, which it said was costing Scotland's fishing communities millions of pounds.\nThe spokesman called on the prime minister to deliver \"a multi-billion pound package of Brexit compensation for Scotland\", adding: \"Communities across Scotland will never forgive the Tories for the damage they are doing to our country with their extreme Brexit obsession.\"\nA UK government spokesperson said the Prime Minister would respond to the SFF letter in due course.\nThe spokesperson said: \"We have now taken back control of our waters and the agreement we have reached with the EU secures a 25% transfer of quota from EU to UK vessels over five years, starting with 15% this year.\"\nThe spokesperson said the government was looking at providing additional financial support for the Scottish fishing industry, which it recognised was facing \"some temporary issues\".\n\"The Prime Minister has already committed to investing \u00a3100m in the UK's fishing industry and provided the Scottish government with nearly \u00a3200m to minimise disruption for businesses,\" the spokesperson added."

      "tags": "North Korea weapons programme,United States,North Korea",
      "text": "North Korea has unveiled a new type of submarine-launched ballistic missile, described by state media as \"the world's most powerful weapon\". \nSeveral of the missiles were displayed at a parade overseen by leader Kim Jong-un, reported state media.\nThe weapon's actual capabilities remain unclear, as it is not known to have been tested.\nThe show of military strength comes days before the inauguration of Joe Biden as US president.\nIt also follows a rare political meeting where Mr Kim decried the US as his country's \"biggest enemy\".\nImages released by North Korean state media showed at least four large black-and-white missiles being driven past flag-waving crowds.\nAnalysts noted it was a previously unseen weapon. \"New year, new Pukguksong,\" tweeted North Korea expert Ankit Panda, using the North Korean name for their submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). \nClad in a leather coat and fur hat, Mr Kim is pictured smiling and waving as he watched the display in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square, which also included infantry troops, artillery and tanks.\n\"The world's most powerful weapon, submarine-launch ballistic missile, entered the square one after another, powerfully demonstrating the might of the revolutionary armed forces,\" the official Korean Central News Agency said.\nThe event on Thursday did not showcase North Korea's largest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which was unveiled at a much larger military parade in October. That colossal weapon is believed to be able to deliver a nuclear warhead to anywhere in the US, and its size had surprised even seasoned analysts when it was put on show last year.\nThe country's latest display of its arsenal comes at the end of a five-yearly congress of the ruling Workers' Party.\nIn his address to members last week, Mr Kim had pledged to expand North Korea's nuclear weapons and military potential, outlining a list of desired weapons including long-range ballistic missiles capable of being launched from land or sea and \"super-large warheads\".\nHe also said that the US was Pyongyang's \"biggest obstacle for our revolution and our biggest enemy... no matter who is in power, the true nature of its policy against North Korea will never change\".\nUnder Mr Kim's leadership North Korea has made rapid progress in its weapons programme, which it says is necessary to defend itself against a possible US invasion.\nThe unveiling of the new missiles appears designed to send the incoming Biden administration a message of the North's growing military prowess, say experts.\n\"They'd like us to notice that they're getting more proficient with larger solid rocket boosters,\" Mr Panda tweeted, noting what appeared to be new solid-fuel short-range ballistic missiles on display too. These missiles can be launched more quickly than liquid-fuelled varieties.\nOver the last four years, Pyongyang has had an erratic relationship with the US under President Donald Trump's administration. Mr Kim and Mr Trump engaged in mutual insults and threats of war before an unprecedented summit in Singapore in 2018 and declarations of love by the outgoing US leader.\nDespite the apparent warming of relations, little concrete progress was made on negotiations over North Korea's nuclear programme and a second summit in Hanoi in 2019 broke down after the US refused Pyongyang's demands for sanctions relief.\nKim Jong-un has had a busy week. In this rare party congress at the start of a new year he's earned a new title, pledged to build new nuclear weapons and now he's shown the world some new missiles.\nThe general secretary, the title posthumously awarded to his father by which he is now known, had been pretty quiet in 2020 and appeared very few times in state media.\nBut 2021 is looking rather different. The party congress has offered him a grand daily domestic platform - even if it is not getting the international attention it may have done due to events in the United States and a global pandemic.\nThe parading vehicles include a new submarine-launched ballistic missile and new short-range ballistic missiles. This is a show of strength - flexing the military muscle once more to show the people of North Korea that despite the current bleak economic outlook, this impoverished country is capable of designing and building new strategic weapons.\nIt also offers a direct challenge to the incoming US administration. \nNorth Korea appears willing to continue with its self-imposed isolation and being subject to strict economic sanctions, and the state has vowed to continue to build nuclear weapons in defiance of the international community.\nDuring the transfer of power, President Obama told Donald Trump that North Korea should be his top national security concern.\nIn the last four years a combination of US and UN sanctions, so-called \"maximum pressure\" policies and three summits between Mr Trump and Mr Kim have done nothing to alleviate those concerns.\nKim Jong-un has shown the new US president this week that he faces the daunting prospect of coming up with new solutions for this decades-old problem."

      "text": "New laws for shoppers and staff are to be introduced after \"significant evidence\" coronavirus is being spread in supermarkets, the first minister has said.\nMark Drakeford said shops would have to install signs reminding shoppers to socially distance.\nIt comes after customers and staff raised concerns over safety, with some workers saying they had faced abuse.\nMr Drakeford said the stricter measures were needed due to the new variant.\nSpeaking at the Welsh Government's Covid briefing on Friday, Mr Drakeford said the Test, Trace, Protect scheme had shown there was \"no doubt at all\" transmission was taking place in supermarkets.\nBut he also said: \"I don't want anybody to get the idea that supermarkets are dangerous places - supermarkets are safe places and we're incredibly grateful to all those brave members of staff who have been in there, providing face-to-face services to members of the public since the very beginning of the pandemic. \n\"We want to make sure that they are even safer.\"\nWales remains under a level four \"stay at home\" lockdown, meaning people are only allowed to leave home for essential reasons, including shopping for food.\nBut there have been growing concerns from shoppers and staff about safety in supermarkets and Mr Drakeford previously said one-way systems and number limits in stores appeared to have broken down.\nSome workers have claimed they are seeing shoppers walking around without masks, not using hygiene measures and shopping in large groups.\nSpeaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said many shops already had safety measures in place, including providing hand sanitisers, limiting numbers in store and reminding people to socially distance.\nThe first minister said laws for supermarkets were being strengthened because of concerns of people in \"many communities\" that safety measures were not as visible as they were in the earlier stages of the pandemic last year.\nMr Drakeford said people needed to see everything was \"being done to keep them safe\" and give them the \"necessary confidence... to be able to use places which are, after all, pretty vital to most of us to keep our lives going in a lockdown.\"\nUnder the laws, set to come into force early next week, all retailers will need to have:\nThese measures were already guidance, but will now be law, and supermarket owners and managers will be responsible for ensuring the new rules are followed.\n\"Many [shops] are already operating high standards and we need to raise the bar for those who could and should improve,\" Mr Drakeford said.\nSome shop workers had told BBC Wales they were facing \"daily abuse\" for challenging rule-breakers, with some threatened and spat at.\nThe Union of Shop Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) has warned the onus on policing customers' behaviour must not fall on shop workers.\nWhile Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium said trying to enforce laws had created \"further conflict and flashpoint\" with customers, leading to workers being abused.\n\"We ask that all customers play their part in keeping our stores safe, shopping alone where possible, following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers,\" she said.\n\"We also ask that government considers legislating for better protections for shop workers, as is being planned in Scotland.\"\nMr Drakeford said it was \"entirely unacceptable that retail staff who have done so much to help us or during this pandemic\" should face abuse from customers unhappy with the restrictions.Staff had been \"going into work every day to make sure that there's food that we can put on the table\", he said.\nNick Ireland, regional secretary for Usdaw for Wales and the south west of England, said shop workers were anxious about confronting customers not adhering to guidance in shops.\n\"We've asked for clearer signage, and robust one way systems,\" he said.\n\"Some shoppers seem to forget about two metre social distancing, particularly when it comes the workforce in stores.\"\nHealth spokesman for Plaid Cymru, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said new rules for shops were \"overdue\".\nHe said it was \"certainly the right thing to do\", and was \"totally unacceptable for any supermarket staff to be the subject of any abuse over this\".  \nMeanwhile, Paul Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said it was \"quite clear that we are lagging behind other parts of the UK\" in regards to numbers of people vaccinated.\n\"It's important to get those vaccines out to people and get the vaccines into people's arms,\" he added. \nMr Drakeford said enforcement action could be taken against supermarkets over breaches of Covid rules. During the first lockdown some stores were issued with fines for failing to adhere to regulations.\n\"Reputation does really matter to supermarket chains,\" he said.\n\"They definitely don't like it... when one of their supermarkets becomes known locally as somewhere that was regarded as falling below the standards that an environmental health officer would require.\"\nThe first minister said there was also the \"wish of the sector to do the right thing by their staff and their customers\".\n\"I think is more effective than financial penalties, which are there and have been applied to supermarkets,\" Mr Drakeford added."

      "tags": "Impeachment of Donald Trump,US Capitol stormed,Donald Trump,US Congress",
      "text": "US Republicans in Congress are deeply divided after 10 members split with their party to impeach President Donald Trump on Wednesday. \nCongresswoman Liz Cheney, the third ranking House Republican, is facing calls to resign her party leadership role after her vote to impeach.\nThe lawmakers who voted against Mr Trump face threats of violence, and have increased security, they say.\nIt comes as Mr Trump prepares to leave office and faces a trial in the Senate.\nThe House of Representatives voted by 232 votes to 197 on Wednesday to impeach him for allegedly inciting rioters who stormed the Capitol last week. \nThe FBI has warned of possible armed protests planned for Washington DC and all 50 US state capitals in the run-up to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday.\nMs Cheney, a Wyoming congresswoman whose father was vice-president to Republican George W Bush, faced immediate calls to resign after voting to impeach Mr Trump for inciting insurrection against the US government.\n\"I'm not going anywhere. This is a vote of conscience,\" said Ms Cheney, after Mr Trump's conservative defenders in Congress called for her to quit. \n\"It's one where there are different views in our conference. But our nation is facing an unprecedented, since the Civil War, constitutional crisis,\" she told reporters on Wednesday, as Trump was impeached for a historic second time.\nAnother Republican has said he and several colleagues have purchased body armour and have been forced to change their normal routines after receiving threats of violence.\n\"It's sad that we have to get to that point, but you know our expectation is that someone may try to kill us,\" Michigan Republican Peter Meijer told MSNBC on Thursday.\n\"We don't know what's going to happen next. We weren't expecting for the Capitol to get overrun for the first time in 200 years,\" he said. \n\"And so in this unprecedented environment with an unprecedented degree of fear, of divisiveness and hatred, we have to account for every scenario.\" \nFor two hours, members of the Democratic-controlled House made statements for and against the vote on impeachment while National Guard troops kept watch inside and outside the Capitol. \nMost Republicans did not seek to defend Mr Trump, but instead argued that the impeachment had bypassed the customary hearings and called on Democrats to drop it for the sake of national unity.\n\"Impeaching the president in such a short time frame would be a mistake,\" said Kevin McCarthy, the House's top Republican. \"That doesn't mean the president's free from fault. The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters.\"\nImpeachment charges are political, not criminal. The president was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House.\nHe urged them to \"peacefully and patriotically\" make their voices heard, but also to \"fight like hell\" against an election that he falsely told them had been stolen.\nFollowing Mr Trump's remarks, his supporters broke into the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to suspend certification of election results and take shelter while the building was placed on lockdown.\nThe article of impeachment states that Mr Trump \"repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were fraudulent and should not be accepted\".\nIt says he then repeated these claims and \"wilfully made statements to the crowd that encouraged and foreseeably resulted in lawless action at the Capitol\", leading to violence and loss of life.\nThe Senate - the upper house of the US Congress - will hold a trial to determine the president's guilt but this will not happen during Mr Trump's remaining week in office. \nRepublican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said there was \"simply no chance that a fair or serious trial\" could conclude in time given \"the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents\" that govern trials involving presidents.\nA two-thirds majority will be needed to convict Mr Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would have to vote with Democrats in the evenly split, 100-seat chamber.\nAs many as 20 Republicans are open to convicting the president, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. In a note to colleagues, Mr McConnell said he had not made a final decision on how he would vote.\nIf Mr Trump is convicted, senators could then hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again, which he had indicated he planned to do in 2024.\nThe first impeachment of Mr Trump was in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine. He was acquitted by the Senate."

      "tags": "Media,UK TV licence fee,BBC,Richard Sharp",
      "text": "The licence fee is the \"least worst\" way of funding the BBC, its incoming chairman Richard Sharp has said.\nBut Mr Sharp told MPs he had an \"open mind\" about how the corporation should be funded in the future, and it \"may be worth reassessing\" the current system.\nHe also said he didn't think the BBC's Brexit coverage was biased overall, but \"there were some occasions when the Brexit representation was unbalanced\".\nQuestion Time \"seemed to have more Remainers than Brexiteers\", he said.\nThe \u00a3157.50 licence fee is due to stay in place until at least 2027, when the BBC's Royal Charter ends, with a debate about how the broadcaster should be funded after that.\nMr Sharp, who spent 23 years working as a banker for Goldman Sachs, told the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee: \"At 43p a day, the BBC represents terrific value.\"\nThe government is currently reviewing whether its cost should continue rising with inflation from 2022, and whether non-payment should remain a criminal offence. Mr Sharp said he was \"not in favour of decriminalisation\".\nHe said other possible options for funding the BBC in the future could include a household tax like the one used in Germany, \"which amounts to the same amount of money\".\nHe added: \"So when we next get the chance to review the structure of this then it may be worth reassessing.\"\nAsked whether he believed the BBC's coverage of Brexit had been unbalanced, he replied: \"No, actually I don't.\n\"I believe there were some occasions when the Brexit representation was unbalanced.\n\"So if you ask me if I think Question Time seemed to have more Remainers than Brexiteers, the answer is yes, but the breadth of the coverage I thought was incredibly balanced, in a highly toxic environment that was extremely polarised.\"\nQuestion Time has said it has robust processes in place to ensure balance on its panels.\nMr Sharp said he was \"considered to be a Brexiteer\" and had donated around \u00a3400,000 to the Conservative Party over the past 20 years.\nHe said the biggest issue now facing the BBC is impartiality, and that \"trust in leadership and trust in processes\" must be rebuilt after high-profile equal pay cases with journalists such as Carrie Gracie and Samira Ahmed. \n\"Clearly some of the problems it's had recently are really rather terrible and reflect a culture that needs to be rebuilt, so everybody who cherishes the BBC and works at the BBC feels proud and happy to work there,\" he said. \"Then in my view that would produce a better output inevitably.\"\nMr Sharp also told the committee he would give his \u00a3160,000 salary as BBC chairman to charity. \nWhen asked \"what's in it for you?\" Mr Sharp, whose heritage is Jewish, said: \"We're all a product of our upbringing and I was very fortunate with the parents I have, my great grandparents came to this country escaping tyranny.\n\"I think I won the lottery in life to be British and if I can make a contribution, I couldn't be happier to.\n\"The BBC is part of the fabric of all our national identities, it offers education and enrichment and is also important for our position in the world... It is a massive privilege to be chair of the BBC.\"\nSir David Clementi, the current BBC chairman, steps down in February. The post-holder is officially appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the government.  \nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Travellers from South America are no longer allowed to come into the UK, amid fears over a new coronavirus variant first identified in Brazil.\nThe UK's new travel ban - which also applies to Portugal and Cape Verde - came into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday.\nLike variants discovered in the UK and South Africa, it is thought the Brazil variant could be more contagious.\nVirologist Prof Wendy Barclay said one Brazilian variant had already been detected in the UK. \nHowever, she said this was not \"the variant of concern\", which is thought to be more infectious.\nProf Barclay, head of G2P-UK National Virology Consortium, which is studying the effects of emerging coronavirus mutations, said: \"There are two different types of Brazilian variants and one of them has been detected and one of them has not.\"\nShe added: \"The new Brazilian variant of concern, that was picked up in travellers going to Japan, has not been detected in the UK.\n\"Other variants that may have originated from Brazil have been previously found.\"\nEarlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Brazilian variant of concern was not \"as far as we are aware\" already in the UK, adding that he did not believe there had been any flights from Brazil in the last week. \nIt comes as a further 1,248 people with coronavirus have died in the UK.\nLatest government figures on Thursday also showed another 48,682 new cases had been reported.\nMeanwhile, the number of people in the UK to have received the first dose of a vaccine is now approaching three million.\nThe UK's new travel ban applies to people who have travelled from, or through, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela in the last 10 days.\nIt also applies to Portugal - because of its strong links to Brazil - and the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde off the coast of west Africa, as well as Panama in central America.\nBritish and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights are still allowed to return - but must isolate for 10 days. \nAlso exempt are hauliers who are travelling from Portugal to transport essential goods.\nBrazil has seen more than 200,000 deaths and there is concern about the impact the new mutation could have on its health system.\nHowever, the UK's travel ban was prompted by fears of how quickly the new variant could spread through the region - since Brazil borders 10 countries.\nMr Shapps has said the ban is \"precautionary\", adding he \"can't provide an end date\" to the new rules.\n\"We're so close now, we've got three million of these vaccines in people's arms in the UK,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\"We want to make sure we don't fall at this last hurdle.\"\nBecause holidays are not currently allowed, Mr Shapps said he did not \"expect a large number of Brits to have jaunted off to South America\", and the government was \"not expecting to see a big repatriation issue as a result\".\nOne family, who live in Wolverhampton, told the BBC they feared being stuck out in Brazil.\n\"I don't know if the government will organise flights,\" said Jon Dent, 31. He and his wife Carla travelled to the Brazilian city of Goiania in October to introduce their baby daughter to Carla's family.\n\"I think it's a long shot,\" he said. \"I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months. We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible.\" \nMany countries imposed travel restrictions after new variants of Covid-19 were identified in the UK and South Africa.\nSeveral Central and South American nations - including Brazil - had already restricted travel from the UK before the latest ban on arrivals.\nThere is currently no evidence to suggest that any of the variants cause more serious illness, and scientists are confident that vaccines should work against them.\nAccording to Felipe Naveca, deputy director of research at the Brazilian state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, the new variant's origin was \"undoubtedly\" from the Amazon region.\nHe told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson the new variant showed some of the same mutations as the UK and South Africa variants - and \"some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern\".\nMr Shapps also announced Qatar and the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba were being removed from the UK's travel corridor list, meaning arrivals from those places will need to self-isolate for 10 days from 04:00 GMT on Saturday.\nMeanwhile, France has cracked down on the type of tests that travellers can take to show they are negative. \nFrom Monday, travellers will need to show a negative PCR test. Antigen tests - which are the rapid lateral flow tests - will no longer be accepted.\nHowever, Mr Shapps said arrangements allowing hauliers to use rapid lateral flow tests before crossing the border from the UK into France remained in place at the moment. \nFrom Monday, everyone travelling to England and Scotland will also have to show proof of a negative test. Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce their own plans in the coming days.\nHow have you been affected by the travel ban?

She is still under the care of the clinic.\nHe said: \"We presumed we were feeding her correctly. She was getting fruit, veg, home-cooked meals. But I think our issue was, we kind of let her have treats, like chocolates and sweets.\n\"To be told the news [that she was obese], it was horrible. We were very upset. We were kind of angry about it - we didn't see a problem in her, we didn't believe she was overweight or obese. We were both asking what we had done wrong as parents - we gave her fruit, vegetables, home-cooked meals... we were asking ourselves, 'how have we failed as parents?'\"\nWith support from Dr Simmons, his daughter made \"great progress\" and lost weight, he said. Previous signs of health issues such as liver problems had improved. Then the pandemic struck and the country went into its first lockdown, followed by the firebreak, then the current lockdown. \nDespite making efforts to keep active and eat healthily, Daniel has seen the gradual effects on his daughter, both physically and mentally.\n\"It had a bad effect on her, and not just the weight - mental health-wise it's also affected her. She's six years old and is worried about being around other people in the street,\" he said.\n\"In years to come, Covid will be gone, we'll have control of it. But obesity, that's the issue that's going to be prolonged.\n\"The long-term mental health impact really scares me - not just for my daughter, but for so many other children.\"\nDr Simmons said increasing rates of childhood obesity in recent years meant experts were treating more children with conditions normally associated with adults.\n\"Even children as young as primary school age, I'm seeing those children with fatty liver changes for example, as a result of their obesity. We're seeing them with high blood pressure and we're seeing children and young people developing type 2 diabetes and many more with pre-diabetic states because of their obesity.\"\nShe revealed her youngest patient was only a year old and encouraged families to get their children \"used to being fit and healthy and consuming a healthy diet\".\n\"It's lack of exercise, it's the sedentary lifestyle that we as a nation are sadly embracing these days,\" she added.\nIf children remain overweight and remain obese into adolescence, they have an 80% chance of being obese into adulthood, said Dr Simmons.\nShe said she hoped the new service would give \"the very best chance of turning things around\".\nSteven Grayston, Betsi Cadwaladr health board's assistant area director of therapy services, said the health board had been working for the past five years to develop its obesity services.\n\"This is a specialist weight management service for children who are already obese,\" he said.\n\"We want to stop them becoming obese, therefore we want to develop preventative services as well as treatment services.\n\"We're very concerned about the impact of Covid and the pandemic on children's activity levels, certainly in terms of team-based sports and access to leisure facilities - particularly things like swimming, which we know children enjoy. \n\"We're concerned that children just aren't getting out of the house and doing things, and the impact that'll have and the knock-on effect on obesity levels in the future, as children are just less active and less interested in doing those activities.\"\nThe Welsh Government said: \"We will shortly be publishing a revised delivery plan for Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales for 2021-22, which will focus on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on children and families.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you on Saturday morning.  \nAll of the UK's travel corridors will be temporarily closed from Monday to \"protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new Covid strains\", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced. Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson said anyone arriving in the UK would be required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test, taken in the previous 72 hours. It comes after new, more infectious variants were detected in South Africa and Brazil. On Friday, a further 1,280 people died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test, according to the latest government figures.\nThe coronavirus epidemic in the UK is still officially estimated to be growing, according to the government's latest estimate of the R number - but there are signs lockdown restrictions may be working. The Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) now estimates the R number to be between 1.2 and 1.3, compared to 1-1.4 last week. But in London, where tight restrictions came in earlier, the R number is between 0.9 and 1.2. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, told the Downing Street briefing there was some \"levelling off\" in cases \"thanks to enormous efforts by so many people\". What is the UK's R number and why does it matter?\nInsurers must cover the losses of tens of thousands of small businesses during the first lockdown following a Supreme Court ruling. The court found largely in favour of small firms receiving payments from business interruption insurance policies. The ruling could offer a lifeline to some firms, allowing them to continue trading. It came as the UK economy shrank by 2.6% in November as lockdown restrictions reduced economic activity. \nNew coronavirus laws for shoppers and staff in Wales are to be introduced following \"significant evidence\" Covid is being spread in supermarkets. Shops will now have to install signs reminding shoppers to socially distance. The country's first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the stricter measures were needed due to the new variant. But workers have also raised safety concerns about shoppers walking around without masks and shopping in large groups. \nWith hospitals under extreme pressure and daily infections still high, the NHS Test and Trace system remains an important tool to stop the spread of coronavirus. BBC Asian Network is helping the South Asian community in the UK to understand how the system works in five languages: Gujarati, Punjabi, Sylheti, Tamil and Urdu. Below, reporter Raj Kaur Bilkhu explains how the test-and-trace system works in Punjabi. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nIf you're wondering how concerned we should be about the new virus variants, our health editor Michelle Roberts examines what we know so far.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "US election 2020,Twitter,Donald Trump,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US president-elect Joe Biden has been given his new official presidential Twitter account, but has been forced to start it with zero followers.\nThe Biden campaign is unhappy with the move, which marks a change from the previous transition from Barack Obama.\nThe new account, @PresElectBiden, will transform into the official @POTUS (President of the United States) one on inauguration day on 20 January.\nIn its first six hours online it gained nearly 400,000 followers.\nMr Biden's own account has 24 million followers.\nHis team has also registered new accounts - @FLOTUSBiden for the future first lady, Jill Biden, and for the first time, @SecondGentleman, for Ms Harris's husband Doug Emhoff.\nDonald Trump inherited the Potus account's 13 million or so followers when it moved to him from Mr Obama - but that will not happen this time.\nMr Biden's team was told about the move less than a month ago, and said it meant \"the administration will have to start from zero\".\nTwitter has not explained why the decision was made, and said it had nothing further to add beyond an official blog post laying out transition plans.\nIn that post it said: \"These institutional accounts will not automatically retain the followers from the prior administration,\" without a reason why.\nBut it said that people who previously followed the official @POTUS and @VP (Vice-President) accounts, or the personal accounts of Mr Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris - would receive notifications giving them the option to follow the new official ones.\nMr Obama was the first US leader to have an official Twitter account. The @POTUS account was set up during his tenure in 2015.\nAt the end of his second term, a transition plan for handing over the official accounts to Mr Trump was drawn up - with @POTUS going to the new administration. \nAll of Mr Obama's official tweets were archived for posterity on a separate account, @POTUS44 (where they can still be read today).\nTwitter said that the official @POTUS account under Mr Trump will be archived in a similar way, under @POTUS45. But Mr Trump rarely used that account, favouring his own Twitter handle.\nTwitter notably omitted any mention of the now-suspended @realDonaldTrump account, and declined to answer questions about whether its contents would be archived.\nThat is despite a declaration by the White House in 2017 that tweets from that account are considered official statements by the President.\nHowever, the US National Archives has already announced - through a tweet - that it will archive all social media content from that account, despite Twitter's lack of a commitment to doing so.\nIt said that the White House has been using a special archiving tool to capture all content, including deleted tweets, because of the Presidential Records Act.\nThat is likely to result in a record system similar to The Obama White House Social Media Archive, built after the last transition.\nA key goal of the Obama transition was to preserve social media posts \"on the platforms where they were created\".\nBut Twitter has permanently suspended Mr Trump from its platform and it remains unclear if it will ever archive his account for posterity.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Fake News,BAME communities",
      "text": "Fake news is likely to be causing some people from the UK's South Asian communities to reject the Covid vaccine, a doctor has warned.\nDr Harpreet Sood, who is leading an NHS anti-disinformation drive, said it was \"a big concern\" and officials were working \"to correct so much fake news\". \nHe said language and cultural barriers played a part in the false information.\nA GP in the West Midlands told the BBC some of her South Asian patients had refused the vaccine when offered it.\nDr Sood, from NHS England, said officials were working with South Asian role models, influencers, community leaders and religious leaders to help debunk myths about the vaccine.\nMuch of the disinformation surrounds the contents of the vaccine.\nHe said: \"We need to be clear and make people realise there is no meat in the vaccine, there is no pork in the vaccine, it has been accepted and endorsed by all the religious leaders and councils and faith communities.\" \n\"We're trying to find role models and influencers and also thinking about ordinary citizens who need to be quick with this information so that they can all support one another because ultimately everyone is a role model to everyone\", he added.\n\"There's a big piece of work happening where we're translating information, we're making sure the look and feel of it reaches the populations that matter.\"\nSome of the disinformation seen by the BBC on social media and on WhatsApp is religiously targeted. Messages falsely claim the vaccines contain animal produce - eating pork goes against the religious beliefs of Muslims, as does eating beef for Hindus. \nDr Samara Afzal has been vaccinating people in Dudley, West Midlands. She said: \"We've been calling all patients and booking them in for vaccines but the admin staff say when they call a lot of the South Asian patients they decline and refuse to have the vaccination.  \n\"Also talking to friends and family have found the same. I've had friends calling me telling me to convince their parents or their grandparents to have the vaccination because other family members have convinced them not to have it\".\nReena Pujara is a beauty therapist in Hampshire and a practising Hindu. She said she's been bombarded with false information.\n\"Some of the videos are quite disturbing especially when you actually see the person reporting is a medic and telling you that the vaccine is going to alter your DNA,\" she said. \n\"For a layman it is very confusing. And also when you read that the ingredients in the vaccine derive from a cow - and as Hindus the cow is sacred to us - it is disturbing.\"\nAbout 100 mosques have a joined a campaign to counter vaccine disinformation and persuade their communities to take the vaccine. They've said they'll use their Friday sermons to urge people to have the jab. \n\"There should be no hesitation in taking [the vaccine] from a moral perspective,\" said Qari Asim, chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board (MINAB), which has organised the campaign. \"It is our ethical duty to protect ourselves and others from harm.\"\nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC's Asian Network that faith and community leaders had a big role to play in ensuring a high take-up of the vaccine. He said he had met with more than 150 leaders from Sikh, Hindu, Jewish and Muslim communities who were taking the message out \"that it's the right thing to do\".\nHe added that the government was taking steps to tackle online disinformation around the vaccine, as well as making sure vaccine guidance was available in many different languages.\nA recent poll, commissioned by the Royal Society of Public Health, suggested just over half of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people would be happy to have the coronavirus vaccine. \nIt found 57% said they would take the vaccine - compared with 79% of white people."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

      "text": "Hospitals in the Brazilian city of Manaus have reached breaking point while treating Covid-19 patients, amid reports of severe oxygen shortages and desperate staff.\nThe city, in Amazonas state, has seen a surge of deaths and infections.\nHealth professionals, quoted by local media, warned \"many people\" could die due to lack of supplies and assistance.\nBrazil has recorded more than 205,000 virus deaths - the second-highest tally in the world, behind the US. \nA new coronavirus variant has recently emerged in Brazil, with several cases in travellers arriving in Japan traced back to the Amazonas region.  \nAmazonas suffered heavy losses in the first wave of the pandemic but is also being badly hit by a new rise in infections. \nRefrigerated containers were brought to hospitals to help store bodies last week, as authorities declared a state of emergency.\nJessem Orellana, from the Fiocruz-Amazonia scientific investigation institute, told the AFP news agency that some hospitals in Manaus had \"run out of oxygen\" with some centres becoming \"a type of suffocation chamber\" for patients.\nThe researcher told Brazilian media she had received reports from the front-line of \"dramatic\" scenes playing out in some hospitals.\nReports in the daily Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper described desperate staff having to try to keep patients alive through manual ventilation. \nIn a widely shared video from the region, a female medical worker asks the internet for help: \"We're in an awful state. Oxygen has simply run out across the whole unit today.\"\n\"There is no oxygen and lots of people are dying,\" she says in the clip.  \"If anyone has any oxygen, please bring it to the clinic. There are so many people dying.\"\nAmazonas Governor Wilson Lima said the state was \"in the most critical moment of the pandemic\" and has announced a nightly curfew will begin at 19:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Friday to try to stem the spread. \nMarcellus Campelo, a local health secretary, said the state needed three times the amount of oxygen it can produce locally and appealed for help. \nBrazil's vice-president shared images on Twitter of the air force transporting hospital supplies, including oxygen cylinders and stretchers, to the city as reports of the situation spread throughout the country.\nHealth officials also say some patients will be airlifted to other states for treatment due to the demand for intensive care units, Reuters reports. \nFelipe Naveca, deputy director of research at the state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson that the new variant had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same characteristics: \"Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern.\"\nMr Naveca said that they did not yet have any data to suggest that existing vaccines would be any less effective against the new variant. \"We have to do a lot more sequencing of samples to answer that question,\" he said.\nHowever, on Thursday UK officials announced a ban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde due to the new strain.

About 60 people were safely evacuated from the hospital.\n\"It happened so quickly, around 10 seconds,\" Syamsu Ridwan, a local police spokesman, told the BBC.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Money,Personal finance,Insurance,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Tens of thousands of small businesses will receive insurance payouts covering losses from the first national lockdown, following a court ruling.\nThe Supreme Court found largely in favour of small firms receiving payments from business interruption insurance policies.\nFor some businesses it could provide a lifeline, allowing them to trade beyond the coronavirus crisis.\nThe ruling could cost the insurance sector hundreds of millions of pounds.\nThe City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), brought the test case, with eight insurers agreeing to take part in proceedings.\nOne of the insurers set to make significant payouts is Hiscox, which was challenged by thousands of its policyholders as part of the case.\nRichard Leedham, who represented the Hiscox Action Group - on behalf of small businesses, said: \"This is a landmark victory for a small group of businesses who took on a huge insurance player and have been fully vindicated. \n\"What is important now is that Hiscox accepts the Supreme Court's verdict and starts paying out to its policy holders, many of whom are in danger of going under\".\nOther insurers involved in the test case are Arch, Argenta, MS Amlin, QBE and RSA - but as many as 60 insurers sold similar products. They will now pay out on many, but not all, policies.\nHuw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: \"All valid claims will be settled as soon as possible and in many cases the process of settling claims has begun.\n\"We recognise this has been a particularly difficult time for many small businesses and naturally regret the Covid-19 restrictions have led to disputes with some customers.\"\nIn the lockdown of last spring, many small businesses made claims through business interruption insurance policies for loss of earnings when they had to close.\nBut many insurers refused to pay, arguing only the most specialist policies had cover for such unprecedented restrictions.\nIt was agreed that a selection of policy wordings should be tested in court, setting the parameters for what would be considered a valid claim.\nThe ruling provides guidance for a wider pool of 700 policies, potentially affecting 370,000 small businesses - although only some of these will end up with payouts.\nGiving the court's ruling, Lord Hamblen said the court accepted the arguments from representatives of policyholders and dismissed appeals from insurers against an earlier judgement finding in policyholders' favour.\nThe complex ruling covered issues such as disease clauses, whether business were denied access to the properties, and the timing of lost earnings.\nJames Ollerenshaw's hair salon was one of those businesses unable to operate during the first national lockdown.\nThe business - The Drawing Room in London's Spitalfields - paid an annual premium of \u00a31,200 for business interruption insurance, and disease cover came as part of it.\nMr Ollerenshaw said the Supreme Court's decision would not directly affect his policy, but would decide the principles on claims such as his - and were vital for the business.\n\"A payout would cover the major costs, which is the rent. We have debt sitting there,\" he said.\nHe said he was delighted with the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\"The insurance industry needs to face up to the fact that it failed customers at their greatest moment of need, destroying companies, livelihoods and jobs,\" he said.\nHe formed a Covid Claims Group, joining other small business owners in calling for a quick resolution and payouts.\n\"Time matters,\" he said, pointing out that some small businesses have been forced to close down while waiting for the decision.\nSheldon Mills, from the FCA, which brought the case on behalf of policyholders, said: \"Coronavirus is causing substantial loss and distress to businesses and many are under immense financial strain to stay afloat. Today's judgment decisively removes many of the roadblocks to claims by policyholders.\n\"We will be working with insurers to ensure that they now move quickly to pay claims that the judgment says should be paid, making interim payments wherever possible.\"\nThe test case was fast-tracked to the highest court in England and Wales - the Supreme Court, which heard four days of legal representations in November. The final ruling provides authoritative guidance for these policies, and potentially of similar ones not part of the case.\nThe FCA, the insurance sector, and the Financial Ombudsman will all use the judgement to guide their decisions in other cases.\nThe Financial Ombudsman Service and courts in Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to use the judgment to rule on other, similar cases.\nInsurance policies would have been amended for new and renewing customers since this issue emerged, so losses from the latest lockdown measures in different parts of the UK would be clearly stated as part of the cover - or not - in new business interruption insurance policies."

      "title": "Covid variants: Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights?",
      "tags": "Travel,Reality Check,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There are more than 40 countries on the government's red list, which has the strictest travel restrictions.\nOne is India, where a new mutation of coronavirus first identified in the country has spread to the UK. This has been linked to international travel. It has been classified as a \"variant of concern\" and more than 3,400 cases of it have been found in the UK.\nBut despite this and the discovery in the UK of other variants identified abroad, the government has never banned international travel altogether - unlike some countries.\nA traffic light system has been introduced for travel, with countries classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests.\nRed list countries (which include India, Pakistan, Brazil and South Africa) are those the UK government says are at the highest risk from Covid, and should not be visited \"except in the most extreme of circumstances\".\nIf you have been in one, you can only enter the UK if you are a UK or Irish national, or UK resident.\nYou must be tested negative for Covid-19 before departure and self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved quarantine hotel.\nDirect flights from many red list countries to the UK are banned but some are allowed. These include flights from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kenya. The government says this is to avoid potential disruption to critical freight and British nationals seeking to return home.\nOn one day (19 May), Reality Check counted 4 direct flights from India to Heathrow.\nCoronavirus variants originally found in Brazil, South Africa and India are believed to be more transmissible, and there are concerns vaccines may not be quite as effective against them.\nBritish and Irish citizens who have been in these countries are allowed to return to the UK and - until mid-February - were trusted to self-isolate at home and could take public transport to get there. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had moved \"as fast as we could\" to introduce quarantine hotels, describing them as a \"very tough regime\". The measures began on 15 February 2021, after weeks of speculation.\nLabour said there had been a lack of a \"comprehensive\" border system. \nThe Civil Aviation Authority said that in February 2021, 50,000 passengers travelled between India and the UK, which is an average of just under 900 a day in each direction. \nThe country was placed on the red list on 23 April and there has been criticism that it should have been added earlier.\nJust under half of people with the India variant of concern in England had been travelling, according to a 13 May briefing from Public Health England. It said that about one third of the cases were in London and a quarter were in the North West of England.\nPositive tests from passengers arriving in the UK are automatically sent for genome sequencing, which identifies new variants.\nBut there is concern that by the time a variant has been identified, it may already have spread in the UK.\nThe debate over whether to shut UK borders stretches back to the start of the pandemic.\nBetween January and March 2020, the UK introduced some measures to try to protect itself from the new virus.\nQuarantine was imposed on 273 people travelling from Wuhan in China, where the first outbreak was seen. Others from \"high-risk countries\" including China, Iran and Northern Italy were asked to voluntarily isolate for 14 days.\nAn inquiry into the pandemic suggested it was understandable the government \"did not consider it practical or effective simply to restrict flights\" at that time, partly because there were so many British residents trying to get home.\nBut these self-isolation requirements were withdrawn on 13 March 2020 - 10 days before the UK went into the first lockdown.\n\"The government's failure to have proper quarantine measures in place in March as the infection was spreading fast was a grave error and meant Covid spread faster and reached more people,\" Yvette Cooper, chair of the committee of MPs behind the inquiry said. \nOne study found the virus was introduced to the UK \"well over a thousand times in early 2020\", with a third of transmission chains brought in from Spain, followed by 29% from France, neither of which faced any restrictions. China accounted for just 0.4% of imported cases.\nAt the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised against travel bans, saying they were \"usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact\".\nIn April 2021, the WHO said it would update its \"risk-based guidance\" on Covid and international travel.\nThe Home Office said the committee behind the inquiry was \"incorrect in their assertions\".\nIt said keeping borders open helped businesses maintain international connections, boosted the economy and meant people could still travel for essential reasons. \nIt argued that by mid-March 2020 there was \"significant transmission\" in the UK and any extra travel restrictions at that time would have had a \"very marginal\" impact.\nAt a meeting in February 2020, the government advisory committee Sage suggested that cutting the number of infections entering the UK by half would only delay the epidemic by five days. \nThe scientists estimated that a 95% reduction in imported cases, which would have required \"draconian\" travel restrictions, would have pushed things back by a month.\nBut at its meeting in January 2021, Sage said: \"No intervention, other than a complete, pre-emptive closure of borders, or the mandatory quarantine of all visitors upon arrival in designated facilities, irrespective of testing history, can get close to fully preventing the importation of cases or new variants.\""

      "text": "UK meat exporters have claimed post-Brexit customs systems are \"not fit for purpose\", with goods delayed for hours, sometimes days, at the border.\nThe British Meat Processor Association said even experienced exporters were struggling with the system.\nIt said meat exports to the EU were 25% of normal levels for this time of year.\nOne large French meat importer told the BBC that he and his competitors were starting to look at alternative suppliers in Spain and Ireland. \nThe BBC has contacted the government for comment.\nNick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processor Association, said: \"Fundamentally, this is not a system that was designed for a 24/7, just-in-time supply chain. \n\"The export health certification process was designed for moving containers of frozen meat around the world where you have a bit of leeway on time. \n\"No matter how much better we get at filling in the forms, it's really not fit for purpose. This is going back to the dark ages in terms of a process really, in this digital age.\"\nHe added \"It's going to be a problem for quite a time until we move forward and hopefully get a better digital system in place and can make it work a bit better, but until then, we've got to put up with all this paperwork and lorries arriving in Ireland with box files full of paper.\"\nRizvan Khalid, a lamb exporter based in Shropshire, cannot afford to get the paperwork wrong. \nHis company, Euro Quality Lambs, exports 70% of its meat to the EU, including France, Germany, Belgium and Portugal. He says what was once a once well-oiled machine now has a spanner in it. \n\"What used to take us 15 minutes is now taking us three or four hours on average before we can get the paperwork completed for one particular load,\" he says.\n\"It's taking them [on the French side] up to six hours to go through the health certificates, to open up the lorry and check the goods.\n\"All of that is adding time and costs. It's now an extra day before our product gets into the markets of Paris.\"\nMeanwhile, some buyers in the EU are losing patience and are beginning to consider other options.\nFrancis Ochoa's meat company, Fory Viandes, is based in one of the world's biggest fresh produce markets - the Rungis market, south of Paris. \n\"The delays and extra costs mean me and my competitors in the market are obliged to start looking for other solutions,\" he says.\n\"One of the solutions unfortunately is to try produce from other countries, Spain for instance. Some of our competitors are ordering lambs from Ireland instead of the UK, so the consequences for UK meat and UK lambs could be disastrous.\"\nDown at the international freight checkpoint in Ashford, near the entrance to the Eurotunnel, customs consultant Steve Cocks gave a downbeat assessment. \n\"The temporary border post lorry park is full, roads are being closed off and lorries are being sent back to the Covid testing site to hold them there,\" he said.\n\"Last week wasn't much to write home about as it was very quiet, but volumes are building and it's just going to get worse. Exports are grinding to a halt and that will affect imports, but if you are a haulier. you don't want to get a lorry stuck on this side of the Channel.\"\nAfter decades of friction-free trade, there are bound to be teething problems. Indeed, the government predicted that there would be \"significant additional disruption\" as traders, officials and customers became accustomed to new procedures. \nHowever, some things cannot \"bed in\" and will become permanent features. HMRC estimates the additional cost to UK business of bog-standard customs declarations alone at \u00a37bn. \nWhen buyers and sellers want to trade, they will find a way, but significant additional cost and complexity is here to stay.

      "text": "The new school term began in Scotland this week - but many pupils and teachers did not return to the classroom. \nInstead, laptops, tablets and exercise books were opened on kitchen tables across the country as home-schooling began again in earnest. \nDay one was marred by technical difficulties as thousands of users logged on to Microsoft Teams after holidays. \nBut did it get any better?  We asked some parents about their experience of home-schooling during the latest coronavirus lockdown. \nDuring the first lockdown Donna Bruce, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, juggled a full-time job and working from home while looking after her two children, Kai, 10, and eight-year-old Quinn. \nShe didn't have enough devices for all three of them, and she had to occupy the children for seven hours a day while working at the same time. \nHer early Zoom meetings enjoyed guest appearances from half-naked children climbing kitchen cupboards to find snacks. \nThis time round, she feels schools and teachers were better prepared. \n\"Teachers had made videos talking to the children and reassuring them,\" she said. \n\"I feel there is less pressure this time on parents and children, but children still need supervised and their time still needs occupied to allow parents to work and that's when the issues come in.\"\n\"On day one, they finished all their assigned school work by 11:00 and I was working until 16:30,\" she added. \n\"I feel anxious and worry as the novelty wears off and my work gets busier, how I will cope.\n\"At the end of every day I question if I have done enough and try to remind myself it's not a race or a competition - if we all survive to tell this story in the future's history lesson then that's all that matters.\"\nKirsteen Roberts, from East Lothian, found the first lockdown stressful. \nHer son Finn is in S2, while daughters Layla and Summer are in P7 and P3 respectively. The primary school work was structured with teacher contact but the secondary work was \"patchy\". \nShe said the younger two were pretty motivated but the eldest was frustrated and didn't have enough to do. \n\"With school, plus keeping on top of Zooms for extra curricular activities, I felt a huge pressure,\" she said. \nKirsteen was disappointed to return to online learning.\n\"None of us were looking forward to it and I feared that no work would be posted on the first day,\" she said.  \n\"Thankfully I was proved wrong. The secondary school teachers have organised weekly class Google Meets this time around which is a big improvement. \n\"Everything went well technically and the first day went pretty smoothly - only two out of three of them ended up in tears after putting pressure on themselves. \n\"I feel we can get through it intact - as long as it really only is a few weeks this time. \n\"I think workwise the kids will get enough of what they need from the school without me having to find more on the BBC or websites like Twinkl, but it's still hard on them and they miss the classroom contact.\"\nResources to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown.\nFiona Keiller, from Perth and Kinross, is a single parent to Ross who is in P6. \nShe said there were \"good days and bad days\" during the first stint of home learning. She did not feel her son was getting enough to do and she was also working full-time from home.\nThis time around she was told Ross would have two live sessions per week via Microsoft Teams.\n\"My son struggles to get on with the tasks without my assistance, so he insists on trying to rope me into helping him, which is difficult when I am in meetings and trying to do my own work,\" Fiona said. \n\"I felt worse after the first day, I had forgotten just how stressful it is. Hopefully we will find our groove by week two, but I worry whether Teams is going to cope with the amount of traffic on it.\"\nEmily Black is a keyworker from Aberdeenshire, with a daughter in S1 and a son in P1. \nThe first time schools were closed, her daughter tried to complete tasks while her little brother tried to play with her. \n\"My son's behaviour became concerning and my daughter cried every day,\" she said. \nThis time round, their rural internet has proved a problem. \n\"My daughter was up and at her laptop at 08:45. She is used to using Teams for homework but when it decided to play up, I thought she was going to launch her laptop out of the window,\" she said. \n\"My son really appreciated the welcome video message from his teacher so was a lot more engaged after his teacher had told him to do his jobs and then he could have fun. \n\"It went a lot better than I expected. But it has also exposed that I'm not a teacher and I would struggle to keep this up longer-term, trying to help both of them - at some times simultaneously. But I don't know if it will be the same in a couple of weeks.\"\nMark Cummings from East Dunbartonshire has two daughters, one in P2 and one in kindergarten. Both attend an independent fee-paying school.\nHe was disappointed by the timing of this government's decision - just after the festive break - but he said his daughter's school has been \"excellent\". \n\"They are well organised and clear in what they are trying to do,\" he said. \n\"Our daughters are getting a full curriculum each day (two live lessons with teacher and classmates and four pre-recorded topic lessons). It is not comparable to the experience they get at school but is a great effort nonetheless.\"\nBut he is concerned about the long-term effects of home-learning.  \n\"Online learning is not adequate and will lead to greater disparity in learning between different types of pupils who attend different types of schools,\" he said."

During the first lockdown some stores were issued with fines for failing to adhere to regulations.\n\"Reputation does really matter to supermarket chains,\" he said.\n\"They definitely don't like it... when one of their supermarkets becomes known locally as somewhere that was regarded as falling below the standards that an environmental health officer would require.\"\nThe first minister said there was also the \"wish of the sector to do the right thing by their staff and their customers\".\n\"I think is more effective than financial penalties, which are there and have been applied to supermarkets,\" Mr Drakeford added."

      "text": "Police officers who were targeted by a pro-Trump mob have been speaking out about the \"medieval battle\" that unfolded on the steps of the Capitol and inside the halls of American democracy last week.\nPolice faced off against rioters equipped with clubs, shields, pitchforks, firearms, and metal poles stripped from seating set up for next week's inauguration.\nHere's what we've learned from their interviews with US media.\nMichael Fanone, a 40-year-old DC plainclothes narcotics detective who was told to wear his uniform that day, rushed to the West Terrace of the Capitol where he took turns holding back the crowd, and resting to rinse his face of the the chemical irritants that that crowd was spraying on police.\n\"We weren't battling 50 or 60 rioters in this tunnel,\" the MPD (Metropolitan Police Department of District of Columbia) veteran told the Washington Post. \"We were battling 15,000 people. It looked like a medieval battle scene.\"\nAfter he was grabbed by his helmet and dragged face-first down several steps, he said the crowd started stripping gear from his vest, including spare ammo, his radio and his badge - all while chanting \"USA!\".\n\"We got one! We got one!\" Mr Fanone said he heard people shout, with others chanting: \"Kill him with his own gun!\"\nSome members of the crowd protected him after he started yelling that he has children, the father of four told CNN. He sustained only minor injuries but later found out in hospital that he had suffered a mild heart attack during the brawl.\nMPD Officer Daniel Hodges, 32, had already been on shift for several hours before the rioting began.\n\"We were battling, you know, tooth and nail for our lives,\" he told ABC News. \nIn one viral video, Mr Hodges is seen pinned in a glass doorway between officers and the crowd, as rioters strip his gas mask from his face and beat him with his own police-issued baton. One rioter tried to gouge his eyes.\n\"That was one of the three times that day where I thought: Well, this might be it,\" said Mr Hodges. \"This might be the end for me.\"\nAs he choked on tear gas, he is seen on video gasping for air to call out for help. Enough police were eventually able to push through the melee to extract him.\n\"I had conspiracy theorists and everyone you could think of yelling at me, saying, 'Why are you doing this, you're the traitor,'\"  Mr Hodges told radio station WAMU. \n\"We're not the traitors. We're the ones who saved Congress that day, and we'll do it as many times as necessary.\"\nDespite fearing for his life, Mr Hodges says he decided not to use his gun on the crowd.\n\"I didn't want to be the guy who starts shooting, because I knew they had guns - we had been seizing guns all day,\" he told the Post. \nRobert Glover, the commander on scene for MPD, declared a riot at 13:50 local time, nearly two hours after Trump's speech at the White House where he instructed his followers to go to the Capitol.\nHe quickly told officers to retake the inauguration bleachers, to stop the crowd from raining down heavy objects on officers from above.\nMr Glover told the Post that some rioters may have been caught up in the moment, but others seemed to be moving in \"military formation\" as if they had prepared for the assault. He said that some appeared to be using hand signals to co-ordinate tactics.\nSeveral US military veterans, as well as off-duty police officers from Virginia, Maryland and Texas, have since been suspended or arrested for participating in the riot.\nMPD Officer Christina Laury, 32, was among the first city police officers to arrive on the scene. When she got to the Capitol, officers were already being brutally attacked by rioters attempting to storm the building.\n\"They had bear mace, which is literally used for bears. I got hit with it plenty of times that day and it just seals your eyes shut. You just would see officers going down trying to douse themselves with water, trying to open their eyes up so they can see again.\"\n\"The bravery and the heroism that I saw in these officers - the second they were able to open their eyes, they were back up front and they were just trying to stop these individuals from coming in.\"\nOne officer being lauded as a hero has yet to speak about his experience - Officer Eugene Goodman, a member of Congress' 2,100 member Capitol Police force.\nMr Goodman, an African American Iraq War veteran, was seen singlehandedly distracting a rampaging mob, giving lawmakers enough time to clear the chamber and get to safety.\nOn Thursday, a cross-party group of lawmakers introduced a bill calling for him to receive the Congressional Gold Medal for his effort to defend democracy.\nThe Capitol Police have been criticised over their response and preparation.\nSeveral top Capitol security officials, including the Capitol Police chief and the sergeants-at-arms for the House and Senate, resigned in the wake of the siege amid claims from lawmakers that they had not done enough to prepare for the mob.\nOn Friday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced General Russel Honor\u00e9 would be leading an immediate investigation of the Capitol's security infrastructure.\nVideo footage has also emerged showing an officer taking a selfie with a rioter inside the Capitol. Some officers reportedly gave directions to rioters telling them how to get to the offices of Democratic lawmakers. \nSeveral Capitol Police officers have been suspended for allegedly violating policies as the agency conducts an internal probe."

But tours in Germany and Spain, for instance, will now require extra visas for paid work, while those in France and The Netherlands will not.\nPopular European touring routes could now see them take on extra costs and paperwork. According to the Association of British Orchestras, truck drivers carrying stage equipment must now return to the UK after visiting two EU member states.\nA petition signed by more than 250,000 people - including Laura Marling, Biffy Clyro and Dua Lipa - is calling on the the government to \"negotiate a free cultural work permit\" that would allow \"bands, musicians, artists, TV and sports celebrities that tour the EU to perform shows and events and carnet exception for touring equipment\".\nThe government later responded to the petition, saying the EU \"turned down proposals\", while noting that \"there is scope to return to this in the future\".\nOn Thursday, Musicians' Union general secretary Horace Trubridge demanded greater support from Prime Minister Boris Johnson for UK artists hoping to tour in Europe again once it's safe to do so.\nA \"reciprocal agreement\" for EU artists arriving into the UK would be \"in the interests of the UK and EU\", he said.\n\"Our industry has been incredibly badly hit by the Covid-19 crisis and if our members are also restricted by additional costs and red tape on touring once things start to go back to normal, we will see a real downturn in what is a unique British success story: Music.\"\nMr Johnson vowed on Wednesday during Prime Minister's Questions to meet MPs to discuss the matter. \"I know that our friends in the EU will be wanting to go further to improve things for not just musicians, but business travellers of all kinds. There is a mutual benefit,\" he said.\nAn EU spokesperson told the BBC: \"The UK has chosen to no longer allow the free movement of EU citizens to the UK. It also refused to include a chapter on mobility in the agreement.\n\"These choices inevitably mean that travel between the EU and the UK - including for business purposes - will no longer be as easy as it was while the UK was a member state.\"\nHe added that the UK \"refused to include a commitment on visa-free short stays\", which could have meant people like musicians, sportspeople and journalists would not have needed individual visas.\n\"As a result, it is now up to each member state to determine if a visa is required for short-stay visits for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. This is fully in line with EU law.\"\nThe EU would not be drawn on whether it would re-open talks around music touring visas.\nThe government has previously said it \"pushed for a more ambitious agreement with the EU on the temporary movement of business travellers, which would have covered musicians and others, but our proposals were rejected by the EU\".\nOn Tuesday, it added that \"the door remains open should the EU change its mind\".\nThen on Wednesday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden blamed the EU for \"letting down music on both sides of the Channel - not us\".\nProf Catherine Barnard, deputy director of research organisation UK In A Changing Europe, told BBC News: \"The bottom line is that the EU did offer up to 90 days, and with the possibility of being paid.\n\"I suspect the UK probably said no because they have a very hard line on anything that may even look like free movement of persons, which of course the UK had committed itself to stopping.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Students",
      "text": "\"It's really scary. You don't know what you're going to face everyday,\" Lizzy tells Newsbeat. \nShe's a student nurse and is on placement at the moment. Like many others working in a hospital right now, she's finding it tough.  \nBut the difference for Lizzy and other student nurses and midwives is they've not been getting paid.\nThis means they don't have any insurance if they catch coronavirus either.\n\"There's a lot of anxiety and stress for students working unpaid placements right now. Covid is worse than it's ever been, especially with the new strain,\" Lizzy says.\n\"We should be paid, because without it we have no life insurance protection for death in service.\"\nLizzy is one of a number of students Newsbeat has spoken to, who thinks they need better protection while on placement. \nDuring the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 students could either opt out of hospital placements, or join the NHS under paid contracts. \nThis then meant they were covered by the The NHS and Social Care Coronavirus Life Assurance Scheme which was set up in recognition of the extra risk front line workers face during the crisis, with families offered a payment of \u00a360,000 if an NHS or social care worker dies from coronavirus, contracted at work.\nBut for students, paid contracts ended in September when pressure on the health service initially eased. \nYesterday the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) announced final year nursing students can be paid for placements again, but it'll be up to local governments to decide. The NMC also announced those in their first year can opt to move entirely to online or academic learning. \nBut some students Newsbeat has been talking to say this doesn't go far enough.\nA student midwife - who doesn't want to be named - has raised her concerns in an open letter she's shared on social media.\n\"I wrote to NHS Health Education England about the fact we aren't covered by the NHS coronavirus life insurance at the moment,\" she tells Newsbeat.\n\"Right now, the number of cases and deaths are higher than they've been during the whole pandemic.\n\"So for all students who are working on placements and putting themselves at risk, there should be absolute protection.\"\nShe didn't want to give her name because she's fearful of any impact it might have, but wanted to speak out to raise awareness of the situation.\n\"While this latest announcement by the NMC is good news, its still not enough and we will keep pushing for action.\n\"For me this isn't about the money. We are so proud to be part of the NHS and want to be working and doing what we can to help in the pandemic, but we all deserve cover while we are doing it.\"\nShe says she's yet to get a response to her letter.\nJames, who's a second year student nurse, says people like him have been at a \"massive risk.\"\n\"If anything was to happen, we'd be left without the protections a qualified nurse would get,\" he says.\n\"The universities are supporting us, but there are certain limitations to what they can provide, and we need the reassurance of knowing we are protected\"\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) told Newsbeat it was \"immensely grateful\" for the work of student nurses during the pandemic.\n\"While they are in clinical training, they should be an addition to the normal team and undertake clinical learning under supervision,\" \n\"Individuals who are not automatically eligible (for the Coronavirus Life Assurance scheme) can still be considered.\"\nThe DHSC says the Health and Social Care Secretary can look at individual cases when someone isn't automatically eligible.\nBut for Lizzy, she says the stress and anxiety is taking its toll, with this adding more pressure.\n\"It's so busy right now. We're doing long shifts and it's exhausting. At times it does feel quite overwhelming.\n\"Essentially we are putting our lives at risk with no backing or benefit\".\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "tags": "Media,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": " The Daily Telegraph must publish a correction over a \"significantly misleading\" column written by Toby Young, press regulator Ipso has ruled.\nThe July 2020 article claimed the common cold could provide \"natural immunity\" to Covid-19 and London was \"probably approaching herd immunity\".\nBut on Thursday Ipso found the paper had \"failed to take care not to publish inaccurate and misleading information\".\nIpso said the paper \"did not accept it has breached the [Editors] Code\".\nIt said the newspaper said that Young's comments on immunity referred to \"cross-reactive T-cells\" that work to combat the virus.\nHowever, the media watchdog sided with the complainant, James Whitehead, in its decision, who said that while these cells \"may lessen the impact of Covid-19\" after infection, they \"would not confer 'natural immunity'\"\nThe ruling added Young's statement \"misrepresented the nature of immunity\".\nIpso also found Young's suggestion that \"London is probably approaching herd immunity, even though only 17% tested positive [for antibodies] in the most recent seroprevalence survey\"  could be misleading.\nThe Telegraph referred to surveys listed in an article on Young's own Lockdown Sceptics website in its defence, but the Ipso committee judged these did not accurately reflect \"how herd immunity is reached and whether it exists in London\".\nThe ruling concluded that the paper had breached accuracy standards on a topic of \"public importance\", but deemed a correction an appropriate sanction, given the level of \"significant scientific uncertainty\" at the time of publication.\nYoung told the BBC: \"I think Ipso has been put in a difficult position because our scientific understanding of the virus is constantly evolving and there is a great deal about it that scientists still disagree about. \n\"While some of the things I wrote in that article would be contested by some scientists, they would be confirmed by others... Have we achieved herd immunity in London? I think that's an open question and the 'case' data is unreliable because of the well-documented shortcomings of the PCR test. \n\"I may have been over-emphatic in putting the anti-lockdown case, but it's not as if the advocates of a pro-lockdown position are any less emphatic. \n\"Don't forget the WHO initially estimated the global IFR [infection fatality rate] of Covid-19 at 3.4%. The consensus now is that it's less than 1% and almost certainly a lot less. Lots of journalists faithfully reported that alarmist figure. Why hasn't Ipso reprimanded them?\"\nLast week Young told BBC Newsnight that some of his claims from an article he wrote in June had been \"wrong\", where he had said a second spike of Covid-19 had \"refused to materialise\" and that one-metre rule is \"unnecessary\". \n At the start of the year, Young, an associate editor at The Spectator and general secretary of the Free Speech Union, installed an app that auto-deletes tweets more than a week old. \nHe said he did so to protect against \"politically-motivated offence archaeologists\" - a move unrelated to the Ipso ruling. \nReacting to criticism of his past comments on coronavirus from Neil O'Brien, Conservative MP for Harborough, Oadby and Wigston, after the deletion, Young then tweeted a defence of his stance against lockdowns. \n\"This is an important public debate to have,\" he wrote, \"both because it helps us assess the present government's management of the pandemic and because it will help us prepare better for the next one.\"\nThe UK entered a second national lockdown last week in a bid to control spiralling virus infection rates. On Wednesday, the UK saw its biggest daily death figure since the start of the pandemic, with 1,564 deaths.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,GDP,Economic growth,UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK economy shrank by 2.6% in November as England was placed in lockdown for a second time, official figures show. \nThe Office for National Statistics said it meant gross domestic product was 8.5% below its pre-pandemic peak.\nNovember's decline came after six consecutive months of growth.\nPubs and hairdressers were badly hit as the service sector suffered, the ONS said, but some manufacturing and construction activity improved.\nThe hit to the service sector - which accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy - meant it contracted by 3.4% in November, and is now 9.9% below the level of February 2020.\nSome economists said the November figure was better than expected, and it appeared many companies were better prepared for the second lockdown, with some sectors staying open for business and many firms having already put in place plans to expand online operations.\n\"Steps taken by businesses earlier in the year to Covid-proof their operations - combined with the time-limited nature of the restrictions, and schools remaining open - meant more companies were able to continue trading safely,\" said Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI employers' group.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures showed \"it's clear things will get harder before they get better and today's figures highlight the scale of the challenge we face\". \nBut he said the vaccine roll-out and economic support measures meant there were reasons to be hopeful. \"With this support, and the resilience and enterprise of the British people, we will get through this,\" he said.\nShadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the figures showed the UK has an economic \"mountain to climb\". \nSpeaking to the BBC, she said it would be a \"serious mistake\" if Mr Sunak waited until the Budget in March before providing more support and confidence for business.\nONS director for economic statistics Darren Morgan said: \"The economy took a hit from restrictions put in place to contain the pandemic during November, with pubs and hairdressers seeing the biggest impact.\"\nHowever, he said many firms adjusted to the new pandemic working conditions, such as by expanding click and collect and other online operations.\nHe added: \"Manufacturing and construction generally continued to operate, while schools also stayed open, meaning the impact on the economy was significantly smaller in November than during the first lockdown.\n\"Car manufacturing, bolstered by demand from abroad, housebuilding and infrastructure grew and are now all above their pre-pandemic levels.\" Construction activity grew by 1.9% during the month.\nGross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy.\nBut the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year.\nIf the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. That generally means more wealth and more new jobs.\nIf it is negative, the economy is shrinking.\nDespite the GDP figure being better than some analysts had forecast, there are still concerns that the UK could be heading back into recession. \nEconomists have warned the UK could see a double-dip recession if restrictions remain in place in the first three months of 2021.\nRory Macqueen, from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the November figures confirm a significant slowdown in the last quarter of 2020, \"despite November's lockdown in England clearly having a far smaller effect than the first\". \nJames Smith, research director of the Resolution Foundation, said there would be a lot of comment about whether these figures point to the UK heading for only its second-ever double-dip recession on record. \nBut, he said, the real \"story of the year will be a vaccine-driven bounce back in economic activity for sectors like hospitality and leisure\".\n\"The chancellor must do everything he can to support that recovery once public health restrictions ease,\" he added.\nAnalysts at Capital Economics also said there was cause for optimism, saying that the current third lockdown could have less impact than feared.\n\"The economy has built up a fair bit of immunity to lockdowns, as November's lockdown was much less painful for the economy than the first lockdown.\n\"As a result, the Covid-19 economic hole is smaller than we thought, the economy may get back to its pre-crisis crisis level a bit sooner and it makes us more confident that the Bank of England probably won't resort to negative interest rates.\"\nThe fall in the economy in November was still considerable, but the figures show businesses adapting to difficult conditions. The hit was a fraction of what occurred in the first lockdown last April, and was mainly confined to the service sector, with pubs and hairdressing for example in sharp decline.\nManufacturing and construction largely remained open, as did previously shut public services such as schools. By November car manufacturing and house building were back above the level of output before the pandemic.\nThe trade figures also showed a \u00a37bn increase in EU imports in the three months to November as traders stockpiled car parts, medicines and other goods ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period.\nThe renewed regional tiered restrictions in December, and more severe national lockdowns this month, still indicate a possible return to overall recession in this tough winter.\nBusiness groups continue to argue that extra support is required to support jobs and cash flow well before the Budget in March. But a more sustained lifting of restrictions as vaccines are rolled out should see growth return after the spring."

      "text": "Northern Ireland's statistics agency has recorded its highest weekly Covid-19 related registered deaths since the pandemic began.  \nNisra said 145 deaths were registered in the first week of 2021, although administrative delays over Christmas may have affected the number.  \nThat brings the agency's death toll to 1,976 by 8 January. \nThe figures come as the chief medical officers from NI and the Republic issued a joint stay-at-home plea.\nDr Michael McBride and Dr Tony Holohan said they were \"gravely concerned\" about the \"unsustainably high level of Covid-19 infection\" across the island of Ireland.\nConcern was raised in the Republic of Ireland this week as figures showed it has the world's highest number of confirmed new Covid-19 cases per million people.\nOn Friday evening, the Irish Department of Health reported 50 further deaths with Covid-19 and 3,498 new cases of the virus. More than half (54%) of those newly diagnosed are under the age of 45.\nNorthern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown, with ministers scheduled to review measures next week.\nHowever, health officials have warned that an extension of the restrictions could be required to reduce pressure on the health service.\nOf the 2,019 deaths recorded by Nisra by 8 January, 1,247 (62%) occurred in hospital, 622 (31%) in care homes, 12 (0.6%) in hospices and 138 (7%) at residential addresses or other locations.\nPeople aged 75 and over account for just over three-quarters of all Covid-19 related registered deaths (77.6%) between 19 March 2020 and 8 January 2021.  \nJust over a fifth (22.2%) of all Covid-19 related registered deaths have been of people with an address in the Belfast council area.  \nMeanwhile, the Department of Health reported 26 further Covid-related deaths on Friday.\nFive of these deaths did not occur in the past 24 hours. \nThe Department of Health bases its figures on a positive test result being recorded, whereas Nisra figures are based on mentions of the virus on death certificates, so people may or may not have been confirmed to have contracted the virus prior to death. \nA further 1,052 individuals have tested positive for Covid-19 and 63 patients are being treated in intensive care units, 47 of whom are on ventilators. \nThe chief medical officers warned the high infection rate was having a \"significant impact\" on the health of the population and the \"safe functioning\" of the healthcare systems.\nThey said the public should avoid all unnecessary journeys, including cross-border travel. \nPointing out that many of the patients admitted to hospital in January have been younger than 65, they warned coronavirus could affect anyone, \"regardless of age or underlying condition\".\n\"It highlights the need for us all to protect one another by staying at home,\" said the medical officers.\nNorthern Ireland's spike in infections has been put down to an easing of restrictions over Christmas. \nAsked if he regretted being part of the decision to ease restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann said the executive had tried to be balanced in its approach.\n\"I regret the pressures we see now in our hospitals, but let's remember it's caused by this virus, we have it in our power to bring it back under control and get us back to where we were in the summer,\" he told BBC News NI on Friday. \nMr Swann pleaded with people to follow the current restrictions.\n\"We're in the middle of a very tough six-week scenario, and how we come out of this will be a more graduated approach to make sure we get the benefits of what we've already done, and also the benefits of the vaccine.\""

The Met Office said East Anglia and parts of Kent and Sussex are most at risk of snow.\nSome 1-3 cm of snow may fall fairly widely over these areas, with 5-10 cm possible in places, mostly over parts of East Anglia and any higher ground. \nA snow and ice warning is in place for most of Scotland, north-west and north-east England, Yorkshire and Humber, the East Midlands and parts of the West Midlands. \nSnow is likely to fall to low levels over east Scotland and northern England.\nThe Met Office said 1-3 cm is possible at low levels in these areas but is more likely at higher elevations, where 5-10 cm of snow is possible above 200m - and even 20cm at the highest places. \nFog is also forecast for parts of the Midlands and the North, along with mist around Glasgow which may pose hazards for motorists.\nThe coronavirus vaccine rollout has been affected by the weather.\nOver-80s who were due to receive their jab at Newcastle's Centre for Life were told they could re-book rather than risk making a trip in the icy conditions.\nNewcastle Hospitals tweeted: \"There's enough vaccine for everyone, so don't worry about making a trip to Newcastle.\"\nAnd Leeds University has delayed the opening of its asymptomatic Covid-19 test centre.\nHeavy snowfall has already caused travel disruption across sections of northern England and Scotland.\nTemperatures were as low as -6C on Friday morning in parts of Yorkshire and Cumbria, with yellow warnings set to last through most of Friday.\nThere was a loss of gas supply to approximately 700 homes in the Hebden Bridge area after water got into the local gas network and froze.\nThe Met Office has published advice from the Department for Transport advising people to clear snow and ice from footpaths outside their homes, preferably in the morning.\n\"You can then cover the path with salt before nightfall to stop it refreezing overnight,\" the advice says.\nTemperatures in the Greater London area are expected to drop to 1C on Friday and parts of the South East could fall to -2C.\nIt comes after \"hazardous\" conditions on Thursday caused problems for the ambulance service in Yorkshire, which struggled to keep up with the high demand, while Covid vaccinations were also affected.\nMark Millins, of Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said the bad weather was having a \"severe impact\" on its operations and urged people to \"take extra care\" when out walking or driving.\nIn Scotland, heavy snow in some areas resulted in road closures.\nThe deepest snow on Thursday was in Bingley, West Yorkshire, and Strathallan in Perth, Scotland, both of which recorded 11cm."

Mr Sharp said he was \"not in favour of decriminalisation\".\nHe said other possible options for funding the BBC in the future could include a household tax like the one used in Germany, \"which amounts to the same amount of money\".\nHe added: \"So when we next get the chance to review the structure of this then it may be worth reassessing.\"\nAsked whether he believed the BBC's coverage of Brexit had been unbalanced, he replied: \"No, actually I don't.\n\"I believe there were some occasions when the Brexit representation was unbalanced.\n\"So if you ask me if I think Question Time seemed to have more Remainers than Brexiteers, the answer is yes, but the breadth of the coverage I thought was incredibly balanced, in a highly toxic environment that was extremely polarised.\"\nQuestion Time has said it has robust processes in place to ensure balance on its panels.\nMr Sharp said he was \"considered to be a Brexiteer\" and had donated around \u00a3400,000 to the Conservative Party over the past 20 years.\nHe said the biggest issue now facing the BBC is impartiality, and that \"trust in leadership and trust in processes\" must be rebuilt after high-profile equal pay cases with journalists such as Carrie Gracie and Samira Ahmed. \n\"Clearly some of the problems it's had recently are really rather terrible and reflect a culture that needs to be rebuilt, so everybody who cherishes the BBC and works at the BBC feels proud and happy to work there,\" he said. \"Then in my view that would produce a better output inevitably.\"\nMr Sharp also told the committee he would give his \u00a3160,000 salary as BBC chairman to charity. \nWhen asked \"what's in it for you?\" Mr Sharp, whose heritage is Jewish, said: \"We're all a product of our upbringing and I was very fortunate with the parents I have, my great grandparents came to this country escaping tyranny.\n\"I think I won the lottery in life to be British and if I can make a contribution, I couldn't be happier to.\n\"The BBC is part of the fabric of all our national identities, it offers education and enrichment and is also important for our position in the world...

      "tags": "Lockerbie",
      "text": "Scottish judges have rejected a third appeal on behalf of the Libyan man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing.\nThe family of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who died in 2012, argued that he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice.\nBut the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the verdict of the original trial, which took place at special Scottish court in the Netherlands in 2001.\nMegrahi is the only person to have been convicted over the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988.\nAll 259 passengers and crew on board the flight were killed, along with 11 people in Lockerbie who died when the wreckage fell onto their homes.\nLast month the US announced new charges against a Libyan man who is accused of making the bomb. \nAbu Agila Mohammad Masud has been charged with terrorism-related crimes, and prosecutors say they will seek his extradition to stand trial in the US.\nMegrahi was found guilty of playing a central role in the bombing in 2001 after the trial at Camp Zeist, and lost the first appeal against his conviction the following year.\nHe abandoned a second appeal shortly before he was released from prison in 2009 after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. He returned to Libya, where he died in 2012.\nHis family continued their efforts to ensure a further appeal against his conviction, and the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission referred his the case back to the courts last year.\nA written judgment rejecting the appeal was delivered by Scotland's most senior judge, Lord Carloway, the Lord Justice General.\nHe said they had rejected the argument that the trial court had come to a verdict that no reasonable court could have reached.\n\"On the evidence at trial, a reasonable jury, properly directed, would have been entitled to return a guilty verdict,\" the judgement says.\nThe five judges also rejected the second grounds of appeal, that the Crown failed to disclose material which would have created a real prospect of a different verdict.\nIn a statement issued by lawyer Aamer Anwar, the family said they were \"heartbroken\" by the decision and would now lodge an appeal with the UK Supreme Court.\nHe said Megrahi's son, Ali Al-Megrahi, maintained his father's innocence and was determined to clear his name.\n\"All the Megrahi family want for Scotland is peace and justice, but as Ali stated today their journey is not over.\n\"Libya has suffered enough, as has the family for the crime of Lockerbie. They remain determined to fight for justice,\" said Mr Anwar.\nDr Jim Swire, who lost his daughter Flora in the bombing, said he had believed the Scottish system would deliver \"truth and justice\" - but did not think it had done so.\n\"I very much regret that we have to see whether we can go elsewhere to look for those outcomes,\" he said.\nHowever Kara Weipz, whose brother Richard Monetti was killed in the atrocity, said she was \"quite pleased\" with the decision.\n\"We have always had confidence in the system that it would turn out this way,\" she said.\n\"I don't know how many more decisions can be made that say the conviction at trial was the correct decision.\n\"I don't know how many more judges can confirm what was decided at Camp Zeist.\"\nJustice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the Scottish government had always been clear that the courts were the only \"appropriate forum\" to determine Megrahi's guilt or innocence.\nHe said it did not comment or intervene in any criminal case and added that the investigation into the bombing remained ongoing.\nPolice Scotland's Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said his thoughts remained with the families of the victims.\nHe said the force would continue to work on its investigation along with the Crown Office, American law enforcement and other international partners.\nThat commitment was reiterated by Scotland's top prosecutor, Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC.\nThe appeal against Megrahi's conviction was heard by five judges at the High Court in Edinburgh in November.\nAdvocate depute Ronald Clancy, representing the Crown, said the original trial judges had been fully entitled to infer that Megrahi was involved in the bombing.\nHe said a number of factors suggested his involvement, including his use of a false passport.\nClaire Mitchell QC, representing the Megrahi family, argued that evidence in relation to his identification was of \"poor quality\".\nShe said the court had read into a mass of conflicting evidence a conclusion which was not justified.\nUS and British investigators indicted Megrahi in 1991 but he was not handed over by the Libyans until April 1999.\nMay 2000 - A special trial under Scots law starts on neutral ground at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands.\n31 January 2001 - Former Libyan intelligence officer Megrahi is found guilty of mass murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 27 years.\nMarch 2002 - Megrahi loses an appeal against his conviction.\nJune 2007 - The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) recommends that Megrahi is granted a second appeal against his conviction.\n18 August 2009 - Megrahi's move to drop his second appeal is accepted by judges at the High Court in Edinburgh.\n20 August 2009 - Megrahi, who has terminal prostate cancer, is released from prison on compassionate grounds. \nMay 2012 - Megrahi dies at his home in Tripoli, aged 60.\nJuly 2017 - Megrahi's family launch a new bid to appeal against his conviction.\nMarch 2020 - The Scottish Criminal Case Review Commission says Megrahi's conviction can be taken to a fresh appeal.\nAugust 2020 - The posthumous appeal is given permission to proceed.\nJanuary 2021 - Judges uphold the verdict of the trial and reject the appeal."

      "text": "Covid patients have been transferred to hospitals in Newcastle from over-stretched London intensive care units.\nA small number, fewer than five, have been moved hundreds of miles from the south east, the BBC has been told.\nHospitals with the largest critical care capacity have been asked to take patients from other areas to ease pressures.\nHowever, NHS England has denied that patients have been transferred to Newcastle from London.\nThe patient transfers were first reported by The Guardian.\nIt is not uncommon for patients to be transferred from one busy hospital to another within the region, but moving the sick from out of their areas is unusual.\nThe North of England Critical Care Network, which co-ordinates provision in the North East, north Cumbria and North Yorkshire, confirmed patients had been moved from other parts of England.\nIn statement, director Lesley Durham said: \"During this pandemic and at these times of unprecedented pressures, we have ensured equity of patient access to critical care though mutual aid between units in the form of critical care patient transfers. \n\"We are also working with our colleagues and networks further afield. \n\"Whilst not ideal, it is correct to ensure that every person, regardless of location, has access to a critical care bed if they require one.\"\nElsewhere, Northampton General Hospital - which is about 70 miles from London - has been receiving critical care patients from outside its area. \nA spokesman said: \"Some patients have been transferred to our critical care unit in recent weeks from other parts of the country, including London. \n\"We currently have one 'out-of-area' patient, but they are not from London.\"\nNHS England said in a statement: \"The NHS has tried and tested plans in place to manage significant pressure either from high Covid-19 infection rates and non-Covid winter demands and this has always included mutual aid practices whereby hospitals work together to manage admissions.\"\nIt added that no patients had been transferred from London to Newcastle, Birmingham, Northampton or Sheffield.\nAcross England in the week to 12 January, there were 32,202 patients in hospital with Covid-19, a rise of 5,735 on the previous week.\nIn the week up to 10 January there were\u00a0330,616 new cases. \nSharon Barbour - BBC Look North health correspondent\nHospitals across the North East are already seeing many more patients than the first wave of the pandemic, and the next few weeks are likely to be the toughest yet.\nBut right now some - like Newcastle - have room in intensive care and are being asked to take patients from critical care units in the south which have become overwhelmed and run out of room. \nNewcastle and Northumbria NHS trusts have already been taking in patients from across their own patch - most notably from Cumbria where there are not nearly enough intensive care beds for the soaring numbers of Covid patients. \nBut patient numbers are growing in the North East's hospitals too, and many are already struggling. \nThey expect next week will be the worst week they have experienced yet. \nTo prepare, elective work is being postponed, wards are being cleared to take in new patients, and intensive care units are being expanded. \nConcerns have been raised about seriously-ill patients travelling such long distances.\nDr Uwe Franke, intensive care lead at Middlesbrough's James Cook Hospital, said: \"The critical care networks work regionally and nationally and are trying to spread the workload about the country without pushing other units to their limits or out of the durability of their capacity.\n\"But there is a difficulty in this; we know that Covid patients are incredibly ill, they are dependent on breathing machines, they are dependent on other machines that need organ support. \n\"To transfer these people across the country is quite a challenge.\"\nDr Franke added that while hospitals in the North were keen to support colleagues across the country, some - like his own - were already reaching their limit.\nHis hospital currently has in excess of 200 Covid patients, with 32 of those in intensive care.\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Several EU countries are receiving significantly fewer doses of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine than expected, after the US firm slowed shipments.\nSix nations called the situation \"unacceptable\" and warned it \"decreases the credibility of the vaccination process\".\nSweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia urged the EU to apply pressure on Pfizer-BioNTech.\nPfizer said the reduced deliveries were a temporary issue.\nIn a statement on Friday, the drugmaker said shipments were being affected by changes to its manufacturing processes designed to boost production.\n\"Although this will temporarily impact shipments in late January to early February, it will provide a significant increase in doses available for patients in late February and March,\" Pfizer said.\nThe company said its production upgrades would also have a \"short-term impact\" on the delivery of vaccines to the UK.\nDespite this, the UK government said it still planned to hit its target of vaccinating all priority groups by mid-February - about 15 million people.\nThe vaccine from Pfizer is not the only candidate available in the UK, with the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca jab also currently being rolled out.\nThe EU is not wholly reliant on the Pfizer jab either, having approved a vaccine manufactured by US company Moderna for use. Still, the development is expected to slow the pace of vaccination programmes.\nThe German health ministry called Pfizer's announcement surprising and regrettable, noting that it had committed to binding delivery dates until mid-February.\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she had been assured by Pfizer's chief executive that all orders guaranteed for delivery in the first quarter of the year would arrive. \nLast week, Ms von der Leyen said Pfizer had agreed to supply the EU with 600 million doses this year, double its initial order.\nThe pledge may do little to soothe European governments battling to subdue a fast-spreading Covid-19 variant first detected in the UK.\nAbout a third of the 27 EU governments reported having \"insufficient\" vaccine doses at a meeting this week, Reuters reported, citing a participant.\nLithuania said it would now get only half as many Pfizer vaccine doses as promised until mid-February. \nBelgium said it expected to receive about half the planned doses in January. Canada is also affected, because its vaccine supplies come from a Pfizer factory in Belgium.\nNorway, which is not an EU member, said on Friday that Pfizer was temporarily reducing the number of vaccine doses delivered to the country as of next week. \nThe Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in a statement that it could supplement the loss using \"emergency stock\". \"The stock we now have will be able to compensate for a reduction in the planned deliveries for a few weeks ahead,\" it said.\nAs well as Pfizer-BioNTech, the European Commission has reached agreements with five other pharmaceutical companies to purchase hundreds of millions of vaccines, once they pass clinical trials:\nThe Commission concluded initial talks with another company, Novavax, for up to 200 million doses.\nElsewhere in the world, Turkey said it had vaccinated half a million people in two days with vaccines developed by China's Sinovac Biotech.\nThe figures suggest Turkey vaccinated more people on the first day of its roll-out than France did in almost three weeks.\nThe French government faced a storm of criticism after it emerged that only 500 people had been vaccinated in the first week of the roll-out, which began in late December.\nVaccination efforts have since stepped up, though, with 388,730 people receiving at least one dose so far, according to CovidTracker.\nIn the US, President-elect Joe Biden on Friday unveiled an ambitious plan to ramp up vaccinations against Covid-19 when he takes office on 20 January.\nMr Biden said his administration would set up new mass vaccination centres and hire extra health workers to achieve his target of inoculating 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in office.\nThe incoming president made the announcement as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a stark warning about the spread of a highly transmissible coronavirus variant in the US.\nIndia, meanwhile, launched the world's largest vaccination campaign on Saturday.\nEfforts are under way to inoculate 1.3 billion people against the disease, starting with healthcare and frontline workers. Two vaccines - Covishield (the local name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine) and Covaxin - are being used in India."

      "tags": "Gaming,Companies,Fortnite,Google,Apps,Apple,Android",
      "text": "Epic Games, the studio behind the hit game Fortnite, has started legal action against Apple and Google in the UK.\nBoth Apple and Google removed Fortnite from their smartphone app stores in a row over the cut of sales they take from developers.\nEpic Games claims the two tech giants' rules are in violation of UK competition laws.\nBut both companies say Epic Games broke their terms and conditions by trying to bypass their payment systems.\nApple said Epic Games' action had been \"reckless\".\nWhen people buy an app, subscription or in-app item on Apple's App Store or the Google Play store, the tech giants take a cut of the fee.\nTypically they take a 30% cut, although in some cases the rate is lower.\nFor this reason, some companies charge more for subscriptions when people buy directly in the app instead of on their website, while others do not sell subscriptions in-app at all. Companies are also banned from telling app users a cheaper deal is available. \nEpic Games has previously said it thinks a 30% cut is too much, given the amount of money and effort it invests in developing its games.\nIn August 2020, the company bypassed the Apple and Google payment systems to let Fortnite players buy virtual currency at a lower price, direct from Epic.\nBoth app stores then removed Fortnite from their services, and Apple terminated Epic Games' developer account.\nIn documents submitted to the UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CTA), Epic Games alleges that Apple and Google have abused their dominance over their smartphone operating systems.\nWhile Apple produces iOS exclusively for its iPhones, Google's Android software is open-source so in theory any smartphone-maker can use it.\nHowever, Google also produces a suite of proprietary tools including Maps, Search and the Play Store, which power some of the most popular services on smartphones. Phone-makers must enter an agreement with Google to use them on their devices.\nEpic Games alleges that both companies abuse their power by:\nEpic Games is not seeking a financial payout but instead wants the court to order Apple and Google to:\nIn a statement, Epic Games said: \"We believe that this is an important argument to make on behalf of consumers and developers in the UK and around the world who are impacted by Apple and Google's misuse of market power.\"\nIt has taken similar legal action in the US and Australia. \nOn Thursday, 21 January, the CTA will decide whether Epic Games can include US-based divisions of Apple and Google in its legal action.\nApple said its priority was to create a \"safe and trusted place to download software\" and that it applied its rules equally to all developers.\n\"Epic enabled a feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines,\" it said in a statement.\n\"Their reckless behaviour made pawns of customers, and we look forward to making this clear to courts in the UK.\"\nGoogle said: \"The open Android ecosystem lets developers distribute apps through multiple app stores. For game developers who choose to use the Play Store, we have consistent policies that are fair to developers and keep the store safe for users.\"\nIt said it welcomed the opportunity to \"continue discussions\" with Epic Games about bringing Fortnite back to the Google Play store."

      "tags": "Music",
      "text": "Sylvain Sylvain, guitarist with trailblazing 1970s rock band New York Dolls, has died at the age of 69.\nOne of the group's founding members, his visceral riffs bridged the divide between punk and glam, and helped kick-start the punk and new wave movements.\n\"As most of you know, Sylvain battled cancer for the past two and 1/2 years,\" his wife, Wanda O'Kelley Mizrahi, wrote in a statement on his Facebook page.\n\"Though he fought it valiantly, yesterday he passed away.\"\nShe added: \"While we grieve his loss, we know that he is finally at peace and out of pain. Please crank up his music, light a candle, say a prayer and let's send this beautiful doll on his way.\"\nSylvain's death leaves only one surviving member of the New York Dolls' original line-up from their 1973 debut album, frontman David Johansen. The singer posted his own tribute on Instagram.\n\"My best friend for so many years, I can still remember the first time I saw him bop into the rehearsal space/bicycle shop with his carpetbag and guitar straight from the plane after having been deported from Amsterdam, I instantly loved him,\" he wrote.\n\"I'm gonna miss you old pal. I'll keep the home fires burning.\"\nBorn Sylvain Mizrahi in Cairo, Egypt, on Valentine's Day 1951, the musician lived in France as a child before moving to New York with his family. \nAfter playing in several bands as a teenager, he co-founded the New York Dolls in 1971, taking the name from a doll repair shop called the New York Doll Hospital (Sylvain had worked across the street before becoming a musician).\nLike the punk movement they helped inspire, the band wanted to shake up the self-indulgent state of 70s rock.\n\"The reason why the Dolls got together was because of the boredom with the norm of the day, which was like the stadium-rock era,\" Sylvain told Brooklyn Vegan in 2006. \"The 20-minute drum solos, songs that were a big operetta. They were sort of boring, they'd lost their sex appeal.\"\nThe Dolls cut through with urgent, punchy songs about sex, drugs, alienation and dysfunction. \nThe band's provocative and vulgar live shows gained them a huge following in New York, but many record labels were reluctant to sign them. That situation not helped by their androgynous look - shocking at the time - with their wardrobe sourced from cheap women's clothing stores on New York's Lower East Side.\nLate in 1972, tragedy struck when, during a tour of England, Dolls drummer Billy Murcia died in a drug-related accident. He was replaced by Jerry Nolan, after which the Dolls finally secured a contract with Mercury Records. \nTheir debut album, simply called New York Dolls, stalled at number 113 in the US chart but is now regarded as a classic, full of sleazy, raucous anthems like Personality Crisis and Trash.\nRolling Stone magazine recently named it one of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, writing: \"Glammed-out punkers the New York Dolls snatched riffs from Chuck Berry and Fats Domino and fattened them with loads of attitude and reverb. \n\"It's hard to imagine the Ramones or the Replacements or a thousand other trash-junky bands without them.\"\nHowever, the band's lack of commercial success saw them dropped after two albums and, despite hiring Sex Pistols guru Malcolm McLaren as a manager, eventually fell apart.\nOutside the Dolls, Sylvain toured and recorded with several bands and led various solo projects as his former band's reputation grew.\nArtists from the Sex Pistols to Guns N' Roses cited them as an influence, and Morrissey was famously president of their UK fan club before forming The Smiths. In 2004, the singer reunited his idols for a show at London's Meltdown Festival, adding an unexpected second act to their career.\nOver the subsequent decade, Sylvain and Johansen, the only remaining members, released three well-received albums.\nIn 2019, Sylvain announced his cancer diagnosis, and a GoFundMe was set up to pay his medical bills, raising $79,500 (\u00a358,000).\nGuitarist Lenny Kaye, best known for playing with Patti Smith, paid tribute to Sylvain's \"heart, belief, and the way you whacked that E chord\". \nKaye wrote on Facebook: \"Syl loved rock and roll.\n\"His onstage joy, his radiant smile as he chopped at his guitar, revealed the sense of wonder he must have felt at the age of 10, emigrating from his native Cairo with his family in 1961, the ship pulling into New York Harbor and seeing the Statue of Liberty for the first time.\n\"His role in the band was as lynchpin, keeping the revolving satellites of his bandmates in precision.\n\"Though he tried valiantly to keep the band going, in the end the Dolls' moral fable overwhelmed them, not before seeding an influence that would engender many rock generations yet to come.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

They've been doing a great job during the pandemic and it's reassuring to have the vaccine from someone you know.\"\nSteffan John, the pharmacist who administered the vaccine to Rosie, said the staff are \"really pleased to do their bit for the community\".\nPharmacist Llyr Hughes, who runs four pharmacies, including Fferyllwyr H L Taylor Pharmacy, said \"vaccinating at scale\" was the \"only way out of the pandemic\".\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Hughes said he expected the rollout to happen \"very quickly across all community pharmacies in Wales\".\n\"I don't forsee any big problems,\" he said.\n\"Community pharmacists have a wealth of experience in delivering flu vaccinations.\n\"We will tailor our work model to accommodate for this, as we did for the flu vaccine.\"\nMr Hughes said his pharmacy will have vaccinated in the region of more than 100 people by Saturday afternoon.\nHe added: \"If we can deliver locally we can provide easier access to older patients.\"\nHe explained local patients would be contacted about an appointment for the vaccine at the pharmacy.\nMr John said that the vaccine comes in vials of ten doses which means it's \"important to vaccinate that many people at a time and not to waste any\".\nHowever, Mr Drakeford told Friday's Welsh Government press briefing that not all pharmacy premises would be suitable to deliver the Covid vaccines.\nHe said some community pharmacists could be asked to administer vaccinations at mass vaccination centres instead, in cases where spaces for vaccinations are small at pharmacies with high volumes of people.\nWales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the rollout was still in the \"early stages\" of the \"largest vaccination programme Wales has ever seen\".\n\"People can be expected to be asked to attend either a mass or community centre, hospital, GP practice, pharmacy or mobile unit,\" he added.\nMr Gething said a mix of vaccination sites and centres were chosen so \"everyone across the country has equal access to a vaccination\".\nHe added that people will be notified for an appointment, and before that they should not call GPs or health services to request a vaccine and \"add undue pressure\" to their workloads.\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said Wales' vaccination programme was \"improving far, far too slowly\".\n\"As important as it is that we have one pharmacy doing it, what's happening in all the others?\"\nPaul Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said it was clear Wales was \"lagging behind\" the rest of the UK on delivering the vaccinations.\n\"It's certainly not happening quickly enough, we need to see the Welsh Government stepping up to the plate,\" he said.\nThe Welsh Government has said more pharmacists and other primary care services, such as dentists and opticians - are being invited to help with the rollout, subject to vaccine supply."

      "text": "One of two coronavirus variants first detected in Brazil has been found in the UK, says a leading scientist advising the government.\nBut the version discovered is not the \"variant of concern\", Prof Wendy Barclay clarified.\nThe \"variant of concern\" from Brazil, detected in travellers to Japan, is thought to be more infectious. \nIt led to travellers from South America and Portugal being banned from entering the UK on Friday. \nProf Wendy Barclay, who is heading a newly-launched project to study the effects of emerging coronavirus mutations called the G2P-UK National Virology Consortium, said: \"There are two different types of Brazilian variants and one of them has been detected and one of them has not.\"\nProf Barclay, who also sits on Nervtag, a committee which advises government on new and emerging respiratory virus threats, said the variant was \"probably introduced some time ago\" and it \"will be being traced very carefully\".\nShe added: \"The new Brazilian variant of concern, that was picked up in travellers going to Japan, has not been detected in the UK.\n\"Other variants that may have originated from Brazil have been previously found.\"\nThe body which collects and analyses the genomes of virus samples - Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (Cog-UK) - said this variant seen in the UK contained one of the mutations found in the Brazilian \"variant of concern\".\nThe mutation, also found in the South African variant, has been linked to a reduced antibody response meaning our bodies might be less able to fight it off. \nCog-UK said this alone was not enough to qualify it as a \"variant of concern\", thought it acknowledged \"no internationally agreed definition of a variant of concern has yet been agreed\".\nIn other variants of concern, the mutation sits alongside a \"constellation\" of others which together amount to a high chance of making the virus more transmissible. \nIt comes as a further 1,248 people with coronavirus have died in the UK.\nThe latest government figures on Thursday also showed another 48,682 new cases had been reported.\nMeanwhile, the latest estimate for the reproduction (R) number in the UK - which represents the average number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to - is between 1.2 and 1.3.\nLast week it was estimated at between 1 and 1.4 by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. \nWhen the figure is above 1, the number of cases increases exponentially. \nDespite other variants entering the country since, the Kent variant remains dominant in the UK and is believed to be 30-50% more infectious than the previous form of the virus.\nViruses acquire random changes to their genes constantly as they replicate.\nMany are neutral or even hurt the virus's ability to spread, but those that give it an advantage will become more common.\nMutations are being detected now because enough time has passed for those random changes to take hold.\nEven though there is no evidence any of these mutations make the virus more deadly, a virus that infects more people is likely to have a higher death toll. \nWhen the virus gets better at sticking onto and breaking into human cells, in theory someone exposed to the same dose is more likely to become ill.\nThe use of masks and personal protective equipment, social distancing and hand washing remain the best defences against the virus's spread. \nDowning Street said current evidence did not suggest the concerning Brazilian variant affected vaccines or treatment. \nMr Shapps described the travel ban, which came into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday, as a \"precautionary\" measure. \nIt covers people who have travelled from or through, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela in the last 10 days.\nThe ban also applies to Portugal - because of its strong links to Brazil - and the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde off the coast of west Africa, as well as Panama in central America.\nBritish and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights are still allowed to return - but must isolate for 10 days. \nAlso exempt are hauliers who are travelling from Portugal to transport essential goods.\nDr Mike Tildesley, an epidemiologist who is part of the government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, said the travel ban should minimise the risk from a \"more transmissible\" variant.\n\"We always have this issue with travel bans, of course, that we're always a little bit behind the curve,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\"My understanding is that there haven't really been any flights coming from Brazil for about the past week, so hopefully the immediate travel ban should really minimise the risk.\"\nDowning Street said it acted \"as quickly as possible\" to impose the travel ban because the concerning Brazilian variant \"could pose a significant risk to the UK\". \nHowever, Portugal's government has described the ban as \"absurd\" and illogical\". \nThe country's minister of foreign affairs Augusto Santos Silva said he had requested a conversation with his British counterpart after the \"sudden and unexpected\" suspension of flights. \nHe added Portugal was already restricting flights from Brazil and there was \"no evidence\" the new variant existed in his country.

      "text": "President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled a $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) stimulus plan for the coronavirus-sapped US economy before he takes office next week.\nIf passed by Congress, it would include $1tn for households, with direct payments of $1,400 to all Americans.\nThe relief proposal includes $415bn to fight the virus and $440bn for small businesses.\nMr Biden, a Democrat, has promised to beat the pandemic that has killed more than 385,000 people in the US.\nHe campaigned last year vowing to do a better job handling the virus than outgoing President Donald Trump, a Republican.\nThe direct payments of $1,400 would come on top of $600 payments provided in a relief bill enacted last month. \nMr Biden's proposal comes as a winter surge of the coronavirus breaks records. \nEach day brings well over 200,000 new cases in the US and the daily death toll sometimes tops 4,000. \nIn a primetime speech on Thursday night from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, he said: \"A crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight and there's no time to waste.\"\n\"The very health of our nation is at stake,\" he added. \"We have to act and we have to act now.\"\nThe incoming president said: \"There will be stumbles, but I will always be honest with you about both the progress we're making and what setbacks we meet.\"\nMr Biden wants to pump $20bn into vaccinating Americans, including setting up mass vaccination hubs and dispatching mobile units to remote areas.\nTwo effective vaccines were delivered under the Trump administration, but health officials say the rollout needs to speed up.  \n\"The vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far,\" said Mr Biden. His administration aims to deliver 100 million jabs in 100 days.\nSo far, about 11 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \nHis plan also calls for $50bn to expand testing and $130bn to help most schools reopen by the spring.\nThe plan would fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers for contact tracing.\nBy BBC Reality Check\nUS officials have acknowledged that the vaccination programme has not been working as smoothly as planned, and a goal to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of 2020 was not met.  \n\"We know that it should be better, and we're working hard to make it better,\" said Moncef Slaoui, who leads the government's vaccine rollout plan, at the end of December.\nPresident Trump has deflected attention onto the states to deliver the jabs - telling them to \"get moving\" - but there has also been criticism of the level of government support given to local health authorities.\nAnd there have been issues around getting sufficient supplies to vaccinations centres, as well as co-ordination and preparedness at the state level.\nThere are wide variations in vaccination rates: South Dakota has administered more than 6,000 doses per 100,000 people, and Alabama fewer than 2,000.\nWhen you look at vaccine doses per head in the countries doing the most vaccinations, the US is currently fourth. \nWith nearly 11 million people unemployed across the country, supplemental jobless benefits would increase to $400 a week from $300 a week now.\nThey would also be extended until September, along with a moratorium on evictions and home repossessions.\nThe proposal would bring payouts for families to the $2,000 figure that both Mr Biden and Mr Trump called for.\nThe president-elect will also call on Congress to double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour - a Democratic priority that predates the pandemic.\nRepublicans are likely to object to piling up trillions more in debt that the US has already incurred to tackle the pandemic, and the incoming president acknowledged his plan \"does not come cheaply\".\nBut he will be helped by his fellow Democrats controlling both chambers of Congress, if only by narrow margins.\nThe beginning of Mr Biden's term, however, will take place against the backdrop of a US Senate impeachment trial for his predecessor.\nIt is unclear how quickly the Senate will proceed - or whether it will vote to convict President Trump - but the drama is expected to prove a distraction from the Biden agenda."

They could be used to see whether particular groups of patients, such as those with low antibody levels, could benefit.\nInternational trials are also testing if plasma helps people when it's used much earlier in the disease, before people get to hospital."

known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the drop showed the \"very real\" effect of lockdown restrictions imposed on 26 December, but she warned there was still \"no room for complacency\".\nShe said she still believed there needed to be an \"two-island approach\" to travel restrictions, including discussions with the British and Irish governments as a \"matter of urgency\".\nMrs Foster said Stormont ministers had also expressed frustration at the executive meeting over a lack of data-sharing from authorities in the Republic of Ireland, and called for it to be escalated.\nPSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said 40 penalty notices a day are being handed out to those who breach the Covid-19 regulations.\nHe told the press briefing that if people continued flouting rules, they could expect \"firm and swift enforcement\".\n\"We won't turn a blind eye when people break the rules.\"\nOn Thursday, 16 more deaths related to Covid-19 were reported by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 1,533. \nThere have been 973 new cases diagnosed in the past 24 hours, while 58 Covid-19 patients are being treated in ICUs across Northern Ireland, of which 44 are on ventilators. \nMrs Foster said she found it \"incredible and frankly unbelievable\" that some people were still holding house parties and gatherings, despite the pandemic rates and the lockdown. \nOn Wednesday, health officials warned that levels of the new, more transmissible variant of the virus are rising.\nMr Swann said that meant more \"difficult decisions\" on lockdown restrictions could be required.\nNorthern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19.\nThe executive is due to review the current restrictions on 21 January.\nThe first and deputy first ministers said they would take evidence from health officials before deciding whether an extension of the lockdown would be required.\nMinisters have also expressed concerns about some larger retailers \"gaming\" the regulations and keeping open non-essential parts of their businesses.\nA meeting between the first and deputy first ministers and representatives of the retail sector is due to happen on Friday afternoon.\nElsewhere, the Chief Medical Officer has confirmed that unpaid carers looking after Clinically Extremely Vulnerable individuals should receive the first dose of their vaccine when phase two of the vaccination programme begins next month.\nDr Michael McBride told Stormont's Health Committee they are provided for on a list of prioritisation provided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which decides the order of vaccination delivery.\nMr Swann was asked if his department was \"putting all its eggs in the vaccine basket\".\nHe said it was \"not the entirety of the answer\", adding: \"It will take time for the benefits of it to bed in.\n\"And while it is doing it, we still have to follow those restrictions that are in place.\n\"We may actually have to introduce more.\"\nOn Thursday afternoon the department tweeted that 121,711 vaccines have been administered in Northern Ireland.\nMrs Foster said that by end of this month, it is hoped all care home residents, health staff and those aged over 80 in Northern Ireland will have received their first vaccination.\nShe said that would be an \"incredible achievement\" and make Northern Ireland one of the top-performing countries in rolling out its vaccination programme. \nMeanwhile, the chairman of the Police Federation for NI (PFNI) has said officers need more powers to enforce Covid-19 regulations.\nAt present officers can only issue guidance and advice on the public health regulations.\nPFNI chairman Mark Lindsay said that puts officers in a \"difficult position\".\nThe federation represents thousands of rank and file PSNI officers.\n\"I think we are well past the stage where police officers are the people that should be giving advice around the guidance,\" Mr Lindsay told BBC Radio Foyle."

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "The UK's epidemic is still officially estimated to be growing, according to the latest R number, but data suggests new cases are beginning to fall.\nThe R number - which takes into account cases, hospitalisations and deaths - is estimated to be between 1.2 and 1.3, compared with 1 and 1.4 last week.\nThis suggests the total number of people with the virus is still rising across the UK.\nBut in London, where tight restrictions came in earlier, the R number is lower.\nIn the capital, the estimate - based on data up until 11 January - is between 0.9 and 1.2, compared with 1.1 and 1.4 the previous week.\nIt comes as a further 1,280 people with coronavirus have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total to 87,291.\nThe latest government figures on Friday also showed another 55,761 new cases had been reported.\nMeanwhile, more than three million people in the UK have now received the first dose of a vaccine - latest figures show the number at 3,234,946.\nAlthough the number of people sick with coronavirus is growing in the UK, data from various sources suggests new infections are declining. \nThis provides early signs that lockdown restrictions may be taking effect.\nThe government's scientific advisory group Sage, which calculates the R number, said areas that have been under tougher restrictions for a longer period of time - including east of England, London, and the south east - are showing \"a slight decline in the number of people infected\".\nHowever, they warned that regions such as north-west and south-west England continue to see infections rise, where the spread of the new UK variant may be playing a role.\nThe R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. In theory, it describes the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus onto, on average.\nIn reality, though, the government's estimate of R gives a wider view of the epidemic's general trend since it also looks at what is happening in hospitals.\nCases, hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 have been alarmingly high since the beginning of the year and the latest estimate of the R number indicates that the pandemic is continuing to grow.\nBut because of the way the data to estimate R is collected - it reflects the situation a week ago. More up to date indicators suggest that there's a slight decline in infections in the east of England, London, and the South East.\nThese areas have had the highest prevalence and therefore the toughest restrictions the longest but infections are continuing to rise in the North West and South West probably because of the spread of the new variant of the virus. \nDespite this there's some relief at these figures among the government's scientific advisors.  They were not sure whether the current restrictions would be enough to prevent the more contagious variant getting out of control. Now they expect Covid-related deaths to level off in a week or so and then decline as the benefits of the vaccine programme begin to take effect.\nCases should also begin to decrease in the coming weeks. But all this depends on people continuing to observe the government's social distancing guidelines - and come into contact with others only if it is essential.\nProf Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, said coronavirus deaths were likely to peak in the next week to 10 days.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's The World At One that the lockdown measures were having an impact, with the peak in infections having passed \"a good few days ago\" which would lead to a reduction in the numbers dying from the disease.\n\"They are likely to level off in a week - 10 days maybe - at a peak which is probably going to be bigger than the first wave peak of 1,000-a-day, but then should decline due the reductions in cases that we are seeing and, of course, the vaccine programme.\"\nData from the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app gives its own estimate of 0.9 for the virus's R or reproduction number. This is based on cases alone, rather than a wider number of data sources included in the official estimate. \nWhile this leaves out the fact that hospitals are still filling up, looking at cases on their own allows assessment of whether lockdown restrictions are working.\nBut the large number of infections recorded at the end of December and the beginning of January means, despite receding cases, hospitalisations and deaths will inevitably continue to rise for some time. \nMeanwhile, a ban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde entering the UK came into force on Friday as a result of a new, potentially more infectious strain linked to Brazil. \nProf Wendy Barclay, a scientist at Imperial College London advising the government, said this \"variant of concern\" had not been detected in the UK but another variant from Brazil was already in circulation.\nIt is not clear whether this second strain is more contagious or not.

      "tags": "Mark Rutte,Netherlands,Fraud",
      "text": "The Dutch government has stepped down after thousands of families were wrongly accused of child welfare fraud and told to pay money back.\nFamilies suffered an \"unparalleled wrong\", MPs decided, with tax officials, politicians, judges and civil servants leaving them powerless.\nMany of those affected were from an immigrant background and hundreds were plunged into financial difficulty.\nPM Mark Rutte submitted the cabinet's resignation to the king.\n\"Innocent people have been criminalised and their lives ruined,\" he then told reporters, adding that responsibility for what had gone wrong lay with the cabinet. \"The buck stops here.\"\nThe \"unanimous\" decision, taken at a cabinet meeting in The Hague, comes at a key moment in the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe Netherlands has gone into lockdown and ministers have been considering stiffer measures to halt the spread of infection. \nThe government will stay on in a caretaker role to tackle the pandemic until parliamentary elections in March but Economics Minister Eric Wiebes has quit with immediate effect for his role in the scandal. Asked whether the cabinet's resignation was merely symbolic, Mr Rutte was adamant that it was not.\nThis is not the first time a Dutch government has resigned en masse in a gesture of collective responsibility. In 2002, the cabinet stood down after a report criticised ministers and the military for failing to prevent the massacre of Muslims at Srebrenica during the Bosnian war seven years earlier.\nParents were branded fraudsters over minor errors such as missing signatures on paperwork, and erroneously forced to pay back tens of thousands of euros given by the government to offset the cost of childcare, with no means of redress. They were, as one junior minister who resigned in connection with the scandal put it, \"steamrolled\" by the system. \nFamilies were left in a state of ruin, by a state apparatus that became \"the enemy of the people\". \nRelationships disintegrated under the pressure, homes were lost, mothers have spoken tearfully of the financial and psychological anguish they suffered after being targeted by tax officials. \nLast year the tax office admitted that 11,000 people were subjected to extra scrutiny simply because they had dual nationality. This confession has reinforced the widely held belief among many ethnic minorities in the Netherlands that discrimination against them is institutionalised and perpetuated by those in power. \nBut while being seen as the responsible, honourable response - sacrificing power in an admission of government failure - the mass resignation could be interpreted as an act of self-preservation by the Rutte government that avoids the prospect of losing a no-confidence vote by MPs next week. \nRead Anna's report on Covid vaccinations in the Netherlands: Shocked to be Europe's vaccination stragglers\nThe scandal began in 2012 and the number of parents involved could be as high as 26,000. Some openly called for the government to step down, saying they had lost faith in the ability of the cabinet to clean up the system.\nOne mother faced demands to pay tax authorities around \u20ac48,000 (\u00a342,000). She tried to explain to the authorities that mistakes had been made but officials then started withholding not just childcare allowances but other benefits too. \nHer rent went into arrears and energy companies refused to provide a regular supply. Eventually she lost her job and could not find another as she was seen as a fraudster. Her relationship with her child broke down as the pressure took its toll.\n\"Rutte says he thinks it's terrible, but he's not the one who had to pay up... This shouldn't happen in the Netherlands - I've been labelled a fraudster,\" another mother, Nazan Aydin, told NOS.\nMr Rutte's liberal VVD party is performing well in the opinion polls, so the 17 March election could see another Rutte-led administration. He has already led three governments since 2010.\nAlthough he initially opposed the cabinet's resignation, it was seen as inevitable once the opposition Labour leader Lodewijk Asscher resigned on Thursday in response to the scandal. Mr Asscher was social affairs minister under the previous Rutte coalition government.\nMr Rutte heads a four-party centre-right-liberal coalition and his party leads the latest opinion polls, ahead of far-right leader Geert Wilders.\nHowever, victims of the childcare allowance scandal who had to repay large sums paid out in benefit have this week filed a formal complaint against several current and former ministers.\nCompensation to the tune of at least \u20ac30,000 (\u00a326,000) each is to be paid out to parents who were wrongly accused, but many have argued it is not enough.\nAhead of the government's decision to step down, Sigrid Kaag, the leader of the liberal D66 party said it was \"important to be politically accountable and to take responsibility for the content of the report and for the injustice done to the parents\".\nState Secretary for Finance Alexandra van Huffelen said children caught up in the fraud scandal should also be looked after so they could \"soon move on\"."

They will now pay out on many, but not all, policies.\nHuw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: \"All valid claims will be settled as soon as possible and in many cases the process of settling claims has begun.\n\"We recognise this has been a particularly difficult time for many small businesses and naturally regret the Covid-19 restrictions have led to disputes with some customers.\"\nIn the lockdown of last spring, many small businesses made claims through business interruption insurance policies for loss of earnings when they had to close.\nBut many insurers refused to pay, arguing only the most specialist policies had cover for such unprecedented restrictions.\nIt was agreed that a selection of policy wordings should be tested in court, setting the parameters for what would be considered a valid claim.\nThe ruling provides guidance for a wider pool of 700 policies, potentially affecting 370,000 small businesses - although only some of these will end up with payouts.\nGiving the court's ruling, Lord Hamblen said the court accepted the arguments from representatives of policyholders and dismissed appeals from insurers against an earlier judgement finding in policyholders' favour.\nThe complex ruling covered issues such as disease clauses, whether business were denied access to the properties, and the timing of lost earnings.\nJames Ollerenshaw's hair salon was one of those businesses unable to operate during the first national lockdown.\nThe business - The Drawing Room in London's Spitalfields - paid an annual premium of \u00a31,200 for business interruption insurance, and disease cover came as part of it.\nMr Ollerenshaw said the Supreme Court's decision would not directly affect his policy, but would decide the principles on claims such as his - and were vital for the business.\n\"A payout would cover the major costs, which is the rent. We have debt sitting there,\" he said.\nHe said he was delighted with the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\"The insurance industry needs to face up to the fact that it failed customers at their greatest moment of need, destroying companies, livelihoods and jobs,\" he said.\nHe formed a Covid Claims Group, joining other small business owners in calling for a quick resolution and payouts.\n\"Time matters,\" he said, pointing out that some small businesses have been forced to close down while waiting for the decision.\nSheldon Mills, from the FCA, which brought the case on behalf of policyholders, said: \"Coronavirus is causing substantial loss and distress to businesses and many are under immense financial strain to stay afloat. Today's judgment decisively removes many of the roadblocks to claims by policyholders.\n\"We will be working with insurers to ensure that they now move quickly to pay claims that the judgment says should be paid, making interim payments wherever possible.\"\nThe test case was fast-tracked to the highest court in England and Wales - the Supreme Court, which heard four days of legal representations in November. The final ruling provides authoritative guidance for these policies, and potentially of similar ones not part of the case.\nThe FCA, the insurance sector, and the Financial Ombudsman will all use the judgement to guide their decisions in other cases.\nThe Financial Ombudsman Service and courts in Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to use the judgment to rule on other, similar cases.\nInsurance policies would have been amended for new and renewing customers since this issue emerged, so losses from the latest lockdown measures in different parts of the UK would be clearly stated as part of the cover - or not - in new business interruption insurance policies."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 GMT. \nA ban on travellers from South America entering the UK has come into force, amid fears over a potentially more contagious coronavirus variant identified in Brazil. The ban also applies to Portugal and Cape Verde - off West Africa - because of their links to Brazil, along with Panama in southern Central America. British and Irish citizens, and foreign nationals with residence rights, are exempt but must isolate for 10 days on entering the UK. Find out which other countries are subject to a UK travel ban. \nThe UK economy shrank by 2.6% in November as lockdown restrictions reduced economic activity, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. The closure of businesses such as pubs, hairdressers and many shops meant the services sector shrank by 3.4%. The setback came after sixth consecutive months of growth, with the ONS saying UK gross domestic product at the end of November was 8.5% below its pre-pandemic peak.\nConcerns over child poverty have been raised throughout the pandemic, with a focus on school food vouchers, holiday meal provision and food parcels. Now campaigning Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford has been joined by celebrity chefs Jamie Oliver, Tom Kerridge and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, and actress Dame Emma Thompson, in backing charities' calls for a review to \"fix\" the free school meals policy. Downing Street insists \"no child will ever go hungry\" because of the pandemic.\nFalse claims are likely to be causing people from ethnic minorities to reject Covid vaccines, warns a doctor leading an NHS campaign. Dr Harpreet Sood says much of the disinformation surrounds the contents of the vaccines. \"We need to be clear and make people realise there is no meat in the vaccine, there is no pork in the vaccine, it has been accepted and endorsed by all the religious leaders and councils and faith communities,\" he says.\nA surprise delivery of pizza from sixth-formers who clubbed together left staff at a hospital critical care unit \"lost for words\". Nurse Tina Waltho says the gift came as a welcome boost to deflated staff at the Royal Stoke University Hospital. \"The nurse who had been in charge on the day shift was in tears,\" Mrs Waltho says. \"She had barely eaten all day and was a little emotional.\" While the act drew praise on social media, the identity and school of the pupils remains a mystery.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nIf you're wondering how concerned we should be about the new virus variants, our health editor Michelle Roberts examines what we know so far.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Marcus Rashford and a group of celebrity chefs and campaigners have called on Boris Johnson to review the government's free school meals policy.\nThe group, including Jamie Oliver, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Tom Kerridge, have written to the PM asking him to \"fix\" the system long-term.\nThey called for a strategy to help \"end child food poverty\" before the summer holidays.\nNo 10 said \"no child will ever go hungry\" because of the Covid pandemic. \nThe call for a wide review comes after another row over free school meals during February half-term.\nThe government has said food will be provided to children by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme while schools are closed for the holiday.\nCouncils and unions say the government should provide food vouchers instead, with the Local Government Association's Councillor Richard Watts telling BBC Radio 4's PM programme the grant had already been allocated for other support. \nBut Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are down to semantics whether it is the school delivering the meal or whether it is the local authority - fortunately there is quite a lot of different support available.\"\nAs well as getting the backing of Rashford - who has led campaigns around child poverty over the course of the pandemic - the letter has been signed by chefs Oliver, Kerridge and Fearnley-Whittingstall, along with actor Dame Emma Thompson and over 40 charities and education leaders.\nOrganised by the Food Foundation charity, the letter said it was time to \"step back and review the policy in more depth\".\nThey called for an \"urgent comprehensive review into free school meal policy across the UK\" to feed into the government's next Spending Review, saying it should look at:\nThe signatories praised the Department for Education's \"swift response\" to reports earlier this week of inadequate food parcels sent to families, saying the \"robustness of the message from you and the secretary of state on this issue was very welcome\".\nBut, they added that \"following the series of problems which have arisen over school food vouchers, holiday provision and food parcels since the start of the pandemic\", now was the time for a review. \nAnna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation charity, said the last few months had seen \"crisis after crisis with the provision of free school meals\". \n\"The result of that is disadvantaged children have often paid the price,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \n\"Our view is that really unless we do a root and branch review these problems are going to still keep appearing.\"\nChef Fearnley-Whittingstall also called for a more consistent, long-term response to the issue of food poverty. \n\"We need to get out of this fire-fighting, highly reactive series of actions by the government,\" he told the same programme. \nThe signatories want a review to be published and debated in Parliament before the 2021 summer holidays. \n\"We are ready and willing to support your government in whatever way we can to make this review a reality and to help develop a set of recommendations that everyone can support,\" the letter said.\n\"School food is essential in supporting the health and learning of our most disadvantaged children. \n\"Now, at a time when children have missed months of in-school learning and the pandemic has reminded us of the importance of our health, this is a vital next step.\"\nAnti-poverty campaigner and food writer Jack Monroe welcomed the letter to the PM, but told the BBC: \"We need to be feeding children right now.\"\nShe added: \"While it is great to be looking longer term... having an underpinning strategy that means that children aren't put into poverty in the first place, we need to also immediately be putting resources in to ensure people aren't going hungry, today, tonight, next week and in the February half-term. \n\"This isn't a rhetorical thing. It isn't a dinner party discussion. We need to be doing this now.\"\nA Downing Street spokesperson said: \"It is great that celebrities and groups across society see the importance of school food. The PM thanks Marcus Rashford for his letter and will reply soon. \n\"School food is essential in supporting the health and learning of the most disadvantaged pupils. The prime minister has been clear that no child will ever go hungry as a result of the pandemic\"."

The Met Office said East Anglia and parts of Kent and Sussex are most at risk of snow.\nSome 1-3 cm of snow may fall fairly widely over these areas, with 5-10 cm possible in places, mostly over parts of East Anglia and any higher ground. \nA snow and ice warning is in place for most of Scotland, north-west and north-east England, Yorkshire and Humber, the East Midlands and parts of the West Midlands. \nSnow is likely to fall to low levels over east Scotland and northern England.\nThe Met Office said 1-3 cm is possible at low levels in these areas but is more likely at higher elevations, where 5-10 cm of snow is possible above 200m - and even 20cm at the highest places. \nFog is also forecast for parts of the Midlands and the North, along with mist around Glasgow which may pose hazards for motorists.\nThe coronavirus vaccine rollout has been affected by the weather.\nOver-80s who were due to receive their jab at Newcastle's Centre for Life were told they could re-book rather than risk making a trip in the icy conditions.\nNewcastle Hospitals tweeted: \"There's enough vaccine for everyone, so don't worry about making a trip to Newcastle.\"\nAnd Leeds University has delayed the opening of its asymptomatic Covid-19 test centre.\nHeavy snowfall has already caused travel disruption across sections of northern England and Scotland.\nTemperatures were as low as -6C on Friday morning in parts of Yorkshire and Cumbria, with yellow warnings set to last through most of Friday.\nThere was a loss of gas supply to approximately 700 homes in the Hebden Bridge area after water got into the local gas network and froze.\nThe Met Office has published advice from the Department for Transport advising people to clear snow and ice from footpaths outside their homes, preferably in the morning.\n\"You can then cover the path with salt before nightfall to stop it refreezing overnight,\" the advice says.\nTemperatures in the Greater London area are expected to drop to 1C on Friday and parts of the South East could fall to -2C.\nIt comes after \"hazardous\" conditions on Thursday caused problems for the ambulance service in Yorkshire, which struggled to keep up with the high demand, while Covid vaccinations were also affected.\nMark Millins, of Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said the bad weather was having a \"severe impact\" on its operations and urged people to \"take extra care\" when out walking or driving.\nIn Scotland, heavy snow in some areas resulted in road closures.\nThe deepest snow on Thursday was in Bingley, West Yorkshire, and Strathallan in Perth, Scotland, both of which recorded 11cm."

I don't think that's a good idea at all.\"\nIn December, Wales' Education Minister Kirsty Williams confirmed the details of a plan under which students would receive grades based on a mix of internal and external assessments, rather than end-of-year exams. \nBut following the announcement of the move to full-time remote learning earlier this month, exams regulator Qualifications Wales cancelled the spring period of \"internal assessments\" for GCSE, AS and A-level pupils, which would have been marked by teachers and had been scheduled between 22 February and 23 April.\nHowever, the external assessments, which will be set and marked by the exam board, are still scheduled to take place between 17 May and 29 June.\nIn England, the government has announced that teachers' estimated grades would be used, although Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has since suggested that some external \"mini exams\" are being considered. \nThe Scottish equivalents to GCSE and A levels will be teacher-assessed, while Northern Ireland has also cancelled all GCSE, AS and A-level exams this year. \nPlaid Cymru has reiterated its calls for the external tests to be scrapped, and now want an urgent decision to change to teacher-assessed grades, also known as \"centre-assessed\". \nEducation spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said this would be \"sensible, practical and fair\" and a \"a perfectly legitimate alternative system\".\n\"The children have had so much disruption to their education already this year and some children have had more disruption than others,\" she said. \nThe chief executive of the WJEC, Wales' exam board, said there were \"no easy decisions [or] outcomes\". \nIan Morgan said the decision to cancel exams in England \"does have a broader impact right across the UK\", but that they would push forward with an agenda that suits learners in Wales. \n\"What we need is to make sure that there's consistency in the process, that everybody is treated fairly and that the level of content and the level of assessment of learners get, is fair and balanced across the board,\" he added. \nA Welsh Government official said following the shift to full-time remote learning its advisory group would now be considering how to \"build on and adapt\" the proposals to \"support learner wellbeing and progression\". \n\"The minister is also discussing with stakeholders including young people and will provide a further update as soon as possible,\" they said."

      "text": "Despite the huge need to free up space in hospitals, some care homes say insurance issues make it impossible for them to accept Covid-19 patients.\nIn October, the government launched a scheme for designated care homes to take patients recovering from the virus but insurance is a stumbling block.\nSir David Behan, head of the UK's largest care home company, HC-One, says insurance has become a major concern.\nThe government says it is working to resolve the issue. \n\"We are aware the adult social care insurance market is changing in response to the pandemic, and recognise some care providers may encounter difficulties as their policies come up for renewal,\" said a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson. \nOne Hampshire care home says it will have to stop taking patients within days because its insurance will expire.  \nWaterside House in Netley, Hampshire usually provides holidays and respite care for people with disabilities. \nBut since the autumn it has been taking Covid-positive patients discharged from hospitals on the south coast. \nThey are looked after on a separate floor from other residents, and the home has had to meet high infection control standards. \nHome manager Sarah Knight said demand for the 31 beds is unparalleled and added: \"I've been in nursing a long, long time, and I have never known anything like this. \n\"People end up in an ambulance sat outside hospitals for hours and hours, or they end up on a trolley in A&E in a corridor for hours and hours. \n\"By offering the best that we've got here, we can reduce some of that burden.\"\nThe government originally hoped there would be 500 designated care homes taking in Covid-positive patients. \nBut Waterside House is one of only 129 which have been set up to take those who have not completed 14 days in isolation. \nHowever, its public indemnity insurance protection, which it needs in case someone contracts Covid there, runs out at the end of January. \nWaterside House is run by the charity Revitalise, whose chief executive, Jan Tregelles, said they have tried everything, but will soon have to start turning away people. \n\"It's shocking,\" she says. \"We are truly helpless. We have a fantastic team of nurses and colleagues already. \n\"The facilities are here, everything's arranged and we can't step up to support our communities at this time.\"\nOne resident, Alan Washbourne, who has been living at Waterside House since he was discharged from hospital during the first wave of the pandemic, said: \"I feel quite safe here.\" \nHe is not on the Covid floor of the home, and added: \"If I were to go to somewhere else, which is possible, I might not feel quite so safe.\"\nAfter so many deaths last spring, many care homes  will not consider taking patients who are Covid-positive, even with extra infection control measures. \nMeanwhile, growing numbers of staff are off sick or self-isolating, leaving care homes facing shortages. \nAnd many are also finding it difficult to get the public indemnity insurance. \nSince November, HC-One, which is the UK's largest care home provider, has had to cover its own Covid risks because it cannot get the insurance.  \nSir David said it is one of the reasons why they have not taken part in the designated places scheme.  \n\"You've got solicitors' firms advertising, taking cases up against care companies,\" he says. \n\"So, this isn't a theoretical risk that there may be proceedings, it's an actual risk, and therefore we need cover.\n\"The NHS wouldn't operate without similar liability cover and that's what we need to see, and I think governments have a role to play working with the insurance industry to work to find a solution.\" \nThe Department for Health and Social Care said it was making efforts to determine what actions it could take.\n\"Our priority is to ensure everyone receives the right care, in the right place, at the right time,\" said a spokesperson.
