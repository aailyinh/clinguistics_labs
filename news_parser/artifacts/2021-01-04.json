      "text": "Schools are being given a flexible approach to ensure a \"safe return\", according to Wales' first minister.\nHe was responding to calls by teaching unions in Wales to suspend face-to-face teaching in response to the new coronavirus variant.\nMark Drakeford said experts would be \"looking at all the evidence again early next week\".\nUnions have called for a national decision on reopening schools rather than leaving it to local councils.\nAccording to local authorities many secondary schools aim to return from 11 January, with some fully open on 6 January.\nA joint statement from nine unions called on the Welsh Government to give a \"centralised, coherent response\" regarding all educational settings \"rather than leaving decisions at local levels\".\nThe statement from ASCL Cymru, GMB, NAHT Cymru, NASUWT Cymru, NEU Cymru, Ucac, Unison, Unite and Voice continued: \"We are extremely worried that schools will be opening for face-to-face learning from next Monday, whilst Welsh Government continues to gather information about the nature and impact of the new variant of Covid-19...\n\"We strongly believe that we need to err on the side of caution and ensure, in advance, that we have the medical 'evidence and information' to ensure that any decisions are the correct ones.\"\nThe National Education Union Cymru has called for in-person learning to be delayed until at least 18 January.\nThe NASUWT has also threatened \"appropriate action in order to protect members whose safety is put at risk\", while head teachers' union NAHT Cymru said it had taken legal action. \nBut Mr Drakeford said: \"We reached an agreement with our local education colleagues that in Wales we will have a phased and flexible return to school.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday parents should send their children to primary school as long as they are open in their area.\nJackie Parker, head of Crickhowell High School in Powys, which reopens for some form years from Wednesday, said \"it would have been more sensible to have had a national decision for the time being until the 18th\".\nShe said it would have allowed time to see if cases of Covid had increased over the holiday period.\n\"People may have been together during the Christmas holiday,\" she said.\nFigures published by Public Health Wales on Sunday showed 56 new deaths from Covid and 4,011 new cases of the virus.\nWales has been in lockdown since 20 December with restrictions on people meeting others on all but Christmas Day when it was limited to another household and a person living alone.\nMr Drakeford said: \"There is no evidence that young people get the illness more severely as a result of the variant. \n\"Our technical advisory group will be looking at all the evidence again early next week.\n\"And, of course, we will continue to make decisions in the light of the best knowledge, research and information that's available to us at the time,\" he told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement.\nHe also said mass testing in schools would begin as planned this month, in a decision which has been criticised by NAHT Cymru.\n\"It will allow more children and more teachers to stay safely in the classroom without having to be sent home because another child or another staff member has tested positive,\" he said. \nThe joint unions' statement also said the Welsh Government's testing proposals were unworkable for most schools.\n\"Due to the chaotic and rushed nature of this announcement, the lack of proper guidance, and an absence of appropriate support, the Welsh Government's proposals will be inoperable for most schools and colleges,\" it said.\nThe statement continued: \"Any suggestion that schools can safely recruit, train and organise a team of suitable volunteers to staff and run testing stations on their premises by an as yet unspecified date in the new term is simply not realistic.\"\nSian Gwenllian, Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman, said \"parents and teachers need to know what the plan is for the next few weeks\".\n\"We don't really know very much about this new variant in the way that it transmits within the school community,\" she said.\n\"And if it is becoming inevitable that schools will have to close, well, an early decision is better for everybody.\"\nWelsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: \"We've had conflicting reports in the press and on social media about the effect of the new variant on younger children and their role in transmitting the disease - complete confusion reigns...\n\"The Welsh Government hasn't succeeded in reassuring teachers and in some cases parents as well.\" "

      "text": "The Queen has sent her \"best wishes\" to Woman's Hour to mark the BBC Radio 4 show's 75th year.\nThe 94-year-old noted that the show had \"played a significant part in the evolving role of women\".\n\"As you celebrate your 75th year, it is with great pleasure that I send my best wishes to the listeners and all those associated with Woman's Hour,\" she said in a letter sent to the programme.\nEmma Barnett read out the message on her first day as the show's presenter.\n\"During this time, you have witnessed and played a significant part in the evolving role of women across society, both here and around the world,\" the Queen added in her message.\n\"In this notable anniversary year, I wish you continued success in your important work as a friend, guide and advocate to women everywhere.\"\nSpice Girl Melanie C also performed a rendition of The Beatles track Here Comes the Sun, after presenter Barnett had declared that 2021 \"has to be better\" than the previous year.\nLater, guest Imelda Staunton, who will play Her Majesty in the upcoming series five of Netflix's royal drama, The Crown, described her as being like \"the original Spice Girl\".\n\"The Queen, you think, might be an original Spice Girl because girl power is what she is,\" said the actress, who is due to take over the role from Olivia Colman. \"She became the head of state and all that sort of thing.\n\"It's the continuity of The Queen that has been so important... Whether you're a royalist or not, this person has got up and gone to work every day for 60 years, and I sort of admire that.\"\nLast month, the Queen used her Christmas Day message to reassure anyone struggling without friends and family this year that they \"are not alone\".\nThe message helped to mark a memorable opening day in the hot seat for Barnett, which also saw her discuss Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian under house arrest in Tehran, with her husband Richard and the MP and former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt.\nBarnett - known for hosting Newsnight and shows on 5 Live - has replaced Jane Garvey, who presented her final edition of Woman's Hour after 13 years last week, saying the programme \"needs to move on, and now it can\".\nGarvey's exit came three months after her co-host Dame Jenni Murray also left the long-running show after 33 years.\nBarnett's 5 Live show has been taken over by BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty, who also broadcast her first show on Monday.\nMunchetty told listeners she was \"absolutely delighted to be here with you on the first Monday of 2021\".\n\"I am so excited to be on board with you on this, the morning show we are making together,\" she added. \"We are going to get to know each other, I promise. There is so much to talk about.\" \nAnalysis by BBC media editor Amol Rajan\nWoman's Hour is a topical, conversation-led programme; Barnett has a strong news pedigree. Her previous 5 Live show involved thorough interrogation of politicians, and she has made no secret of her love of politics, not least in her outings on Newsnight. \nIt doesn't get any bigger than the Queen, obviously. Interestingly, the other big 'get' for her first show is Sonia Khan, former special adviser to the Chancellor. \nSo Barnett's first show indicates very clearly that she will make Woman's Hour newsier and more political.\nIt's also a safe bet that short, visual clips of the kind that allowed Barnett's 5 Live show to dramatically increase its impact will also be a big feature of her time in the job.\nOne early challenge: getting an even bigger name for next Monday.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The first Scottish recipients of the new Oxford University and AstraZeneca vaccine have received their jabs.\nJames Shaw, 82, and his 82-year-old wife Malita were among the first to be vaccinated in Dundee.\nThe couple received their first doses at Lochee Health and Community Care Centre.\nNicola Sturgeon has said she hoped all over-50s and those with underlying health conditions will have been vaccinated by early May.\nJames said: \"My wife and I are delighted to be receiving this vaccination. I have asthma and bronchitis and I have been desperate to have it so I am really pleased to be one of the first to be getting it. \n\"I know it takes a little while for the vaccine to work but after today I know that I will feel a bit less worried about going out. I will still be very careful and avoid busy places but knowing I have been vaccinated will really help me.\n\"All of my friends have said they are going to have the vaccine when it is their turn and I would encourage everyone who is offered this vaccination to take it.\"\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine programme is being rolled out less than a week after it was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). It is the second vaccine approved for use in the UK.\nNHS Tayside is rolling out the vaccine through GP practices in the community and will also vaccinate elderly residents and staff in care homes.\nIts associate director of public health Dr Daniel Chandleris said: \"The efforts of our vaccination teams have been amazing and it is testament to a real whole team approach that sees the first over-80s in the general population have their jabs today in Tayside.\n\"The availability and mobility of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine gives us the opportunity to start to roll out the biggest vaccine programme that the UK has ever seen across our communities.\n\"Over-80s are the first priority group and patients will be contacted directly to attend a vaccination session.\"\nScottish Secretary Alister Jack added: \"This is another important moment in our fight against the virus - every vaccination takes us a step closer to getting back to our normal lives as soon as possible.\n\"As with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the UK is the first country in the world to approve and roll out the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, with the UK Government ordering and paying for millions of doses for people in all parts of the UK.\"\nThe milestone came as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a new stricter lockdown. \nWith the exception of essential travel, people in mainland Scotland will have to remain at home from midnight.\nStatistics released on Monday showed a further 1,905 people had contracted Covid-19. \nFigures for hospital admissions and deaths over the holiday weekend will not be published until Tuesday.\nMs Sturgeon likened the situation to a race between the vaccine and the virus.\nShe said: \"In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they run as fast as possible.\n\"But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new variant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks. \n\"To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible. But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.\"\nThe new vaccine will initially be available in the hospitals that have been delivering the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine, and new community settings will be able to deliver the jabs from 11 January. \nPeople in Scotland will be contacted by their health board when it is their turn to be vaccinated. \nThe Oxford vaccination marks a major turning point in the pandemic and will lead to a massive expansion in the UK's immunisation campaign, with enough to vaccinate 50 million people throughout the UK already on order. \nIt is easier to transport and store than the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which needs cold storage of about -70C.\nThe UK government has said 530,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine will be available to the UK from Monday, with \"millions due by the beginning of February\". \nScotland will ultimately get an 8.2% share of these vaccines, based on its population. \nChief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith has said he expects the NHS in Scotland to receive 440,360 doses of the vaccine during January. \nThe first minister said on Monday about 100,000 people in Scotland have already received a first dose of vaccine.\nBoth vaccines require two doses to be administered with an interval of between four and 12 weeks. \nPreviously the advice was for the vaccines to have a four-week gap between doses.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) then recommended as many people as possible in the top priority groups should be offered a first dose as the initial priority."

      "text": "The prime minister has said that tougher measures could be needed to help cope with a surge in coronavirus cases.\nHe has not yet said whether we will need school closures, or even overnight curfews like those imposed in France.\nBut clues about such measures to tackle the new more infectious variant come from the government's Sage advisory committee. \nThe headline is that whether we see a return to only being allowed one form of daily outdoor exercise, or stricter controls on travel around the country, we'll be hearing a lot more about something already very familiar: hand hygiene, social distancing, wearing masks and ensuring there is fresh air.\nThese may sound familiar but the advisers believe that because the new variant spreads so easily, the measures need to be applied with \"a step change in rigour\" - in other words, a lot more forcefully.\nThey suggest considering a return to the two-metre rule because it's more effective than the one-metre plus guidance adopted last year.\nMasks need to be made of three layers, not just one, and worn in more locations than now - including workplaces, schools and crowded outdoor spaces.\nThe key message is that it is vital to reduce social contact - being close to people, especially indoors for long periods of time, carries the highest risk of infection.\nSo expect tier four-type bans on visiting other households to become normal.\nThe advisers also say many people still do not recognise the key symptoms of Covid-19 - so ministers need to spell them out and help people understand why they should self-isolate.\nBut they also say it is essential to praise the efforts made so far, to recognise sacrifices and emphasise how they've kept infection numbers lower than they would otherwise have been. \nWhatever new measures are picked, the advice to ministers is to offer \"clear and convincing explanations\" to motivate people.\nThat could be a hint that the government's current \"hands, face, space\" slogan may need to make way for something stronger.\nFollow David on Twitter"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Fully jabbed travellers arriving in the UK from France have to quarantine, because of the Beta variant. \nThe government is concerned jabs may not work as well against the variant. \nFrench authorities say most cases are from the overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte, rather than mainland France.\nBeta, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, has some significant genetic changes that experts are studying. It was first identified in South Africa.\nAll viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into new versions or variants.\nThese tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive. \nMost are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some variants can make the virus more infectious or threatening to the host - humans. \nSome of the changes Beta has undergone involve the virus's spike protein - the part that gains the virus entry into human cells. It is also the bit that vaccines are designed around, which is why experts are concerned about these particular mutations.\nBeta, along with a few other variants of coronavirus, such as Delta and Alpha, have been labelled \"variants of concern\". These have some worrying changes experts want to keep a very close eye on.\nBeta carries a mutation, called N501Y, which appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. \nAnother mutation, called E484K, could help the virus dodge a person's immune system, and may affect how well vaccines work. \nThere is no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people.\nAs with the original version, the risk is still highest for elderly people and those with significant underlying health conditions.\nVaccines are designed around original Covid, rather than new variants. \nThere is some evidence they are less effective at stopping Beta infections.\nBut experts say they should still work to stop severe illness. \nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to provide a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary.\nA trial of a new version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, designed against Beta, has begun in the UK.\nSome of the other Covid vaccines are also being updated. \nThe Beta variant has been identified in more than 50 countries around the world. \nSo far, the UK has recorded just over 1,000 cases of Beta. That's a tiny fraction of all Covid cases. Another variant, called Delta, currently makes up more than 99% of Covid seen in the UK. \nSouth Africa has reported higher cases of Beta.\nWhen it was first identified in the UK, the government recommended surge testing in the community in some regions to help stop the spread. \nA system of foreign travel restrictions has also been introduced to minimise the chance of UK travellers spreading Beta as well as other variants of concern. \nAlthough adults who were fully jabbed in the UK now no longer need to quarantine on return from amber list countries, double vaccinated travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to self-isolate for ten days. \nThey will also have to take two PCR tests to ensure they are not infectious. \nUK scientists are tracking variants, including Beta, to learn more and are providing genomic sequencing help to other countries so that they can do the same.

      "text": "Georgia's top election official Brad Raffensperger has called President Donald Trump's false claims that he won the state in 2020 \"just plain wrong\".\nMr Raffensperger's comment came after Mr Trump pressured him in a phone call to \"find\" votes proving his win.\nCriticism of Mr Trump's call has been widespread, with some claiming that it amounts to illegal vote tampering.\nRepublicans fear that the call could undermine their efforts to win two Senate races in Georgia on Tuesday.\nIf Republicans win one of the Georgia Senate seats in the run-off, they will retain control of the upper chamber. If both candidates lose, Democrats will control the Senate, House of Representatives and White House.  \n\"He did most of the talking. We did most of the listening,\" Mr Raffensperger told ABC News on Monday. \n\"But I did want to make my points that the data that he has is just plain wrong.\"\nHe was on the phone for an hour to the president and his team on Saturday, and the audio was published by the Washington Post the following day. On Monday, Mr Raffensperger told reporters that he did not know the call was being recorded, and said he spoke to the president from his home. \n\"He [Mr Trump] had hundreds and hundreds of people he said that were dead that voted. We found two, that's an example of just - he has bad data,\" he added.\nGabriel Sterling, the state's voting systems implementation manager, said in a Monday news conference that Mr Trump's claims were \"easily, provably false\". He also rued the \"ridiculousness\" of the call to Mr Raffensperger. \nMr Sterling warned that the president was undermining Georgians' trust in the election process, and pleaded with residents to vote in Tuesday's election. \n\"Everybody's vote is going to count,\" he said. \nMr Trump can be heard alternately cajoling and pressuring Georgia's secretary of state to \"recalculate\" the vote tally.\n\"I just want to find 11,780 votes,\" he said. The number would have given him a total of 2,473,634 votes in the state, one more than Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who received 2,473,633 votes.\nHe also accused Mr Raffensperger - a fellow Republican - of shredding ballots and engaging in criminal acts that cost Mr Trump the election. He called the disproven allegations \"a criminal offence,\" adding that it presents \"a big risk to you\".\nMr Raffensperger responded by pointing out that Mr Trump's campaign has lost several legal challenges in court.\n\"The challenge you have, Mr President, is that the data you have is wrong.\"\nOn Monday, two Democratic lawmakers wrote to the FBI, asking \"to open an immediate criminal investigation into the president\".\n\"As members of Congress and former prosecutors, we believe Donald Trump engaged in solicitation of, or conspiracy to commit, a number of election crimes,\" wrote Ted Lieu of California and Kathleen Rice of New York.\nVice-president-elect Kamala Harris, who was in Georgia on Sunday to campaign for the Democratic senate candidates, called Mr Trump's call \"a bold abuse of power\".\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said Mr Trump was \"unhinged and dangerous\" and that his call to Mr Raffensperger merited \"nothing less than a criminal investigation\".\nGeorgia's Republican Lt Governor added to the criticism on Monday, telling CNN: \"I am 100% certified to tell you that it was inappropriate. And it certainly did not help the situation.\"\n\"It was based on misinformation,\" continued Geoff Duncan, whose boss Governor Brian Kemp has faced calls from Mr Trump to resign. \"It was based on, you know, all types of theories that have been debunked and disproved over the course of the last 10 weeks.\"\nThe Senate run-offs in Georgia have drawn national attention.\nOn Monday, Mr Trump, Mr Biden and Vice-president Mike Pence are all holding rallies in the state on behalf of their chosen candidates ahead of Tuesday's vote.\nSpeaking in Atlanta, Mr Biden urged Georgians to turn on Tuesday, saying the election's outcome could \"chart the course, not just for the four years, but for the next generation\". \n\"Tomorrow can be a new day for Atlanta, for Georgia and for America,\" he said. \nPresident Trump rallied voters in Dalton, Georgia, warning that the Georgia runoff was the \"last line of defence\" against Democratic control of the Senate. \nHe said: \"If the liberal Democrats take the Senate and the White House - and they're not taking this White House - we're going to fight like hell, I'll tell you right now.\" \nHe added: \"This could be the most important vote you will ever cast for the rest of your life, it really could be.\"\nThe competing rallies come as nearly 3 million Georgia voters - around half of those that voted in the November general election - have already cast their ballots.\nGeorgia's incumbent Republican Senator David Perdue, who is fighting to hold his seat in Tuesday's race, has sided with the president. \n\"To have a statewide elected official, regardless of party, tape without disclosing a conversation - private conversation - with the president of the United States, and then leaking it to the press is disgusting,\" he told Fox News.\nHe also dismissed claims of wrongdoing by Mr Trump, saying: \"I didn't hear anything in that tape that the president hasn't already said for weeks now since the November election.\"\nDemocratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff said the call was \"a direct attack on our democracy,\" and accused Mr Perdue and fellow Republican Senate candidate Kelly Loeffler of failing to defend \"Georgia voters from that kind of assault\".\nRaphael Warnock, the other Democratic Senate candidate, called upon Senator Loeffler to \"speak out against these unsubstantiated claims of fraud, defend Georgia's elections, and to put Georgia ahead of herself\". \nDuring a campaign appearance on Monday, Mrs Loeffler refused to respond to a question about the phone call, instead telling reporters: \"My sole focus is on tomorrow's election.\"\n\"I am focused on that exclusively because this affects every single Georgian,\" she added."

      "tags": "Vaccination,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Experts have raised concerns over India's emergency approval of a locally-produced coronavirus vaccine before the completion of trials. \nOn Sunday, Delhi approved the vaccine - known as Covaxin - as well as the global AstraZeneca Oxford jab, which is also being manufactured in India.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi touted the approval as a \"game changer\". \nThe head of Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, defended the approval process, but health experts warn it was rushed.\nHealth watchdog All India Drug Action Network said it was \"shocked\".\nIt said that there were \"intense concerns arising from the absence of the efficacy data\" as well a lack of transparency that would \"raise more questions than answers and likely will not reinforce faith in our scientific decision making bodies\". \nThe statement came after India's Drugs Controller General, VG Somani, insisted Covaxin was \"safe and provides a robust immune response\".\nHe added the vaccines had been approved for restricted use in \"public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains\".\n\"The vaccines are 100% safe,\" he said, adding that side effects such as \"mild fever, pain and allergy are common for every vaccine\".\nThe All India Drug Action Network, however, said it was \"baffled to understand the scientific logic\" to approve \"an incompletely studied vaccine\". \nOne of India's most eminent medical experts, Dr Gagandeep Kang, told the Times of India newspaper that she had \"not seen anything like this before\". She added that \"there is absolutely no efficacy data that has been presented or published\".\nEven social media users were quick to point out that approving the vaccine before trials were complete was a matter of concern irrespective of how safe or effective the vaccine eventually turned out to be. \nBut Krishna Ella, chairman of Bharat Biotech, met reporters on Monday and said the approval of Covaxin had not been rushed. He cited previous examples where emergency authorisation approvals had been given based only on immunogenicity data.\n\"Under Indian laws we can get emergency approval for the vaccine based on fulfilling five parameters after Phase 2 trails. That is what has happened with our vaccine. So it is not a premature approval,\" he said.\n\"We will complete the Phase 3 trials soon and provide the efficacy data for the vaccine by February.\"\nThe company currently has 20 million doses available and plans to produce about 700 million doses this year, Dr Ella said. \n\"We have four facilities coming up and we are planning [to make] around 200 million doses in Hyderabad, 500 million doses in other cities.\"\nVikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi\nMany scientists and opposition politicians have raised questions over what they say is the hasty authorisation of Covaxin.\nBharat Biotech has developed the vaccine with the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research - and the effort has been touted as an example of India's might in vaccine development and production.\nRegulators say the vaccine is safe and effective. The firm says phase 1 and phase 2 trials have shown good results. \nBut scientists say that the government's decision not to release data on the vaccine's efficacy for peer review has raised concerns. \nMr Modi has welcomed the approval, saying Covaxin is a shining example of his ambitious Atmnirbhar (self-reliance) India campaign.\nBut experts worry that questions over the approval process don't bode well for the campaign. And there could be deeper issues. Many believe that the government needs to be more transparent about the authorisation process because the success of the Covid-19 vaccine programme depends on public trust. \nThe emergency authorisation also sparked a fierce debate on Indian Twitter on Sunday night between ministers and opposition leaders. \nIndia's health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan called out opposition leaders for failing to \"applaud\" the country's \"prowess\"  in locally producing a vaccine. India makes about 60% of vaccines globally.\nMembers of the main opposition Congress party, Shashi Tharoor and Jairam Ramesh, and former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, Akhilesh Yadav, were among those who raised concerns about the manner in which Covaxin was approved.\nThe approval comes as India gears up to vaccinate its population of more than 1.3 billon people. Amid fears that richer countries are buying up much of the vaccine supply, India too appears to be stockpiling vaccines. \nIn an  interview with the Associated Press, Adar Poonawalla, whose Serum Institute of India (SII) is manufacturing the  AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine, said the jab was given emergency authorisation on the condition that it would not be exported outside India. \nMr Poonawalla said his company, the world's largest vaccine maker, was also not allowed to sell the shot in the private market.\nThis has raised concerns in India's neighbouring countries, including Nepal and Bangladesh, which were primarily depending on the SII to start vaccinating their populations. \nBangladesh had already ordered 30 million doses of the vaccine in the first phase, Reuters reported, but now the fate of the order is unclear. The country's health secretary told local media in December that it expected the first batch of the jab by February. \nIndia plans to vaccinate some 300 million people on a priority list by August.\nIt has recorded the second-highest number of infections in the world, with more than 10.3 million confirmed cases to date. Nearly 150,000 people have died.\nBoth vaccines approved on Sunday can be transported and stored at normal refrigeration temperatures. "

The first victim to be found was named as Eirik Gr\u00f8nole, 31.\nSeveral people remain missing following the hillside collapse that sent mud into the village of Ask on Wednesday.\nRescuers are working to find survivors, but chances of this are fading.\nPolice said the latest body was recovered near where two others had been found, but they gave no further details.\nFive of the victims have been identified, including a 40-year-old man and his two-year-old daughter.\nAnother 10 people were injured. \nThe king and queen of Norway visited the site of the landslide on Sunday.\n\"I'm having trouble finding something to say, because it's absolutely horrible,\" King Harald said after the visit.\n\"This terrible event impacts us all. I sympathise with you who are beginning the new year with sadness and uncertainty,\" he said. \nA shortage of daylight in the Norwegian winter has proved one of the challenges at the scene in Gjerdrum municipality, 25km (15 miles) north-east of Oslo.\nRescuers are also contending with freezing temperatures and the clay ground proving too unstable for emergency workers to walk on.\nHelicopters and drones spent two days searching the area before Police Commander Roy Alkvist said one or two houses appeared safe to enter.\nRescuers began moving into the danger zone on Styrofoam boards; the bright orange boards were laid down on the mud in a domino-effect as rescuers tried to reach the wrecked homes.\nResidents of Ask began calling emergency services at around 04:00 local time on Wednesday telling them that their houses were moving, police said.\n\"There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,\" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK.\n\"Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly.\"\nMore than 30 homes were destroyed, with others teetering on the edges of the deep crater that was left by the landslide. At least 1,000 residents were evacuated from the area.\nThe landslide was a so-called \"quick clay slide\" measuring about 300m by 700m (985ft by 2,300ft), a spokeswoman for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) told AFP.\nQuick clay is a kind of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and behave as a fluid when it comes under stress. \nBroadcaster NRK said heavy rainfall may have made the soil unstable, but questions have since emerged over why construction was permitted in the area. \nA 2005 geological survey labelled the area as at high risk of landslides, according to a report seen by the broadcaster TV2. Despite this, the homes were built there three years later."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scientists in South Africa say there is a \"reasonable concern\" that the new variant of Covid-19 sweeping across the country might prove to be more resistant to current vaccines being rolled out in the UK and elsewhere, and warn that it makes the need for a global roll-out of vaccines \"even more critical\".\n\"It's a theoretical concern. A reasonable concern\u2026 that the South African variant might be more resistant,\" Prof Shabir Madhi, who has led trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa, told the BBC. \nProf Madhi was responding to comments by the UK government and scientists. He said a definitive answer would probably come in a matter of weeks, with extensive testing already under way in South Africa. \nThe concern arises from the fact that the virus here has mutated far more than the variant in the UK, and one of those mutations might mean it can evade attack by antibodies that would normally fight coronavirus. \nVaccines teach the body to mount an immune response - which includes creating antibodies - to fight the coronavirus, should it ever encounter it. \nAntibodies are small proteins made by the immune system that stick to the surface of viruses, effectively disabling them. If that ability to connect is weakened, then the antibodies created following the introduction of a vaccine might not be as effective.\nProf Madhi said it was \"unlikely\" that the mutation in South Africa would make the current vaccines useless, but might \"weaken the impact\".\nA vaccine expert at Wits University, Prof Helen Rees, said: \"Fortunately, should further modifications of the vaccine be required to address the new variants, some of the vaccine technologies under development could allow this to be done relatively rapidly.\"\nSouth Africa recently pushed back against suggestions from the British government that its variant was more transmissible than the one in the UK. Scientists insist there is no evidence of that, nor that the mutations here have made the virus deadlier.\nProf Rees said concern about the mutations in South Africa should add to global pressure for a swift roll-out of vaccines across the world, and not just to wealthier nations.\n\"As the new variants are already spreading to other countries, the importance of ensuring that vaccines remain effective against new variants is a global imperative,\" said Prof Rees.\nProf Barry Schoub, who chairs the government's advisory committee on vaccines, said the \"preliminary evidence\" from tests did not suggest that mutations would allow the virus to \"escape\" the impact of the current vaccines. \n\"The vaccines seem to be very effective,\" he said, citing laboratory tests that appeared to show the current vaccines still \"neutralise this new variant\".\nProf Madhi said the crucial laboratory experiments were yet to start and the efficacy of the vaccines would only be known \"over the next few weeks\"."

      "title": "Iran resumes enriching uranium to 20% purity at Fordo facility",
      "tags": "Iran,Iran nuclear deal",
      "text": "Iran has resumed enriching uranium to 20% purity, in its most significant breach yet of its 2015 deal with world powers to end nuclear sanctions.\nThe global nuclear watchdog confirmed the process had begun at the underground Fordo plant on Monday.\nEnriched uranium can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear bombs. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% purity.\nA US state department spokesperson accused Iran of pursuing a \"campaign of nuclear extortion\".\nIran, which insists that its nuclear programme is peaceful, has rolled back a number of commitments under the deal.\nIt has said it is retaliating for the US economic sanctions that were reinstated in 2018 by President Donald Trump when he abandoned the accord, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\nIn a separate development, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they had seized a South Korean-flagged chemical tanker in the Gulf \"due to the repeated infringement of maritime environmental laws\". \nSouth Korea's foreign ministry demanded its immediate release of the Hankuk Chemi and said a South Korean anti-piracy unit stationed in the Strait of Hormuz had been dispatched to the area.\nIranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei told media the process of enriching uranium to 20% had started at Fordo.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani had ordered the move because he was \"bound\" by a new law requiring the production and storage of at least 120kg (265lbs) of 20%-enriched uranium annually for peaceful purposes, he said.\nIran's parliament passed the law following the assassination in late November of the country's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, which Iranian leaders blamed on Israel.\nLater on Monday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Iran's move in a report to member states.\n\"Iran today began feeding uranium already enriched up to 4.1% U-235 into six centrifuge cascades at the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant for further enrichment up to 20%,\" a statement said.\nSome experts see the announcement as an attempt to put pressure on Joe Biden, who is due to succeed Mr Trump as president on 20 January.   \nMr Biden has said he will consider rejoining the nuclear deal so long as Iran returns to full compliance and commits to further negotiations.\nThe state department spokesperson said: \"Iran enriching uranium to 20% at Fordow is a clear attempt to increase its campaign of nuclear extortion, an attempt that will continue to fail.\" \nEU spokesman Peter Stano said Iran's move constituted \"a considerable departure from Iran's nuclear commitments under the JCPOA with serious nuclear non-proliferation implications\".\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, one of Iran's main opponents in the Middle East, said the Iranian decision could not be \"explained in any way except as continued realisation of its intention to develop a military nuclear programme\". \n\"Israel will not allow Iran to manufacture nuclear weapons,\" he added. \nEnriched uranium is produced by feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges to separate out the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235.\nLow-enriched uranium, which typically has a 3-5% purity of U-235, can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants.\nHighly enriched uranium has a concentration of 20% or more and is used in research reactors. \nUnder the nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to a 3.67% purity; to stockpile no more than 300kg (660lbs) of the material; to operate no more than 5,060 of its oldest and least efficient centrifuges; and was required to cease enrichment at Fordo altogether.\nBut Iran has taken steps to \"reduce\" those commitments since Mr Trump reinstated US sanctions to compel it to negotiate a replacement of an agreement he said was \"defective at its core\".\nThe steps have included building up the stockpile of low-enriched uranium, producing 4.5%-enriched uranium, restarting advanced centrifuges, and resuming enrichment activities at Fordo.\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stressed on Monday that the measures were \"fully reversible upon full compliance by all\" parties.\nExperts at the Arms Control Association said last month that 120kg of uranium enriched to 20% was about half the amount of uranium that, when enriched to weapons-grade (90% or more), was necessary for one bomb. \nThey also warned that the production of highly enriched uranium would pose a more serious near-term proliferation risk. \nThat is because going from uranium's natural state of 0.7% concentration of U-235 to 20% takes about 90% of the total effort required to get to weapons-grade.\nBefore the nuclear deal, Iran had a sufficient amount of 20%-enriched uranium and number of centrifuges that its \"break-out time\" was estimated to be about two to three months. \nThe agreement slowed the \"break-out time\" to at least a year.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Welsh government,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic,Vaughan Gething",
      "text": "It has been described as a \"momentous day\" in the fight against Covid-19 as the rollout of the second Covid vaccine begins in Wales.\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething said the start of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine programme was \"a key milestone\" in the fight against Covid. \nThe Welsh Government said 40,000 doses will be available within the first two weeks - with 22,000 jabs this week.\nMore than 35,000 people in Wales have had a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose.\nThe number of mass vaccination centres in Wales will be increased to 22 and more than 60 GP surgeries will offer the Oxford vaccine - mobile units will also be set up throughout Wales.\nOne of the first people to receive the vaccine on Monday was Ralph Evans, 88, who was vaccinated at the Pontcae medical practice in Merthyr Tydfil.\nHe was one of eight people there to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Mr Evans said he was \"very grateful\" to be getting it. \nHe was followed by 86-year-old Derek Games, former mayor of Merthyr, who said: \"I'm delighted, I'm very privileged to have it.\"\nThe medical centre hopes to vaccinate 1,000 people by the end of January after being contacted on New Year's Eve about starting vaccinations.\n\"We received a hundred vaccines at lunchtime today,\" practice manager Kevin Rogers said. \"We hope to get through the hundred this week.\"\nMr Rogers said they would be asking staff to work additional hours on weekends to help reach the target of 1,000 people over the coming weeks.\nThe Welsh Government's priority is to vaccinate front-line health and social care staff, care home residents and staff, and people over 80.\nPlaid Cymru said \"serious questions\" remained about the roll-out plans, while a professor in palliative medicine said she was concerned \"at the very slow apparent roll out\" for those aged over 85.\nMari Lloyd Williams, from the University of Liverpool, said \"huge numbers have self-shielded since March\".\n\"Apart from intense loneliness this leads to loss of confidence and reduction in both physical and mental and cognitive well-being, meaning that some may need to enter full time care sooner,\" she said.\n\"We need to be vaccinating 24/7 in order to get this under control and to protect our most vulnerable.\"\nThe Pfizer vaccine has to be kept at -70C, but the Oxford jab can be stored at standard fridge temperatures so can be administered in doctors surgeries, pharmacies and care homes.\nDialysis patient Brian Pinker, 82, was the first person to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in Oxford.\n\"It is an absolutely momentous day,\" said Dr Gillian Richardson, who is leading the Covid vaccination programme in Wales.\n\"The vaccine has been prioritised for those groups where it has been harder to reach with the Pfizer vaccine - so we're prioritising the over 80s and care home staff and residents.\"\nMs Richardson said the pace of the rollout \"will be governed by supply\" and \"will start slowly this week but build vastly over the coming weeks and months.\"\nBoth vaccines require two doses to be administered with an interval of between four and 12 weeks - a change from the previous advice of four weeks between jabs.\nThe change has been \"very controversial\", according to one GP who will administer the Oxford vaccine, but she agrees with the decision.\n\"The evidence suggests that a longer time period between first dose and second booster gives you better immunity,\" said Dr Rowena Christmas, a Monmouthshire GP whose surgery is part of the rollout pilot.\n\"The key thing is we need to protect people. If we gave 1,000 second doses of the Pfizer vaccine next week then that's 1,000 people who won't get the first protection.\n\"As soon as you have the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, within about 10 days you've got 70% protection from coronavirus.\n\"But if you are in the 30% that does catch it, you're much less likely to get severely ill and much less likely to go to hospital.\n\"We are in a crisis situation and we have to protect as many people as we possibly can.\"\nWales is under \"stay at home\" lockdown restrictions after a rise in Covid-19 cases - with more than 31,000 cases in Wales in the two weeks over the Christmas period.\nThere are almost 2,700 people with coronavirus symptoms in Welsh hospitals - with \"more than half\" of the 208 critical care patients having Covid.\nBut Mr Gething said Wales' overall Covid incidence rate had fallen from a high of 636 cases per 100,000 people before the lockdown started to 446 cases on Monday.\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas with nine out of the top 10 of the UK's most infected counties in Wales.\nLatest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK.\n\"Cases of the virus remain very high\" although rates had fallen back from the incredibly high levels from just before Christmas,\" said Mr Gething.\nThe British Medical Association in Wales said there was concern among staff that a 12-week gap between doses could lead to \"sacrificing some immunity\" because trials had involved a shorter gap. \nBut First Minister Mark Drakeford said the longer time between doses and the rollout of a second jab would see the pace of vaccinations increase.\n\"By the end of the month we will be doing in a day what we've been able to do in a week prior to Christmas, maybe more than that,\" he said.\nUnlike the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is stored at normal vaccine fridge temperatures so will have fewer storage and transport issues, making it much easier to use in care homes and GP surgeries.\n\"This is a game changer in the fight against Covid, it's absolutely huge,\" Dr Christmas, principal GP at the Wye Valley Practice, told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We need this vaccine because it's easy to give. We can now all get involved and start this rollout of this crucial vaccination programme.\"\nThe Welsh Government said every health board in Wales will receive its allocation in proportion to the size of its priority population and ability to deliver.\nBut it warned the effects of the vaccines may not be seen nationally for many months and the advice remained to keep contacts with others to a minimum, keep a two-metre distance from others, wash hands regularly, wear a face covering where required and avoid touching surfaces others have touched. \nPeople have also been asked not to phone their GP, pharmacy or hospital to ask when they will get a vaccine and wait for a letter which \"will provide people with a measure of assurance\" and will explain how they will be contacted.\nMr Gething said: \"Today marks a key milestone in our fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\"Its approval will help us to speed up our vaccination programme and run more clinics closer to people's homes\".\nWhile Plaid Cymru are \"pleased\" with the second vaccine rollout, health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"Wales has been behind every other UK nation in terms of numbers vaccinated and there's far too much variation from region to region - Welsh Government must not allow a postcode lottery.\" \nThe Welsh Conservatives previously criticised the speed of the first vaccine rollout, saying hope had \"dropped away\" for many over 80 who were \"desperately waiting for their appointment\". \nThe rollout of the new vaccine will be another injection of hope at a time when it's so desperately needed.\nAt least 22,000 doses will be available in Wales this week followed at least another 20,000 next week.\nThe hope is then to ramp up its distribution as supplies arrive, so that around 1.5 million people in Wales at greatest risk of getting really ill from Covid, for example older people or those who have long term health conditions,  can get a jab within the next few months.\nBecause it can be stored for much longer in a normal fridge, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is easier to deliver in places like GP surgeries and care homes than the other Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.\nGetting both vaccines out is now a race against time."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has said there is \"no question\" the government will announce stricter measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus \"in due course\".\nHe predicted \"tough, tough\" weeks to come, with more than three-quarters of England's population already under the highest - tier four - restrictions.\nOn Sunday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the sixth day in a row.\nLabour is calling for new England-wide restrictions to come in immediately.\nLeader Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"inevitable\" more schools would have to close to lessen the spread of coronavirus.\nIn Scotland, further new restrictions are to come into force at midnight, including a \"legal requirement\" for people to stay at home. except for essential purposes. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland was effectively returning to conditions similar to Spring's nation-wide lockdown, with the curbs in place until at least the end of January. \nAn additional 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported across the UK on Sunday, meaning the total by this measure is now above 75,000. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the \"old tier system\" in England was \"no longer strong enough\" to contain increasing infections.\nHospitals are coming under increasing pressure, as cases mount up.\nThe old tier system is no longer enough\u2026the figures are only heading in one direction.\nThese are the words of the health secretary and a health minister.\nBoris Johnson says stricter measures are coming, which immediately sparks the questions \"when?,\" and \"what are you waiting for?\"\nDowning Street wants to push a tougher message on adherence to the current rules in England while it assesses the latest Christmas data, but is coming under growing pressure to act sooner.\nWith Nicola Sturgeon about to go further in Scotland and the Labour leader calling for an immediate national lockdown, it's difficult to see how the prime minister can wait much longer.                    \nAsked what further restrictions would be put in place, Mr Johnson said: \"What we have been waiting for is to see the impact of the tier four measures on the virus and it is a bit unclear, still, at the moment.\n\"But if you look at the numbers, there is no question that we are going to have to take tougher measures and we will be announcing those in due course.\" \nHe said the faster-spreading coronavirus variant that has developed in south-eastern England required \"extra-special vigilance\".\nBBC science editor David Shukman said new measures could include limits on outdoor exercise and a return to the two-metre (rather than one-metre-plus) social distancing rule, as applied during the first lockdown last year.\nSpeaking on a visit to Chase Farm Hospital in north London, the prime minister argued that closing primary schools must remain a \"last resort\", adding that the \"risk to kids\" was \"very, very small\".\nSecondary schools in England are currently closed until 18 January, except for pupils in their final GCSE and A-level years, who are due to return on 11 January.\nAsked whether they could remain closed, Mr Johnson said: \"We are keeping things under review.\"\nBut former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged the government to close all schools and UK borders \"right away\", while banning \"all household mixing\".\nThe Conservative MP, who now chairs the Commons Health Committee, said these restrictions should be \"time-limited\" to \"12 weeks or so\", after which the roll-out of vaccines would provide \"light at the end of the tunnel\".\nMore than 500,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine are now available for use, with the Pfizer BioNTech jab having been issued since early last month.\nThe virus is winning at the moment, despite science fighting back with a vaccine. New daily cases of Covid have been rising to record levels, which means hospital numbers and deaths will increase too.\nMinisters say more measures are coming, but it is not clear yet what that will mean in practice.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are already in lockdown, and most of England is under tier four rules.\nIn recent days the focus has shifted to schools and whether they can be kept open without making the epidemic worse.\nExperts agree that the risk the virus poses to children is still low, but they can spread the disease.\nWith a new, more transmissible variant of Covid circulating, the government may have to enact this unpalatable \"last resort\" of closing classrooms. \nSome 78% of the population of England is now in tier four, under which non-essential shops are closed and people can only leave their homes for a certain number of reasons. \nThe Scottish government meets later to consider \"further action\", with all of mainland Scotland currently under its own level four restrictions - only some islands are under less stringent tier three measures. \nWales entered a nationwide lockdown on 20 December, while Northern Ireland is in the second week of a six-week lockdown that began on Boxing Day.\nIn another development, an academic has said there is a \"big question mark\" over whether a vaccine developed at Oxford University will be as effective against a new variant of the virus that has emerged in South Africa.\nProf Sir John Bell, Regius professor of medicine at the university, said the team there were currently investigating this question \"right now\". \nHe added it was \"unlikely\" the variant would \"turn off the effect of vaccines entirely\", and in any case it would be possible to tweak the vaccine in around four to six weeks.\nBut Matt Hancock told Today he was \"incredibly worried\" about the South African variant, saying: \"This is a very, very significant problem.\"\n\"We have shown that we are prepared to move incredibly quickly, within 24 hours if we think that is necessary, and we keep these things under review all the time,\" added the health secretary."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday morning. \nBoris Johnson is expected to announce new national restrictions for England, similar to the March lockdown, as the UK picture continues to look bleak. For the seventh consecutive day, the number of new cases recorded is above 50,000 - 58,784 on Monday, with 407 new deaths. In a televised address at 20:00 GMT, the PM is likely to urge the public to follow the new rules from midnight. The national Covid alert level has increased to five - its highest level - and pressure has been mounting on ministers, who admit England's tier system is not strong enough to contain the new, more contagious variant. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer is leading calls for imminent nationwide lockdowns like the ones in March, with the PM himself saying there is . Parliament is being recalled early from its Christmas break so as to be able to vote on any new measures on Wednesday.\nMainland Scotland will enter a strict new lockdown from midnight, with people ordered by law to stay at home.  Schools will remain closed to pupils until February. Announcing the changes, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said new laws will require people to stay at home and work from home where possible. Outdoor gatherings are also to be cut back, with people only allowed to meet one person from one other household. Places of worship are to be closed and group exercise banned. There have been 1,905 new cases reported in Scotland on Monday - with 15% of tests returning a positive result, something Ms Sturgeon said \"illustrates the severity and urgency of the situation\". Read more on the latest Covid rules in Scotland. \nAll schools in Wales will stay shut until 18 January, with pupils to be taught online only, the Welsh Government has announced. It comes after Scotland's similar move announced earlier, and as pressure mounts for England to follow suit. Teachers' unions there have written a joint letter to the government accusing it of \"creating chaos\" and calling for the return of pupils and teachers after the Christmas break to be paused. It followed what head teachers said was a \"confusing picture\" as many schools stayed shut this morning, despite the government urging parents to send children in where they were open. \nA group of Covid-19 \"deniers\" were removed from a hospital by security guards after going there to take pictures of empty corridors to post on social media to back up their claims that there is no crisis, according to its chief executive. Describing the incident at Colchester Hospital, where the intensive care unit is running at maximum capacity because of the virus, Nick Hulme said it \"beggars belief\" some people were calling the pandemic a hoax. \"Of course there are empty corridors at the weekend in outpatients, because that's the right thing to do,\" he added. \nMusic seems to have been crucial in lifting people's mood during lockdown, according to figures from record label body the BPI. More than 155m albums were bought or streamed in 2020, an increase of 8.2%. British artists Lewis Capaldi, Harry Styles and Dua Lipa were the three biggest-sellers of the year. BPI boss Geoff Taylor said the \"remarkable\" figures were a reminder of \"how important music is to our country, even when our lives are disrupted\". However, despite the boom in consumption, sales of individual albums were down. For the first time since 1973, not a single album released in the last 12 months was certified platinum - representing 300,000 sales, suggesting listeners are seeking out a more diverse range of music on streaming services, which now account for 80.6% of music consumption in the UK. \nGet a longer coronavirus briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\n... if you're wondering when you might be able to get the Covid vaccine read our guide here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "The inauguration of a new president is a day that usually follows decades of custom and precedent. A day that follows a routine set in stone. Well, you can forget all that this year.\nJoe Biden and Kamala Harris will still take the oath, of course, to make them officially US president and vice-president, but this will be a much scaled back affair, due to Covid and the recent riots.\nHere's everything you need to know about the big day. \nThe inauguration is the formal ceremony that marks the start of a new presidency, and it takes place in Washington DC. \nThe only required feature is that the president-elect recite the presidential oath of office.\n\"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" \nOnce he utters these words, Mr Biden will then take his place as the 46th president and the inauguration will be complete (but that's not all - celebrations follow). \nKamala Harris will become vice-president once she takes the oath of office, which usually happens just before the president.\nOpening remarks are usually scheduled for around 11:30 EST (16:30 GMT) and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn in around midday. By law, inauguration day is always 20 January.\nMr Biden will move into the White House later in the day - his home for the next four years. \nPresidential inaugurations typically involve detailed security plans, but even more so now, after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol on 6 January. \nOfficials have ramped up security and closed off large sections of the city. The Secret Service has taken command of the security plans, backed up by some 25,000 National Guard troops, in addition to thousands of police officers. \nWashington DC is already under a state of emergency and will remain that way through inauguration. \nAgent Matt Miller, who is leading the security effort on behalf of the Secret Service, told reporters on Friday that planning for the event has been going on for over a year.\nAnd while Mr Biden has insisted on taking the oath of office outside, as is tradition, attendance to the event will be scaled back. \nIt's become customary for the outgoing president to watch the next in line being sworn in, which can sometimes make things awkward. This year, it will be a different type of awkward - the outgoing president will be a no-show. \n\"To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,\" Mr Trump tweeted on 8 January. He is widely expected to be travelling to his Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago.\nSome of his supporters say they are planning a virtual \"second inauguration\" for Mr Trump on the same day (and time) that Mr Biden takes office. More than 68,000 people said on Facebook they would attend an online event to show their support for Mr Trump.  Facebook said it removed this event the week before the inauguration, because it violated its policies.\nWhen Mr Trump was sworn in, Hillary Clinton joined her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at the inauguration - just two months after her election defeat and a bitter campaign against Mr Trump. \nOnly three presidents - John Adams, John Quincy Adams and Andrew Johnson - have actively chosen to sit out their successor's inaugurations, and none in the last century.\nVice-President Mike Pence, however, has said that he will attend. \nIn normal circumstances, Washington DC would see hundreds of thousands of people flock to the city, swarming the National Mall and selling out hotels - an estimated two million came when President Obama was sworn in for his first term in 2009. \nBut this year, the celebration's size will be \"extremely limited\", the Biden team has said, and it has urged Americans to avoid travelling to the capital, a call that has been repeated by DC authorities following the storming of Congress.  Viewing stands that had been constructed along the parade route have been taken down. \nOne tradition that will be preserved is that Mr Biden and Ms Harris will still take their oaths in front of the US Capitol, overlooking the Mall (a tradition that started with President Ronald Reagan in 1981). About 200 people will sit, socially distanced, on the stage with them, the Washington Post reports.\nThere will be masks and everybody on the platform will have to be tested within a couple of days of the event itself, it added. As for the moment of the swearing in itself, Mr Biden said back in June that he would not wear one to take the presidential oath.\nIn the past, up to 200,000 tickets were up for grabs to attend the official ceremony, but with infections still surging across the US, only around 1,000 tickets will be available. \nThis year, there will still be a \"pass in review\" ceremony - a traditional part of the peaceful transfer of power, where the new commander in chief inspects the troops, but instead of the usual parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, organisers say they will host a \"virtual parade\" across the US.\nMr Biden, Ms Harris and their spouses will then be escorted to the White House by members of the military, including a band and drum corps. \nTickets are required for seated and standing areas near the stage and seats along the parade route in normal years, and traditionally, the rest of the National Mall remained open to the public. \nSo if you want to watch the inaugural ceremonies from up close, you'll need to talk to your local representatives first. \nInaugural balls and other related events around the city require separate tickets.\nSenators and members of Congress are the keepers of the keys. Each has an allotted number of free tickets that they can distribute. \nThis year's pandemic-restricted number amounts to each lawmaker plus a guest. Commemorative tickets will be available for constituents after inauguration day. \nIn recent years, incoming presidents have added some of the country's most beloved performers to the day's programme. Despite the pandemic, this year won't be any different. \nMr Biden and Ms Harris will be joined by Lady Gaga - an active supporter of the incoming president - who will sing the national anthem, and Jennifer Lopez will sing during the ceremony's musical performance. \nAfter Mr Biden is sworn in, actor Tom Hanks will host 90-minutes of primetime television - a Covid-friendly replacement of celebrations typically held in-person.\nIt will feature Garth Brooks, Jon Bon Jovi, Demi Lovato and Justin Timberlake and will be broadcast across all major US networks and streaming platforms - with the exception of Fox News, a conservative network that has primarily supported Mr Trump during his presidency. \nIn 2009, Aretha Franklin sang at Barack Obama's inauguration, performing My Country 'Tis of Thee. Beyonc\u00e9 was also present, singing At Last to the first couple at Mr Obama's inaugural ball. \nAt his second inauguration in 2013, President Obama called on Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson to do the honours. Beyonc\u00e9 was back again, this time to sing the national anthem. \nDonald Trump reportedly had more trouble booking performers. Elton John declined Mr Trump's offer to perform, and reports circulated that Celine Dion, Kiss and Garth Brooks did the same. In the end, the Rockettes, country artist Lee Greenwood, and the band 3 Doors Down turned out for Mr Trump's day. "

We need to create space for the vaccine now, to be rolled out safely. \n\"The virus is out of control. We have got to get it back under control. The more we delay, the worse it will be. The more we delay, the longer schools will be closed.\"\nIn March last year, Boris Johnson told people in England they could only leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work when it is \"absolutely necessary\", shop for essential items and fulfil any medical or care needs.\nCurrently, shops selling non-essential goods have been told to shut and gatherings in public of more than two people who do not live together are prohibited in tier four areas.\nSir Keir said the government's message needed to be firmer and backed by law, if necessary, to encourage people to comply.\nIn an interview with the BBC's deputy political editor Vicki Young, he urged the country to get back to \"the spirit of March, where there was a very strong stay at home message\". \n\"You only need to go out on the streets now and you see lots of people out and about, you see trains that are half full,\" said the Labour leader. \n\"We need to go back to where we were in March with very very strong messaging about staying at home. \n\"And I'm afraid that the closure of schools is now inevitable, and therefore that needs to be part of that plan, as part of the national plan for further restriction. \n\"And that means that we need to have measures in place to protect working parents, most in place to enable children to learn at home, and a plan to get schools safely reopened again and that goes back to vaccination. It must be mission critical now.\""

      "text": "All eyes are on the southern state of Georgia, where the future of the US Senate will be decided this week. Here's all you need to know.\nThere are two races and voting has been going on since mid-December.\nThe outcome will be crucial to how much the incoming Democratic president, Joe Biden, will be able to achieve in his first term.\nWait, another US election?  Wasn't all this done in November? \nOK, rewind.\nAccording to the state rules, a winning candidate needs 50% of the votes and in November no-one achieved that.\nSo the top two go through to a 5 January replay - a so-called run-off.\nIn both races, we have a Republican incumbent up against a Democratic newcomer. \nSenator David Perdue, 70, v Jon Ossoff, 33\nMr Perdue has served as a Georgia senator since 2015. The former Reebok CEO was an early supporter of Donald Trump, and has remained an ally to the president. He is now facing scrutiny over multimillion dollar stock trades in companies whose business falls under his purview on Senate committees. He has denied wrongdoing.\nMr Ossoff launched his campaign with an endorsement from civil rights champion John Lewis, who died this summer. Before taking the reins of a documentary film company, Insight TWI, he spent five years working for Congressman Hank Johnson, an Atlanta Democrat. He has employed his filmmaking skills on the trail, launching campaign accounts on both Snapchat and TikTok.\nSenator Kelly Loeffler, 50, v Reverend Raphael Warnock, 51\nMs Loeffler, the junior Georgia senator, is still a political novice. She was named to the US Senate in December 2019 by Governor Brian Kemp after the sitting senator resigned. One of the wealthiest members of the Senate, Ms Loeffler is co-owner of the women's NBA team the Atlanta Dream. The ownership has caused a stir after the league's players called for Ms Loeffler to sell her stake over her vocal opposition to Black Lives Matter.\nRev Warnock is a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr once preached. Along with Democratic rising star Stacey Abrams, he started the New Georgia Project, a voting rights organisation. The group is now under investigation by Georgia's Republican secretary of state for allegedly sending ballot applications to non-residents.\nThe upper chamber of US Congress, the Senate, has been controlled by the Republican Party since 2014.\nIt's very important in getting laws passed, Cabinet appointments confirmed and Supreme Court Justices on to the bench of the highest court.\nIf Democrats win in Georgia, the extra two seats would give them effective control.\nEach party would have 50 senators and it's become increasingly rare for senators to vote against their party. \nTechnically, there are currently 46 Democrats and two independent Senators - Bernie Sanders and Angus King - but they typically vote with Democrats.\nSo in a 50-50 tie, Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris would have the deciding vote in her role as Senate president.\nIf Democrats pick up the two seats and forge a 50-50 tie in the upper chamber, it's far from certain that Biden will be able to enact the kind of sweeping legislation on the environment, healthcare and the economy that he proposed during his successful presidential campaign. \nThe narrowness of the margin will ensure that any laws will have to be supported by centrists like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Arizona's two senators.\nIt will, however, give the new president a fighting chance at legislative accomplishments - and make it significantly easier for him to appoint the administration officials and federal judges of his choice.\nIf the Republicans hold on, then that would mean two more years of divided government and, probably, legislative gridlock. Democratic hopes will rest on the whims of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a handful of Republican moderates.\nA huge amount of money has poured in for all four candidates, but record-breaking numbers for the Democrats.\nThe Loeffler-Warnock race has received more media attention, partly because it's been more feisty and vocal.\nShe accuses him of being a \"radical liberal\" who courts Marxism and wants to defund the police.\nHe sticks to a pretty centrist Democratic message of pandemic relief and healthcare.\nWith his MLK Jr links, Rev Warnock is well known among African Americans and the state has a higher proportion of black voters than the average US state.\nThe state is around 52% non-Latino white and 33% black, according to 2019 census data.\nBlack residents made up nearly half of the 1.9 million increase in Georgia's voting population since 2000, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2019, 2.5 million black voters made up a third of the total Georgia electorate. \nThe Biden-Harris win in the state was the first time in 30 years Georgia went to a Democratic presidential candidate.\nOn election-eve, President Donald Trump held a rally to support the two Republicans, urging them to turn out. Mr Perdue, however, participated virtually after coming into contact with a Covid-positive individual. He and his wife have tested negative, but have remained in quarantine.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden campaigned on behalf of the two Democrats on 4 January as well, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris travelling to the state a day earlier.\nA Democrat has not won in a Senate race in Georgia for decades so it will be an uphill struggle for them.\nThe Republican candidates also won more votes in both races when it was a larger field in November.\nBut Mr Biden narrowly won there in the presidential contest by tapping into an effective get-out-to-vote campaign among African Americans.\nVoting began weeks ago and early indications suggest a high turnout, possibly a record for a run-off in the state.\nBallot counting will begin at 19:00 local time on Tuesday, once polls close, though there could be a wait for results.\nPolling shows a very tight contest in both races even with less than a day left, though many are looking at polls with scepticism, as they missed the mark during the presidential election. \nA number of big pollsters have also opted not to cover the run-off races."

They remain in custody.\nHighdown School and Sixth Form Centre head teacher Rachel Cave described the boy's death as a \"total tragedy\".\nIn a statement, she said: \"This student was part of our community and many students and staff knew him well.\n\"Many have been deeply affected by this tragedy. \n\"In normal circumstances we would open the school and welcome in students for support before the start of the term. \n\"We are currently unable to do this, of course, but are arranging counselling support and will be establishing an electronic book of condolence.\"\nMs Cave said the school was \"a supportive and close-knit community\" which would \"work together over the coming days and weeks\".\nDet Supt Kevin Brown, of Thames Valley Police, said: \"Our thoughts remain with Olly's family at this incredibly difficult time.\"\nHe added: \"This is a tragic and shocking incident which has resulted in the death of a young boy.\"\nThe victim's family are being supported by specially trained officers.\nOfficers were called just before 16:00 GMT on Sunday following reports of an attack.\nOfficers are appealing for anyone who was in the area between 15:00 and 16:30 who might have taken photos or camera footage to contact them if they notice anything suspicious.\nDet Supt Brown said he believed there would have been witnesses to the \"dreadful incident\" as the area is popular with dog walkers.\nA man said his wife was walking their dog through the park on Sunday afternoon when she saw a boy on the ground with several people around him trying to give him first aid. \nAnother dog walker said she saw a group of young people standing in the woods in Bugs Bottom fields at about 15:30 and described it as \"slightly unusual\". \nReading East MP Matt Rodda has offered his \"deepest condolences\" to the boy's family. \nSt Barnabas Church in Emmer Green has invited residents to pray and light a candle in memory of the boy.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "Scotland should be prepared for Covid restrictions to be extended as infection rates continue to rise, a public health expert has said. \nThe latest government figures show a further 2,137 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Scotland on Friday. \nProf Linda Bauld described it as a \"fragile situation\", despite the rate dropping below Thursday's 2,539 cases. \nThe latest figures for hospital admissions and deaths will not be published until Tuesday.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned on Friday that the next few weeks could be the most dangerous period for Scotland since March in the fight against Covid as the new variant of the virus was \"accelerating spread\" across Scotland.\nDaily confirmed cases reached record highs on the last three days of 2020, rising to to 2,622 on Thursday.\nThe percentage of positive cases also reached 14.4% on Wednesday - the highest it has been since the second wave of the pandemic began in the summer.\nIt had dropped to 10.8% on Friday. A percentage of lower than 5% is needed to show the virus is under control, according to the WHO. \nProf Bauld, a public health expert at the University of Edinburgh, said there were no signs yet that the infection rate was levelling off, having risen suddenly from a daily rate of fewer than 1,000 to more than 2,000 per day in recent days.\nShe told BBC Scotland: \"It definitely is a fragile situation and you can see that we have more cases than we would expect at the current time. \n\"We may be starting to see some of the impacts of the Christmas mixing, but also we know around four in 10 cases, from recent data, are of the new variant. \n\"I would imagine that the new variant is playing a role in these higher rates of infection and if these numbers continue to sit at where they are we are going to have more people in hospital in a week or two's time, and that is very worrying.\"\nThis would bring \"real challenges\" for hospitals, especially in the central belt, Prof Bauld said, adding that it was \"absolutely imperative that we do not see these number rise more than they are now\". \nShe said it would take some time to see the impact of level four restrictions introduced in mainland Scotland on Boxing Day. \n\"Mentally we just need to be prepared for the fact that we may be living with the level four restrictions for longer than the Scottish government currently plans,\" Prof Bauld said. \nShe said the new, more transmissible coronavirus variant would make it harder to get the R number below one in Scotland and schools may not be able to fully reopen on 18 January.\nThe government's education recovery group was preparing with schools for blended learning to go on longer if necessary, she added. \nAll of mainland Scotland is under level four restrictions in an attempt to slow down the rate of virus spread. \nA new study by London's Imperial College has found that the new variant of Covid-19 is \"hugely\" more transmissible than the virus's previous version.\nIt concludes that the new variant increases the Reproduction or R number by between 0.4 and 0.7.\nThe Scottish government's most recent estimate of the R number in Scotland has put it between 0.9 and 1.1. It needs to be below 1.0 for the number of cases to start falling.\nThe government has described the vaccination programme as a \"light at the end of the tunnel\" and has urged people to stay at home as much as possible in the meantime."

      "text": "Closing schools will be a \"last resort\" that depends on scientific evidence, Wales' health minister has said.\nSome schools are due to welcome pupils back this week as the Welsh Government comes under fire from teachers' unions.\nHealth minister Vaughan Gething said: \"If the evidence changes then we'll have to take account of that... and that may lead to a different choice.\"\nEvidence is expected shortly on the new Covid-19 variant, but local authorities have control over schools re-opening.\nUnder a \"flexible\" agreement with the Welsh Government some schools are due to open on Wednesday, local authorities said.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has defended this flexibility that leaves the decision with local authorities on when to allow children back to school.\nBut, unions have threatened legal action because of concerns about the new variant.\nAt Monday's coronavirus press briefing, Mr Gething said schools will continue with the phased return to face-to-face learning over the first two weeks of the new term unless the \"evidence changes\".\n\"The plan is for schools to open in a flexible way\u2026 we made a choice before the Christmas break to have this flexible approach to opening, so we can learn and try to understand more of what is happening,\" he said. \n\"Now, if we get evidence and advice today, then that is advice we may well need to act upon today or tomorrow.\"\nHe stressed that decisions on schools \"are always underpinned by evidence\".\nClosing primary schools \"has a real impact on people being able to go to work\" and online learning is \"practically more difficult\" for younger pupils, he added.\nSchools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers while other pupils are taught online until face-to-face teaching resumes.\nThe Trades' Union Congress - the UK's umbrella union body - has called for parents who are juggling their work lives with childcare should be put on furlough as long as schools are closed.\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said there had to be as much \"advance warning as possible\" on any plans to change the return to school. \n\"I feel for students and I feel for teachers and here we are on the first day of term with a lack of assurance of what's coming down the line,\" he said.  \nThe Ynys Mon MS said the Welsh Government should make a statement on \"what the impact is\" of the new variant on schools so that schools can plan.\n\"It cannot be an end to education - it must be a move to full online education\", he added.  \nWith Covid-19 cases rising in early December, Education Minister Kirsty Williams announced all secondary schools and further education colleges in Wales would move to online learning as part of a \"national effort to reduce transmission of coronavirus\".\nThe move was criticised by children's commissioner for Wales Sally Holland, who said it was disruptive to education.\nBut many parents had already started withdrawing their children from school early due to fears of having to self-isolate over Christmas.\nA week later, the Welsh Local Government Association said children would return to school on a staggered basis after the Christmas break, with a full return expected by 18 January.\nThis sparked outrage from teachers' unions, who said schools would \"yet again\" have to \"pick up the pieces of a last-minute announcement\".\nAmelie Boyce, a sixth form student at Neath College, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast she had been enjoying online learning and felt \"a bit more worried I think for going back to college than I was maybe last term because obviously the virus is a lot more dangerous now\".\nBut she added it was more difficult working in her bedroom at home as \"that's the place where I relax most of the time, so it's not really a working environment\".\nTim Newbould, head teacher at Penycae Community Primary School in Wrexham, said he had mixed feelings about the return to school, but welcomed the flexibility given by the Welsh Government.\n\"We don't know yet the impact of Christmas Day,\" he said.\nHe added six of his staff had been off following positive Covid tests and \"a number of us have been quite poorly, so we're well aware of the risks.\"\nMr Newbould said absence from school had an obvious impact on pupils' academic progress, but there was also the effect on socialising with peers, \"which is really important and has an impact on pupils' mental health and wellbeing\".\nBut he stresses \"safety is the key issue\", particularly in light of the new variant of the virus, and that teachers and school staff should receive the vaccine early on.\n\"We simply don't know whether our risk assessments are adequate for the new variant of the virus,\" he said.\n\"We're right in front of a large number of pupils at the same time, breathing the same air.\"\nCeri Reed, from the group Parents Voices in Wales, said many members are worried about the danger of the new variant of the virus. \n\"I have to admit, we are divided in our group. We represent over 720 parents and carers in Wales, and I think the main concern from those parents who are not considering sending their children into school is because of the new strain,\" she said.\n\"We are encouraging parents to look at the science, and we need to applaud what the teachers have done from September onwards with things like track and trace. \n\"They have been absolutely phenomenal and we believe we can do it again.\"\nOn 19 December, Mr Drakeford scrapped plans for a five-day relaxation of lockdown rules over Christmas amid concerns about the spread of a more virulent variant of coronavirus.\nCouncils pressed on with the plans for a staggered reopening of schools, with the majority of local authorities intending to reopen secondary schools next Monday.\nSchools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers from this week, and all pupils are expected to take part in remote learning before their schools reopen for face-to-face teaching.\nOn Saturday, the NASUWT teachers' union threatened \"appropriate action\" to protect teachers, and the head teachers' union NAHT Cymru said it had taken legal action against the Welsh Government to obtain scientific evidence on the risks of the new variant it said it was \"withholding\".\nThe National Education Union Cymru had already called for in-person learning to be delayed until at least 18 January.\nThe unions say more time is needed to assess the risks posed by the new variant and have accused the Welsh Government of \"passing the buck\" to local authorities.\nOn Sunday, a joint statement from nine unions called for a national decision on reopening schools rather than leaving it to local councils.\nIn response, Mr Drakeford said there was \"no evidence that young people get the illness more severely as a result of the variant\", adding that the Welsh Government's technical advisory group \"will be looking at all the evidence again early next week\".\nHowever Dilwyn Roberts-Young, general secretary of Undeb Cenedlaethol Athrawon Cymru (UCAC), told BBC Wales Breakfast the evidence around transmission rates in schools did not instil confidence. \n\"We have listened to the first minister's comments about young people getting the illness more severely,\" he said. \n\"Schools aren't in a vacuum - there are adults in the school, there are older pupils, and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Wales Dr Chris Jones, said just before Christmas that high numbers of incidents continue to be reported, mainly in residential care homes and school settings.\n\"Looking at the evidence again... it does not give confidence to parents, to staff or to pupils, and if you look at last March, when the education minister talked about the five guiding principles to determine when schools should return to providing education, there was an emphasis on evidence and information, to ensure that any decisions taken are the correct ones.\""

      "text": "Up to 11,000 people aged over 80 across Northern Ireland are set to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine this week.\nThe aim is to ensure everyone in that age group will be offered the vaccine by the end of January.\nThirty GP practices will be administering 50,000 doses of the vaccine, which was approved for use in the UK on 30 December.\nIt is the second vaccine to be approved in the battle against coronavirus in Northern Ireland.\nIt comes ahead of a UK-wide announcement by the prime minister, set to be made at 20:00 GMT on Monday, in which further restrictions will be announced.  \nIn a statement, a No 10 spokesman said the new variant of Covid-19 had \"led to rapidly escalating case numbers across the country\" and \"further steps must now be taken to arrest this rise\".\nOn Monday, Northern Ireland recorded a further 1,801 Covid-19 cases and 12 more virus-related deaths. \nThese latest figures from the Department of Health bring the total number of deaths to 1,366, while 79,873 people have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic started. \nMore than 12,000 cases have been reported in the past seven days, more than double the week before.\nThe seven-day rate per 100,000 people is now 660 positive cases, compared to 200 per 100,000 two weeks ago.\nMedical experts believe that is down to the two-week easing of restrictions over the Christmas period.\nIn the Republic of Ireland on Monday, an additional 6,110 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were announced, with six further deaths linked to the virus.\nNorthern Ireland is in the second week of a six-week lockdown in which non-essential retail is closed.\nThe first doses of the vaccine were given delivered at a GP surgery on the Falls Road in West Belfast on Monday afternoon. \nThe first person in Northern Ireland to receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine was 94-year-old Eileen Lynch.\nSpeaking after receiving the vaccine, Ms Lynch said she was \"delighted and privileged\" to receive it. \n\"I feel like I can really look forward to the year ahead now that I have been vaccinated,\" she said. \nThe Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has already been used to vaccinate care home residents and staff.\nBy mid December, 50,000 doses of that vaccine had been made available and by 30 December, Northern Ireland's Department of Health reported that 33,000 people had been vaccinated.\nThis included 8,940 care home residents, 10,484 care home staff and 14,259 health and social care staff. \nAccording to the latest NI statistics, for the first time the percentage positive cases in the over 80s is down - an indication the vaccination process is working.   \nThere are approximately 82,000 people over 80 in NI and BBC News NI understands that if deliveries of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine happen as planned, it is thought that all of those over 80, as well as GPs and their staff, could be vaccinated within three weeks. \nWhile 50,000 doses have been delivered to Northern Ireland, a further 23,000 vaccines are expected on 19 January while another 68,000 are due on 24 January.\nDr Alan Stout, who is a GP in Belfast, told BBC News NI that members are \"very optimistic\" that 11,000 people can be vaccinated this week.\nNI's chief medical officer said the Oxford-AstraZeneca rollout would run alongside the ongoing vaccination programme.\nDr Michael McBride said: \"First and foremost we must act to protect those most at risk of severe disease and death.  \n\"The evidence shows that the initial dose of vaccine offers as much as 70% protection against the effects of the virus. \n\"Providing that level of protection on a large scale will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality and hospitalisations, protecting the health and social care system.\"\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has to be kept at an extremely low temperature which complicates handling constraints.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is considered easier to store and distribute.\nIts rollout consists of two full doses of the vaccine, with the second dose to be given four to 12 weeks after the first.\nGPs are appealing to the public to remain calm and wait to be called for their vaccine either by telephone or by letter.\nDr Stout said as demand grows worldwide for the vaccine, that schedule could easily change.    \n\"The public have to be patient, we have a system and must be allowed to get on with it - it really is 'don't call us - we will call you'.\" \nWhile some vaccinations will take place in surgeries others will happen in a drive-through system.\nCovid-19 is deadlier than flu, which means January 2021 is going to be even tougher than usual. \nAlso, Covid patients tend to stay much longer in hospital with more severe symptoms requiring additional beds and care. \nBut those rising patient numbers aren't matched by an increased workforce.\nInstead it is expected that the nurse-patient ratio will increase (even though many aren't trained to work in critical care) as there simply aren't enough nurses available. \nSome health unions fear this will only add to Northern Ireland's excess mortality rate, which is greater than that in Great Britain. \nOnce again, this highlights Northern Ireland's failing health care system, which was already below par well before the start of the pandemic.\nCoronavirus infection figures here are expected to peak between 15 and 21 January. That will be felt not only in hospitals but also in GP practices as they continue to roll out the vaccine. \nWhile at this stage the six weeks look bleak it's hoped that the additional Astra-Zeneca vaccine and the low incidence of flu will go a long way in not only saving lives, but also protecting the health service.\nDr Stout said much planning had gone into ensuring the programme happened as smoothly as possible.\n\"People will literally stay in their cars and be asked to roll up their sleeves - it has to be safe and efficient in order for us to get through it and safely.\"  \nThe UK has ordered 100 million doses of the new vaccine - enough to vaccinate 50 million people.\nMeanwhile, Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland, said it was \"appalling\" that the Pfizer vaccine was not to be administered in two doses within 21 days as instructed by the company and threatened legal action.\nDr Black was responding to news that the UK will give both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart.\n\"They have left care workers in Northern Ireland with a gap in their expected immunity,\" he told BBC NI's Radio Foyle on Monday.\n\"In that period doctors, nurses, porters or health care professionals could infect patients because they will not be protected against the transmission of the infection to patients.\"\nThe UK's chief medical officers have defended their Covid vaccination plan.\nThey said getting more people vaccinated with the first jab was \"much more preferable\" and that the great majority of the initial protection from clinical disease is after the first dose of vaccine.\nDr Black is to meet NI Health Minister Robin Swann later to express health care workers' concern over the change in vaccine policy."

I cannot lead you into battle, I do not give you laws or administer justice, but I can do something else, I can give you my heart and my devotion to these old islands and to all the peoples of our brotherhood of nations.\"\nThe anniversary of the birth of Sir Walter Scott, who wrote the novels Waverley, Rob Roy and Ivanhoe and is considered one of Scotland's most famous figures, will be celebrated with a \u00a32 coin.\nThe 75th anniversary of the death of science fiction author HG Wells, who penned works such as The Time Machine and The War Of The Worlds, will also be marked on a \u00a32 coin, with a depiction of images from his novels.\nThe 50th anniversary of decimalisation, when Britain's modern coins came into force, will be featured on a 50p coin.\nThe 75th anniversary of the death of the inventor John Logie Baird, famous for his early prototypes of the television, will be commemorated on another new 50p coin.\nAs the Queen's head already appears on one side of all coins in circulation, these five coins will each offer a different depiction from the various stages of her reign.\nClare Maclennan, of the consumer division at the Royal Mint, said this year's commemorative coins marked \"some of the biggest anniversaries in 2021\", with each coin \"a miniature work of art\" designed as \"a treasured keepsake or gift\".\nThe commemorative set will be available to purchase from the Royal Mint website."

This drops to \u00a3100 if paid within 14 days. \nThe penalty doubles for each subsequent offence, with no discount for quick payment.

Repeat offenders can also be prosecuted in court where fines are unlimited.\nIn Scotland, the police can issue a penalty notice of up to \u00a360 for breaking the law on mask-wearing.\nEvidence suggests transmission mainly happens indoors where people are close together.\nCovering the nose and mouth reduces the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and while speaking.\nThe main purpose is to protect others although there is some evidence they offer protection to wearers.\nIt should:\nStandard surgical masks are acceptable.

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "Scots are to be ordered to stay at home amid a fresh Covid-19 lockdown which will see schools remain closed to pupils until February.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said new curbs would be introduced at midnight in a bid to contain the new, faster-spreading strain of the virus.\nNew laws will require people to stay at home and work from home where possible.\nOutdoor gatherings are also to be cut back, with people only allowed to meet one person from one other household.\nPlaces of worship are to be closed, group exercise banned, and schools will largely operate via online and remote learning.\nThese rules will apply across the Scottish mainland until at least the end of January, and will be kept under review.\nIsland areas will remain in level three - but Ms Sturgeon said they would be monitored carefully.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson later announced similar lockdown measures for the whole of England with all schools and colleges closing to most pupils until mid February.\nA further 1,905 new cases were reported in Scotland on Monday - with 15% of tests returning a positive result, something Ms Sturgeon said \"illustrates the severity and urgency of the situation\".\nThe first minister said she was \"more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year\", with the new coronavirus strain now accounting for half of new cases.\nAnd she said a \"steeply rising trend of infections\" was threatening to put \"significant pressure\" on NHS services, saying hospitals could breach capacity within three to four weeks.\nThe new rules - which will be put down in law - mean Scots will only be allowed to leave home for essential purposes, such as shopping for food and medicine, exercise and caring responsibilities.\nNo limit is to be put on how many times people can go out to exercise, but outdoor meetings are to be limited to a maximum of two people from two households.\nEveryone who can work from home will be required to, and people in the \"shielding\" category are advised not to go in to work at all.\nThe construction and manufacturing industries will remain open, but Ms Sturgeon said this would be kept under review.\nPlaces of worship are to close, the number of people who can attend weddings is to be cut to five, and funeral wakes will no longer be allowed.\nSchools are to remain closed to the majority of pupils until February, with Ms Sturgeon saying community transmission of the virus must be brought to a lower level amid concerns that the new variant of the virus spreads more easily among young people.\nShe said she knew remote learning presented \"significant challenges\" for parents, teachers and pupils, adding: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils are quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"\nThe first minister said she was considering whether teachers could be given the Covid-19 vaccine as a priority.\nMore than 100,000 people have been given a first dose of the vaccine in Scotland, and the government expects to have access to just over 900,000 doses by the end of January.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon said the best way to get schools open again was to drive down transmission of the virus - urging Scots to abide by the rules.\nThese are the toughest restrictions Scotland has faced since the lockdown of March 2020. \nIt is - once again - becoming compulsory to stay at home except for essential purposes like food shopping, exercise and medical care. \nThe extended closure of schools to most pupils is something the Scottish government was particularly keen to avoid. \nThese decisions are a measure of how worried ministers are about the rapid spread of the new variant of coronavirus, which is fast becoming the dominant strain. \nWith 225 cases per 100,000 people, Scotland is thought to be about four weeks behind London, which already has four times as many cases and NHS services under considerable pressure. \nThe Scottish government believes that without further action the NHS here would run out of beds for Covid patients within a month. \nThis new alert comes at the start of a new year which also brings new hope for a route out of the pandemic with two vaccines now beginning to offer protection. \nAround 100,000 doses have already been administered in Scotland but it is likely to take several months to reach all in the most vulnerable groups.\nThe first minister said Scotland was now in \"a race between the vaccine and the virus\".\nShe said: \"The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine. But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.\n\"We can already see - by looking at infection rates in the south of England - some of what could happen here in Scotland. To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.\n\"For government, that means introducing tough measures - as we have done today. And for all of us, it means sticking to the rules.\"\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson raised concerns about online learning, saying it was vital that pupils had \"equal access to high-quality education\".\nAnd Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said teachers and working parents would need support to make the remote learning system work.\nMs Sturgeon said her government had \"agonised\" over the decision on schools, and said the \"fundamental priority\" was to re-open them in full as soon as possible.\nShe said: \"Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.\"\nThe NHS has coped so far in Scotland - more so than many other parts of the UK. \nBut in places like Glasgow and Lanarkshire it has been very, very tight. And here like everywhere else staff are bracing themselves for the post-Christmas effects of rising cases. \nThe first minister gave some stark figures on hospital and ICU occupancy - suggesting we are just weeks away from reaching limits. \nThere is so little give in the system they will be glad to see everything possible done to prevent stretched services being overwhelmed at a time when we are on our way to getting out the other side. \nThere is real anxiety about what the next few weeks might bring."

New daily cases of Covid have been rising to record levels, which means hospital numbers and deaths will increase too.\nMinisters say more measures are coming, but it is not clear yet what that will mean in practice.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are already in lockdown, and most of England is under tier four rules.\nIn recent days the focus has shifted to schools and whether they can be kept open without making the epidemic worse.\nExperts agree that the risk the virus poses to children is still low, but they can spread the disease.\nWith a new, more transmissible variant of Covid circulating, the government may have to enact this unpalatable \"last resort\" of closing classrooms. \nSome 78% of the population of England is now in tier four, under which non-essential shops are closed and people can only leave their homes for a certain number of reasons. \nThe Scottish government meets later to consider \"further action\", with all of mainland Scotland currently under its own level four restrictions - only some islands are under less stringent tier three measures. \nWales entered a nationwide lockdown on 20 December, while Northern Ireland is in the second week of a six-week lockdown that began on Boxing Day.\nIn another development, an academic has said there is a \"big question mark\" over whether a vaccine developed at Oxford University will be as effective against a new variant of the virus that has emerged in South Africa.\nProf Sir John Bell, Regius professor of medicine at the university, said the team there were currently investigating this question \"right now\". \nHe added it was \"unlikely\" the variant would \"turn off the effect of vaccines entirely\", and in any case it would be possible to tweak the vaccine in around four to six weeks.\nBut Matt Hancock told Today he was \"incredibly worried\" about the South African variant, saying: \"This is a very, very significant problem.\"\n\"We have shown that we are prepared to move incredibly quickly, within 24 hours if we think that is necessary, and we keep these things under review all the time,\" added the health secretary."

      "text": "Everyone in England must stay at home except for permitted reasons during a new coronavirus lockdown expected to last until mid-February, the PM says.\nAll schools and colleges will close to most pupils and switch to remote learning from Tuesday.\nBoris Johnson warned the coming weeks would be the \"hardest yet\" amid surging cases and patient numbers.\nHe said those in the top four priority groups would be offered a first vaccine dose by the middle of next month.\nAll care home residents and their carers, everyone aged 70 and over, all frontline health and social care workers, and the clinically extremely vulnerable will be offered one dose of a vaccine by mid-February.\nScotland earlier issued a stay-at-home order and Wales said schools and colleges would shut until 18 January  for most pupils. \nSchools in Northern Ireland will have an \"extended period of remote learning\", the Stormont Executive said.\nSpeaking from Downing Street, Mr Johnson told the public to follow the new lockdown rules immediately, before they become law in the early hours of Wednesday.\nAll the new measures in England will then last until at least the middle of February, he said, as a new more infectious variant of the virus spreads across the UK.\nThe PM added that he believed the country was entering \"the last phase of the struggle\".\nHospitals were under \"more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic\", he said.\nAnd he reiterated the slogan used earlier in the pandemic, urging people to immediately \"stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives\".\nOn Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. \nA further 58,784 cases and an additional 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported, though deaths in Scotland were not recorded.\nAs of 08:00 GMT, there were 26,626 Covid-19 patients in hospital in England, according to the latest figures. \nThis is a week-on-week increase of 30%, and a new record high.\nThose who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be contacted by letter and should now shield once more, Mr Johnson said.\nSupport and childcare bubbles will continue under the new measures - and people can meet one person from another household for outdoor exercise.\nCommunal worship and life events like funerals and weddings can continue, subject to limits on attendance.\nWhile Mr Johnson said end-of-year exams would not take place as normal in the summer, he said alternative arrangements would be announced separately.\nThe government has published a 22-page document outlining the new rules in detail.\nThe House of Commons has been recalled to allow MPs to vote on the new restrictions on Wednesday.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his MPs would \"support the package of measures\", saying \"we've all got to pull together now to make this work\".\nOnce again it is the threat to the NHS that has forced the hand of ministers. \nIn England there has been a 50% rise in the number of patients in hospital with Covid since Christmas day.\nTo put that into context, it equates to 18 hospitals being filled.\nCurrently around three out of 10 beds are occupied by patients with the disease.\nIn some hospitals it is more than six in 10.\nBut what is worrying ministers and NHS leaders is that the number is just going to increase.\nIn the spring it took nearly three weeks after lockdown for hospital cases to peak.\nThe last six days have seen in excess of 50,000 new infections confirmed each day across the UK - a number of these infections are next week's hospital admissions.\nIt is why the UK's chief medical officers were warning there was a \"material risk\" of some hospitals being overwhelmed if something did not change.\nMr Johnson spoke after UK chief medical officers recommended the Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level.\nLevel five means the NHS may soon be unable to handle a further sustained rise in cases, the medical officers said in a joint statement.\nNHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, said hospitals were at a \"critical point\" and that \"immediate and decisive action\" was needed.\nAnnouncing tougher measures in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: \"It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.\"\nFor pupils who returned for their first day of the new term at primary school on Monday, it's turned out to be an extremely short-lived visit. \nBoris Johnson's announcement will see primary, secondary and further education colleges closed for at least the next six weeks, except for vulnerable and key workers' children.\nIt's a much bigger shift in policy than had been anticipated, even a few days ago.\nEven the return date will depend on the progress in tackling the virus.\n\"I hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February half term,\" said the prime minister.\nKeeping schools open was the government's most definite of red lines, a few weeks ago they were threatening councils that wanted to close them - but it's now been overtaken by the spiking lines on the Covid infection charts.\nEven after the chaos of last year's replacement grades, GCSEs and A-levels are being cancelled again - with a replacement system still to be decided. Vocational exams are to continue.\nFor parents dreading home schooling, there are plans for it to be better supported this time - with more computer devices available and suggestions that Ofsted inspectors will check what schools are offering.\nBut there's no escaping that this will feel like another sudden and chaotic change of direction for schools and parents. \nMr Johnson's pledge on vaccinations comes after an 82-year-old retired maintenance manager became the first person in the UK to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 jab\nSome 13.9 million people are among the four priority groups who will receive a vaccine dose by about 15 February, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said.\nHow will you be affected by the latest developments?

      "tags": "Trades Union Congress,Job Retention Scheme,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Working parents trying to balance work and childcare should be put on furlough while schools are closed, the umbrella body for UK trades unions says.\nBosses may not be aware that they can use the scheme to support parents, according to the Trades Union Congress.\nMany families would be \"frantically\" looking for a solution, the TUC said, after the decision to start the new term late or online for many pupils.\nEmployers must \"do the right thing and furlough mums and dads\", the TUC said.\nAll secondary schools will remain closed to students this week, except for the children of key workers such as NHS staff. Students are expected to return on a staggered basis from 11 January.\nMost primary schools are open to pupils from Monday, except in London and parts of the south east of England where the spread of a new, more infectious, strain of coronavirus is already high.\nHowever, decisions over whether it was safe for pupils to return to school in person were still being discussed over the New Year holiday weekend, leaving parents with little time to find support.\n\"Without further action, many will have no choice but to cut their hours or take unpaid leave from work,\" said Frances Grady, general secretary of the TUC. \"This will lead to further hardship and will hit mums and single parents hardest.\"\nAccording to the rules of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, first introduced nine months ago, firms can furlough parents unable to work due to a lack of childcare. \nThe TUC said its research showed that in March, when schools were closed during the first period of lockdown, one in six mothers reduced their working hours due to school and nursery closures. It said single parents were also more likely to be affected.\nSelf-employed parents should also be given support through access to the self-employed income support scheme, the TUC said. It is calling for employees to be given a right to paid parental leave and flexible working beyond the current crisis.\nEmployers aren't obliged to furlough staff, says employment lawyer Sarah Chilton.\"You might think, why wouldn't they? But there are some costs associated with it,\" she said. \nFirms in sectors that have lost business due to the virus are more likely to agree than those that have plenty of work for staff to do.  \nIf you aren't furloughed, there are alternatives:\nHowever, most firms will have their own policies in place in addition to those laid out in law, said Ms Chilton, so it is sensible first to check with your boss.\nOne of the arguments for keeping schools open, rather than switching to remote learning, is to allow parents to continue to work. \nHowever, there is a growing debate over whether the new coronavirus strain, which is significantly more infectious than the original strain of the virus, can be contained without closing schools for longer. \nWhile cases of the virus are increasing in almost all age groups, the percentage testing positive is highest among secondary school age children, according to the Office for National Statistics. While schools practice social distancing where possible, students continue to mix with others within their bubbles.\n\"The health and safety of school staff, children and parents and the wider community must come first,\" said Ms O'Grady.\nBoris Johnson, interviewed on the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday, said there was \"no doubt in [his] mind that schools are safe\". But the prime minister did not rule out further closures.\nTeaching unions have told staff at primary schools it is unsafe to return to work and are calling for remote learning to be introduced across all primary schools. Some local authorities have also expressed concerns.\nMr Johnson said that while school closures would be kept \"under constant review\", the government would be \"driven by public health considerations and by the massive importance of education\".\nA government spokesperson said it would be \"socially responsible\" for employers to take account of a person's childcare responsibilities and individual circumstances.  \n\"We encourage both employers and employees to be as flexible as possible during this difficult time, to support colleagues with childcare responsibilities. \n\"That includes providing flexible working and home working arrangements, as well as considering requests from parents to be furloughed, which is at the employer's discretion,\" the spokesperson said."

      "text": "Regional restrictions in England are \"probably about to get tougher\" to curb rising Covid infections, the prime minister has warned.\nBoris Johnson told the BBC stronger measures may be required in parts of the country in the coming weeks.\nHe said this included the possibility of keeping schools closed, although this is not \"something we want to do\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for new England-wide restrictions within 24 hours. \nSir Keir said coronavirus was \"clearly out of control\" and it was \"inevitable more schools are going to have to close\".\nIt comes as the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the sixth day in a row, with 54,990 announced on Sunday. \nAn additional 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result have also been reported, meaning the total by this measure is now above 75,000. \nSpeaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Johnson said he stuck by his previous prediction that the situation would be better by the spring, and he hoped \"tens of millions\" would be vaccinated in the next three months. \nBut he added: \"It may be that we need to do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher in many parts of the country. I'm fully, fully reconciled to that.\"\n\"And I bet the people of this country are reconciled to that because, until the vaccine really comes on stream in a massive way, we're fighting this virus with the same set of tools.\"\nThe PM added that ministers had taken \"every reasonable step that we reasonably could\" to prepare for winter, but \"could not have reasonably predicted\" the new, more transmissible variant of the virus that has emerged over the autumn.\nSpeaking after Mr Johnson's interview, Sir Keir said introducing new nationwide restrictions in England \"has to be the first step to controlling the virus\".\n\"There's no good the prime minister hinting that further restrictions are coming into place in a week or two or three,\" he told reporters on Sunday. \"That delay has been the source of so many problems.\"\n\"Let's not have the prime minister saying 'I'm going to do it, but not yet',\" he added.\nMeanwhile, Mr Johnson defended plans for primary schools to reopen in most of England on Monday, amid opposition from teaching unions and some local councils. \nIt came after Amanda Spielman, the head of Ofsted, England's schools watchdog, said closures should be kept to an \"absolute minimum\".\nThe rapidly rising infection rates mean it should come as no surprise that tougher measures are being considered.\nInfection levels are nearly four times higher now than they were at the start of December - and that in turn has put more pressure on hospitals.\nThere are signs the restrictions have started slowing the rises in London, the East of England and the South East.\nBut that on its own is not enough. Ministers want to get cases down.\nSo what extra can be done? After all most of England is effectively in lockdown already with tier four in place. Those places not in tier four could, of course, follow.\nBut some public health experts are warning more needs to be done. \nThere is a determination to get primary school children back - they have among the lowest rates of infection if you look at symptomatic cases. \nBut infection rates are higher among secondary school age children. The government has bought itself time by delaying their return.\nA further 20 million people in England were added to tier four - \"stay at home\" - the toughest set of rules, on 31 December in a bid to stem a surge in Covid cases. \nIt means 78% of the population of England is now in tier four, under which non-essential shops are closed and people can only leave their homes for a certain number of reasons. \nThe Scottish government will meet on Monday to consider \"further action\" to limit the spread of the disease, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. \nAll of mainland Scotland is currently under its own level four restrictions - with only some islands under less stringent tier three measures. \nWales entered a nationwide lockdown on 20 December, with First Minister Mark Drakeford saying on Sunday it was \"difficult to see\" how the rules could be strengthened further. \nHe said Welsh ministers would consider whether restrictions could be \"tweaked at the margins\" at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. \nNorthern Ireland is in the second week of a six-week lockdown that began on Boxing Day. Stricter measures, including a \"stay-at-home curfew\", ended on Saturday.\nIn another development, an academic has said there is a \"big question mark\" over whether a vaccine developed at Oxford University will be as effective against a new variant of the virus that has emerged in South Africa.\nProf Sir John Bell, Regius professor of medicine at the university, said the team there were currently investigating this question \"right now\". \nHe added it was \"unlikely\" the variant would \"turn off the effect of vaccines entirely,\" and in any case it would be possible to tweak the vaccine in around 4-6 weeks.\n\"Everybody should stay calm - it's going to be fine,\" he told Times Radio.\n\"But we're now in a game of cat and mouse - because these are not the only two variants we're going to see.\"  "

      "title": "Covid: Boris Johnson set to announce new England lockdown",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson is expected to announce a set of new national restrictions for England, similar to the March lockdown, in a televised address at 20:00 GMT. \nThe PM is likely to urge the public to follow the new rules from midnight.\nIt is expected people will be told to work from home if possible and schools will close for most pupils.\nIt is not yet clear when the measures will be reviewed, but MPs are likely to be given a vote to approve them retrospectively on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, the UK's chief medical officers warned of a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\" in several areas over the next 21 days.\nScotland announced a legal requirement to stay at home from midnight, with schools to be closed.\nMr Johnson will set out plans for England as the UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations. \nBoth Wales and Northern Ireland are already under national restrictions.\nOn Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. \nAs of 08:00 GMT, there were 26,626 Covid-19 patients in hospital in England, according to the latest figures. \nThis is a week-on-week increase of 30%, and a new record high.\nMr Johnson is expected to tell people to work from home unless they are a key worker, or it is not possible for them to do so, for example if they work on a construction site, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. \nIt is also understood that England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has told the prime minister the new variant of coronavirus is now spreading throughout the country. \nThe new variant - first identified in Kent and since seen across the UK and other parts of the world - has been found to spread much more easily than earlier variants.\nA No 10 spokesman said the spread of the new variant had led to \"rapidly escalating case numbers across the country\".\n\"The prime minister is clear that further steps must now be taken to arrest this rise and to protect the NHS and save lives,\" he added. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who called for a national lockdown in England within 24 hours on Sunday - said: \"I hope the prime minister has been listening to the clear calls for tough national restrictions.\"\nHospitals have said they are under \"extreme pressure\" and one of Britain's most senior doctors warned on the weekend that trusts across the UK should prepare themselves for a surge in cases.\nThe number of Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals is currently above the level seen in spring 2020. \nA further 58,784 cases and an additional 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported on Monday, though deaths in Scotland were not recorded.\nWhat worked before may not work again - even a repeat of the March lockdown may not be enough to contain the new variant. \nConsider the R number - the number of people each infected person passes the virus onto on average. \nThe March lockdown brought R down to 0.6 and led to a sharp decline in cases.\nEvery 100 infected people passed the virus onto 60 others, who passed it onto 36, then 21, then 12 and so on.\nBut the new variant is thought to be around 50% more transmissible so its R number, in the same lockdown conditions, would be around 0.9.\nThen 100 infected people would pass the virus onto 90 others, then 81, then 73, then 66 and so on.\nThis is a far slower decline.\nHowever, uncertainty around the new variant means there are scenarios where its levels plateau rather than fall during lockdown conditions. \nIt is going to be a tough start to the year. Even with immediate and tough restrictions there are a projected 20,000 additional deaths in the first months of 2021. \nNow more than ever this is a race between the virus and the vaccine. \nMr Johnson's address comes as UK chief medical officers recommended the Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level.\nIt means the NHS may soon be unable to handle a further sustained rise in cases, the medical officers said in a joint statement.\nNHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, said hospitals were at a \"critical point\" and that \"immediate and decisive action\" is needed.\nPreviously, the government described level five as requiring stricter social distancing measures. The first lockdown, which began in March 2020, was when the UK was under level four.\nThese Covid threat levels are separate to the regional tier system of restrictions in England.\nAnnouncing tougher measures in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: \"It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.\"\nThe new restrictions in Scotland mean it will be a legal requirement to stay at home except for certain essential purposes, similar to the first lockdown last March. Schools will be closed to pupils until February.\nIn Wales, all schools and colleges will move to online learning until at least 18 January.\nNorthern Ireland's Stormont Executive are also meeting to discuss possible new measures in light of Mr Johnson's televised address - which will air on BBC One and the BBC iPlayer from 19:35 GMT.\nThe prime minister will speak amid continued uncertainty over whether schools will remain open to all pupils in England, after several councils requested classrooms stay shut.\nEarlier on Monday, an 82-year-old retired maintenance manager became the first person in the UK to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.\nBrian Pinker said he was \"really proud\" to receive a jab developed in the UK, which will form a large part of the country's mass vaccination plan.\n\"The nurses, doctors and staff today have all been brilliant and I can now really look forward to celebrating my 48th wedding anniversary with my wife Shirley later this year,\" Mr Pinker said."

      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

      "text": "Unions representing teachers and heads in Wales have called for face-to-face teaching to be suspended in response to the new coronavirus variant.\nThe NASUWT has threatened \"appropriate action in order to protect members whose safety is put at risk\".\nHead teachers' union NAHT Cymru said it had taken legal action against the Welsh Government to obtain scientific evidence it said it was \"withholding\".\nThe Welsh Government said it had agreed an approach with local authorities.\nThe National Education Union Cymru had already called for in-person learning to be delayed until at least 18 January.\nAccording to councils, many secondary schools aim to return from 11 January, with some fully open on 6 January.\nWelsh schools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers from this week.\nAll pupils will be expected to take part in remote learning before their schools reopen for face-to-face teaching.\nBut teachers' unions have said more time is needed to understand the new Covid-19 variant.\nWhile \"completely committed\" to ensuring children return to school as soon as possible, NASUWT general secretary Patrick Roach said it was now \"abundantly clear that the pandemic is seriously impacting on the ability of all schools to continue to operate normally\".\n\"The NASUWT will not hesitate to take appropriate action in order to protect members whose safety is put at risk as a result of the failure of employers or the Welsh Government to ensure safe working conditions in schools.\"\nNeil Butler, the union's official for Wales, said there was \"chaos and confusion\" in the Welsh education system, and that \"the buck has effectively been passed to local authorities and some authorities have passed it down to individual schools\".\nMr Butler said a suspension of face-to-face teaching would allow schools to review their risk assessments in light of the new variant.\nA Welsh Government spokeswoman said: \"We have agreed with local authorities a common approach to schools returning in January with some flexibility built in over the first two weeks of term. \n\"It is our expectation that pupils, when not in school, will continue to benefit from remote learning.\"\nSecondary schools in England will stagger their return with pupils taking exams in 2021 starting on 11 January, and other year groups returning in person on 18 January. Most primary schools in England will return on 4 January, but in London and some surrounding areas they will not open for most pupils until 18 January. \nIn Northern Ireland, primary school pupils will be taught online until 11 January. In secondary schools, years 8 to 11 will be taught online throughout January. Years 12 to 14 will return to school after the first week of January. \nIn Scotland, the Christmas holidays have been extended to 11 January, and the following week will be online learning only. A full return to face-to-face learning is planned for 18 January. \nRead more here\nLaura Doel, director of NAHT Cymru, said \"control of infection has been lost\" in large parts of Wales, which had created an \"intolerable risk to many school communities\".\n\"It is simply unacceptable for schools to remain open when there is such a question mark over the impact the new variant will have and we will not sit back and let this happen without calling the Welsh Government to account, for the sake of the whole school community,\" she added.\nMs Doel said the union had taken legal action \"to force\" the Welsh Government \"to disclose the scientific information they are withholding\" which has guided its policies.\nIn England, pressure is growing on the government to keep all schools closed for two weeks after the Christmas break amid a surge in coronavirus cases."

The new variant is accelerating spread.\n\"PLEASE do not visit other people's homes just now, even today - if you first foot someone today, or hug/kiss/handshake them HNY, you are putting yourself, others & the NHS at risk.\"\nShe said the \"vaccine cavalry\" was on the way, offering \"real hope for 2021\", but she added: \"With this new variant, the next few weeks may be the most dangerous we've faced since Mar/April.\n\"We must act together to suppress it, to save lives and protect the NHS. Folded hands stick with it.\"\nA new study by London's Imperial College has found that the new variant of Covid-19 is \"hugely\" more transmissible than the virus's previous version.\nIt concludes the new variant increases the Reproduction or R number by between 0.4 and 0.7.\nThe UK's latest R number has been estimated at between 1.1 and 1.3. It needs to be below 1.0 for the number of cases to start falling.\nThe Scottish government's most recent estimate of the R number in Scotland has put it between 0.9 and 1.1.\nEmma Thomson, a professor of infectious disease at the University of Glasgow, said it was important to get people vaccinated quickly.\nThe professor, who has been working on the sequencing of the new Covid mutation, told the BBC that lockdown was not controlling the infection \"on its own\".\n\"At least we come in armed into the new year with two vaccines which are highly effective at preventing severe disease. We have that,\" she said.\n\"We need to roll it out now to add to the public health measures.\"\nParties, traditional \"first-footing\" and social events were banned this Hogmanay, with all of mainland Scotland and Skye being under the highest level of Covid restrictions.\nAll official events were cancelled, but police had to disperse a crowds of people who gathered at Edinburgh Castle and Calton Hill to see in the new year.\nIt has also emerged that 32 people were charged with reckless conduct after police found them gathered at a rented property in Aberfoyle on 27 December.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"As the first minister has pointed out, the sharp rise in cases is evidence that the new strain seems to be speeding up transmission.\n\"This is why we are asking people to please stay at home as much as possible and avoid non-essential interaction with others.\n\"There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we ask everyone to be patient as we work our way through the vaccination programme, and continue to follow FACTS to keep us all safe.\""

      "text": "Some EU specialist online retailers have said they will no longer deliver to the UK because of tax changes which came into force on 1 January.\nBicycle part firm Dutch Bike Bits said from now on, it would ship to every country in the world except the UK.\n\"We are forced by British policy to stop dealing with British customers,\" it said on its website.\nAnother firm, Belgium-based Beer On Web, said it was now shunning the UK \"due to the new Brexit measures\".\nThe companies are angry because they now face higher costs and increased bureaucracy in order to comply with UK tax authorities. \nHowever, it is unclear how many have taken the drastic step of refusing all UK orders.\nAt the same time, international shipping companies including Federal Express and TNT have said they are levying additional charges on shipments between the UK and the EU.\nThey said this reflected the increased investment they had had to make in adjusting their systems to cope with Brexit.\nThe moves follow changes in VAT rules brought in by HM Revenue and Customs on 1 January.\nVAT is now being collected at the point of sale rather than at the point of importation.\nThis essentially means that overseas retailers sending goods to the UK are expected to register for UK VAT and account for it to HMRC if the sale value is less than \u20ac150 (\u00a3135).\nA government spokesperson said: \"The new VAT model ensures goods from EU and non-EU countries are treated in the same way and that UK businesses are not disadvantaged by competition from VAT-free imports. \n\"The new system also addresses the problem of overseas sellers failing to pay the right amount of VAT on sales of goods already in the UK at the point of sale, raising an anticipated \u00a3300m every year.\n\"Many EU businesses which currently sell goods to UK customers will have already registered for UK VAT under existing rules and HMRC is working very closely with those who haven't to ensure they can comply with the changes.\"\nAdam French, Which? consumer rights expert, said consumers would be \"frustrated\" if the new VAT rules were applied in a way that causes significant inconvenience.\n\"It's vital the government makes it clear to consumers as well as traders what the changes as a result of Brexit mean for them and how they shop. It should also work to ensure UK consumers can retain access to a wide range of competitively priced and quality goods.\"\nCampaigner Richard Allen, founder of Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, told the BBC that the massive increase in international online shopping had led to VAT evasion on a huge scale.\nHe said the new HMRC rules were aimed at tackling that, but it was unclear how firms who failed to register for UK VAT would be dealt with.\n\"Why should a phonograph spares manufacturer in Idaho bother to register for VAT in the UK and how are you going to make them do it?\" he said. \"And if they send the package anyway, what are you going to do?\"\n\"For providing this service, [HMRC] intend to charge a fee to every company in the world in every country in the world which exports to the UK,\" said Dutch Bike Bits on its website. \n\"Clearly this is ludicrous for one country, but imagine if every country in the world had the same idea. \n\"If every country decided to behave in the same way, then we would have to pay 195 fees every year, keep up with the changes in taxation law for 195 different countries, keep accounts on behalf of 195 different countries and submit payments to 195 tax offices in 195 different countries, and jump through whatever hoops were required to prove that we were doing all of this honestly and without any error.\"\nDutch Bike Bits said it had many customers within the UK and would like to be able to trade with them. \n\"Not being able to send parcels to the UK does not work in any way in our favour and it is not what we wanted,\" the firm added.\n\"If you're angry about this, and you may well be so, please contact your elected representative in the UK.\"\nOther firms held out the hope that their ban on exports to the UK might prove to be temporary.\nScandinavian Outdoor, which is based in Finland and sells outdoor clothing and equipment, posted a message on its homepage saying: \"No delivery to UK just now.\"\nIn a further message explaining its decision, it said: \"Due to Brexit, we have temporarily closed our store from UK-based customers. Ordering will be possible as soon as our UK VAT registration and the overall process of selling to the UK post-Brexit has been sorted out.\"\nMeanwhile, mail and freight company TNT has said it is now imposing a surcharge of \u00a34.31 on all shipments between the UK and the EU.\nTNT is now owned by Federal Express, which has also \"updated\" its charges, a spokesperson for the two companies said.\n\"FedEx/TNT has been making incremental investments to adjust our systems, processes, resourcing and customer-facing solutions to ensure readiness for the change on 1 January 2021,\" the spokesperson added.\n\"To reflect these investments and the incremental cost of customs clearance, we are increasing transportation rates for shipments from UK to EU, and EU to UK.\"\nRivals DHL and UPS have also taken similar measures."

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts.\nThe UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that \"adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nData from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. \nBased on the current data, the following is advised:\nThe MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April.\nThe MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate.\nAnd the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. \nIts head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was \"firming up\", more evidence would be needed. \nThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\".\nThe MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nPlatelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\nAmong these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT).\nCVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. \nAs a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke.  \nThe clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. \nThe MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice:\nCovid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clotting should be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect.\nAfter a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link.\nNevertheless, Denmark has stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - and Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. \nFrance is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, while Australia says people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness.\nOnce injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus.\nExperts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. \nThe government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is \"plenty of evidence\" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant which is dominant in the UK.\nThere is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. \nHowever a study of around 2,000 people suggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease."

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he expects \"tens of millions\" of Covid-19 vaccinations will be given over the next three months.\nPeople across the UK will start to receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine from Monday, when 530,000 doses will be ready at GPs and hospitals.\nBut questions remain over the policy shift on when the second dose of the Oxford and Pfizer jabs is given.\nMore than 40 MPs have written to No 10 seeking clarity on the changes.\nAsked if it was correct that two million people would need to be vaccinated a week to end restrictions, Mr Johnson told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday: \"We do hope that we'll be able to do tens of millions [of Covid-19 vaccines] in the course of the next three months.\"\nHe said the UK had been the \"first country to have pioneered a room temperature vaccine\" in the Oxford jab, which he said offered \"real hope for the future\" and a \"way forward\".\nThe joint letter, signed by 41 Labour, Lib Dem and Independent MPs, has been sent to Health Secretary Matt Hancock and vaccine rollout minister Nadhim Zahawi.\nIn it, the MPs say that while they welcome the vaccine roll-out and its prioritisation of front-line health workers and those most vulnerable to the virus, the are concerned that recent changes could risk its success.\nThe letter includes 20 questions that seek \"urgent clarity\" on two \"areas of concern\" - the guidance on the combination of jabs from different manufacturers and the new 12-week gap between first and second doses of the Oxford and Pfizer jabs are given.\nOlivia Blake, the Labour MP who Sheffield Hallam who organised the letter, said: \"We welcome the vaccination programme and desperately want it to succeed - but for it to do so, the public must have confidence that there is a rigorous scientific basis to the policy decisions.\"\nIn the letter the MPs call for the scientific guidance behind the changes to be made public, adding: \"More communication and greater transparency can only strengthen the vaccination programme by providing greater public confidence.\"\nPublic Health England (PHE) recently clarified its guidance on second doses of the vaccine, saying that experts did \"not recommend mixing\" the jabs, but on the \"extremely rare occasions\" where the same vaccine is unavailable or it is unknown which jab the patient received, it is \"better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all\".\nThe UK has moved to accelerate its vaccination rollout, amid a rise in coronavirus cases driven by a new Covid variant, by giving both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between the Pfizer jabs.\nBoris Johnson told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that \"in vaccinating 1m people\" in the UK, \"already we exceed the whole of the rest of Europe put together\". \nAs of 27 December, 944,539 people in the UK had received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech. \nThe latest data from 19 of the EU's 27 member states, including Germany, France and Italy, shows 423,303 vaccinations have been carried out so far. \nAs each EU member state publishes its own statistics, some of this data goes up to early January but some only to late December. \nGermany is leading the EU, having vaccinated 188,553 people as of 1 January. Meanwhile, France had only vaccinated 432 citizens by 31 December and the Netherlands won't begin vaccinations till 8 January. \nThe UK started vaccinating citizens with the Pfizer jab on 8 December, the EU rollout began on 27 December.\nThe UK's chief medical officers have defended the delay to second doses, saying getting more people vaccinated with the first jab \"is much more preferable\".\nWriting in the Mail on Sunday, deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said the new dosing regimen will \"save the most lives and avoid the most hospital admissions\".\nHe said: \"If a family has two elderly grandparents and there are two vaccines available, it is better to give both 89% protection than to give one 95% protection with two quick doses, and the other grandparent no protection at all.\n\"The virus is unfortunately spreading fast, and this is a race against time.\n\"My mum, as well as you or your older loved ones, may be affected by this decision, but it is still the right thing to do for the nation as a whole.\"\nDr Nikki Kanani, NHS medical director for primary care and the government's GP lead on vaccination, also defended delaying giving people the second dose, saying that giving a first jab to as many people as possible would prevent serious illness, hospitalisation and death.\nShe told the BBC that the evidence from the UK's chief medical officers had been \"really clear [that] this is the right thing to do, right now\".\nShe said that \"over a million\" people had been vaccinated before the end of last year, before warning those who have had the jab that it would take a \"really long time to get to the position when you can go back to normality\", urging them to remember the roll-out was a \"marathon, not a sprint\"."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,Brexit",
      "text": "Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster has said there \"is a gateway of opportunity for the whole of the UK and for NI\" after the UK-EU trade deal.\nMPs last week approved the post-Brexit trade deal in a parliamentary vote.\nMrs Foster told The Andrew Marr Show it was \"important\" in NI's centenary year to \"take the opportunities that are there for all of our people\".\nShe also said the deal dealt with \"some of the great difficulties that there are with the (NI) Protocol\". \nThe purpose of the Northern Ireland Protocol is to prevent a hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nIt does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and by having Northern Ireland apply EU customs rules at its ports.\nAs a consequence, an 'Irish Sea border' now exists with most commercial goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain requiring a customs declaration.\nIn response, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Steve Aiken said Mrs Foster's party should \"cut the bravado\" and admit they got it \"wrong\" on the border. \nHe said: \"Arlene Foster's interview with Andrew Marr has further confirmed that the DUP's blood red line about a border in the Irish Sea was never a red line at all. \n\"It was washed away when the DUP supported Boris Johnson`s proposals for a border in the Irish Sea.\"\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which Mrs Foster leads, opposed the protocol and had criticised the establishment of such a border.\nShe told The Andrew Marr show that her party \"didn't want the protocol but it is here\".\n\"I have to mitigate against that and my job from now on is to mitigate against those excesses and to hold the government to account for what they claimed would be unfettered access from Northern Ireland into Great Britain, our largest market of course, and also from Great Britain into Northern Ireland,\" Mrs Foster added.\nUnder the terms of the protocol, the Northern Ireland Assembly could vote to overturn the arrangement in four years time. \nMrs Foster said she hoped \"by that stage people will see that it is much better to move out of those regulations and into the global market which the rest of the UK can engage in\". \nThe DUP leader also said nationalists wanted the UK's withdrawal from the EU to be a disaster in order to enhance the case for a united Ireland. \nThe Sinn F\u00e9in MP John Finucane described the remarks as \"nonsense\", while the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Mrs Foster was \"trying to wash her hands of the new Irish Sea border\".\nThe Brexit transition period ended at 23:00 GMT on 31 December, with Northern Ireland's ports now using border control posts (BCPs) to check many food products entering from Great Britain.\nA small number of lorries were delayed at the new BCPs following the end of the transition period on Thursday night.\nMeanwhile, with Northern Ireland and the UK continuing to grapple with Covid-19, Mrs Foster said Stormont ministers would \"do all that we can\" to keep young people in schools in January.\nEducation Minister Peter Weir announced last week that most pupils would not return to school in the first week of the month as planned, and instead return after a week of remote learning.\nFor some post-primary pupils (Years 8-11), online learning will be in place for the entire month of January.\nMrs Foster said young people \"have missed out far too much on education during Covid\".\n\"However, we do recognise with this new mutant version of Covid-19 that there are difficulties, that it transmits among younger people, therefore we have to take that into consideration,\" she said.\n\"It is important we get our young people into schools again but we have to have remote learning for a short period of time - and I hope it is a short period of time.\"\nAlthough most pupils of primary and post-primary schools will spend this week being taught remotely, nurseries have been instructed to open as normal.\nThe principals of some nursery schools in Belfast have written to Mr Weir, expressing their concerns about the reopening of their schools on Monday.\nEdenderry Nursery School principal Nancy McGrath told BBC News NI: \"Our children are very young, they need to nurtured, they want to hold your hand, they need comforted when they are upset.\n\"We cannot have social distance with our pupils - we would be failing them in our duty of care to do that and I am really concerned about the duty of care that is being shown to staff, children and families at the moment.\n\"We don't understand why we've been separated out from the primary and secondary sectors.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament",
      "text": "Scots are to be ordered to stay at home amid a fresh Covid-19 lockdown which will see schools remain closed to pupils until February.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said new curbs would be introduced at midnight in a bid to contain the new, faster-spreading strain of the virus.\nNew laws will require people to stay at home and work from home where possible.\nOutdoor gatherings are also to be cut back, with people only allowed to meet one person from one other household.\nPlaces of worship are to be closed, group exercise banned, and schools will largely operate via online and remote learning.\nThese rules will apply across the Scottish mainland until at least the end of January, and will be kept under review.\nIsland areas will remain in level three - but Ms Sturgeon said they would be monitored carefully.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson later announced similar lockdown measures for the whole of England with all schools and colleges closing to most pupils until mid February.\nA further 1,905 new cases were reported in Scotland on Monday - with 15% of tests returning a positive result, something Ms Sturgeon said \"illustrates the severity and urgency of the situation\".\nThe first minister said she was \"more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year\", with the new coronavirus strain now accounting for half of new cases.\nAnd she said a \"steeply rising trend of infections\" was threatening to put \"significant pressure\" on NHS services, saying hospitals could breach capacity within three to four weeks.\nThe new rules - which will be put down in law - mean Scots will only be allowed to leave home for essential purposes, such as shopping for food and medicine, exercise and caring responsibilities.\nNo limit is to be put on how many times people can go out to exercise, but outdoor meetings are to be limited to a maximum of two people from two households.\nEveryone who can work from home will be required to, and people in the \"shielding\" category are advised not to go in to work at all.\nThe construction and manufacturing industries will remain open, but Ms Sturgeon said this would be kept under review.\nPlaces of worship are to close, the number of people who can attend weddings is to be cut to five, and funeral wakes will no longer be allowed.\nSchools are to remain closed to the majority of pupils until February, with Ms Sturgeon saying community transmission of the virus must be brought to a lower level amid concerns that the new variant of the virus spreads more easily among young people.\nShe said she knew remote learning presented \"significant challenges\" for parents, teachers and pupils, adding: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils are quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"\nThe first minister said she was considering whether teachers could be given the Covid-19 vaccine as a priority.\nMore than 100,000 people have been given a first dose of the vaccine in Scotland, and the government expects to have access to just over 900,000 doses by the end of January.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon said the best way to get schools open again was to drive down transmission of the virus - urging Scots to abide by the rules.\nThese are the toughest restrictions Scotland has faced since the lockdown of March 2020. \nIt is - once again - becoming compulsory to stay at home except for essential purposes like food shopping, exercise and medical care. \nThe extended closure of schools to most pupils is something the Scottish government was particularly keen to avoid. \nThese decisions are a measure of how worried ministers are about the rapid spread of the new variant of coronavirus, which is fast becoming the dominant strain. \nWith 225 cases per 100,000 people, Scotland is thought to be about four weeks behind London, which already has four times as many cases and NHS services under considerable pressure. \nThe Scottish government believes that without further action the NHS here would run out of beds for Covid patients within a month. \nThis new alert comes at the start of a new year which also brings new hope for a route out of the pandemic with two vaccines now beginning to offer protection. \nAround 100,000 doses have already been administered in Scotland but it is likely to take several months to reach all in the most vulnerable groups.\nThe first minister said Scotland was now in \"a race between the vaccine and the virus\".\nShe said: \"The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine. But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.\n\"We can already see - by looking at infection rates in the south of England - some of what could happen here in Scotland. To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.\n\"For government, that means introducing tough measures - as we have done today. And for all of us, it means sticking to the rules.\"\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson raised concerns about online learning, saying it was vital that pupils had \"equal access to high-quality education\".\nAnd Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said teachers and working parents would need support to make the remote learning system work.\nMs Sturgeon said her government had \"agonised\" over the decision on schools, and said the \"fundamental priority\" was to re-open them in full as soon as possible.\nShe said: \"Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.\"\nThe NHS has coped so far in Scotland - more so than many other parts of the UK. \nBut in places like Glasgow and Lanarkshire it has been very, very tight. And here like everywhere else staff are bracing themselves for the post-Christmas effects of rising cases. \nThe first minister gave some stark figures on hospital and ICU occupancy - suggesting we are just weeks away from reaching limits. \nThere is so little give in the system they will be glad to see everything possible done to prevent stretched services being overwhelmed at a time when we are on our way to getting out the other side. \nThere is real anxiety about what the next few weeks might bring."

      "text": "South Korea recorded more deaths than births in 2020 for the first time ever, raising fresh alarm in the country which already has the world's lowest birth rate. \nOnly 275,800 babies were born last year, down 10% from 2019. Around 307,764 people died.\nThe figures prompted the interior ministry to call for \"fundamental changes\" to its policies.\nA declining population puts immense strain on a country.\nApart from increased pressure on public spending as demand for healthcare systems and pensions rise, a declining youth population also leads to labour shortages that have a direct impact on the economy.\nLast month, President Moon Jae-in launched several policies aimed at addressing the low birth rate, including cash incentives for families. \nUnder the scheme, from 2022, every child born will receive a cash bonus of 2 million won ($1,850; \u00a31,350) to help cover prenatal expenses, on top of a monthly payout of 300,000 won handed out until the baby turns one. The incentive will increase to 500,000 won every month from 2025. \nJulie Yoon, BBC Korean\nLargely, it's because in South Korea, women struggle to achieve a balance between work and other life demands. \nHyun-yu Kim is one of them. The oldest of four, she dreamed of having a big family of her own. But faced with conditions that are not family friendly in South Korea, she is reconsidering her plans to have children. \nShe recently accepted a new job and had felt anxious about taking time off for maternity leave. \"People tell me that it's safer to build my career first,\" she told the BBC. \nSoaring real estate prices are another major issue. Ms Kim points out that rapidly rising property prices also discourage young couples.\n\"In order to have children, you need to have your own home. But this has become an impossible dream in Korea.\" \nShe is also unconvinced by the incentives being offered by the government. \n\"It's expensive to raise a child. The government providing an extra couple hundred thousand won won't solve our problems.\""

      "tags": "Belfast,Balham,Death of Nora Quoirin,Malaysia",
      "text": "A girl whose body was found in a jungle during a holiday in Malaysia died by misadventure, a coroner has recorded.\nN\u00f3ra Quoirin, 15, from Balham, south-west London, was discovered dead nine days after she went missing from an eco-resort in August 2019.\nThe family said they were \"utterly disappointed\" with the verdict, which ruled out any criminal involvement.\nThey believe \"layers of evidence\" that were heard at the inquest point towards Nora having been abducted.\nThe family were staying in Sora House in Dusun eco-resort near Seremban, about 40 miles (65km) south of Kuala Lumpur, when they reported N\u00f3ra missing, the day after they had arrived.\nN\u00f3ra, who was born with holoprosencephaly - a disorder which affects brain development - was eventually found by a group of civilian volunteers in a palm-oil plantation less than two miles from the holiday home.\nThe girl who vanished into a Malaysian jungle\nThe Quoirins, whose lawyers had asked the coroner to record an open verdict, said in a statement after the ruling that they have a number of reasons for the abduction theory. These include:\nIn the statement, issued through the Lucie Blackman Trust, the family said they witnessed 80 slides presented in court as the verdict was given, adding that none of them \"engaged with who N\u00f3ra really was - neither her personality nor her intellectual abilities\".\nThey said: \"The coroner made mention several times of her inability to rule on certain points due to not knowing N\u00f3ra enough. \n\"It is indeed our view that to know N\u00f3ra would be to know that she was simply incapable of hiding in undergrowth, climbing out a window and making her way out of a fenced resort in the darkness unclothed.\"\nThe statement added: \"We believe we have fought not just for N\u00f3ra but in honour of all the special needs children in this world who deserve our most committed support and the most careful application of justice. \n\"This is N\u00f3ra's unique legacy and we will never let it go.\"\nFom the outset Meabh Quoirin believed her daughter had been abducted but Malaysian police insisted N\u00f3ra's disappearance had always been a missing persons case and ruled out any criminal involvement.\nThe authorities closed the case in January 2020, and N\u00f3ra's parents pushed for the inquest.\nDuring the inquest, a British pathologist who carried out a second post-mortem examination said N\u00f3ra's body had no injuries to suggest she was attacked or restrained.\nOn the final day of evidence, an investigating officer who was on duty the morning N\u00f3ra was reported missing said he was confident there were no criminal elements involved in her disappearance.\nFollowing the coroner's verdict, the Quoirins' legal team have discussed the family's rights moving forward, which include the possibility of applying for a revision of the misadventure verdict at the High Court of Seremban.\nLouise Azmi, one lawyer for the family, said they had pressed for an open verdict to reflect the lack of positive evidence in the case regarding what happened to Nora. \nAn open verdict would leave open the possibility that a criminal element was involved in Nora's death, Mrs Azmi said.\nShe told the BBC based on everything the family know of Nora, \"they continue to believe it is impossible she would have willingly walked away into the jungle\".\nThe family's legal team say parents Meabh and Sebastien Quoirin are \"disappointed\" with today's verdict. \nBut, Coroner Maimoonah Aid said her verdict was made not on \"theories\" and \"speculation\" surrounding the case, but on the balance of probabilities of the evidence presented before her. \nWith no evidence to the contrary she ruled out foul play. \nMoving forward, the Quoirin family now have the possibility to apply for a revision of the verdict with the High Court of Seremban. \nThere is precedent of a verdict being overturned in Malaysia before.\nIn 2019, following an appeal, a Malaysian coroner's verdict of misadventure concerning the death of 18-year-old model Ivana Smit was overturned in Kuala Lumpur and reopened as a murder investigation. \nAccording to Quoirin family lawyer Sakthy Vell, the family say they now need time to consider their next course of action."

      "tags": "Georgia,US election 2020,Donald Trump",
      "text": "US President Donald Trump has been recorded telling Georgia's top election official to \"find\" enough votes to overturn the election result.\n\"I just want to find 11,780 votes,\" Mr Trump told Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in a recording released by the Washington Post.\nMr Raffensperger is heard replying that Georgia's results are correct.\nJoe Biden won Georgia alongside other swing states, winning 306 electoral college votes to Mr Trump's 232. \nVice-President-elect Kamala Harris called Mr Trump's comments \"a bold abuse of power\".\nIt comes ahead of two crucial runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday that will decide which party controls the Senate.\nSince the 3 November vote, Mr Trump has been making unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud.\nAll 50 states have certified the election result, some after recounts and legal appeals.\nCongress is due to formally approve the election result on 6 January and Mr Biden, a Democrat, is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January.\nAll 10 living former US defence secretaries have urged President Trump not to question the election results in an opinion piece for the Washington Post. The group also said he should not involve the military in voting disputes, an idea that's been mooted by some of Mr Trump's supporters.\nIn excerpts of Saturday's phone call released by the Washington Post, Mr Trump can be heard alternately cajoling and pressurising Georgia's secretary of state.\nHe insisted that he had won the election in Georgia and told Mr Raffensperger that there was \"nothing wrong with saying you have recalculated\".\nMr Raffensperger responded by saying: \"The challenge you have, Mr President, is that the data you have is wrong.\"\nLater in the call, Mr Trump said the rumour was that ballots had been shredded and voting machinery had been removed from Fulton County in the state - claims denied by Mr Raffensperger's lawyer.\nThe president then threatened the official with possible legal consequences.\n\"You know what they did and you're not reporting it. That's a criminal offence. You can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer,\" Mr Trump said.\nHe then called for the extra 11,780 votes - which would have given him a total of 2,473,634 votes in the state, one more than Mr Biden, who received 2,473,633 votes.\nHe told Mr Raffensperger he should re-examine the result in the state.\n\"You can re-examine it, but re-examine it with people who want to find answers, not people who don't want to find answers,\" he said.\n\"Mr President, you have people who submit information and we have our people that submit information, and then it comes before the court and the court has to make a determination,\" Mr Raffensperger replied. \"We have to stand by our numbers, we believe our numbers are right.\"\nMr Trump also warned Mr Raffensperger that by refusing to recalculate the election result he would deter Republicans from turning out to vote in Tuesday's runoff elections for the Senate. \nIf the two Democratic contenders win, then there will be equal numbers of Republican and Democratic senators, and Kamala Harris, as vice-president-elect, will have the deciding vote.\nMr Biden's Democrats already control the lower House of Representatives.\nBoth President Trump and President-elect Biden are due to visit Georgia on Monday to campaign ahead of the elections.\nOn Sunday Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Raffensperger had not given details of the fraud the president alleges. \"He has no clue!\" the president tweeted.\nMr Raffensperger tweeted back: \"Respectfully, President Trump: What you're saying is not true. The truth will come out.\"\nThe White House has not commented on the release of the audio.\nThe only Democrat on Georgia's state election board called on Mr Raffensperger to launch an investigation into the phone call.\n\"It's a crime to solicit election fraud and asking the secretary to change the votes is a textbook definition of election fraud,\" David Worley, an Atlanta lawyer, said in an interview with the Washington Post.\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said Mr Trump was \"unhinged and dangerous\" and that his call to Mr Raffensperger merited \"nothing less than a criminal investigation\".\nModerate Republican Adam Kinzinger also tweeted: \"This is absolutely appalling. To every member of Congress considering objecting to the election results, you cannot - in light of this - do so with a clean conscience.\"\nIn the final weeks of his presidency, Donald Trump is struggling for ways to hold on to power. His latest act was to berate, beg and threaten Georgia's secretary of state to \"find\" the votes necessary to move the state to his column.\nNever mind that there has been no credible evidence of substantive fraud. Never mind that Georgia has counted, then recounted, then recounted again the ballots and found no major disparities. Never mind that the Republican-controlled state has certified its election results and, even if Georgia flipped, it wouldn't be enough to re-elect Trump.\nThe tenor of Trump's call suggests he's not just manoeuvring for post-presidential power or trying to boost his fund-raising haul, however. He appears to firmly believe he won and is willing to use all the tools, some of questionable legality, to push state officials to shift the election in his favour.\nThe call is reminiscent of Trump's \"I would like you to do us a favour, though\" conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinsky, where he pressured and cajoled a foreign leader for political help. \nThat contact resulted in Trump's impeachment. The brazenness of Trump's Saturday call may make it more difficult for the president to rally political support to his cause. \nThe president's desperate times have led to the most desperate of measures.\nThere is a developing split in the Republican party after 11 senators said they would not vote to certify Mr Biden's election victory in a Senate session on 6 January.\nTed Cruz led the group of senators, calling for a 10-day delay to audit unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud.\nVice-President Mike Pence - who as president of the Senate is due to oversee the session and declare Mr Biden the winner - said he welcomed the move.\nHe stopped short of repeating allegations of fraud but his chief of staff said Mr Pence shared what he called \"the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities\".\nMeanwhile, four Republican senators including Mitt Romney have signed a statement saying they will vote to certify Mr Biden's win.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already recognised Mr Biden's victory and asked other Republicans not to object.\nA group of Republicans in the lower chamber of Congress, the House of Representatives, is also planning to contest the election results.\nHowever, for an objection to be upheld, a majority in both chambers must vote in favour. Republicans hold the majority in the Senate but some of their number have already said they will not contest the results. Democrats are in the majority in the House.\nOn Sunday a new Congress convened for the first time, with senators and representatives sworn in. Democrat Nancy Pelosi was narrowly re-elected as House Speaker."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Dialysis patient Brian Pinker, 82, has become the first person to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.\nThe retired maintenance manager got the jab at 7:30 GMT from nurse Sam Foster at Oxford's Churchill Hospital.\nMore than half a million doses of the vaccine are ready for use on Monday.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said it was a \"pivotal moment\" in the UK's fight against the virus, as vaccines will help curb infections and then allow restrictions to be lifted.\nBut Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Monday there was \"no question we will have to take tougher measures\", which will be announced in \"due course\", as the UK struggles to control a new, fast-spreading variant of the virus.\nOn Sunday more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases were recorded in the UK for the sixth day running, prompting Labour to call for a third national lockdown in England.\nNorthern Ireland and Wales currently have their own lockdowns in place and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a fresh lockdown will begin in Scotland from 00:01 on Tuesday.\nThe rollout comes as rows continue over whether pupils should return to school with the current high levels of Covid infections.\nSix hospital trusts - in Oxford, London, Sussex, Lancashire and Warwickshire - have begun administering the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, with 530,000 doses ready for use.\nMost other available doses will be sent to hundreds of GP-led services and care homes across the UK later in the week, according to the Department of Health and Social Care.\nMr Pinker, who has been having dialysis for kidney disease at the Churchill Hospital for a number of years, said he was \"really proud\" the vaccine was developed in Oxford.\n\"The nurses, doctors and staff today have all been brilliant and I can now really look forward to celebrating my 48th wedding anniversary with my wife Shirley later this year,\" he said.\nMusic teacher and father-of-three Trevor Cowlett, 88, and Prof Andrew Pollard, a paediatrician working at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and lead investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, were also among the first to be vaccinated.\nChief nurse Ms Foster, who administered the first dose, told the BBC it was a \"huge privilege\", saying: \"Every single patient that we have vaccinated over the last couple of weeks have got their own personal stories to the difference it's going to make, so it is no different this morning.\"\nSpeaking during a visit to London's Chase Farm Hospital, to meet some of the first people to receive the Oxford vaccine, the prime minister said there were \"tough, tough\" weeks to come.\nThere will now be a \"massive ramp-up\" in vaccination numbers \"in the weeks ahead\", Mr Johnson said, and the number of vaccine doses will amount to \"tens of millions by the end of March\".\nAsked when the government will be able to vaccinate two million people a week, Mr Johnson said the government will give more details \"in the next few days... as soon as we have better numbers to give\".\nMr Hancock told BBC Breakfast the Oxford vaccine rollout was a \"pivotal moment\" in the fight against coronavirus, saying: \"It's going to be a tough few weeks ahead, but this is the way out.\"\nAsked about reports potential volunteers were being deterred by the additional training and forms, Mr Hancock said they were going to \"reduce the amount of bureaucracy\".\n\"For instance there's one of the training programmes about how to tackle terrorism, I don't think that's necessary, we're going to stop that,\" he said.\nHowever, he said this was not delaying the delivery of the vaccine, adding that the next delivery of the vaccine will be \"early this week\" to be \"deployed next week\".\nEngland's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said the vaccines \"give us a route out in the medium term\" but warned the NHS was \"under considerable and rising pressure in the short term\".\nFormer health secretary and Conservative chairman of the Commons' health committee Jeremy Hunt tweeted that it was \"time to act\" and the government needed to close schools and borders, ban all household mixing and impose a 12-week national lockdown in England.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth agreed that a national lockdown was needed, as well as \"rapidly scaled-up vaccine distribution\".\nAs the recent rise in Covid cases puts increased pressure on the NHS, the UK has accelerated its vaccination rollout by planning to give both doses of the vaccine 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between jabs.\nThe UK's chief medical officers have defended the delay to second doses, saying getting more people vaccinated with the first jab \"is much more preferable\".\nMake no mistake, the UK is in a race against time.\nThat much is clear from the decision to delay the second dose of the vaccine to focus on giving as many people as possible their first doses.\nSo how fast can the NHS go? Ultimately it wants to get to two million doses a week.\nThat will not be achieved this week.\nBut Monday marks the start of the NHS putting the accelerator to the floor.\nA rapid increase in the vaccination rate should follow.\nBut how quickly the UK can go is dependent on several complex processes.\nFirst, the vaccine has to be manufactured, then it has to be put into vials and packaged up (known as fill and finish). After that each batch has to be checked and certified before being sent to NHS vaccination sites where there needs to be enough vaccinators and support staff to ensure those doses are given as quickly as possible.\nProblems at any one stage can disrupt how quickly the vaccination programme can be rolled out.\nWhile there are millions of doses of each vaccine in the country and a total of 140 million of both vaccines pre-ordered, there are currently just over one million - around 500,000 of each - ready to be given this week.\nNHS medical director Professor Stephen Powis said: \"The NHS' biggest vaccination programme in history is off to a strong start, thanks to the tremendous efforts of NHS staff who have already delivered more than one million jabs.\"\nHe said the Oxford vaccine rollout was \"chalking up another world first that will protect thousands more over the coming weeks\".\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first jab approved in the UK, and more than a million people have had their first one.\nThe first person to get the jab on 8 December, Margaret Keenan, has already had her second dose.\nThe Oxford jab - which was approved for use in late December - can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, making it easier to distribute and store than the Pfizer jab. It is also cheaper per dose.\nThe UK has secured 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, enough for most of the population.\nCare home residents and staff, people aged over 80, and frontline NHS staff will be first to receive it.\nGPs and local vaccination services have been asked to ensure every care home resident in their local area is vaccinated by the end of January, the Department of Health and Social Care said.\nSome 730 vaccination sites have already been established across the UK, with the total set to surpass 1,000 later this week, the department added."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing",
      "text": "Up to 11,000 people aged over 80 across Northern Ireland are set to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine this week.\nThe aim is to ensure everyone in that age group will be offered the vaccine by the end of January.\nThirty GP practices will be administering 50,000 doses of the vaccine, which was approved for use in the UK on 30 December.\nIt is the second vaccine to be approved in the battle against coronavirus in Northern Ireland.\nIt comes ahead of a UK-wide announcement by the prime minister, set to be made at 20:00 GMT on Monday, in which further restrictions will be announced.  \nIn a statement, a No 10 spokesman said the new variant of Covid-19 had \"led to rapidly escalating case numbers across the country\" and \"further steps must now be taken to arrest this rise\".\nOn Monday, Northern Ireland recorded a further 1,801 Covid-19 cases and 12 more virus-related deaths. \nThese latest figures from the Department of Health bring the total number of deaths to 1,366, while 79,873 people have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic started. \nMore than 12,000 cases have been reported in the past seven days, more than double the week before.\nThe seven-day rate per 100,000 people is now 660 positive cases, compared to 200 per 100,000 two weeks ago.\nMedical experts believe that is down to the two-week easing of restrictions over the Christmas period.\nIn the Republic of Ireland on Monday, an additional 6,110 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were announced, with six further deaths linked to the virus.\nNorthern Ireland is in the second week of a six-week lockdown in which non-essential retail is closed.\nThe first doses of the vaccine were given delivered at a GP surgery on the Falls Road in West Belfast on Monday afternoon. \nThe first person in Northern Ireland to receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine was 94-year-old Eileen Lynch.\nSpeaking after receiving the vaccine, Ms Lynch said she was \"delighted and privileged\" to receive it. \n\"I feel like I can really look forward to the year ahead now that I have been vaccinated,\" she said. \nThe Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has already been used to vaccinate care home residents and staff.\nBy mid December, 50,000 doses of that vaccine had been made available and by 30 December, Northern Ireland's Department of Health reported that 33,000 people had been vaccinated.\nThis included 8,940 care home residents, 10,484 care home staff and 14,259 health and social care staff. \nAccording to the latest NI statistics, for the first time the percentage positive cases in the over 80s is down - an indication the vaccination process is working.   \nThere are approximately 82,000 people over 80 in NI and BBC News NI understands that if deliveries of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine happen as planned, it is thought that all of those over 80, as well as GPs and their staff, could be vaccinated within three weeks. \nWhile 50,000 doses have been delivered to Northern Ireland, a further 23,000 vaccines are expected on 19 January while another 68,000 are due on 24 January.\nDr Alan Stout, who is a GP in Belfast, told BBC News NI that members are \"very optimistic\" that 11,000 people can be vaccinated this week.\nNI's chief medical officer said the Oxford-AstraZeneca rollout would run alongside the ongoing vaccination programme.\nDr Michael McBride said: \"First and foremost we must act to protect those most at risk of severe disease and death.  \n\"The evidence shows that the initial dose of vaccine offers as much as 70% protection against the effects of the virus. \n\"Providing that level of protection on a large scale will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality and hospitalisations, protecting the health and social care system.\"\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has to be kept at an extremely low temperature which complicates handling constraints.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is considered easier to store and distribute.\nIts rollout consists of two full doses of the vaccine, with the second dose to be given four to 12 weeks after the first.\nGPs are appealing to the public to remain calm and wait to be called for their vaccine either by telephone or by letter.\nDr Stout said as demand grows worldwide for the vaccine, that schedule could easily change.    \n\"The public have to be patient, we have a system and must be allowed to get on with it - it really is 'don't call us - we will call you'.\" \nWhile some vaccinations will take place in surgeries others will happen in a drive-through system.\nCovid-19 is deadlier than flu, which means January 2021 is going to be even tougher than usual. \nAlso, Covid patients tend to stay much longer in hospital with more severe symptoms requiring additional beds and care. \nBut those rising patient numbers aren't matched by an increased workforce.\nInstead it is expected that the nurse-patient ratio will increase (even though many aren't trained to work in critical care) as there simply aren't enough nurses available. \nSome health unions fear this will only add to Northern Ireland's excess mortality rate, which is greater than that in Great Britain. \nOnce again, this highlights Northern Ireland's failing health care system, which was already below par well before the start of the pandemic.\nCoronavirus infection figures here are expected to peak between 15 and 21 January. That will be felt not only in hospitals but also in GP practices as they continue to roll out the vaccine. \nWhile at this stage the six weeks look bleak it's hoped that the additional Astra-Zeneca vaccine and the low incidence of flu will go a long way in not only saving lives, but also protecting the health service.\nDr Stout said much planning had gone into ensuring the programme happened as smoothly as possible.\n\"People will literally stay in their cars and be asked to roll up their sleeves - it has to be safe and efficient in order for us to get through it and safely.\"  \nThe UK has ordered 100 million doses of the new vaccine - enough to vaccinate 50 million people.\nMeanwhile, Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland, said it was \"appalling\" that the Pfizer vaccine was not to be administered in two doses within 21 days as instructed by the company and threatened legal action.\nDr Black was responding to news that the UK will give both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart.\n\"They have left care workers in Northern Ireland with a gap in their expected immunity,\" he told BBC NI's Radio Foyle on Monday.\n\"In that period doctors, nurses, porters or health care professionals could infect patients because they will not be protected against the transmission of the infection to patients.\"\nThe UK's chief medical officers have defended their Covid vaccination plan.\nThey said getting more people vaccinated with the first jab was \"much more preferable\" and that the great majority of the initial protection from clinical disease is after the first dose of vaccine.\nDr Black is to meet NI Health Minister Robin Swann later to express health care workers' concern over the change in vaccine policy."

      "tags": "Merthyr Tydfil,Cardiff,Newport,NHS Wales,Mountain Ash,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?\nHere we update some of the key areas of data for measuring the pandemic and we also try to explain some of the different measures being used. \nThe emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 led to record case numbers and fears that a surge in cases could put pressure on hospitals already struggling - as a result, tighter rules were imposed on 26 December.\nBy the second week of January, case numbers began to fall quickly. One week later, the Welsh government was confident the peak had passed and Wales moved to the lowest level of restrictions - alert level zero - on Friday. \nWe saw record numbers of Covid cases in the community in the days after Christmas but this did not translate into a significant rise in hospital cases, with the number of Covid patients now falling for more than a week.\nThere was a rolling average of 560 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on 27 January, a 22% drop on a week ago, although the daily figure has now risen for two successive days to 566.\nThere were two and a half times as many people in hospital with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2021. \nWhen we include patients with suspected Covid and recovering from Covid, there are an average of 1,028 patients. They make up 12% of all hospital patients.  \nThere are now 470 patients who are recovering, so they no longer test positive for Covid but are either still rehabilitating or waiting for a discharge or care support or place to become available. This is the highest number of these patients since last March.\nThe number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stood at 20 on 27 January. This is a figure we last saw in early August.\nThe average daily number has fallen from 28 to 21 in a week.\nAbout 90% of these patients are primarily being treated for Covid.\nThere are seven times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. \nAt the same point in 2021, there were 134 critically ill Covid patients.\nThe mortality rate of a critical care Covid patient, in the most recent study of 623 Welsh patients since May 2021, is about 35%, including those who died later in a general ward.\nAbout half had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic.\nThe average age is 55, nearly two-thirds are men and they are more likely to be overweight. Nearly half are from more deprived parts of Wales. Just under a third are aged under 50.\nThe study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December.\nCovid admissions are at an average of 25 a day - lower than the average of 40 last week - and make up 2.3% of all hospital admissions.\nWe can also see how they are running lower than modelled scenarios, based on various estimates based on vaccine effectiveness.\nWe can see from a comparison with December-January 2020-21, that despite much higher numbers of cases in the community, the hospital admissions rate is much lower.\nAccounting for a 10-day lag between cases being confirmed and hospital admissions, on 24 January, Covid hospital admissions were just less than 1% of positive Covid tests, compared to 9.4% at the same point in 2021.\nAdmissions have been considerably lower compared to the second wave.\nNearly six in 10 cases of patients in hospital with confirmed Covid in the last week were patients being treated for other conditions.\nOnly 41.5% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or \"actively\" treated for the virus.\nBut that proportion rises to 90% of those in critical are.\nThe figures on these \"incidental\" Covid cases are only just being published and reflect the fact there has been a lot of people being infected out in the community, while in the latest week there were 220 patients who caught Covid \"probably\" or \"definitely\" while in hospital for other reasons.\nNearly 10,000 patients have hospital-acquired Covid since the start of the pandemic.\nIt doesn't mean that these patients can't have complications because of having Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.\nSeparate analysis of Covid admissions to Welsh hospitals between the start of the pandemic and August 2021 in Wales estimated that 71.2% were directly due to Covid.\nIn cases where Covid wasn't the primary cause, trauma injuries made up nearly one in five cases, with Welsh Government scientists saying acute illnesses were known to increase the propensity to fall, which on top of reduced physical activity and consequent muscle loss due to shielding and self-isolation issues, \"would increase the likelihood of hip fractures\".\nOne indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which has been 90.7% on average for the week, at its highest level over the last two weeks.\nThe other measure is NHS staff absence.\nLatest figures show NHS staff sickness related to Covid-19 in Wales has improved slightly over the last two weeks after being at its highest level since the start of the first wave.  \nOverall staff absence was slightly higher last winter.\nA total of 1.5% of staff were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 24 January. Another 1% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the weekly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. \nThe total absence proportion has dropped to 7.1%.\nAbout 84% of those eligible for a booster in Wales have now received one.\nThere have been an average of 3,494 boosters given out a day in the past week, which has seen a drop off, as the programme works through people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Before Christmas, the daily average was 42,500.\nAt the peak of the vaccine programme in March, between 38,000 and 40,000 daily vaccines were given out. \nAbout 61% of all vaccines being given out are boosters, with nearly two thirds of 12 to 15-year-olds now having a second dose.\nThe chart above shows the number of people admitted to hospital who have had two doses of vaccine, and those who have had none, for every 100,000 people.\nIt shows the rate of admissions for over-60s who have not had a jab is nearly triple that of those who have been double jabbed and is also far higher for the 18-59 age group.\nThe latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests - based on swab samples of 9,430 people - that one in 30 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 22 January.\nThat is 99,500 people, or 3.27% of the population.\nThat's estimated to be highest in youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nThis shows another decrease, compared to the estimate of 112,100 the previous week.\nWhen it comes to age groups, the highest proportion of people infected are youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nCase rates are becoming more problematic to interpret, because three-quarters of people who test positive for lateral flow tests are no longer asked to take follow-up PCR tests.\nThe infection survey is a useful indicator, as it picks up asymptomatic people.\nONS says it shows Covid infections fell in Wales, as in England and Scotland, with an uncertain trend in Northern Ireland. Similar surveys showed infections were one in 30 in Scotland too and one in 20 in England and Northern Ireland. \nIt's now more than two weeks since results from the new testing criteria started coming in, which meant most asymptomatic people no longer needed to take follow-up PCR tests if they tested positive with a lateral flow device. \nAround 80% of those testing positive for lateral flows did not take a follow-up test in the latest week.\nWe know that there were 17,000 people with positive LFTs in the week to 22 January, who did not have follow-up PCR tests and so were not included in the case rate figures - set against 16,000 positive PCR results in the same period. LFT results are published weekly and so we have to be careful with comparisons and interpretation.\nBut if we look at the trend from those figures taken roughly together, in the latest week they would have pushed up the case rate more noticeably than it has risen in recent days. But this is still well down on the numbers we saw in early January.\nThe positivity rate has levelled out - at 34.4% - roughly the same as the week before.\nThe nature of this wave so far has been defined by the age profile.\nThis can also be seen in the big change in January 2022, compared to the week in 2021.\nAround 10% of Covid cases in Wales were in the over-60s, compared to 22% in the very early days of the vaccine roll out in January 2021. \nThere has been a big rise in the proportion of cases in the under 19 age group, now making up a third of all cases.\nThis is back to a share not seen since September and early October and can probably be linked to schools going back.\nAbsence for Covid-related reasons in primary schools has been an average of 4.7% and 2.7% in secondary schools in the last week.\nMost age groups are showing a decline, although there has been a recent rise in the under 16 age group.\nThis week, the proportion of cases among the under 19 age group reached 37% of all positive tests for the first time since September.\nThe 30 to 39 age group remained the largest group. \nCouncil areas in Cardiff and Vale and the Aneurin Bevan health board area all showed rises, as 13 of Wales' 22 local authority areas showed falls in under 25s in the week ending 20 January.\nNewport (1122.9 cases per 100,000) had the highest rate in the under 25s, as it did for case rates as a whole, showing how younger people have generally driven rises in case rates.\nNewport also had above average case numbers in the over 60s.\nMeanwhile, the R-number - reproduction number - for Wales has been estimated at the slightly lower range, between 1.1 and 1.5, up to 13 January. This is a calculation which looks at various factors to work out a transmission rate for Covid. It suggests that for every 10 people with Covid, another 11 to 13 people would be infected.\nRecent modelling, published on 7 January, indicated a rise over the following two weeks, with the situation unlikely to ease. \nBut a fall in cases led First Minister Mark Drakeford, a week later, to say there were \"positive signs that the peak may have passed\" although he added caution over a \"fast-moving and volatile variant\".\nBy 21 January, after a sharp drop, he could say \"confidently\" that Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron wave and the \"incredibly high levels of infections we have seen across Wales\".\nThe latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests that 97.4% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.\nAlthough slightly less than the other UK nations, it is an increasing proportion and the highest yet recorded, since estimates began more than a year ago.\nThe estimate is 97.2% of 16 to 24-year-olds would have tested positive for antibodies, although it falls to 96.4% for those aged over 80. It is as high as 98.2% for people in their 70s. \nONS also estimates that 88% of 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales have antibodies.\nIn the most recent week, up to 14 January, 69 people in Wales had a death which involved Covid-19 - and saw it included as a contributory factor on a death certificate.\nThis compared to 61 deaths registered in the previous week, according to the ONS.\nIn 77.4% of cases (across England and Wales) in the latest week, Covid was the underlying cause of death - so deaths were due to Covid. This is a lower proportion than seen in earlier months, when it averaged 87%.\nThere were no deaths from Covid in only three counties in the latest week: Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Powys.\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr health board area had 18 deaths.\nDuring 2021, there were 4,007 deaths involving Covid, of those registered up to now.\nThat includes 204 deaths in December. Back in December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.\nThe second wave in the winter brought 83 deaths alone on 11 January 2021 - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.\nA total of 9,384 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales - with 65 actually occurring, rather than just being registered, over the most recent week.\nThe ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.\nBecause Public Health Wales' \"snapshot\" measure only includes deaths within 28 days and after a positive Covid lab test, mostly in hospitals, it excludes deaths involving Covid elsewhere, including many deaths in the first wave of the pandemic, hundreds of deaths in people's own homes and where doctors suspect Covid has been a contributory factor.\nONS also records so-called \"excess deaths\". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared to the five-year, non-pandemic average.\nSo since March 2020, there have been 6,520 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.\nDeaths ran above average for the last half of 2021 and in the latest week were the same as the five-year norm. \nNearly a fifth of all Covid deaths (19%) registered have occurred in care homes.\nThere were 10 deaths involving a care home resident in the latest week.\nCare Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,019 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid- 16.1% of all reported deaths.\nDeaths in people's own homes have also been running at more than a third higher than average.\nWe can also see how deaths in the third wave have been at much lower levels than in the second wave.\nCovid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in Wales in December. \nMortality analysis by the ONS showed it accounted for 5.4% of all registered deaths. This compares with 5.2% of all deaths in England.\nCovid was the third leading cause of death in the previous three months and had been ranked as the leading cause of death in six months since the pandemic began.\nDementia, heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases were the three leading causes of death in Wales in December. Flu and pneumonia ranked seventh, with the mortality rate significantly lower than normal levels.\nCovid was the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease throughout 2021.\nThe ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in December was 59.3 deaths per 100,000 - significantly lower than the previous month. This was lower than five of the nine English regions: the north west, north east, east and west Midlands and the highest in London (70 deaths per 100,000).\nFour health board areas in Wales had mortality rates in December higher than the Welsh average - the highest was 107 deaths per 100,000 in Cardiff and Vale due to Covid.\nAcross the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is the same in Wales and England - 147.4 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (126.9) and Northern Ireland (132.5) both lower in the 22 months to the end of December.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England, than in Wales.\nWhen a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales again.\nONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found since the pandemic began, Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 79.6% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales. \nThis is a fall from 83.9% in November. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic it has been 87%.\nIn around 3% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was \"suspected\".\nA doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. \nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.\nBy the second week of January, RCT and Cardiff each had a total 1,024 deaths.\nRCT also has the seventh highest mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales.\nSix of its communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates are broken down further.\nThe area with the highest number of deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic was Tonyrefail, with a total of 57 deaths due to Covid, followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot (52) and Porth East in Rhondda Cynon Taf (48 deaths), by the end of April 2021.\nWhen translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Llanelli Bigyn is the highest, followed by Port Talbot East.\nAnd there is one community remaining which has had no Covid deaths at all through the pandemic - Llandudno Junction South & Llansanffraid Glan Conwy.\nIn the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.\nThe ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing:\nPublic Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus:\nThe graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW. There is also a similar count used by the UK government, which takes the PHW statistics and involves people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.\nThere is a difference of about 2,620 deaths.\nAccording to the PHW measure, on 28 January, there had been a total of 6,804 deaths with Covid, with the daily average running at four a day in the last week.\nMore than eight million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic so far.\nNHS Wales labs have capacity to handle 15,000 a day but private labs process most of the test results.\nAlthough PHW figures show more than 765,000 positive tests, this is not the total number of people who have had Covid as mass testing was not available until the tail end of the first wave of the pandemic.\nSince the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, more lateral flow tests (LFTs) of asymptomatic people have been undertaken, which saw more positive tests eventually feeding into the system - adding about 10% to numbers.\nThe most recent week has seen more than 383,000 LFTs, with a record 21,127 positive. This positive proportion of 11% in the week ending 23 January, was another record. \nThe highest incidence is still among the under 20s - 8,873 positive tests, an 87% rise - and the positivity rate of 24.9% is also the highest  -which is likely to be associated with schools going back.\nIt is the only age group showing a rise, although figures will not show up in overall case numbers.\nFrom 6 January 2022, most people who take LFTs are not being asked to take a follow-up PCR test if positive. This will affect the number of cases which appear - only counting those who come forward with symptoms. This will have to be taken into account when interpreting case data.\nAbout 19,000 tests are routinely taken in hospitals each week and 25,000 in care homes. \nThe number of tests processed in the last two weeks have showed a big drop - half what they were a fortnight ago.\nAbout 96% of tests requiring a rapid turnaround were completed within one calendar day.\nThere have been 1,068 positive tests in care homes among residents and staff in the latest week, following routine testing. This is down on two weeks before, which set a record high since the programme returned in October 2020.\nCare Inspectorate Wales figures also show 235 (22.3%) care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.\nThis is also fall on the previous week.\nIn the last two weeks, there have also been 39 reported deaths of residents with confirmed or suspected Covid.\nThe dominant variant in Wales is now Omicron, with more than 12,344 new cases sequenced.\nNumbers are now only being reported weekly, as the variant has taken hold.\nPHW increased lab capacity in readiness for sequencing more cases. About 20-30% of positive cases in Wales, which are flagged as being more likely to be variants, have swabs sent for sequencing, with results coming back a few days after people get their normal test results.\nWe can also see more people reporting symptoms of \"long Covid\" - 58,000 estimated in Wales to be experiencing the long-term effect of having the virus. \nThis includes 21,000 people estimated to still be reporting symptoms a year or more after their infection."

      "tags": "Julian Assange,Extradition,Wikileaks,United States",
      "text": "Wikileaks founder Julian Assange cannot be extradited to the United States, a court in London has ruled.\nThe judge blocked the request because of concerns over Mr Assange's mental health and risk of suicide in the US.\nMr Assange, who is wanted over the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011, says the case is politically motivated. \nExpressing disappointment at the ruling, the US justice department noted that its legal arguments had prevailed.\nIts position is that the leaks broke the law and endangered lives. \n\"While we are extremely disappointed in the court's ultimate decision, we are gratified that the United States prevailed on every point of law raised,\" the justice department said.    \nThe US authorities have 14 days in which to lodge an appeal and are expected to do so. \nMr Assange will now be taken back to Belmarsh Prison - where he is being held - and a full application for his bail will be made on Wednesday. \nHis lawyer Ed Fitzgerald QC told the court there would be evidence to show Mr Assange would not abscond. \nDistrict Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that while US prosecutors had met the tests for Mr Assange to be extradited for trial, the US was incapable of preventing him from attempting to take his own life.\nOutlining evidence of his self-harm and suicidal thoughts, she said: \"The overall impression is of a depressed and sometimes despairing man fearful for his future.\"\nShe said: \"Faced with the conditions of near total isolation without the protective factors which limited his risk at HMP Belmarsh, I am satisfied the procedures described by the US will not prevent Mr Assange from finding a way to commit suicide and for this reason I have decided extradition would be oppressive by reason of mental harm and I order his discharge.\"\nMr Assange, who wore a blue suit and green face mask in the dock, closed his eyes as the judge read out her ruling on Monday.\nHis fiancee Stella Moris, with whom he has two young sons, wept and was comforted by Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson, who sat next to her in court.\nSpeaking outside court after the ruling, she called on the US president to \"end this now\".\n\"Mr President, tear down these prison walls,\" she said. \"Let our little boys have their father. Free Julian, free the press, free us all.\"\nDistrict Judge Vanessa Baraitser explicitly concluded that Mr Assange should answer allegations that he aided and abetted hacking, theft and the disclosure of the identities of informants working for the US security agencies - disclosures that endangered their lives. \nIn English law, that would be enough for him to be charged with a crime here - and so the route was open for Mr Assange to face trial for the same in the United States. \nBut British extradition law also requires a judge to consider Mr Assange's health. \nAnd it's the effect of his possible detention in near-solitary confinement in a \"supermax\" prison that proved decisive. \nThe US, in the judge's conclusion, can't stop a mentally unwell man taking his own life in those conditions. \nAnd so the legal requirement to treat Mr Assange humanely trumps the seriousness of the case that the judge acknowledges he should answer. \nWhen the US appeals - it'll have to convince more senior judges otherwise.\nIf convicted in the US, Mr Assange faces a possible penalty of up to 175 years in jail, his lawyers have said. However the US government said the sentence was more likely to be between four and six years.\nMr Assange faces an 18-count indictment from the US government, accusing him of conspiring to hack into US military databases to acquire sensitive secret information relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, which was then published on the Wikileaks website.\nHe says the information exposed abuses by the US military. \nBut US prosecutors say the leaks of classified material endangered lives, and so the US sought his extradition from the UK.\nExtradition is the process under which one country can ask another to hand over a suspect to face trial.\nFollowing the judgement, several politicians and organisations welcomed the news, although some expressed dismay that the ruling was made on health grounds:\nMr Assange was jailed for 50 weeks in May 2019 for breaching his bail conditions after going into hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\nHe sought refuge in the embassy for seven years from 2012 until he was arrested in April 2019.\nAt the time he fled to the embassy, he had been facing extradition to Sweden on allegations of sexual assault which he denied. That case was later dropped."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has reiterated his position that a Scottish independence referendum should be a \"once-in-a-generation\" vote.\nSpeaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, the prime minister said the gap between referendums on Europe - the first in 1975 and the second in 2016 - was \"a good sort of gap\".\nHowever, Mr Marr suggested that now \"things had changed\" for Scotland.\nNicola Sturgeon wants to see an independent Scotland join the EU.\nAndrew Marr asked the prime minister what a voter in Scotland should do if they decided that a second independence referendum was now something they wanted, and what were the \"democratic tools\" to now do that?\nMr Johnson replied by saying: \"Referendums in my experience, direct experience, in this country are not particularly jolly events.\n\"They don't have a notably unifying force in the national mood, they should be only once-in-a-generation.\"\nAsked what the difference was between a referendum on EU membership being granted and one on Scottish independence being requested, he said: \"The difference is we had a referendum in 1975 and we then had another one in 2016.\n\"That seems to be about the right sort of gap.\"\nThe 2014 independence referendum resulted in a 55.3% vote against Scotland going alone.\nOn Hogmanay, Nicola Sturgeon said Europe should \"keep a light on\" as Scotland will be \"back soon\".\nThe first minister tweeted just after the Brexit transition period formally ended at 11:00 on 31 December 2020.\nScotland's trading and travel relationships with EU countries will now be governed by the agreement announced by the UK government on Christmas Eve.\nMs Sturgeon reiterated the SNP's call for an independent Scotland to join the EU.\nTweeting a picture of the words Europe and Scotland joined by a love heart, she wrote: \"Scotland will be back soon, Europe. Keep the light on.\"\nSNP depute leader Keith Brown said: \"It may be a new year but it's the same old incoherent bluster from Boris Johnson. The prime minister pretends otherwise but he knows he can't keep on denying democracy.\n\"Even his American pal Donald Trump has learned that if you try to stand in the way of the democratic choice of a nation you get swept away.\n\"The people who will decide our future are the people of Scotland, not Boris Johnson and the Westminster Tories.\"\nFormer Labour prime minister Tony Blair said it was \"extremely difficult\" to challenge the SNP on independence when the party was \"virtually uncontested\" in Scotland.\nHe said: \"We had a referendum that rejected Scottish independence, but Brexit put it back on the agenda again. And it's going to require very careful management. The truth of the matter is it's still not in Scotland's interest to separate from England.\n\"There are huge economic and political reasons for the United Kingdom to stay the United Kingdom but we're going to have to examine whether there's different constitutional settlements.\n\"I also think it's incredibly important, the single most important thing politically to my mind, is that we get a really capable opposition in Scotland - which should be the Labour Party - that's capable of contesting the Scottish nationalist position in Scotland in a way that prevents them from doing what they do at the moment, which is govern Scotland but pretend they're in opposition.\"\nScottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater said: \"Only the people of Scotland have the right to determine Scotland's future.\n\"Seventeen consecutive opinion polls have demonstrated majorities in favour of independence, with the most recent indicating a record 58% support.\n\"Whether it's the botched handling of the coronavirus crisis, the Brexit catastrophe or just the heartlessness of Tory governments we haven't voted for, it's clear that the UK isn't working for Scotland.\""

      "text": "The Scottish cabinet will meet later to consider further measures to help tackle coronavirus, as 2,464 new cases are reported.\nThe Scottish Parliament will then be recalled for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to make an \"urgent statement\". \nMs Sturgeon said the \"rapid increase in Covid cases driven by the new variant\" was of \"very serious concern\". \n\"We are in a race between this faster spreading strain of Covid and the vaccination programme,\" she tweeted.\nShe warned on Friday that the next few weeks could be the most dangerous period for Scotland since March in the fight against Covid.\nThe latest government figures for coronavirus cases showed that 15.2% of Saturday's 17,328 tests were positive. \nIt is higher than the 2,137 cases reported on Friday, but still lower than Thursday's 2,539 positive results. \nFigures for hospital admissions and deaths over the holiday weekend will not be published until Tuesday.\nThe cabinet is likely to consider a further delay to the return of Scottish schools and restrictions that are closer to the stay-at-home lockdown in March.\n\"All decisions just now are tough, with tough impacts,\" Ms Sturgeon wrote on twitter. \"Vaccines give us way out, but this new strain makes the period between now and then the most dangerous since start of pandemic.\"\nThe Scottish government's emergency resilience committee heard on Saturday that \"quick and decisive action is needed\" as the new variant of the virus is becoming the dominant one in Scotland.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"The even steeper rises and severe pressure on the NHS that is being experienced in some other parts of the UK is a sign of what may lie ahead in Scotland if we do not take all possible steps now to slow the spread of the virus, while the vaccination programme progresses. \n\"The strong message remains - people should stay at home as much as possible and avoid non-essential interaction with others.\"\nThis is just the fifth time the Scottish Parliament has been recalled and the second time within the last week.\nPublic health expert Prof Linda Bauld, from the University of Edinburgh, has said Scotland should be prepared for Covid restrictions to be extended as infection rates continue to rise.\nShe said there were no signs yet that the infection rate was levelling off, having risen suddenly from a daily rate of fewer than 1,000 to more than 2,000 per day in recent days.\nShe told BBC Scotland: \"It definitely is a fragile situation and you can see that we have more cases than we would expect at the current time.\n\"We may be starting to see some of the impacts of the Christmas mixing, but also we know around four in 10 cases, from recent data, are of the new variant.\n\"I would imagine that the new variant is playing a role in these higher rates of infection and if these numbers continue to sit at where they are we are going to have more people in hospital in a week or two's time, and that is very worrying.\"\nThe new year offers new hope in the struggle against coronavirus with two vaccines now authorised for UK use - but it looks as if the situation will get worse before it gets better.\nMinisters are worried by the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus during a holiday period when the highest level of restrictions are already in place. \nThey think more needs to be done to suppress the virus, to give the vaccination programme a chance to accelerate and give increasing numbers of people protection.\nWhen the Scottish cabinet meets they are likely to consider tightening the current restrictions to something closer to the stay at home lockdown of March 2020.\nThat will almost certainly mean a further delay to the return of schools into February.\nMinisters will take decisions on Monday morning with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expected to make a statement at Holyrood in the afternoon. \nDaily confirmed cases in Scotland reached record highs on the last three days of 2020, rising to to 2,622 on Thursday.\nMs Sturgeon warned last week there might be changes to the plans for reopening schools. Children start online learning from 11 January and are set to return to class by 18 January.\nThe education recovery group will meet on Monday. \nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the situation was \"deteriorating and fast-moving\" but any decision to extend school closures should be clearly explained to parents and teachers. \nHe said: \"We have been here before so if schools remain closed, the Scottish government must show that it has learned from past mistakes in order to minimise disruption to education.\"\nScottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the Scottish government should prioritise teachers and school staff as vaccines were rolled out. \nHe added: \"We must be honest and accept that most pupils, teachers and support staff cannot go back to schools until the situation is brought under control.\"\nScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard called for ministers to publish the evidence behind all of its decisions to ensure public consent and compliance.\n\"What is clear is that we need to see an acceleration of the vaccine rollout and a step-change in testing,\" he said. \n\"It is also clear that financial support from government has simply not been nearly sufficient to make up for the damage that lockdown measures have done to jobs, livelihoods and businesses. The SNP government must distribute additional funds to the frontline now.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: \"With tighter restrictions on movement and in schools comes a greater responsibility on the government to show its workings.\n\"If we are to restrict people's movement then we need to see what the benefit will be. We need an exit plan to give people hope, as well as to show them what is required to ease the restrictions on our freedoms.\""

It's not so much we think our children are in danger - it's the people they are going to bring it down to.\"\nVicky also says even in Tier 4 the current restrictions do not seem to be particularly strict.\n\"You can still go to work and go to school, it doesn't feel safe. \n\"My dad is quite happy for her to go to school, but how is she going to feel if she gives it to her granddad.

      "tags": "Liverpool",
      "text": "Gerry and the Pacemakers singer Gerry Marsden, whose version of You'll Never Walk Alone became a football terrace anthem for his hometown club of Liverpool, has died at the age of 78.\nHis family said he died on Sunday after a short illness not linked to Covid-19.\nMarsden's band was one of the biggest success stories of the Merseybeat era, and in 1963 became the first to have their first three songs top the chart.\nThe band's other best known hit, Ferry Cross The Mersey, came in 1964.\nIt was written by Marsden himself as a tribute to his city, and reached number eight.\nMarsden was made an MBE in 2003 for services to charity after supporting victims of the Hillsborough disaster.\nAt the time, he said he was \"over the moon\" to have received the honour, following his support for numerous charities across Merseyside and beyond.\nMarsden's daughter, Yvette Marbeck, said he went into hospital on Boxing Day after tests showed he had a serious blood infection that had travelled to his heart.\nMs Marbeck told the PA news agency: \"It was a very short illness and too quick to comprehend really.\"\nHe died in hospital, Ms Marbeck said, adding: \"He was our dad, our hero, warm, funny and what you see is what you got.\"\nLiverpool FC posted on social media that Marsden's words would \"live on forever with us\".\nGerry and the Pacemakers worked the same Liverpool club circuit as The Beatles in the 1960s and were signed by the Fab Four's manager Brian Epstein.\nEpstein gave Marsden's group the song How Do You Do It, which had been turned down by The Beatles and Adam Faith, for their debut single.\nSir Paul McCartney described Gerry and the Pacemakers as The Beatles's \"biggest rivals\" on the Merseyside scene.\n\"I'll always remember you with a smile,\" Sir Paul said in his tribute to Marsden.\nAnd the other surviving Beatle, Sir Ringo Starr, sent \"peace and love\" to Marsden's family in a tribute on Twitter.\nWhile Marsden was a songwriter as well as a singer, his most enduring hit was actually a cover of a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical number from 1945, which he had to convince his bandmates to record as their third single.\nIn many interviews over the years, he explained how fate played a part in his band ever recording the song. He was watching a Laurel and Hardy movie at Liverpool's Odeon cinema in the early 1960s and, only because it was raining, he decided to stay for the second part of a double feature. \nThat turned out to be the film Carousel - which featured that song on its soundtrack - and Marsden was so moved by the lyrics that he became determined that it should become part of his band's repertoire.\nIn a 2013 interview, Marsden told the Liverpool FC website how You'll Never Walk Alone was adopted by the club's fans as soon as it topped the chart in 1963: \"I remember being at Anfield and before every kick off they used to play the top 10 from number 10 to number one, and so You'll Never Walk Alone was played before the match. I was at the game and the fans started singing it.\n\"When it went out of the top 10 they took the song off the playlist and then for the next match the Kop were shouting 'Where's our song?' So they had to put it back on. \n\"Now, every time I go to the game I still get goose pimples when the song comes on and I sing my head off.\"\nSir Kenny Dalglish, who managed Liverpool at the time of the Hillsborough tragedy, tweeted that he was \"saddened\" by the news of Marsden's death, and that You'll Never Walk Alone was an \"integral part of Liverpool Football Club, and never more so than now\".\nLiverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram posted a tribute on Twitter, saying he was \"devastated\" by the news.\nBy BBC Radio Merseyside's Spencer Leigh\nGerry was an entertainer. He loved being an entertainer; he loved people seeing him in the street and asking him for his autograph and the like. \nHe had a very distinctive voice, and that is terribly important. You knew instantly it was him on those records. He was best on those ballads. \nI think he really did them very well indeed. You'll Never Walk Alone was a big show song that had been around for years and years, and lots of people had done it. \nJust before Gerry brought his version out, Johnny Mathis brought his out. If that version had been played on the Kop, I don't think the Kop would have taken to it because you couldn't sing along with Johnny Mathis - he had too big a range and too perfect a voice. \nBut Gerry sounded like everyman and it was absolutely perfect for the Kop. I think it's the greatest football anthem of the lot. \nAs well as being a Liverpool anthem, You'll Never Walk Alone has also been adopted by fans at both Celtic in Scotland and Borussia Dortmund in Germany.\nMarsden's career began at legendary live music venue, The Cavern Club, where The Pacemakers played nearly 200 times.\nThe club said on Twitter that Marsden was \"not only a legend, but also a very good friend of The Cavern\".\nGerry and The Pacemakers achieved nine hit singles and two hit albums between 1963 and 1965, before splitting up.\nMarsden pursued a solo career before the band reformed in 1974 for a world tour.\nIn 1985, Marsden was back in the pop spotlight when he was invited to be one of the vocalists of a charity version of You'll Never Walk Alone, which was released to raise funds for victims of a fire at a Bradford City match. \nIn doing so, Marsden set another chart record by becoming the first person to sing on two different chart-topping versions of the same song.\nSo when, after the Hillsborough tragedy in 1989, the other Pacemakers classic of Ferry Cross The Mersey was chosen to raise funds for its victims and a group of famous Liverpudlian singers was gathered, Marsden was again included and was back at number one once more for a cause he held dear for the rest of his life.\nMarsden was awarded the Freedom of Liverpool in April 2009, an occasion he marked by boarding a ferry across the Mersey and getting out his guitar to sing his famous hit which described the scene."

      "text": "About 10 UK nationals resident in Spain say they were wrongly turned back when their flight landed in Barcelona.\nThey left Heathrow on the Saturday morning British Airways flight, but were refused entry on arrival.\nThey were stopped by border police and ultimately flown back to the UK.\nSpain has banned all but Spanish nationals and residents flying from the UK to Spain since 22 December in the hope of containing the spread of the new UK strain of Covid-19. \nOne passenger on the flight, who did not wish to be named, said that those on board had been told repeatedly that only Spanish nationals or residents would be allowed to enter the country and that their residency certificates, also known as green certificates, were shown to airline staff several times. \nHowever, on arrival, British passengers with green residency certificates were prevented from entering Spain. \nBA has confirmed that about 10 people were denied entry into Barcelona, as they did not meet the Spanish authorities' required criteria. \nOne of those affected, Ruth O'Leary, said: \"I was very confused, obviously. I asked them what other documents I could provide. \n\"They seemed to be just flat-out refusing anything I had and just wouldn't let me on the flight. Very upsetting really. \n\"Quite an awful feeling not to be able to go back to your own house and to not really be given an explanation why you can't go home.\"\nOther British expat passengers have also said that they have been stopped from boarding planes to Spain. \nOne passenger on board said that seven British citizens were prevented from boarding a British Airways/Iberia flight from Heathrow to Madrid on Saturday evening, despite having their green residency certificates, as well as negative Covid tests. \nThe exact number of flights and passengers affected has not been released by the Foreign Office. \nIn a statement on Monday, Iberia said that on 1 January, it received an email from the border police saying that registration as a European citizen was no longer considered to be a valid document to prove legal residency in Spain as a British citizen. \nHowever, by 19:30 on 2 January, the airline received a second email, confirming that the document could be used if it had not expired. \nA British Airways spokesperson said: \"In these difficult and unprecedented times with dynamic travel restrictions, we are doing everything we can to help and support our customers.\"\nThe Spanish Embassy in London tweeted a letter stating it was aware that during the current travel restrictions, there had been some problems for British nationals resident in Spain who had not been allowed to return. \nThe embassy clarified that green certificates were valid proof of residency. \nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: \"We have worked closely with the Spanish government to resolve these issues.\n\"The Spanish Embassy in London has re-confirmed today that both the green residence certificate and the new residence TIE card [Photo-ID card] are equally valid in terms of proving residence in Spain, as set out in the [Brexit] Withdrawal Agreement.\""

      "text": "It has been described as a \"momentous day\" in the fight against Covid-19 as the rollout of the second Covid vaccine begins in Wales.\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething said the start of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine programme was \"a key milestone\" in the fight against Covid. \nThe Welsh Government said 40,000 doses will be available within the first two weeks - with 22,000 jabs this week.\nMore than 35,000 people in Wales have had a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose.\nThe number of mass vaccination centres in Wales will be increased to 22 and more than 60 GP surgeries will offer the Oxford vaccine - mobile units will also be set up throughout Wales.\nOne of the first people to receive the vaccine on Monday was Ralph Evans, 88, who was vaccinated at the Pontcae medical practice in Merthyr Tydfil.\nHe was one of eight people there to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Mr Evans said he was \"very grateful\" to be getting it. \nHe was followed by 86-year-old Derek Games, former mayor of Merthyr, who said: \"I'm delighted, I'm very privileged to have it.\"\nThe medical centre hopes to vaccinate 1,000 people by the end of January after being contacted on New Year's Eve about starting vaccinations.\n\"We received a hundred vaccines at lunchtime today,\" practice manager Kevin Rogers said. \"We hope to get through the hundred this week.\"\nMr Rogers said they would be asking staff to work additional hours on weekends to help reach the target of 1,000 people over the coming weeks.\nThe Welsh Government's priority is to vaccinate front-line health and social care staff, care home residents and staff, and people over 80.\nPlaid Cymru said \"serious questions\" remained about the roll-out plans, while a professor in palliative medicine said she was concerned \"at the very slow apparent roll out\" for those aged over 85.\nMari Lloyd Williams, from the University of Liverpool, said \"huge numbers have self-shielded since March\".\n\"Apart from intense loneliness this leads to loss of confidence and reduction in both physical and mental and cognitive well-being, meaning that some may need to enter full time care sooner,\" she said.\n\"We need to be vaccinating 24/7 in order to get this under control and to protect our most vulnerable.\"\nThe Pfizer vaccine has to be kept at -70C, but the Oxford jab can be stored at standard fridge temperatures so can be administered in doctors surgeries, pharmacies and care homes.\nDialysis patient Brian Pinker, 82, was the first person to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in Oxford.\n\"It is an absolutely momentous day,\" said Dr Gillian Richardson, who is leading the Covid vaccination programme in Wales.\n\"The vaccine has been prioritised for those groups where it has been harder to reach with the Pfizer vaccine - so we're prioritising the over 80s and care home staff and residents.\"\nMs Richardson said the pace of the rollout \"will be governed by supply\" and \"will start slowly this week but build vastly over the coming weeks and months.\"\nBoth vaccines require two doses to be administered with an interval of between four and 12 weeks - a change from the previous advice of four weeks between jabs.\nThe change has been \"very controversial\", according to one GP who will administer the Oxford vaccine, but she agrees with the decision.\n\"The evidence suggests that a longer time period between first dose and second booster gives you better immunity,\" said Dr Rowena Christmas, a Monmouthshire GP whose surgery is part of the rollout pilot.\n\"The key thing is we need to protect people. If we gave 1,000 second doses of the Pfizer vaccine next week then that's 1,000 people who won't get the first protection.\n\"As soon as you have the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, within about 10 days you've got 70% protection from coronavirus.\n\"But if you are in the 30% that does catch it, you're much less likely to get severely ill and much less likely to go to hospital.\n\"We are in a crisis situation and we have to protect as many people as we possibly can.\"\nWales is under \"stay at home\" lockdown restrictions after a rise in Covid-19 cases - with more than 31,000 cases in Wales in the two weeks over the Christmas period.\nThere are almost 2,700 people with coronavirus symptoms in Welsh hospitals - with \"more than half\" of the 208 critical care patients having Covid.\nBut Mr Gething said Wales' overall Covid incidence rate had fallen from a high of 636 cases per 100,000 people before the lockdown started to 446 cases on Monday.\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas with nine out of the top 10 of the UK's most infected counties in Wales.\nLatest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK.\n\"Cases of the virus remain very high\" although rates had fallen back from the incredibly high levels from just before Christmas,\" said Mr Gething.\nThe British Medical Association in Wales said there was concern among staff that a 12-week gap between doses could lead to \"sacrificing some immunity\" because trials had involved a shorter gap. \nBut First Minister Mark Drakeford said the longer time between doses and the rollout of a second jab would see the pace of vaccinations increase.\n\"By the end of the month we will be doing in a day what we've been able to do in a week prior to Christmas, maybe more than that,\" he said.\nUnlike the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is stored at normal vaccine fridge temperatures so will have fewer storage and transport issues, making it much easier to use in care homes and GP surgeries.\n\"This is a game changer in the fight against Covid, it's absolutely huge,\" Dr Christmas, principal GP at the Wye Valley Practice, told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We need this vaccine because it's easy to give. We can now all get involved and start this rollout of this crucial vaccination programme.\"\nThe Welsh Government said every health board in Wales will receive its allocation in proportion to the size of its priority population and ability to deliver.\nBut it warned the effects of the vaccines may not be seen nationally for many months and the advice remained to keep contacts with others to a minimum, keep a two-metre distance from others, wash hands regularly, wear a face covering where required and avoid touching surfaces others have touched. \nPeople have also been asked not to phone their GP, pharmacy or hospital to ask when they will get a vaccine and wait for a letter which \"will provide people with a measure of assurance\" and will explain how they will be contacted.\nMr Gething said: \"Today marks a key milestone in our fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\"Its approval will help us to speed up our vaccination programme and run more clinics closer to people's homes\".\nWhile Plaid Cymru are \"pleased\" with the second vaccine rollout, health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"Wales has been behind every other UK nation in terms of numbers vaccinated and there's far too much variation from region to region - Welsh Government must not allow a postcode lottery.\" \nThe Welsh Conservatives previously criticised the speed of the first vaccine rollout, saying hope had \"dropped away\" for many over 80 who were \"desperately waiting for their appointment\". \nThe rollout of the new vaccine will be another injection of hope at a time when it's so desperately needed.\nAt least 22,000 doses will be available in Wales this week followed at least another 20,000 next week.\nThe hope is then to ramp up its distribution as supplies arrive, so that around 1.5 million people in Wales at greatest risk of getting really ill from Covid, for example older people or those who have long term health conditions,  can get a jab within the next few months.\nBecause it can be stored for much longer in a normal fridge, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is easier to deliver in places like GP surgeries and care homes than the other Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.\nGetting both vaccines out is now a race against time."

      "text": "US casino giant MGM Resorts has made an $11bn (\u00a38.1bn) offer for British gaming company Entain, which owns Ladbrokes.\nThe move is the latest attempt by a casino operator to move into the online gambling business.\nIn addition to its chain of High Street betting shops, UK-based Entain also owns a number of online sports betting and gambling sites. \nEntain confirmed the offer, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, but said the price was too low.\nIt had recently rebuffed an earlier $10bn (\u00a37.3bn) all-cash approach from MGM, the newspaper said.\nIn a statement, Entain said the latest bid approach \"significantly undervalues the company and its prospects\".\nMGM Resorts, which runs the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas, now has until the beginning of next month to decide whether to make a formal bid or to walk away.\nFTSE 100-listed Entain. which renamed itself from GVC Holdings last month, describes itself as \"one of the world's largest sports betting and gaming groups operating in the online and retail sector\".\nAlong with Ladbrokes, it also owns brands such as Bwin, Partypoker, Coral, Eurobet, Gala and Foxy Bingo.\nAfter news of the latest offer for the firm, investors started betting on Entain, pushing its share price up by more than 25% to \u00a314.30 a share - above MGM's offer of roughly \u00a313.83 a share - a sign that market watchers are expecting a higher bid.\nIf the two firms do reach an agreement, it would follow another deal in September when MGM rival Caesars Entertainment agreed to buy UK-based William Hill for $3.7bn (\u00a32.9bn).\n\"Following Caesar's offer for William Hill last year, a bid by MGM for Ladbroke's owner Entain isn't exactly a surprise,\" said Nicholas Hyett an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\"The two are working together to take advantage of the recent legalisation of sports betting in the US, a market worth many billions of dollars a year.\"\nPredictions about the stockmarket have a habit of making the person trying to guess the future look foolish. No such problem for Laura Foll, a fund manager at the investment firm Janus Henderson. On the Today programme on Monday, she forecast more takeover offers for household names in Britain, noting that the UK markets remained unloved by investors and so - perhaps - undervalued. \nAn hour after the prediction a big offer duly landed, with Entain, the London-listed company that owns Ladbrokes and other gambling brands, saying it had received a takeover proposal from MGM Resorts, an American rival. \nThe US company is offering to pay shareholders in Entain not in cash, but in new MGM shares - an obvious move given the sky-high rating of US shares compared to those listed in London. \nIt looks a carbon copy of last year's deal where Caesars, best known for its Las Vegas properties, bought another venerable name in British bookmaking, William Hill. Get ready for more acquisitive foreign companies looking for deals in bargain basement London.\nThe new bid for Entain comes with financial backing from MGM's largest shareholder, InterActiveCorp (IAC), which took a 12% stake in MGM Resorts last August. \nAt the time, IAC's chief executive Barry Diller said it planned to work with MGM to expand its online gambling portfolio.  \nThe attempted acquisition comes as the casino industry faces headwinds from the Covid-19 pandemic.  \nBricks-and-mortar casino operators have struggled under travel restrictions. \nThe economy of Asian casino hub Macau shrank 49% in the first quarter of this year, while unemployment in Las Vegas reached 30% earlier in the year and remains well above the US average.  \nMGM Resorts, which is the operator of the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas, laid off 18,000 furloughed employees in the US in August. \nMany online gambling companies, by contrast, saw a boost during Covid-19 restrictions, prompting many casino owners to pivot their businesses towards online.

      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 BST.\nThe first patients have been given the Oxford vaccine - five days after it was approved for use in the UK. Dialysis patient Brian Pinker, aged 82, was the first to receive it. It's a \"pivotal moment\" in the fight against the virus, according to Health Secretary Matt Hancock. More than 500,000 doses are ready to go, with care home residents and staff, people aged over 80, and NHS workers at the front of the queue. Some 730 vaccination sites have already been established, we're told, with the total set to surpass 1,000 later this week. The Oxford jab is easier to distribute and store than the Pfizer version, which was the first to be approved. It's also cheaper per dose. Find out more about how it was developed, and when you might receive one. \nThe vaccine news may be positive, but few deny the coronavirus situation in the UK right now is bleak. On Sunday, more than 50,000 new cases were recorded for the sixth day running and Labour is calling for a third national lockdown in England. Boris Johnson has admitted tougher restrictions are likely. Nicola Sturgeon is expected to announce new restrictions for Scotland later, while Northern Ireland and Wales already have their own lockdowns in place. The obvious next step for England would probably be to move more areas into tier four - a reminder of what that means - but our science editor David Shukman says there are other steps under discussion too.\nMany of England's primary schools reopen today, but rows continue about whether they should. Teaching unions say the risk to teachers is too great. In some tier four areas, primaries won't be open to most pupils, and some local authorities elsewhere have said they'll support headteachers if they decide to close. English secondaries will remain closed this week except for vulnerable and key worker children. Schools in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also open later than normal - the exact details are complicated so we've set it all out in full. The TUC is urging firms to furlough parents whose children have to stay at home. If you find yourself homeschooling once again, BBC Bitesize can help.\nJanuary is normally a boom time for gyms, but coronavirus restrictions mean many are closed and others can't offer any group classes. At the same time, there's been an explosion in fitness tech, allowing more of us than ever to work out at home. So what does this mean for the future of the gym sector? Our reporter Eleanor Lawrie looks closely.

      "text": "Edinburgh Zoo's giant pandas may have to return to China next year because of financial pressures. \nYang Guang and Tian Tian cost about \u00a31m a year to lease from China. \nThe zoo, which had hoped to breed the pair, is nearing the end of its 10-year contract with the Chinese government and may be unable to renew the deal. \nCovid lockdown closures led to a \u00a32m loss for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, which runs Edinburgh Zoo and the Highland Wildlife Park.\nDavid Field, chief executive of the society, said the charity would have to \"seriously consider every potential saving\", including its giant panda contract.\nMr Field said closures had had a \"huge financial impact\" on the charity because most of its income was from visitors.\n\"Although our parks are open again, we lost around \u00a32m last year and it seems certain that restrictions, social distancing and limits on our visitor numbers will continue for some time, which will also reduce our income,\" Mr Field said. \n\"Yang Guang and Tian Tian have made a tremendous impression on our visitors over the last nine years, helping millions of people connect to nature and inspiring them to take an interest in wildlife conservation.\n\"I would love for them to be able to stay for a few more years with us and that is certainly my current aim.\" \nThe zoo has already taken a government loan, furloughed staff, made redundancies and launched a fundraising appeal, but was not eligible for the UK government's zoo fund, which was aimed at smaller zoos.\n\"The support we have received from our members and animal lovers has helped to keep our doors open and we are incredibly grateful,\" Mr Field added. \n\"At this stage, it is too soon to say what the outcome will be. We will be discussing next steps with our colleagues in China over the coming months.\"\nThe zoo is part of a number of conservation projects, including one to reintroduce Scottish wildcats.\nHowever, Mr Field said projects like that may also have to be scrapped because of Brexit and being unable to apply for grants from the European Union.\n\"We received a \u00a33.2m grant from the EU Life programme to support our Saving Wildcats partnership project, which aims to restore wildcats in Scotland by breeding and releasing them into the wild.\n\"Wildcats are on the brink of extinction in Britain and this is the last hope for the species' survival.\"\nHe added: \"As we are no longer part of the European Union, our charity is no longer eligible to apply for funding from programmes like EU Life, which have proven critical for our wildlife conservation work and wider efforts to protect animals from extinction.\"\nEdinburgh Zoo's conservation genetics laboratory, which supports conservation projects around the world, has lost access to both funding and other researchers as a result. \nIt also faces challenges around moving animals, many of which are part of European endangered species breeding programmes.\nThe programme is currently about \u00a3900,000 short, meaning it may have to be cancelled.\nMr Field said: \"We still need to reduce costs to secure our future. It may be that some of our incredibly important conservation projects, including the vital lifeline for Scotland's wildcats, may have to be deferred, postponed or even stopped.\""

      "title": "Covid: Boris Johnson set to announce new England lockdown",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson is expected to announce a set of new national restrictions for England, similar to the March lockdown, in a televised address at 20:00 GMT. \nThe PM is likely to urge the public to follow the new rules from midnight.\nIt is expected people will be told to work from home if possible and schools will close for most pupils.\nIt is not yet clear when the measures will be reviewed, but MPs are likely to be given a vote to approve them retrospectively on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, the UK's chief medical officers warned of a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\" in several areas over the next 21 days.\nScotland announced a legal requirement to stay at home from midnight, with schools to be closed.\nMr Johnson will set out plans for England as the UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations. \nBoth Wales and Northern Ireland are already under national restrictions.\nOn Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. \nAs of 08:00 GMT, there were 26,626 Covid-19 patients in hospital in England, according to the latest figures. \nThis is a week-on-week increase of 30%, and a new record high.\nMr Johnson is expected to tell people to work from home unless they are a key worker, or it is not possible for them to do so, for example if they work on a construction site, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. \nIt is also understood that England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has told the prime minister the new variant of coronavirus is now spreading throughout the country. \nThe new variant - first identified in Kent and since seen across the UK and other parts of the world - has been found to spread much more easily than earlier variants.\nA No 10 spokesman said the spread of the new variant had led to \"rapidly escalating case numbers across the country\".\n\"The prime minister is clear that further steps must now be taken to arrest this rise and to protect the NHS and save lives,\" he added. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who called for a national lockdown in England within 24 hours on Sunday - said: \"I hope the prime minister has been listening to the clear calls for tough national restrictions.\"\nHospitals have said they are under \"extreme pressure\" and one of Britain's most senior doctors warned on the weekend that trusts across the UK should prepare themselves for a surge in cases.\nThe number of Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals is currently above the level seen in spring 2020. \nA further 58,784 cases and an additional 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported on Monday, though deaths in Scotland were not recorded.\nWhat worked before may not work again - even a repeat of the March lockdown may not be enough to contain the new variant. \nConsider the R number - the number of people each infected person passes the virus onto on average. \nThe March lockdown brought R down to 0.6 and led to a sharp decline in cases.\nEvery 100 infected people passed the virus onto 60 others, who passed it onto 36, then 21, then 12 and so on.\nBut the new variant is thought to be around 50% more transmissible so its R number, in the same lockdown conditions, would be around 0.9.\nThen 100 infected people would pass the virus onto 90 others, then 81, then 73, then 66 and so on.\nThis is a far slower decline.\nHowever, uncertainty around the new variant means there are scenarios where its levels plateau rather than fall during lockdown conditions. \nIt is going to be a tough start to the year. Even with immediate and tough restrictions there are a projected 20,000 additional deaths in the first months of 2021. \nNow more than ever this is a race between the virus and the vaccine. \nMr Johnson's address comes as UK chief medical officers recommended the Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level.\nIt means the NHS may soon be unable to handle a further sustained rise in cases, the medical officers said in a joint statement.\nNHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, said hospitals were at a \"critical point\" and that \"immediate and decisive action\" is needed.\nPreviously, the government described level five as requiring stricter social distancing measures. The first lockdown, which began in March 2020, was when the UK was under level four.\nThese Covid threat levels are separate to the regional tier system of restrictions in England.\nAnnouncing tougher measures in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: \"It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.\"\nThe new restrictions in Scotland mean it will be a legal requirement to stay at home except for certain essential purposes, similar to the first lockdown last March. Schools will be closed to pupils until February.\nIn Wales, all schools and colleges will move to online learning until at least 18 January.\nNorthern Ireland's Stormont Executive are also meeting to discuss possible new measures in light of Mr Johnson's televised address - which will air on BBC One and the BBC iPlayer from 19:35 GMT.\nThe prime minister will speak amid continued uncertainty over whether schools will remain open to all pupils in England, after several councils requested classrooms stay shut.\nEarlier on Monday, an 82-year-old retired maintenance manager became the first person in the UK to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.\nBrian Pinker said he was \"really proud\" to receive a jab developed in the UK, which will form a large part of the country's mass vaccination plan.\n\"The nurses, doctors and staff today have all been brilliant and I can now really look forward to celebrating my 48th wedding anniversary with my wife Shirley later this year,\" Mr Pinker said."

      "text": "Dialysis patient Brian Pinker, 82, has become the first person to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.\nThe retired maintenance manager got the jab at 7:30 GMT from nurse Sam Foster at Oxford's Churchill Hospital.\nMore than half a million doses of the vaccine are ready for use on Monday.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said it was a \"pivotal moment\" in the UK's fight against the virus, as vaccines will help curb infections and then allow restrictions to be lifted.\nBut Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Monday there was \"no question we will have to take tougher measures\", which will be announced in \"due course\", as the UK struggles to control a new, fast-spreading variant of the virus.\nOn Sunday more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases were recorded in the UK for the sixth day running, prompting Labour to call for a third national lockdown in England.\nNorthern Ireland and Wales currently have their own lockdowns in place and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a fresh lockdown will begin in Scotland from 00:01 on Tuesday.\nThe rollout comes as rows continue over whether pupils should return to school with the current high levels of Covid infections.\nSix hospital trusts - in Oxford, London, Sussex, Lancashire and Warwickshire - have begun administering the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, with 530,000 doses ready for use.\nMost other available doses will be sent to hundreds of GP-led services and care homes across the UK later in the week, according to the Department of Health and Social Care.\nMr Pinker, who has been having dialysis for kidney disease at the Churchill Hospital for a number of years, said he was \"really proud\" the vaccine was developed in Oxford.\n\"The nurses, doctors and staff today have all been brilliant and I can now really look forward to celebrating my 48th wedding anniversary with my wife Shirley later this year,\" he said.\nMusic teacher and father-of-three Trevor Cowlett, 88, and Prof Andrew Pollard, a paediatrician working at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and lead investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, were also among the first to be vaccinated.\nChief nurse Ms Foster, who administered the first dose, told the BBC it was a \"huge privilege\", saying: \"Every single patient that we have vaccinated over the last couple of weeks have got their own personal stories to the difference it's going to make, so it is no different this morning.\"\nSpeaking during a visit to London's Chase Farm Hospital, to meet some of the first people to receive the Oxford vaccine, the prime minister said there were \"tough, tough\" weeks to come.\nThere will now be a \"massive ramp-up\" in vaccination numbers \"in the weeks ahead\", Mr Johnson said, and the number of vaccine doses will amount to \"tens of millions by the end of March\".\nAsked when the government will be able to vaccinate two million people a week, Mr Johnson said the government will give more details \"in the next few days... as soon as we have better numbers to give\".\nMr Hancock told BBC Breakfast the Oxford vaccine rollout was a \"pivotal moment\" in the fight against coronavirus, saying: \"It's going to be a tough few weeks ahead, but this is the way out.\"\nAsked about reports potential volunteers were being deterred by the additional training and forms, Mr Hancock said they were going to \"reduce the amount of bureaucracy\".\n\"For instance there's one of the training programmes about how to tackle terrorism, I don't think that's necessary, we're going to stop that,\" he said.\nHowever, he said this was not delaying the delivery of the vaccine, adding that the next delivery of the vaccine will be \"early this week\" to be \"deployed next week\".\nEngland's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said the vaccines \"give us a route out in the medium term\" but warned the NHS was \"under considerable and rising pressure in the short term\".\nFormer health secretary and Conservative chairman of the Commons' health committee Jeremy Hunt tweeted that it was \"time to act\" and the government needed to close schools and borders, ban all household mixing and impose a 12-week national lockdown in England.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth agreed that a national lockdown was needed, as well as \"rapidly scaled-up vaccine distribution\".\nAs the recent rise in Covid cases puts increased pressure on the NHS, the UK has accelerated its vaccination rollout by planning to give both doses of the vaccine 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between jabs.\nThe UK's chief medical officers have defended the delay to second doses, saying getting more people vaccinated with the first jab \"is much more preferable\".\nMake no mistake, the UK is in a race against time.\nThat much is clear from the decision to delay the second dose of the vaccine to focus on giving as many people as possible their first doses.\nSo how fast can the NHS go? Ultimately it wants to get to two million doses a week.\nThat will not be achieved this week.\nBut Monday marks the start of the NHS putting the accelerator to the floor.\nA rapid increase in the vaccination rate should follow.\nBut how quickly the UK can go is dependent on several complex processes.\nFirst, the vaccine has to be manufactured, then it has to be put into vials and packaged up (known as fill and finish). After that each batch has to be checked and certified before being sent to NHS vaccination sites where there needs to be enough vaccinators and support staff to ensure those doses are given as quickly as possible.\nProblems at any one stage can disrupt how quickly the vaccination programme can be rolled out.\nWhile there are millions of doses of each vaccine in the country and a total of 140 million of both vaccines pre-ordered, there are currently just over one million - around 500,000 of each - ready to be given this week.\nNHS medical director Professor Stephen Powis said: \"The NHS' biggest vaccination programme in history is off to a strong start, thanks to the tremendous efforts of NHS staff who have already delivered more than one million jabs.\"\nHe said the Oxford vaccine rollout was \"chalking up another world first that will protect thousands more over the coming weeks\".\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first jab approved in the UK, and more than a million people have had their first one.\nThe first person to get the jab on 8 December, Margaret Keenan, has already had her second dose.\nThe Oxford jab - which was approved for use in late December - can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, making it easier to distribute and store than the Pfizer jab. It is also cheaper per dose.\nThe UK has secured 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, enough for most of the population.\nCare home residents and staff, people aged over 80, and frontline NHS staff will be first to receive it.\nGPs and local vaccination services have been asked to ensure every care home resident in their local area is vaccinated by the end of January, the Department of Health and Social Care said.\nSome 730 vaccination sites have already been established across the UK, with the total set to surpass 1,000 later this week, the department added."

In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough.\nSome employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends.\nInternational travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs.\nMany forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. \nIf you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. \nThe selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay.\nIf you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: \nYou might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. \nThe amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. \nYou may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs. \nThere is lots of free benefits guidance and advice available, including: \nThe government says 11.6 million jobs have been supported by the scheme.\nFrom March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about \u00a366bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. \nThat's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid.\nHowever, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. \nAt the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed.\nInstead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20.

However, unions are telling primary school staff it is unsafe to return to work and are calling for remote learning to be introduced across all primaries.\nA growing number of councils in England are calling on the government to delay the reopening of primary schools, with local authorities in Wolverhampton, Cumbria and Kent asking for a delay to the start of term on Monday.\nBrighton and Hove Council has advised primary schools to stay closed meaning Gemma Cocker's five-year-old son Charlie will not be going to school while her daughter Lyla, who is four, may still be able to go to nursery.\nGemma and her husband have been working from home since March, but now they will once again have to add childcare to the mix.\n\"We'll try to home-school him,\" she said of Charlie. \"He regressed a little bit last time, he's young in the year.\"\nMrs Cocker, 36, added: \"The whole thing is ridiculous, can a decision just be made? At a time when many parents are returning to work next week, to have this uncertainty is adding to already stressed out families. \n\"Morally, I think they should close, but practically, no. It's a hard one.\"\nRead more here.\nMr Johnson said that while school closures would be kept \"under constant review\", the government would be \"driven by public health considerations and by the massive importance of education\".\n\"And if you think about the history of the pandemic, we've kept schools going for a long, long time in areas where the pandemic has really been at really high levels,\" he said.\nSir Keir said tighter measures needed to be introduced nationally in the next 24 hours and criticised the PM for \"hinting\" at further restrictions coming into force.\nThe Labour leader said he did not want to \"add to the chaos\" that would be caused by schools closing on Monday, but said it was \"inevitable\" more would have to shut. \n\"The government needs to plan for children's learning but also for working parents,\" Sir Keir added.\nOn Friday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced that all of London's primaries would remain shut to most pupils, after pressure from local councils to reverse an earlier decision to keep only schools in certain boroughs closed. \nMr Johnson said his message to councils and schools was to be \"guided by the public health advice\" which at the moment is \"that schools are safe in those areas where we're not being driven by the new variant to close them\".\nBut he said \"we've got to be humble in the face of the impact of this new variant of the virus\" and warned there would be \"a very difficult few weeks and months\" until the vaccine comes into effect.\nKeeping schools open for all pupils has been one of the red lines ever since the first national lockdown.\nAll the evidence so far suggests primary school children have one of the lowest levels of infection when it comes to symptomatic cases. \nIf you include asymptomatic infection the picture changes, but the evidence suggests such cases are less likely to lead to onward spread.\nAnd, of course, the risk of serious illness in this group is pretty rare. \nThe rise of the new variant has increased cases generally, although Public Health England says there is still no evidence yet that this new variant transmits more in children than other variants.\nThere is understandable concern about teachers. Research by the Office for National Statistics suggests they have been at no greater risk of infection than other professions working outside the home.\nThe new variant could, of course, change this, which is why the unions are concerned.\nThe prime minister admitted the tier system in England may need to get tougher and \"clearly school closures which we had to do in March is one of those things\" but added it was \"not necessarily something we want to do\".\nAsked whether exams should be cancelled, Mr Johnson did not answer directly but said \"we've got to be realistic\" about the pace at which the new variant was spreading and its impact on the NHS.\nThe National Education Union has advised its members it is not safe to work in primary schools and said all schools should remain closed for a further two weeks, while other major teaching unions have called for a period of remote learning while safety measures are put in place. \nIn Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has asked for the Scottish Parliament to be recalled so she can make an \"urgent statement\", with her deputy John Swinney tweeting that ministers would meet \"to consider the current advice in relation to schools and early learning\". \nHead teachers in Wales as well as England have begun legal action to force ministers to reveal data behind the decision for some schools to reopen - which the Department for Education said is based on new infections and pressure on the NHS in local areas.\nAnne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, called for teachers to be vaccinated \"as a priority\", as she said that any school closure should be for \"the absolute minimum of time and that time must be used very well\".\nWriting in the Sunday Telegraph, Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said \"children's lives can't just be put on hold\", echoing the point that school closures should be kept to an \"absolute minimum\".\nGreater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said the government's \"top-down\" and \"blanket\" approach to schools reopening should be changed to allow head teachers to make decisions based on local public health advice.\nMost primary schools in England will return on 4 January, but in London and some surrounding areas they will not open for most pupils until 18 January. Secondary schools in England will stagger their return with pupils taking exams in 2021 starting on 11 January, and other year groups returning in person on 18 January.  \nIn Wales, local councils have been told they can be \"flexible\" with when they open - with many schools aiming to return for face-to-face lessons from 11 January. \nIn Northern Ireland, primary school pupils will be taught online until 11 January. In secondary schools, years 8 to 11 will be taught online throughout January. Years 12 to 14 will return to school after the first week of January. \nIn Scotland, the Christmas holidays have been extended to 11 January, and the following week will be online learning only. A full return to face-to-face learning is planned for 18 January but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned measures may have to go further with a cabinet meeting to be held on Monday.\nRead more here.\nAre you a parent of schoolchildren?

      "text": "There are three main symptoms of coronavirus. \nIf you have any of them, you should get a test.\nPublic Health England says about 85% of people with Covid will have at least one of these symptoms.\nPeople infected with new variants such as Delta may be more likely to have other symptoms, such as headache, sore throat or a runny nose, according to research from the Zoe Covid Study and an ONS survey.\nIf you have any symptoms you should get tested as soon as possible and not leave home for any other reason. \nIt takes five days on average from the moment you're infected for symptoms to show.\nNo - it can affect multiple organs and has several less common symptoms.\nScientists using data on the health of four million people say Covid has six sub-types:\nResearchers think that vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps could be a sign of coronavirus in children.\nSome people who catch Covid develop chilblain-like lesions on their toes or fingers.\nIt can happen to anyone, but is more common in children and teenagers. \nFor some it's painless, but the rash can be very sore and itchy.\nIt appears to be a side effect of the body switching into attack mode to fight off the virus.\nWriting in the British Journal of Dermatology, researchers say they've pinpointed which parts of the immune system are responsible, which should lead to better treatments. \nLots of other viruses have similar symptoms to Covid, including flu. \nPublic Health England says just under half of people who have one of the three main Covid symptoms will not have it.\nIf you have a positive test result you should self-isolate at home for at least 10 days from the time symptoms started.\nMost people will only have mild symptoms, which can be managed with pain relief (like paracetamol), bed rest and fluids.\nYou should not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.\nSince 16 August, people who are double jabbed (or aged under 18) don't have to self-isolate if they're identified as a close contact of a person who tests positive.\nGetting vaccinated is the best way to prevent serious illness, hospitalisation or death from Covid. \nIf you are seriously unwell and you have a medical emergency you should call 999 - this includes feeling so breathless that you can't speak more than a few words.\nIf you're worried your symptoms are getting worse, use the NHS 111 website England, NHS Inform in Scotland or the equivalents in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe main reason people need hospital care is for difficulty breathing where they may be given oxygen.\nThe most seriously ill patients may require ventilation - where patients are sedated and air is pushed into their lungs.\nOlder people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Welsh government,Wales education,Children's Commissioner for Wales,NASUWT,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Closing schools will be a \"last resort\" that depends on scientific evidence, Wales' health minister has said.\nSome schools are due to welcome pupils back this week as the Welsh Government comes under fire from teachers' unions.\nHealth minister Vaughan Gething said: \"If the evidence changes then we'll have to take account of that... and that may lead to a different choice.\"\nEvidence is expected shortly on the new Covid-19 variant, but local authorities have control over schools re-opening.\nUnder a \"flexible\" agreement with the Welsh Government some schools are due to open on Wednesday, local authorities said.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has defended this flexibility that leaves the decision with local authorities on when to allow children back to school.\nBut, unions have threatened legal action because of concerns about the new variant.\nAt Monday's coronavirus press briefing, Mr Gething said schools will continue with the phased return to face-to-face learning over the first two weeks of the new term unless the \"evidence changes\".\n\"The plan is for schools to open in a flexible way\u2026 we made a choice before the Christmas break to have this flexible approach to opening, so we can learn and try to understand more of what is happening,\" he said. \n\"Now, if we get evidence and advice today, then that is advice we may well need to act upon today or tomorrow.\"\nHe stressed that decisions on schools \"are always underpinned by evidence\".\nClosing primary schools \"has a real impact on people being able to go to work\" and online learning is \"practically more difficult\" for younger pupils, he added.\nSchools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers while other pupils are taught online until face-to-face teaching resumes.\nThe Trades' Union Congress - the UK's umbrella union body - has called for parents who are juggling their work lives with childcare should be put on furlough as long as schools are closed.\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said there had to be as much \"advance warning as possible\" on any plans to change the return to school. \n\"I feel for students and I feel for teachers and here we are on the first day of term with a lack of assurance of what's coming down the line,\" he said.  \nThe Ynys Mon MS said the Welsh Government should make a statement on \"what the impact is\" of the new variant on schools so that schools can plan.\n\"It cannot be an end to education - it must be a move to full online education\", he added.  \nWith Covid-19 cases rising in early December, Education Minister Kirsty Williams announced all secondary schools and further education colleges in Wales would move to online learning as part of a \"national effort to reduce transmission of coronavirus\".\nThe move was criticised by children's commissioner for Wales Sally Holland, who said it was disruptive to education.\nBut many parents had already started withdrawing their children from school early due to fears of having to self-isolate over Christmas.\nA week later, the Welsh Local Government Association said children would return to school on a staggered basis after the Christmas break, with a full return expected by 18 January.\nThis sparked outrage from teachers' unions, who said schools would \"yet again\" have to \"pick up the pieces of a last-minute announcement\".\nAmelie Boyce, a sixth form student at Neath College, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast she had been enjoying online learning and felt \"a bit more worried I think for going back to college than I was maybe last term because obviously the virus is a lot more dangerous now\".\nBut she added it was more difficult working in her bedroom at home as \"that's the place where I relax most of the time, so it's not really a working environment\".\nTim Newbould, head teacher at Penycae Community Primary School in Wrexham, said he had mixed feelings about the return to school, but welcomed the flexibility given by the Welsh Government.\n\"We don't know yet the impact of Christmas Day,\" he said.\nHe added six of his staff had been off following positive Covid tests and \"a number of us have been quite poorly, so we're well aware of the risks.\"\nMr Newbould said absence from school had an obvious impact on pupils' academic progress, but there was also the effect on socialising with peers, \"which is really important and has an impact on pupils' mental health and wellbeing\".\nBut he stresses \"safety is the key issue\", particularly in light of the new variant of the virus, and that teachers and school staff should receive the vaccine early on.\n\"We simply don't know whether our risk assessments are adequate for the new variant of the virus,\" he said.\n\"We're right in front of a large number of pupils at the same time, breathing the same air.\"\nCeri Reed, from the group Parents Voices in Wales, said many members are worried about the danger of the new variant of the virus. \n\"I have to admit, we are divided in our group. We represent over 720 parents and carers in Wales, and I think the main concern from those parents who are not considering sending their children into school is because of the new strain,\" she said.\n\"We are encouraging parents to look at the science, and we need to applaud what the teachers have done from September onwards with things like track and trace. \n\"They have been absolutely phenomenal and we believe we can do it again.\"\nOn 19 December, Mr Drakeford scrapped plans for a five-day relaxation of lockdown rules over Christmas amid concerns about the spread of a more virulent variant of coronavirus.\nCouncils pressed on with the plans for a staggered reopening of schools, with the majority of local authorities intending to reopen secondary schools next Monday.\nSchools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers from this week, and all pupils are expected to take part in remote learning before their schools reopen for face-to-face teaching.\nOn Saturday, the NASUWT teachers' union threatened \"appropriate action\" to protect teachers, and the head teachers' union NAHT Cymru said it had taken legal action against the Welsh Government to obtain scientific evidence on the risks of the new variant it said it was \"withholding\".\nThe National Education Union Cymru had already called for in-person learning to be delayed until at least 18 January.\nThe unions say more time is needed to assess the risks posed by the new variant and have accused the Welsh Government of \"passing the buck\" to local authorities.\nOn Sunday, a joint statement from nine unions called for a national decision on reopening schools rather than leaving it to local councils.\nIn response, Mr Drakeford said there was \"no evidence that young people get the illness more severely as a result of the variant\", adding that the Welsh Government's technical advisory group \"will be looking at all the evidence again early next week\".\nHowever Dilwyn Roberts-Young, general secretary of Undeb Cenedlaethol Athrawon Cymru (UCAC), told BBC Wales Breakfast the evidence around transmission rates in schools did not instil confidence. \n\"We have listened to the first minister's comments about young people getting the illness more severely,\" he said. \n\"Schools aren't in a vacuum - there are adults in the school, there are older pupils, and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Wales Dr Chris Jones, said just before Christmas that high numbers of incidents continue to be reported, mainly in residential care homes and school settings.\n\"Looking at the evidence again... it does not give confidence to parents, to staff or to pupils, and if you look at last March, when the education minister talked about the five guiding principles to determine when schools should return to providing education, there was an emphasis on evidence and information, to ensure that any decisions taken are the correct ones.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Tax,HM Revenue & Customs,Brexit",
      "text": "Some EU specialist online retailers have said they will no longer deliver to the UK because of tax changes which came into force on 1 January.\nBicycle part firm Dutch Bike Bits said from now on, it would ship to every country in the world except the UK.\n\"We are forced by British policy to stop dealing with British customers,\" it said on its website.\nAnother firm, Belgium-based Beer On Web, said it was now shunning the UK \"due to the new Brexit measures\".\nThe companies are angry because they now face higher costs and increased bureaucracy in order to comply with UK tax authorities. \nHowever, it is unclear how many have taken the drastic step of refusing all UK orders.\nAt the same time, international shipping companies including Federal Express and TNT have said they are levying additional charges on shipments between the UK and the EU.\nThey said this reflected the increased investment they had had to make in adjusting their systems to cope with Brexit.\nThe moves follow changes in VAT rules brought in by HM Revenue and Customs on 1 January.\nVAT is now being collected at the point of sale rather than at the point of importation.\nThis essentially means that overseas retailers sending goods to the UK are expected to register for UK VAT and account for it to HMRC if the sale value is less than \u20ac150 (\u00a3135).\nA government spokesperson said: \"The new VAT model ensures goods from EU and non-EU countries are treated in the same way and that UK businesses are not disadvantaged by competition from VAT-free imports. \n\"The new system also addresses the problem of overseas sellers failing to pay the right amount of VAT on sales of goods already in the UK at the point of sale, raising an anticipated \u00a3300m every year.\n\"Many EU businesses which currently sell goods to UK customers will have already registered for UK VAT under existing rules and HMRC is working very closely with those who haven't to ensure they can comply with the changes.\"\nAdam French, Which? consumer rights expert, said consumers would be \"frustrated\" if the new VAT rules were applied in a way that causes significant inconvenience.\n\"It's vital the government makes it clear to consumers as well as traders what the changes as a result of Brexit mean for them and how they shop. It should also work to ensure UK consumers can retain access to a wide range of competitively priced and quality goods.\"\nCampaigner Richard Allen, founder of Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, told the BBC that the massive increase in international online shopping had led to VAT evasion on a huge scale.\nHe said the new HMRC rules were aimed at tackling that, but it was unclear how firms who failed to register for UK VAT would be dealt with.\n\"Why should a phonograph spares manufacturer in Idaho bother to register for VAT in the UK and how are you going to make them do it?\" he said. \"And if they send the package anyway, what are you going to do?\"\n\"For providing this service, [HMRC] intend to charge a fee to every company in the world in every country in the world which exports to the UK,\" said Dutch Bike Bits on its website. \n\"Clearly this is ludicrous for one country, but imagine if every country in the world had the same idea. \n\"If every country decided to behave in the same way, then we would have to pay 195 fees every year, keep up with the changes in taxation law for 195 different countries, keep accounts on behalf of 195 different countries and submit payments to 195 tax offices in 195 different countries, and jump through whatever hoops were required to prove that we were doing all of this honestly and without any error.\"\nDutch Bike Bits said it had many customers within the UK and would like to be able to trade with them. \n\"Not being able to send parcels to the UK does not work in any way in our favour and it is not what we wanted,\" the firm added.\n\"If you're angry about this, and you may well be so, please contact your elected representative in the UK.\"\nOther firms held out the hope that their ban on exports to the UK might prove to be temporary.\nScandinavian Outdoor, which is based in Finland and sells outdoor clothing and equipment, posted a message on its homepage saying: \"No delivery to UK just now.\"\nIn a further message explaining its decision, it said: \"Due to Brexit, we have temporarily closed our store from UK-based customers. Ordering will be possible as soon as our UK VAT registration and the overall process of selling to the UK post-Brexit has been sorted out.\"\nMeanwhile, mail and freight company TNT has said it is now imposing a surcharge of \u00a34.31 on all shipments between the UK and the EU.\nTNT is now owned by Federal Express, which has also \"updated\" its charges, a spokesperson for the two companies said.\n\"FedEx/TNT has been making incremental investments to adjust our systems, processes, resourcing and customer-facing solutions to ensure readiness for the change on 1 January 2021,\" the spokesperson added.\n\"To reflect these investments and the incremental cost of customs clearance, we are increasing transportation rates for shipments from UK to EU, and EU to UK.\"\nRivals DHL and UPS have also taken similar measures."

      "text": "All schools and colleges will move to online learning until 18 January in Wales.\nSome schools had been due to open on Wednesday and others by 11 January with decisions made by local authorities.\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams said the decision had been taken jointly with the Welsh Local Government Association and Colegau Cymru.\nTeaching unions had called for a delayed start to term amid concerns about the coronavirus variant.\nHowever, the timing of the decision has been criticised, with some claiming it left little time for parents and schools to make plans.\nMs Williams said: \"As a government we will use the next two weeks to continue to work with local authorities, schools and colleges to best plan for the rest of term.\n\"This is the best way to ensure that parents, staff and learners can be confident in the return to face to face learning, based on the latest evidence and information.\"\nThe announcement comes as the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre increased the Covid threat level to five - its highest level.\nLevel five warns of a \"material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed\", according to the UK government's website.\nWales has been under \"stay-at-home\" lockdown restrictions since 20 December after a rise in Covid-19 cases, with more than 31,000 cases in the two weeks over the Christmas period.\nA \"flexible\" agreement on reopening schools had been put in place before Christmas with the decision in the hands of local authorities.\nHowever, that decision has changed following the latest announcement.\nChildren's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said: \"It continues to be a difficult situation for children and young people.\n\"Children certainly would rather be in school, and are concerned about uncertainty, but it is clear we are living in difficult times,\" she said.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford tweeted to say moving classes online was the \"best way to help reduce the spread of this deadly virus\".\nEithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, said the decision made sense but the plan to resume face-to-face education after 18 January should be kept under review and \"not set in stone\".\nLaura Doel, director of the head teachers' union, NAHT Cymru, said the decision brought \"much-needed clarity\". \n\"The Welsh Government has repeatedly said it wants to prioritise education, in that case it must also prioritise safety in schools and the communities schools serve,\" she said.\n\"Work should be undertaken with school leaders and Public Health Wales to establish and agree new Covid-related safety measures in schools during the temporary restriction for implementation in good time prior to lifting restrictions.\"\nClaire Jones, deputy head teacher at Crickhowell High School, Powys, said she was \"really optimistic that blended learning is a way forward\" although \"it's not the ideal\".\nConservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: \"With many children having been due to begin a staggered return to school from Wednesday onwards, this news has come late for them and for their parents.\"\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said the decision had left \"little or no time for parents and teachers to adapt to the changing circumstances\".\n\"It is unclear what the Welsh Government expects will change in just two weeks' time and so we risk being in the same position yet again with yet more confusion in a fortnight,\" she said.\nWales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas, and nine of the UK's ten most infected counties.\nIt went into a level four national lockdown on 20 December.\nHowever, the latest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK.\nThis delay until 18 January is something the unions had been calling for but to decide on the Monday before some schools are about to go back on the Wednesday is quite late in the day.\nAnd that's something the opposition parties have picked up on.\nWith all the uncertainty that we are facing over how this new variant will play out and the condition, and the pressure that's on the NHS, I wouldn't put any money necessarily on face-to-face learning resuming on the 18th.\nI'm told that is something that will be kept very much under review.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced a set of new national restrictions for England, as head teachers over the border warned of a \"confusing picture\" with thousands of pupils unable to start primary school as expected.\nSchools and colleges will be closed until the end of February half term and pupils will be taught online.\nScotland has announced a legal requirement to stay at home from midnight, with schools to be closed.\nMost pupils in Northern Ireland were not expected to return to school this week as had been planned.\nEarlier on Monday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said closing schools in Wales would be a \"last resort\"."
