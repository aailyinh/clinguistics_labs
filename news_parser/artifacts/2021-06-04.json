      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Coronavirus cases have roughly doubled in the space of a week, though numbers remain low compared with earlier in the pandemic. So how significant is this, as the government considers lifting the last set of restrictions in England on 21 June?\nIt's difficult to judge what direction the virus is going in from just a few days of data - cases fluctuate and can be skewed by how many tests are being done. But, for the past fortnight at least, there have been growing signs national cases are beginning to rise.\nAnd this relatively small uptick disguises much larger spikes in cases - and some rises in hospital admissions - in certain areas. These include the north-west of England and also large parts of Scotland, although in some of these areas cases are starting to fall again. \nAs we know from experience, what might look like a small blip can quickly spiral into a big wave if enough people are still susceptible to the virus. \nThe virus doesn't have nearly the same opportunity to take off as it did at the start of the winter wave. \nHalf of all adults in the UK are fully vaccinated and three-quarters have received their first jab and this is rising all the time. But that still leaves millions of people who are vulnerable to catching, spreading and becoming ill from the virus. \nThe more people who are fully vaccinated, the less chance of the virus spreading and the epidemic taking off again.  \nThere have been two major waves of infection during the UK's epidemic - in spring 2020 and in the past winter. Although there was the beginning of a resurgence in cases in the autumn, it was contained by a national lockdown in November - resulting in a \"bump\" in cases rather than a fully-fledged wave. \nWhat we're seeing now is far from a full-blown wave like the first two. However, the higher cases get, the faster they rise. \nRecent data suggests cases might now be doubling every fortnight or possibly even faster.\nThat's faster than when the government's scientific advisers recommended a lockdown in September (although the true number of infections then was partially disguised by shortages in appointments for testing, meaning infections weren't being diagnosed).\nBut at that point hospital admissions were doubling every fortnight, whereas now they have only just started to tick up nationwide.   \nThis suggests even if cases rise, vaccines are stopping many infections progressing to serious illness. \nOn Monday 7 June, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that of 12,383 cases of the so-called Indian or Delta variant, 126 ended up in hospital - and just three of them involved people who had been fully vaccinated. \nExperts have expressed concern that hospital admissions are rising again in areas affected by the so-called Indian variant.\nThe question is whether this rise will continue or level off, and whether it will spill out into other parts of the country where admissions are currently falling. \nIn some hotspots like Bolton and Bedford, cases already appear to be coming back down. Given it takes time for a case to turn into a hospital admission, we might expect to see those numbers start falling in these areas too.  \nBut at the moment, we're in a \"wait-and-see\" phase. Cases have only just started to rise across the UK, so it will take some time before we know how much that leads to a rise in hospital admissions - and if they are concentrated in the unvaccinated population. \nPublic health leaders in areas like Bolton have said many of their hospital patients were not yet, or had only just become, eligible for the vaccine. \nThis has led some scientists to call for the 21 June date to be pushed back to allow more people to be fully vaccinated, before allowing unrestricted mixing at weddings and clubs, and inside people's homes. \nProf Ravi Gupta, at the University of Cambridge, has said the UK is already in the early stages of a third wave of infections, and called for the 21 June ending of restrictions in England to be postponed.\nHis fears have been echoed by Prof Andrew Hayward, a government scientific adviser, and Prof Christina Pagel, at University College London, who sits on a group which calls itself Independent Sage \nBut government adviser Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, said he was \"encouraged\" by the numbers, before adding another week's data was needed before decisions could be made. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson and Mr Hancock have indicated they will wait for more data before making the decision.\nThe government is due to announce its decision on England's 21 June easing a week before, on 14 June, so next week's figures will be crucial.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Vaccinating children is routine and widely accepted - measles, mumps, polio, diphtheria, rotavirus, multiple strains of meningitis, whooping cough\u2026 the list goes on. All this starts from just a few weeks old. \nSo, what about Covid-19?\nSome countries are cracking on. The US is immunising children between 12 and 15. It expects to have enough safety data to go even younger next year. \nBut in the UK - the BBC has been told - a decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-olds is unlikely to be recommended by UK experts any time soon.\nThere is a scientific question - will vaccinating children save lives? - which is complex as the answer may vary from country to country. \nThere is also a moral and ethical dimension if doses destined for children would save more lives if they were given to health workers and vulnerable adults in other countries. \nOne argument for not vaccinating children against Covid is they get relatively little benefit from it. \n\"Fortunately one of the few good things about this pandemic is children are very rarely seriously affected by this infection,\" said Prof Adam Finn, who sits on the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nInfections in children are nearly always mild or asymptomatic, which is in sharp contrast to older age groups who have been prioritised by vaccination campaigns. \nA study across seven countries, published in the Lancet, estimated that fewer than two out of every million children died with Covid during the pandemic. \nEven children with medical conditions that would raise the dangers of a Covid infection in adults are not being vaccinated in the UK at the moment. Only those at \"very high risk of exposure and serious outcomes\" - which could include older children with severe disabilities in residential care - are recommended to be vaccinated. \nThe vaccines are incredibly safe, but the risk and the benefit still have to be carefully weighed. \nThere is another potential benefit to vaccinating children - it could save other people's lives. \nThis is an approach that is already used for flu. British children aged from two to around 12 are given the nasal spray, largely to protect their grandparents, each year. \nOne argument is doing the same with Covid vaccines could help contribute to herd immunity - the point at which the virus struggles to spread because so many people are protected. \nThe Covid vaccines look very good at disrupting the spread of the virus. Just one dose appears to cut the chance of catching the virus by at least half and even those that do still get it are half as likely to pass it on. \nChildren do not appear to be major spreaders of coronavirus, but older teenagers may still play a role.\n\"There's certainly evidence of potential for transmission in secondary school ages, so vaccinating could have an impact on overall transmission,\" said Dr Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nBut there is not a universal answer on whether it is worthwhile. \nThe UK's vaccination programme is hurtling ahead and there have been large outbreaks that have left a legacy of immunity which could also play a role.\nAbout a third of 16 and 17-year-olds in England have coronavirus antibodies in their blood despite barely any of them being vaccinated.\nSo the UK and similar countries could find they have enough immunity to stop the virus spreading without vaccinating children.\n\"It's a very different situation to countries without many outbreaks and who don't get as high coverage in adults, then it's very difficult without vaccinating young groups as well,\" said Dr Kucharski.\nAustralia is one country struggling with vaccine hesitancy and, alongside places like New Zealand and Taiwan, contained the virus so well there is barely any immunity from infection. \nOne thing to bear in mind is who doesn't get a vaccine if a child is given one instead.\nThe World Health Organization says wealthy countries should postpone their plans to immunise children and donate them to the rest of the world. Prof Andrew Pollard, who ran clinical trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, said it was \"morally wrong\" to prioritise children.\nProf Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"There is a case for it and if there was unlimited supply of vaccine we could keep going with the over-12s, but there isn't.\n\"Eventually it's a political decision whether to prioritise our kids over adults dying in their droves elsewhere in the world.\" \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPortugal has questioned the UK's decision to remove it from the green list for overseas travel from next Tuesday, saying it doesn't understand the logic behind changing its status to amber. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says rising cases and a Covid mutation found in Portugal are behind the move, which means UK tourists should not visit and returnees must isolate for 10 days. But the travel industry isn't happy and readers have voiced their frustration at being forced to cancel holidays, write off spending and postpone family visits.\nCabinet Office minister Michael Gove had to abandon a meeting with the prime minister and leaders of the devolved nations on Thursday after being pinged by the NHS Covid app, it's emerged. Mr Gove was notified that he may have come into contact with someone who had coronavirus during a trip to Portugal to watch Chelsea play Manchester City in the Champions League final.\nDemand for staff rose at its fastest rate for 23 years in May, as Covid restrictions eased, according to a monthly survey of recruiters. But with the number of staff available declining at the fastest rate for four years, according to accounting firm KPMG, many companies are struggling to fill vacancies. Hospitality, in particular, has seen a shortage of waiters and chefs since the sector reopened.\nUp to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors in Wales, where extended households can expand to include a third from Monday. However, the Welsh government says an increase in the numbers able to meet indoors in homes or at events will not happen until late June at the earliest to allow more people to get vaccinated.\nAnyone who was unable to visit a loved-one in a care home during the height of the pandemic will understand how emotional the easing of restrictions can be. Watch how residents of one nursing home in the US celebrated being able to resume contact with the outside world.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nCheck where you stand with any holiday plans, in light of the changes to the traffic light lists for overseas travel.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "title": "Travel sector dismay as Portugal faces tougher rules",
      "tags": "Tourism,Companies,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The travel and tourism industry has hit back after the announcement of tighter rules on foreign holidays.\nNo more countries will be added to the green list and Portugal will be relegated to amber from next Tuesday.\nThe government said Portugal had seen a doubling of infection rates since the previous travel review.\nCritics warned of a loss of jobs and confidence, while Easyjet said the government had torn up its own rules.\nMoving Portugal from the green to the amber list was a \"safety first approach\" to \"give us the best chance of unlocking domestically\", said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.\nLabour said moving Portugal from green to amber on the UK's foreign travel system was \"not the answer\" and called for the amber list to be scrapped altogether.\nLabour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds accused the government of causing \"chaos with the mishandling of travel restrictions at the border\".\nIn addition to not adding countries to the green list and relegating Portugal to amber, seven more countries have been added to the red list. \nAll the changes will take effect on Tuesday at 04:00.\nIn England's traffic light scheme, countries are classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have similar rules.\nThe government says you should not holiday in red or amber destinations - which means most countries. Holidays to countries on the green list can go ahead without quarantining when you return.\nThere had been some speculation that Greek and Spanish islands could be added to the green list as well as Malta, Finland and parts of the Caribbean - but the government insisted it had to remain cautious.\nThe UK government announced that Portugal would be on the travel green list on 7 May.\nIts low point for new cases (on a seven-day average) was 10 May and the number has been rising gradually since then.\nOn 2 June, there were 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a touch higher than the UK at 5.1, although differences in the amount of testing being done make that comparison difficult. It is considerably higher than Israel, for example, which is still on the green list and had 0.2 new cases per 100,000 that day. \nThe decision about which countries go on the green list is not just about the number of new cases, but a number of other criteria, such as the amount of testing capacity. That has not changed dramatically in the past month.\nPresence of variants of concern (VOCs) is also important. The latest report from the World Health Organization says all four VOCs have now been found in Portugal. A month ago, the variant first identified in India was not yet a VOC. The transport secretary says a new mutation of that variant has now been found in Portugal. \nBritish Airways said this was \"incredibly disappointing and confusing news, not just for aviation but also for our customers\".\n\"The UK has reached a critical point and urgently needs travel with low-risk countries, like the US, to re-start the economy, support devastated industries and reunite loved ones,\" a spokesperson said.  \nJohan Lundgren, Easyjet's chief executive, said that with \"Portuguese rates similar to those in the UK\", relegating the country \"simply isn't justified by the science\".\n\"When this framework was put together, consumers were promised a waiting list to allow them to plan.\n\"Yet the government has torn up its own rule book and ignored the science, throwing people's plans into chaos, with virtually no notice or alternative options for travel from the UK. \n\"This decision essentially cuts the UK off from the rest of the world,\" he said.\nJet2 said it would delay restarting flights from 23 June to 1 July.\n\"We know how disappointed our customers and independent travel agency partners will be following today's announcement, and we share their concerns and frustrations,\" said Steve Heapy, Jet2 chief executive.\nCharlie Cornish, Manchester Airports Group chief executive, said: \"We were told the traffic light system would allow people to travel safely, with the right measures in place to manage risk for different countries.\n\"But it is now clear the government doesn't trust its own system and that international travel is being unfairly scapegoated, with tens of thousands of jobs placed at risk in the process.\nJohn Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow Airport, said: \"Ministers spent last month hailing the restart of international travel, only to close it down three weeks later, all but guaranteeing another lost summer for the travel sector. \n\"Everyone wants to protect public health, but the entire point of the Global Travel Taskforce was to establish a system to unlock low-risk travel safely. \n\"Britain is the worst performing economy in the G7, and in the week that the prime minister hosts G7 leaders to launch his government's vision of Global Britain, he's sending a message that the UK will remain isolated from the rest of the world and closed to most of its G7 partners.\" \nVirginia Messina, vice-president of the World Travel & Tourism Council, called the moves a \"huge disappointment for businesses and holidaymakers\", a point underlined by falls in the share prices of several airlines.\nShe said: \"The government has once again cold-shouldered travel and tourism by refusing to add any new destinations to the already slim green list. \n\"The UK could and should leverage its hard-won competitive advantage from one of the world's best vaccine rollout programmes, to restore mobility and reopen the doors to safe international travel.\"\nPaul Charles, chief executive of the PC Agency and spokesman for parts of the travel sector, said tighter restrictions \"will further threaten tens of thousands of jobs in aviation and travel, not to mention further damage consumer confidence\". \nHe said that data showed several countries should be green-listed, so the government's decision \"defies logic\" and was being driven by \"a policy of fear\".\nJohn Foster, the CBI's director of policy, said businesses across the country were \"losing out on key links with trading partners just as the rest of the world is opening up\". \n\"The international travel sector is on its knees and unable to trade its way to recovery. Without a successful summer season, the government will need to consider further sector specific support to save jobs and skills essential for future growth,\" he added.\nThe Caribbean island of Grenada was hoping to be put on green, and tourism minister Clarice Modeste Curwen said she was \"extremely disappointed\" not to be added.\nShe said: \"Grenada has had just 161 cases of Covid-19 since the onset of the pandemic and we have reported zero new cases locally since February.\n\"We strongly believe that Grenada should be added to the UK's green list as we have taken all the necessary measures to ensure the islands are safe and ready for visitors.\"\nShares in airlines and travel companies fell after the BBC reported that Portugal is set to move from green to amber.\nIAG, the parent company of British Airways, fell 5%, with Easyjet sinking about the same. Ryanair closed 1.3% lower and Tui fell about 4.5%.\nAre you in Portugal? Are you planning to travel there soon? Please share how this latest announcement will affect you.

Records show the firm was dissolved six months earlier, in January.\nThe commission said the Conservatives had admitted incorrectly reporting donations from that firm - but gave no further details. \nIt said it remained in contact with the party \"so that we can publish the correct information and provide transparency to voters\".\nLabour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said: \"This confirmation that the Conservatives inaccurately recorded a donation amounting to thousands of pounds raises more questions than it answers. We urgently need to know where that money came from.\"\nMeanwhile, the commission has also admitted it incorrectly registered details of another donation to the Conservatives in late 2019.\nIt had previously said the party got \u00a33,250 in December 2019 from a company called Landcap Development Eversley Ltd, which was disbanded 12 months prior.\nBut it said the party had in fact reported a donation from a still-active company, Landcap Limited. It again said it had confused the two businesses because they shared an address.\nIt is understood the watchdog discovered that error after the registered donation was brought to its attention. "

      "text": "Global food prices have jumped at their fastest monthly rate in over a decade, according to the United Nations.\nThe UN uses a broad index of global food costs, which have also climbed for 12 months in a row.  \nSuppliers have been affected by disruptions to production, labour and transport during the pandemic.\nConcerns are growing about broader inflation and how higher grocery bills will impact the world's economic recovery.\nThe UN Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index tracks prices around the world of a range of food including cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar.\nAccording to the index, food prices in May were 4.8% higher than April - the biggest monthly rise since October 2010 - and 39.7% higher than this time last year (May 2020).\nAll five components of the index rose, led by the surging cost of vegetable oils, grain and sugar. \nThat pushed the index up to its highest overall level since September 2011.\nThe increased costs are a result of renewed demand in some countries and a backlog of low production.  \nMarket and supply disruptions due to restrictions on movement have created local shortages and higher prices.  \nExperts had warned that high demand and low production would lead to rising inflation as economies exit lockdown.\nHowever, some industries could see a strong recovery. The FAO forecasts record global cereal production this year, which may help to ease upward price pressures.\nEarlier this week, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned UK consumers that they could face more expensive shopping bills in the autumn as costs climb.\nInflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase.\nAs well as giving a snapshot of the price of our shopping and services, it influences interest rates and therefore our mortgages and is used to set regulated items, such as train tickets.\nIt's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far.\nA little inflation, however, typically encourages people to buy products sooner and makes it easier for companies to increase wages. And both of those things boost economic growth.\nMost countries' central banks have an inflation target of between 2% and 2.5%.\nRead more here."

      "text": "The number of people sticking rigidly to Covid rules in Wales has dropped by up to a third, research suggests.\nOne expert who has analysed the results said there was concern \"mixed messages\" on the virus may have led to confusion.\nOne study by University College London suggests complete compliance with Covid rules fell from 60% in February to 40% in May.\nThe Welsh government said the emergence of new variants made it clear the pandemic was not over.\nAnd Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said on Sunday it was \"going to be very difficult\" to stop the spread of an Indian variant from England to Wales as she urged people to continue to comply with the rules.\nAnother ongoing study by Public Health Wales (PHW), which quizzes people on how the pandemic and Covid restrictions are affecting their wellbeing, also suggests complete compliance with rules has dropped - from 76% in March to 65% in May.\nDr Simon Williams, from Swansea University, said the figures from the research also suggested that the proportion of people mixing outside their family households or bubbles had also increased in Wales, from 41% of people meeting with three or more people in March, rising to 57% in May.\nHowever, while sticking tightly to all the rules has dropped, the UCL study - which has spoken to 70,000 people across the UK during the pandemic - said the vast majority of people told researchers they were \"mostly following the rules\", at 91% for the UK as a whole.\nThe latest public engagement survey by PHW, which has spoken to 18,000 people since the start of the pandemic, said the proportion of adults \"very worried\" about catching Covid had dropped massively since the start of the year - falling from 31% to just 8%.\nIt comes as well over two million people in Wales have now received at least one dose of Covid vaccine, and over a million have been completely vaccinated.\nIt means Wales is ahead of every country in the world with similar populations for Covid vaccines.\n\"Overall, there is a picture emerging that we can see over the last couple of weeks, certainly the last few months, there has been a dip in compliance,\" said Dr Williams, who is a senior lecturer in people and organisation at Swansea University's School of Business.\n\"I think a large part of that is a lack of clarity over where we are in the pandemic.\n\"It's a classic case of mixed messages. We see at a UK level the message that there is an irreversible roadmap, that we are going to open up further in June.\n\"At the same time, we are seeing and hearing about the rise in these new variants.\"\nAt the end of May, there were 58 cases of the so-called Indian variant of concern detected in Wales, according to PHW.\nThere have been 30 more cases sequenced of the B.1.617.2 variant - the one of concern - in the most recent week.\nThey had been detected in all health board areas except Powys, but were primarily in traceable clusters in Cardiff and Vale of Glamorgan, according to health officials.\nIn the latest of it steps to ease restrictions, the Welsh government announced on Friday that live music could return, with venues needing risk assessments in line with hospitality and performing guidance.\nThe next review of restrictions in Wales is due on 3 June. \nThe Welsh government says that, if conditions remain positive, its next review will consider further changes to meeting people in private homes and increasing the number of people who can meet outdoors. \nDr Williams said Wales was at a \"crucial moment\" in the course of the pandemic.\n\"Despite recent easing, we are not out of the woods yet and so governments need the tone to be as clear as possible in their communication that we still need to be cautious, but they also need to ensure that further easings are not introduced before we have this new variant under control across the UK.\n\"Mixed messages - an urging for caution while also relaxing measures - has caused confusion which, in turn, might have a negative impact on compliance.\"\nResponding, a Welsh government spokesman said: \"It is thanks to the efforts of everyone that Wales has the lowest rates of coronavirus in the UK. \n\"But the pandemic isn't over and the emergence of the so-called Indian variant of concern is a reminder to us all just how quickly the situation can change and that this virus is full of unpleasant surprises.\n\"We continue to urge people to follow the set of simple measures, such as keeping your distance; washing your hands regularly, wearing a face covering indoors and ventilating indoor spaces, to keep you, your loved ones and Wales safe.\""

      "tags": "Norway,Brexit,Iceland,Trade",
      "text": "The UK has signed a post-Brexit trade deal with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, the government has announced.\nThe agreement will be a major boost for trade between the four non-EU nations, which is already worth \u00a321.6bn, UK minister Liz Truss said.\nShe claimed it would boost sectors such as digital and cut tariffs on UK farm products such as cheese and meat.\nBritain is Norway's top trading partner outside the European Union (EU).\nThe UK government said reduced import tariffs on shrimps, prawns and haddock would cut costs for UK fish processing, helping to support jobs in Scotland, East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire.\nAs Britain is no longer part of the European Common Fisheries Policy, it must deal directly with Norway and UK fleets are keen to have access to the country's sub-Arctic seas.\nHowever, many Norwegian farmers have expressed concerns at opening up the domestic market to British beef and cheese. \nState broadcaster NRK says the country's market of 5.4 million people is small but potentially lucrative, with strong purchasing power.\nThe countries involved are the three non-EU members of the European Economic Area, which allows them to be part of the EU's single market.\nNorwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said \"the deal allows for growth in trade for both our countries\".\nHowever, the Norwegian government said the deal with the UK would not restore all the advantages it had when both countries were in the EEA.\nIn terms of their overall trade volumes, this deal is more significant for Norway and Iceland than it is for the UK.\nBut politically, it's really important for the post-Brexit British government to show that new trade deals are being done quickly. Even if - as the Norwegian side points out - it is less open than the previous relationship inside the same single market. \nThe new deal builds on the rollover agreement the UK signed before it left the EU's economic zone, and the government is keen to stress it includes important elements on digital trade which go beyond what the EU has. \nBut digital and data provisions are relatively new elements in free trade agreements, and it's still unclear how effective they are in the long term. \n\"At first sight, the deal looks cautiously ambitious,\" says trade expert David Henig from the European Centre for International Political Economy. \n\"In many fields, from climate change to SMEs [small businesses] to digital, it sets out some goals, without it being obvious that the underlying provisions will deliver them.\"\nSo, it's a decent start. But it's the implementation that counts. \n\"Prior to the UK's exit from the EU, Norway enjoyed free movement of goods, services, capital and persons to the UK through the EEA agreement,\" Norway said. \n\"A free trade agreement will not provide similar access to the British market.\"\nThe UK's international trade secretary, Liz Truss, said the deal would be \"a major boost for our trade with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, growing an economic relationship already worth \u00a321.6bn, while supporting jobs and prosperity in all four nations at home\".\nIceland's Foreign Minister, Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson, said an agreement with the UK had been a priority for his country and would be \"crucial for both Icelandic companies and consumers\"."

      "tags": "Angela Rayner,Boris Johnson,Lobbying in the United Kingdom,Parliamentary Standards Commissioner ",
      "text": "Parliament's sleaze watchdog should investigate the funding of the prime minister's Downing Street flat refurbishment, Labour says.\nBoris Johnson was last week cleared of misconduct and of breaking the ministerial code by his adviser on ministerial interests.\nBut Lord Geidt said the prime minister had \"acted unwisely\".\nLabour says he might have broken the rules governing the conduct of MPs after failing to declare a donation.\nLabour is keen to increase the pressure on Mr Johnson over the renovations to his flat as part of its wider charge of cronyism against the government, and has written to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, Kathryn Stone.\nLast Friday, Lord Geidt - who was appointed by the PM in April as his ministerial standards adviser - said Tory donor Lord Brownlow had paid an invoice to cover some of the costs for the works, which were overseen by Mr Johnson's wife Carrie.\nHe accepted that Mr Johnson had not been aware how the bill had been paid but rebuked him for \"unwisely\" allowing the refurbishment to proceed \"without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded\".\nAt the time, Labour said it was \"staggering\" that Mr Johnson could \"rack up\" a bill \"yet have no knowledge of how it was eventually paid\".\nNow, the party says Mr Johnson still has more questions to answer in his capacity as an MP, which falls under the remit of Ms Stone.\nIn the letter to the commissioner, Labour's Deputy leader, Angela Rayner, noted Ms Stone had previously reprimanded Mr Johnson in 2019 for failing to register a share of a property within the required time frame, and warned any further breaches may warrant \"more serious sanction\".\nBut Ms Rayner said \"far from learning the lessons of his previous transgressions, the prime minister has continued with his attitude of treating basic standards of integrity, openness and transparency with contempt, and behaving as though there is one rule for him and another for everyone else,\".\nShe says the fact that Mr Johnson told Lord Geidt he became aware of the donations for the works on the flat in February this year but did not settle the invoices personally until 8 March suggests he is in breach of parliamentary rules that all MPs must follow.\nThe Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament states that all MPs must register financial interests, donations and gifts, and Mr Johnson, as prime minister, is not exempt from that. \nMs Rayner added: \"I therefore write to request that you instigate a further investigation into the prime minister's failure to register this donation, using your powers as commissioner.\"\nShe also accused Mr Johnson of breaching the general principles on conduct in public life, including \"selflessness\", \"integrity\" and \"leadership\".\nMs Stone is already investigating whether Mr Johnson properly declared a \u00a315,000 holiday on the Caribbean island of Mustique with his wife Carrie.\nA Downing Street spokeswoman said: \"Lord Geidt's independent report shows the prime minister acted in accordance with the ministerial code at all times and sets out the background to the intended establishment of a Downing Street trust.\n\"The report shows how, at all times, the prime minister followed the advice of officials and he has made a declaration in his list of ministerial interests, as advised by Lord Geidt.\n\"The House of Commons rules and Electoral Commission guidance are clear that support relating to ministerial activity should be declared through ministerial declarations and this has been done.\"\nThe Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards has the power to refer a case to the Committee on Standards if she deems it is serious enough and the committee can, in principle, recommend suspension. \nThe sanction for less serious cases can require the MP to acknowledge and apologise for any breach. \nMr Johnson faces two other inquiries in to the flat refurbishment. \nThe Electoral Commission is conducting its own investigation in to whether the Conservative Party broke the rules on declaring donations over the Downing Street flat and has the power to issue a fine of up to \u00a320,000.\nMeanwhile, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant, is also looking into the refurbishment, including whether donations were properly declared."

      "text": "Airlines are laying on extra capacity to bring people back to the UK from Portugal before the country is removed from the travel green list on Tuesday.\nBritish Airways is increasing its flights, while Tui and EasyJet are upgrading the size of their planes.\nThe move to the amber list means UK tourists should not visit the country and returnees must isolate for 10 days.\nBut travel firm Tui says 50% of passengers due to travel there in June are still planning to go.\nAny travellers scrambling for return flights before the new rules come in at 04:00 BST on 8 June are facing steep prices for tickets - with a single BA ticket from Faro to London City going for more than \u00a3540. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the decision on Portugal, which includes the islands of Madeira and the Azores, had to be made because of a rise in cases of the Delta variant, first detected in India.\n\"It was not a decision I wanted to take,\" he said. \"But we're absolutely determined to keep this country safe, especially from novel variants coming from overseas.\"\nSpeaking from a G7 health ministers' meeting in Oxford, Mr Hancock added that \"tough\" rules on international travel were also necessary to protect the success of the UK's vaccine rollout.\nHowever, Portugal's minister of foreign affairs, Augusto Santos Silva, told the BBC the UK's decision was not sufficiently justified, and that he did not understand the \"logic\" of the move - as the pandemic situations were very similar in the two countries. \nHe also stressed that Portugal had only registered 12 cases of the so-called Nepal variant, saying: \"I don't find any statistical relevance in these numbers.\"\nIt comes as the coronavirus reproduction number, or R - the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average - in England is between 1 and 1.2.\nThe latest figures show a further 11 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and another 6,238 cases have been reported.\nNo new destinations were added to the green list in the latest review, but seven countries - Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and Trinidad and Tobago - are being added to the red list. \nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have confirmed they will adopt the same changes, and the green list will be reviewed again on 28 June.\nLabour has called for the amber travel list to be scrapped altogether - or \"at the very least\" for Thailand and Vietnam to be urgently added to the red list, citing research on a variant linked to Thailand and rising cases in Vietnam, potentially as a result of a new variant.\nThe travel industry has criticised the change, saying it will threaten jobs and consumer confidence - with the boss of Heathrow Airport warning the sector faces \"another lost summer\".\nRyanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told BBC Breakfast that the decision was not \"based on any science or public health\", and that  he did not understand why the UK \"which has been so successful with vaccines\" was expecting its vaccinated citizens to quarantine.\nAlan Richards travelled to the Algarve on Saturday with seven of his family, including grandchildren, and they were due to return home on Tuesday.\nNow he says there is no possible way to get back before Portugal is moved to the amber list, costing the family hundreds of pounds in additional Covid-19 tests, keeping him from his job on the London Underground for 10 days and forcing his seven-year-old granddaughter to miss school.\n\"We're not ignorant people, we understood that there may well be a situation where if anything changes you would start having to make plans to cut short your holiday. That's acceptable,\" he says.\nBut with just five days' notice of the change, there is not enough time to book new pre-flight Covid tests and get the results before departure. Alan says he has been told there is a four-day wait just to get a test in Portugal.\nThe extra coronavirus tests they will be required to take during the 10-day quarantine will also cost \u00a3120 each, he says, adding \u00a3960 to the family's holiday bill.\nA week's notice could have allowed them to rebook travel if necessary, Alan says.\n\"No matter how you look at this, the timescales for returning are absolutely awful. We're in a frantic situation,\" he says.\n\"Mr Shapps needs to understand the awful situation that he's put hundreds of thousands of people in. He needs to resign.\"\nPortugal's change followed increased concern about a mutation of the Delta variant first identified in India, the government said.\nSome 68 cases of the Delta variant have been identified in the country, including cases with an additional so-called Nepal mutation, according to official figures.\nPublic Health England (PHE) said there were cases of the mutation in several countries, including a small number in the UK, and that it was investigating whether it could be more more transmissible and less effectively tackled by vaccines. \nThe number of positive Covid cases in Portugal has nearly doubled in the last three weeks.\nOn 2 June, Portugal had 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a little higher than the UK at 5.1 - but differences in the amount of testing being done make direct comparisons difficult.\nPHE believes the Delta variant is now dominant in the UK and that it may be linked to a higher risk of hospital admission. \nEarlier, epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson told Today that estimates suggest the Delta variant could be \"60% more transmissible\" than the previously dominant Kent variant known as Alpha.\nAsked about whether the ending of Covid restrictions in England on 21 June needed to be delayed, he said the data was pointing \"towards the direction of being cautious\".\nIn other key developments:\nAre you in Portugal?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A second dose of the Pfizer vaccine will be offered to 16 and 17-year-olds across the UK, following updated advice from the UK's vaccine committee.\nAll over-18s across the UK can have two Covid vaccine doses, as can some vulnerable, high-risk children over 12.\nHealthy, low-risk children between 12 and 15 have only been offered a single dose - which should be delayed until 12 weeks after a coronavirus infection.\nThe Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says a second dose for those aged 16 and 17 is safe and effective 12 weeks after the first.\nThe JCVI has previously held back from recommending a second dose because of concerns over a very rare heart condition, called myocarditis, experienced by tiny numbers of young people - particularly boys - after the second dose.\nIt says it is now reassured by evidence from other countries that a 12-week gap between doses would lower that already very small risk.\nA decision on a second dose for 12-15s has not yet been made but could happen in the next few weeks.\nIn the meantime, all 12-17 year olds should wait 12 weeks after a Covid infection before having their first or second dose.\nNo vaccine is currently approved for under-12s in the UK.\nIf you're over 18, and want to book your first, second or booster dose, you can find out how here.\nNo. If you're under 40 or pregnant you'll be given Pfizer or Moderna.\nEvery woman who is pregnant (or planning to become pregnant) is encouraged to get two vaccine doses. Hospital figures show that 98% of pregnant women admitted to intensive care this year were not vaccinated.\nUnder-18s have so far been offered Pfizer. \nThe vaccines are very effective at protecting people against becoming seriously ill or dying from Covid-19. \nLatest data from the UK Health Security Agency suggests more than 90% protection against hospitalisation and death with all three vaccines.\nThe vaccines are less effective at stopping people becoming infected by the virus, developing mild symptoms or passing it on - but they do reduce the risk of that happening too.\nIf you've been double-jabbed, you are far less likely to become seriously ill or die from Covid.\nCovid vaccines aren't compulsory, but everyone is urged to get jabbed to protect themselves, their family, friends and wider society.\nChildren under 16 don't need parental consent to get jabbed, as long as they are believed to have \"enough intelligence, competence and understanding to fully appreciate what's involved in their treatment\". This is known as \"Gillick competence\". \nBeing fully vaccinated can make travelling to most other countries easier, and in many cases means you will not have to self-isolate either when you return to the UK. \nHowever, it's worth bearing in mind that under-16s are not eligible for their own digital NHS Covid Pass, which is now accepted widely as proof of vaccination. \nWhat's more, the single jab which most UK teenagers have so far received, is not recognised as full vaccination by some countries (including France), and more tests may be required.\nCheck your destination's rules on the Foreign Office website before you travel. \nMost are mild, completely normal and disappear after a few days. \nThey happen because the body's defences are reacting to the vaccine, and include:\nA very small number of people had a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, so you should discuss any allergies you have before vaccination.\nThere's no evidence to suggest you should avoid alcohol altogether, but drinking in large quantities can suppress your immune system.\nSome women have experienced unusually heavy, painful or prolonged periods after being jabbed.\nThis may be because the vaccine prompts an increase in activity in the immune system, which also plays a role in the menstrual cycle. \nHowever, there's no evidence  the vaccine has any impact on pregnancy or fertility.\nPregnant women are being urged to get the vaccine, to protect themselves and their babies.\nCoronavirus can cause serious illness in some women in later pregnancy, and possibly a slightly higher rate of stillbirth.\nIf you're planning a pregnancy or are breastfeeding, government guidance says you can still get vaccinated, \nA recent study suggests vaccination can help improve long Covid symptoms.\nResearchers think the vaccine could be pressing the body's reset button and helping it recover.

      "text": "Democratic Unionist Party leader Edwin Poots has said he will lead DUP ministers at this month's North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in Dublin.\nMr Poots had denied boycotting some meetings in protest against the NI Protocol.\nAfter his first meeting as party leader with Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin, he confirmed plans to attend the next meeting.\nMr Martin said they had shared an \"open exchange of views\".\nSpeaking after the meeting, Mr Martin said they discussed a number of issues including north-south cooperation, the protocol and Covid-19. \nHe said he recognised the \"genuine concerns in unionist and loyalist communities around the protocol\".\nThe taoiseach said the focus must be on getting issues resolved and an \"obvious way to do this would be to reach agreement between the EU and UK on a temporary veterinary agreement - which would do away with 80% of checks at NI ports\".\nMr Poots, who described the meeting as \"positive, frank and useful\", said most of their discussion had focused on the protocol.\nThe protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that creates the Irish Sea border.\nHe said they also talked about fulfilling commitments made in the New Deal New Decade agreement in a timely fashion.\nBefore Thursday's meeting took place, he had said there was \"a lot of anger\" among the unionist community towards the protocol and said north-south relations \"have never been as bad\".\n\"I do not blame the current taoiseach for that, I blame the past taoiseach,\" Mr Poots said. \n\"Northern Ireland cannot be a plaything of the European Union or indeed of the southern government.\"\nLater, on Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9's Prime Time programme, Mr Poots said he did not believe the protocol, as it currently exists, \"is fixable\".\n\"It is an international agreement that isn't working,\" he added.\n\"The 15,000 checks per week, more than there would be in the port of Rotterdam - in Belfast and Larne, from goods coming from Britain to a population of 1.8 million, is not feasible, it is not deliverable, it is not implementable and will not be implemented.\n\"Europe needs to wake up and smell the coffee here.\"\nThe new DUP leader said he planned to go to the British Irish Council meeting in Fermanagh next week. \nHe said he believed outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster \"would like to lead on that and I would very much like her to do that\".\nHis comments were made after Sinn F\u00e9in joined the SDLP in seeking legal advice over the DUP's non-attendance at North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings. \nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood told BBC NI's The View on Thursday night that Mr Poots' confirmation that he would attend the next NSMC meeting was \"good news\".\n\"I am glad to see it, because the north-south institutions are a key part of the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said.\n\"There wouldn't have been a Good Friday Agreement frankly that nationalists would have been involved in if there wasn't a north-south dimension, and I want all of the three strands of the Good Friday Agreement to be fully implemented.\"\nThe NSMC is the main body for cross-border co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nUnder the DUP's five-point plan in protest at post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, ministers are refusing to take part in north-south engagement where the protocol is being discussed.\nMr Poots was criticised earlier this month for preventing what was billed as a \"long-standing meeting\" relating to agriculture from taking place. \nHe told a Stormont committee earlier on Thursday, speaking in his capacity as NI agriculture minister, that he had every intention of fulfilling his ministerial obligations. \n\"At no point have I refused to attend north-south meetings,\" he said. \nEarlier on Thursday, DUP MLA Paul Givan said any legal action over non-attendance at NSMC meetings would be an overreaction and should be a \"last resort\".\nMr Givan said there had to be a recognition of the opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nHowever, the SDLP's Nichola Mallon said she firmly believed the DUP was in breach of the ministerial code. \nShe also accused the DUP of being \"dishonest\" in how it has communicated its absences from NSMC meetings. \nOn Wednesday, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill had called on Mr Poots to attend this month's meeting, saying the boycott cannot \"be allowed to continue\"."

      "text": "More than half of UK adults have now had both doses of a coronavirus vaccine, official figures show.\nThe prime minister, who had his own second jab on Thursday, welcomed the \"amazing achievement\", tweeting: \"Now let's finish the job.\"\nA total of 26,422,303 second doses have been given out since the vaccine rollout began nearly six months ago.\nIt comes a day after Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed three quarters of UK adults have had a first jab.\nThree of the four vaccines approved for use in the UK require two doses for maximum protection against Covid-19.\nMeanwhile, cases continue to rise in the UK with another 5,274 infections reported on Thursday, and another 18 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test.\nMr Hancock said he was delighted with the progress of the vaccine rollout, and thanked \"everyone working together in our huge national effort\".\nAnd vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the UK had hit \"another important milestone\".\nEngland is slightly ahead of the other three nations in giving out second doses, with 50.7% of adults (22,442,383 people) having had two jabs.\nIn Scotland, 48.2% have had their second jab (2,137,618 people), Northern Ireland is on 47.1% (684,398 people) and in Wales it's 45.9% (1,157,904 people). These latest figures come from the UK's four health agencies.\nThe government has promised to offer a first dose of a vaccine to all adults by the end of July, and both doses to everyone aged 50 and over by 21 June.\nHerd immunity needs a lot of people being able to fight off the virus. \nSay every infected person would on average, in a fully unlocked society that hasn't seen the virus before, infect another six people. \nIf more than five out of every six people can fight off the virus - either because of vaccination or past infection - then the virus gets blocked and so the epidemic starts to shrink. \nWe're not there yet. \nBut herd immunity isn't all or nothing. Every person who is fully vaccinated makes it harder for the virus to spread. \nSo this is more great news about a successful vaccination programme that will hopefully keep us safer in the months to come.\nThe UK continues to be among those with the highest vaccination rates globally.\nThe number of first doses administered each day is now averaging about 170,000 - a drop from an average of about 500,000 in mid-March - as the schedule of second doses kicks in.\nAn average of more than 350,000 second doses are now being given a day.\nOn Wednesday, the health secretary confirmed the government was in talks with AstraZeneca to secure a future version of its jab which would be adapted to better tackle the Beta variant first identified in South Africa. \nAny altered vaccine would need to be approved by the medicines regulator.\nThe variant of coronavirus first identified in India is now the dominant strain in the UK, Public Health England (PHE) has said.\nThe number of cases confirmed by laboratory analysis rose by 79% over the last week to 12,431.\nScientists believe the variant, now known as Delta, has overtaken the Kent, or Alpha, variant.\nMeanwhile, Portugal is set to be downgraded from UK's green travel list to amber, meaning that people can only travel there for essential reasons.\nSeven countries and territories will be added to the red list facing toughest travel restrictions, including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Trinidad and Tobago."

      "tags": "Companies,Foreign & Commonwealth Office,Money,Travel insurance,Personal finance,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers.\nQuarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November.\nIf the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there.\nFor example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant.\nIf your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher.\nAn airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. \nA package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days.\nThis is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund.\nIn this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have.\nEasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its \"freedom to change\" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022.\nSome may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive.\nThey may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund.\nThat may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given.\n\"If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,\" he said. \n\"Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead.\"\nPeople who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator.\nOperators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate.\nIt is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel.\nTravel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy.\nThe majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel.\nImportantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go.\nRules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries.\nThe government has published a charter that \"clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place\".\nIt says it expects travel operators to be \"flexible\" with customers, given the circumstances, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firms they must stick to refund rules.\n"

      "text": "A County Armagh man has been described as a \"guardian angel\" after saving the life of a five-year-old boy who was choking on a chicken nugget.\nMary Byrne and her son Johnny \u00d3g were at a McDonald's in Newry, County Down, when Gabriel McKenna appeared \"as if out of nowhere\".\nShe has nicknamed the lifesaver the Angel Gabriel because both believe divine intervention was at play. \nMs Byrne said last Thursday had started well and they had decided to get food.\n\"It was a lovely weather and we decided to sit outside the restaurant instead of using the drive-thru, as we usually would,\" she told BBC's Evening Extra programme.\n\"Johnny went to put his wrappers in the bin and when he turned round he had a blank expression on his face.\n\"He couldn't get a breath. I tried banging his back and tried everything I thought was right,\" she added. \nPeople jumped out of their cars and staff rushed over to try to help.\nJohnny \u00d3g told the programme his \"face went purple and blue\". \n\"I had tried to eat the nugget in one go and I was trying to cry but my body didn't let me,\" he explained.\nHowever, even though everyone else was frantic, Johnny said he was not frightened by the experience. \nHe said he remembered his mum \"pushing my belly and back at the same time and then my chest started to hurt\".\n\"At that time I had him bent over my knee trying to slap his back - it was a blur and seemed like forever, even though it probably was,\" said Ms Byrne.\n\"All I thought was someone please help him,\" she added.  \nThen Angel Gabriel came along. \"Gabriel lifted me up like a chicken,\" said Johnny Og.\nMr McKenna, who is originally from County Louth and now lives in Cullyhanna, County Armagh, said it was \"divine intervention\" that he was there at that time.\n\"Something came into my mind to go round to the front of the restaurant and I saw what was going on,\" he told the programme. \n\"The child was on his mother's knee - I said, 'give me him' and hoisted him up in the air by the feet, put his belly towards mine and his back where I could get at him and worked at his two shoulder blades to revive him. \n\"I said prayers to Our Lady and St Theresa and God to help me to save this child and thanks be to God my prayers were answered.\"\nIt was the first time he had performed such a manoeuvre but he said he had been inspired by watching boxing matches in Dundalk. \nLater that day, Ms Byrne put out an appeal on Facebook to find Mr McKenna and the power of social media helped track the hero down.\nMr McKenna has now been round to the house to see Johnny and his mum in better circumstances. \n\"He's a great man and humble man but he's definitely going to be in our lives now - we will never forget what he did,\" Ms Byrne told the programme. \nShe praised other members of the public and McDonalds staff for supporting her afterwards.\nMr McKenna said Johnny was a \"special child\". \nJohnny told the programme he would be chewing his nuggets thoroughly the next time."

      "tags": "Travel,Portugal,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Portugal will be removed from the UK's green travel list from Tuesday, amid rising coronavirus cases and concern over a \"Nepal mutation of the so-called Indian variant\". \nIt will join the amber list, meaning holidaymakers should not visit and returnees must isolate for 10 days.\nSeven nations - including Egypt, Costa Rica and Sri Lanka - will join the red list, with the toughest travel rules.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the move was a \"safety-first approach\".\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have confirmed they will adopt the same changes.\nCountries have their own rules about allowing visitors, so being on the UK's green list does not guarantee travellers can visit.\nThe red list will expand to include Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Trinidad and Tobago. People arriving in the UK from these destinations will be required to stay in a quarantine hotel for 10 days at a fixed cost of \u00a31,750 per adult.\nThe changes come into effect at 04:00 BST on Tuesday.\nNo new countries will be added to the green list, Mr Shapps said.\nThe removal of Portugal means the green list will, from Tuesday, consist of: Australia, Brunei, the Falkland Islands, the Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Iceland, Israel, New Zealand, Singapore, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.\nThe transport secretary said two factors had led to the decision to downgrade Portugal, along with the islands of Madeira and the Azores.\n\"One is the positivity rate has nearly doubled since the last review in Portugal,\" he said.\n\"And the other is there's a sort of Nepal mutation of the so-called Indian variant [now known as Delta] which has been detected and we just don't know the potential for that to be a vaccine-defeating mutation.\"\nOn the so-called \"Nepal mutation\", Public Health England told the BBC it was \"aware of reports linking Nepal to Delta (VOC-21APR-02) with the additional mutation K417N\".\n\"This variant is present in multiple countries including a small number of cases in the UK, detected through rapid testing and whole genome sequencing,\" PHE said. \"We are investigating K417N to better understand its significance.\"\nOn 2 June, Portugal had 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a little higher than the UK at 5.1 - but differences in the amount of testing being done make direct comparisons difficult.\nKerry, a photographer from the Wirral, says her family - like many others - have had \"the year from hell\".  \nHer partner has been shielding for over a year due to an auto-immune disease, Kerry has had to nurse her mother through Covid-19 and a stroke, and her 18-month old son has hardly known a world without a pandemic.\nShe was just about to book a trip to Portugal when the rules changed. \"This holiday was everything for us our first with our baby who has had no experiences in his first 18 months on this planet,\" she says.\nBut others say they are likely to make the trip anyway.\nOne man told the BBC: \"Unless they say, you must not go, you will be fined if you go, we might well still go and just have to bear the additional costs of an extra PCR test and the fact that we have to quarantine.\" \nRead more travellers' reactions\nLabour said downgrading Portugal was \"not the answer\" and called for the amber list to be scrapped altogether.\nThe travel and tourism industry also voiced dismay, as shares fell in airlines and travel companies after the BBC first reported plans to lower Portugal's rating.\nEasyJet's chief executive accused the government of having \"torn up its own rule book\", saying the decision \"essentially cuts the UK off from the rest of the world\".\nThe chief executive of Heathrow Airport said: \"Ministers spent last month hailing the restart of international travel, only to close it down three weeks later.\"\nThe debate over travel rules comes after it was announced that more than half of the UK's adult population has now been vaccinated.\nA total of 26,422,303 second doses have been given out since the vaccine rollout began nearly six months ago.\nMeanwhile, cases continue to rise in the UK with another 5,274 infections reported on Thursday, and another 18 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test."

      "text": "Social distancing could continue in Wales for the rest of the year, the first minister has said.\nMark Drakeford said it remained one of the \"strongest defences\" against Covid.\nThe warning comes after the news outdoor sporting events and concerts can resume from Monday for up to 10,000 people sitting or 4,000 standing.\nExtended households can also expand to include a third and up to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors, including in private gardens.\nBut, Mr Drakeford said he was \"not certain there is a huge thirst\" for people to give up safeguards, including the 2m social distancing rule.\n\"I think they will remain part of the repertoire here in Wales during the rest of the summer, and maybe into the rest of this year,\" he told a coronavirus press briefing.\n\"Whether we will be able to move from them being mandatory to just [things] we advise people about will depend on whether we continue to see improvements of the position here in Wales.\"\nAllowing more people to meet indoors was ruled out until at least late June, as other lockdown rules were eased.\nThe decision to delay comes amid \"growing concern\" over the Delta variant, first identified in India, and the Welsh government said the delay was designed to allow more people to get vaccinated.\nThere are currently 97 cases of the variant in Wales, up 67% compared with the previous week.\nMr Drakeford said: \"The risk of infection is significantly less outdoors than it is indoors. This is why we are phasing in the changes in this three-week cycle.\n\"This will allow more people to enjoy events outdoors and take advantage of the Welsh summer, while we continue to roll out the vaccination programme to all adults.\"\nHowever, he added: \"We have to be realistic. The fact that the Delta variant is spreading so quickly in the north-west of England will mean that it will cross the border into Wales.\n\"That is why we are delaying some of the measures we might otherwise take to maximise the amount of vaccination that we can carry out because that is our best defence against that new variant.\"\nThe lockdown measures will be reviewed again on 21 June.\nThe changes - described as a phased move to Wales' alert level one - will begin from Monday.\nIt means three households are able to meet indoors and have physical contact - but each household can only meet one other at a time.\nA further household with a single adult, or single adult with caring responsibilities, will still be able to join extended households.\nFurther rule changes on indoor activity will be considered by the Welsh government before 21 June - when an ending to restrictions in England may happen. \nPubs and restaurants have been allowed to serve customers inside from 17 May, however, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective has called for all significant restrictions to be lifted before July, including scrapping the 2m social distancing rule.\nSarah Hemsley-Cole, of campaign group WeMakeEvents Cymru, said the announcement was \"great news\" for the industry, having been crippled by repeated lockdowns.\nIn recent weeks a series of test events have been held, including the Tafwyl and Eid festivals in Cardiff Castle, while the upcoming Wales v Albania football match at Cardiff City Stadium is limited to 4,000 spectators.\nMs Hemsley-Cole said while they were happy with the Welsh government's \"cautious\" approach, the test events had been \"incredibly restrictive\" with some limited to just 100 people amid social distancing.\nShe added: \"The reality is, as long as there is social distancing, that is a challenge for the sector... it's a real challenge to make things work, and people sort of forget they have to maintain it.\n\"But we understand it is there to make us safe and we will find solutions and a way to make it work.\"\nAnnual events, such as Brecon Jazz and Green Man Festival, were waiting to see if they would be allowed to go ahead this summer, while Live Nation have confirmed they will now hold four outdoor concerts, each for up to 10,000 people, in Cardiff Bay in September.\n\"There's been an optimistic outlook for the last month or so but we're very pleased with this news,\" said Rob Waller, of Live Nation. \"It's great to have live music back.\"\nThe Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd says businesses will be concerned there were no announcements on financial support.\nAndrew RT Davies said: \"There's \u00a3140m of unallocated money in the Welsh government's coffers for business support but there was no mention of that.\"\nPlaid Cymru welcomed the changes but pressed for more support to businesses while \"the economic devastation of the pandemic remains.\"\nWelsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds welcomed the \"cautious\" move, but warned that after more than a year of changing restrictions, people were \"exhausted\".\nShe also wanted a review of the rules on hospital visits.\nDespite concerns over the Delta variant, Wales will not push for a ban on travel from hot-spots in England, similar to that demanded last year.\n\"I don't think that's the position that we are in at the moment,\" said Mr Drakeford.\n\"We are asking people coming into Wales from those hotspot areas to behave carefully and responsibly, to take all the precautions you would expect them to take to keep themselves and other people safe.\" \nWales has the highest vaccination rate in the UK, with 2,169,624 people having been given a first vaccine dose, or 68.5%.\nFigures also show 1,181,259 people have now had a second jab, almost 40% of the population of Wales.\nThe case rate in Wales is currently 8 per 100,000 people over seven days.\nA cluster of cases, attributed to the Delta variant, has been responsible for a spike in Conwy county, taking the case rate there to 23.\nThere have been no new deaths with covid reported in Wales for the past nine days."

      "text": "Scotland's health secretary has said he \"regrets\" if his claim that 10 children had been hospitalised \"because of Covid\" had caused undue alarm.\nHumza Yousaf used the figure as he warned that travelling from a level two area to a soft play in level one \"could lead to hospitalisation of children\".\nMedics say children's wards are not seeing any rise in admissions due to Covid.\nAnd they have stressed that there is no reason for parents to worry.\nThey also say that many of the children classed as being in hospital with the virus would have no symptoms but would have tested positive after being taken there for unrelated reasons, such as a broken bone, rather than because the virus had made them very ill.\nThere are currently no figures for how many children are actually being treated in hospital for Covid symptoms..\nOpposition parties accused Mr Yousaf of \"scaremongering\" over the risk the virus poses to children.\nThe health secretary made the remarks on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme on Wednesday morning, when he said that 10 children aged zero to nine were admitted to hospital last week \"because of Covid\".\nHe added: \"Therefore the risk of someone who travelled from a level two area into a level one area and who took their children into a soft play area could lead to the hospitalisation of children.\n\"I'm not going to send police out, you wouldn't imagine, to police soft play areas. We require people to exercise their own judgement, personal responsibility, be cautious, know the rules and hopefully follow them\". \nHe was responding to a question about a soft player owner in Midlothian who said it was \"moronic\" that his facility remained closed because it was in level two, but parents could drive six miles down the road to a level one area and go to a soft play there. \nThere is no ban on travel between level two and level one areas. \nThe following day, Covid Recovery Secretary John Swinney told Good Morning Scotland that the number of children being admitted to hospital with the virus was \"on the high side\".\nMr Swinney added: \"We have to look at all of these factors to determine is there something in the new variants that are emerging that is making it more acutely challenging for children with a greater health impact\".\nIn tweets sent on Thursday night, Mr Yousaf wrote: \"My main message was to urge caution, not to cause any undue alarm, I regret if that was the case.\"\nHe added: \"My quoting of these figures was in response to a question about a parent wanting to take their child from a Level 2 area to soft play in a Level 1 area. \n\"My clear msg was plz don't take any risks. It certainly wasn't my intention to create any undue alarm.\nThe Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health had earlier issued a statement saying there was no sign of an increase in the number of children being hospitalised because of Covid. \nIt said: \"As it stands there are very few children in hospital in Scotland and across the whole of the UK due to Covid. \n\"A very few number of admissions who test positive for Covid is what we would expect. \n\"Our experience over the past 15 months is that many children who test positive have come into hospital for something else, like broken bones\".\nThe statement said children's wards were not seeing any rise in Covid, and urged parents not to worry. \nMr Yousaf, who was appointed as health secretary last month after previously serving as justice secretary, was strongly criticised by opposition parties for his remarks.\nThe Scottish Conservatives accused him of being \"appallingly misleading\" and said his remarks had been a \"terrible example of scaremongering during a health crisis\".\nThe party's health spokeswoman, Annie Wells, said: \"By making these claims without any evidence to back them up, he has shamefully stoked fear among the public.\"\nAnd the Liberal Democrats said children and parents \"have enough to worry about right now over lost school days, SQA assessments and economic uncertainty without causing undue alarm\". \nMore than 10,000 people have died with Covid in Scotland since the pandemic began - three of whom were aged under 14, according to National Records of Scotland figures.\nThey were a baby girl in December 2020, a boy in February of this year and a girl in March.\nRegulators have now approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children in the UK aged 12-15, saying it is safe and effective in this age group and that the benefits outweigh the risks."

      "text": "Two police forces are to pay damages to more than 600 people over a cover-up which followed the Hillsborough disaster.\nThe South Yorkshire and West Midlands forces agreed the settlement earlier this year following a civil claim. \nNobody has ever been convicted over police actions following the disaster, in which 96 Liverpool fans died in a crush at a 1989 FA Cup semi-final.\nSouth Yorkshire Police offered an \"unreserved apology\" to those affected. \nActing Chief Constable Lauren Poultney said the force acknowledged that \"serious errors and mistakes were made\" by its officers \"both on 15 April 1989 and during the subsequent investigations\".\n\"Those actions on the day of the disaster tragically led to lives being lost and many being injured [while] the force's subsequent failings also caused huge distress, suffering and pain, both to the victims and their families,\" she added.\nDetails of the claim were revealed after former Ch Supt Donald Denton, 83, retired Det Ch Insp Alan Foster, 74, and Peter Metcalf, 71, who acted as a solicitor for the force, were acquitted of perverting the course of justice in May. \nThe men were accused of trying to minimise the blame placed on the force in the aftermath of the disaster by amending police statements. \nA spokesman for Saunders Law, the lead solicitors for the group litigation, said the civil claim for misfeasance in a public office was started in 2015.\nIt was agreed in April but could not be reported until the conclusion of the trial.\nWhile compensation for the 96 victims will go to their bereaved families, damages will also be paid to survivors for the injuries they have suffered and access to a fund for further psychiatric treatment or counselling.\nThe exact amount of compensation has yet to be agreed.  \n\"The settlement of these claims marks the end of an unparalleled and extraordinary fight for justice by the victims and their families,\" the Saunders spokesman said.\n\"We trust that this settlement will put an end to any fresh attempts to rewrite the record and wrongly claim that there was no cover-up.\"\nHe said there had been \"an almost complete failure of the justice system to deliver justice\" and called on the government to implement a Hillsborough Law, which would include a duty of candour for public officials.\nThe criminal trial of two police officers and a solicitor collapsed because of a fundamental and very unusual legal barrier to it continuing - but claims for damages in civil law work differently.\nThe families had to show on a balance of probabilities that there had been a cover-up - and the evidence was massively in their favour. \nIn 2012 the Independent Panel detailed how the fans were unjustly blamed. The then-South Yorkshire Police chief constable accepted its findings - and then Prime Minister David Cameron told MPs the families had been right all along. \nIn short, there was no point in police chiefs fighting a case that would, in all certainty, result in a damning verdict that their institutions had acted improperly. \nAttention now turns to Parliament. Families want the law to compel public bodies to tell the whole truth in all circumstances. \nThey want guarantees of proper funding so they, like agencies of the state, can have the best lawyers in the land fighting their corner. \nThe proposed Hillsborough Law had cross-party backing until the 2017 General Election stopped it. This government has the choice whether to bring it back. \nLouise Brookes, who was 17 when her brother Andrew died in the disaster, described the situation as \"shameful\". \n\"Why they couldn't have just admitted everything 32 years ago and we could have all moved on with our lives,\" she said. \n\"I have sacrificed 32 years of my life. We've done absolutely nothing wrong. \n\"How they could put us and the survivors through 32 years of hell?\"\nThe disaster at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium, which was later investigated by West Midlands Police, remains the UK's worst sporting disaster. \nMany families and survivors have since led a campaign for more than 30 years to discover how and why the victims died.\nIn 2012, then-chief constable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton apologised for a cover-up following the publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report.\nNew inquests, which concluded in 2016, found that the men, women and children who died were unlawfully killed and fans played no part in the causes of the disaster.\nHillsborough campaigner Prof Phil Scraton said: \"You hear outside of Liverpool people saying 'why are they still going on about it?'\n\"And to put it into context, 96 men, women and children died at a football match and this has been the most costly, the longest and most complex legal process in British history.  \n\"There's never been anything like it before.\"\nActing Chief Constable Poultney has since offered \"an unreserved apology to those affected by the Hillsborough disaster and its aftermath\" and said the actions of officers on the day of the disaster and afterwards was \"something South Yorkshire Police profoundly regrets\".\nWest Midlands Police Deputy Chief Constable Vanessa Jardine added: \"We deeply regret the harm and distress caused to those affected by the tragedy.\n\"Although I know it cannot make up for their suffering, working with South Yorkshire Police we have agreed a scheme to compensate those affected.\"\nShe said she would like to thank the families \"for the dignified way in which they have conducted themselves\". \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "The whistleblower who first warned the BBC about faked documents at the heart of its Princess Diana interview has said the broadcaster has made amends for how he was treated.\nGraphic designer Matt Wiessler was sidelined after he raised concerns about the methods reporter Martin Bashir used to get the scoop in 1995.\nMr Wiessler said BBC director general Tim Davie \"made multiple unreserved apologies\" in a meeting on Thursday.\nThey also discussed compensation.\nBut Mr Wiessler said the matter was confidential, adding: \"We very much both just want to move on.\"\nIn 1995, Mr Wiessler was commissioned by Panorama interviewer Bashir to mock up fake bank statements, but did not know what they would be used for until after the programme aired.\nThe documents were used to lend credibility to Bashir's false claims to Diana's brother Earl Spencer that the princess was under surveillance and being conspired against by royal aides - helping the BBC interviewer to win her trust.\nAfter his meeting with the director general, Mr Wiessler said: \"We had a fantastic conversation. He made multiple unreserved apologies, which I thought was great - and he was really heartfelt about it.\"\nAsked whether the broadcaster had made amends, he said: \"Yes, very much so. Because I still felt that to this day the BBC were just saying things to sort of appease me. \n\"But I have come away from it feeling, 'no they really, really support me'.\"\nThe in-person apology comes some 26 years after the bombshell interview first aired.\n\"It's been a weight on my shoulders for a very long time,\" Mr Wiessler added.\n\"I think that there's always a bit of regret about that, but as I say, we've hit it off pretty well and I'm quite happy right now.\"\nConcerns about how Bashir secured the interview began to resurface last autumn, prompting an independent investigation by retired judge Lord Dyson.\nThe investigation found Bashir had used deception to secure the interview, and said the BBC had fallen short of its \"high standards of integrity and transparency\". \nThe BBC subsequently made an \"unconditional apology\" over the way it obtained an interview.\nFollowing the investigation, Bashir said he \"never wanted to harm\" Diana and was \"deeply sorry\" to her sons, the dukes of Cambridge and Sussex.\nSpeaking to the Sunday Times he admitted he should not have shown the forged bank statements to Earl Spencer.\n\"Obviously I regret it, it was wrong. But it had no bearing on anything. It had no bearing on [Diana], it had no bearing on the interview.\""

      "text": "Scotland has recorded its highest number of new Covid cases since February, a day before restrictions ease across much of the country.\nA total of 992 people tested positive for the virus on Thursday, the highest daily figure since 17 February.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the number of new cases had more than tripled in the past month.\nAnd she said it showed that the country was at a \"critical juncture\" in the pandemic. \nHowever, she stressed that the success of the vaccine programme meant that the country could continue to look forward to living with fewer restrictions over the summer.\nAnd she said the link between the number of cases and the number of people being hospitalised and dying because of the virus was not as strong as it has been in the past - but had not disappeared completely.\nMs Sturgeon said: \"We are at a very critical juncture right now in what we still very much hope, and believe, is a transition to a less restrictive way of dealing with Covid, but the position we are in now on that transition is a fragile one.\"\nMany areas in the north and south of mainland Scotland will move from level two to level one of the country's five-tier system from midnight on Friday.\nGlasgow will move from level three to level two - allowing people to meet in each other's homes again and drink alcohol inside pubs and restaurants - and island communities including Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles will move to the lowest level zero restrictions.\nBut it was announced earlier this week that 13 council areas with a combined population of 2.3 million people in the central belt of the country, including Edinburgh, would stay in level two rather than moving down to level one as had been planned. \nThe whole country is currently due to move to level 0 on 28 June - with Ms Sturgeon saying she is still optimistic about that target despite doubts being expressed about whether it will happen. \nScottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross - who is voluntarily self-isolating despite testing negative for the virus - called for greater clarity from the Scottish government on how areas can move out of level two, saying \"we don't need to shut down entire cities if we see a spike in cases\".\nInstead, he said more targeted measures such as increased testing and vaccination should be put in place when local outbreaks are detected.\nThe country's national clinical director has warned that Scotland is now in the early stages of a third wave of the virus, with about 70% of new cases thought to be the so-called Delta variant that was first detected in India. \nMs Sturgeon said that this variant appeared to be \"quite significantly\" more transmissible even than the Kent variant that was dominant earlier in the year, and that early data suggests it may increase the risk of hospitalisation.\nShe stressed that there were also \"strong indications\" that vaccines were weakening the link between rising cases and the number of people being hospitalised, needing intensive care treatment and dying.\nBut she warned that the link had not yet been broken completely, with hospital cases rising to more than 100 in the past week and a small \"upward tick\" in the number of patients in intensive care in recent days - although the figure remains very low, with only eight people currently being treated in ICU units across the country.\nThe deaths of a further two people who had tested positive for the virus in the previous 28 days have also been recorded, and new cases of the virus were detected in every council area on Thursday. \nThe first minister said the figures justified her decision to pause the easing of restrictions in areas of the country where case numbers have been increasing.\nShe added: \"There is still a significant proportion of the country that has not yet had both doses of the vaccine.\n\"We need to exercise continued care and that is why the decisions I set out on Tuesday, about the level of protection that will apply from tomorrow to different parts of the country, were so cautious.\n\"I know that is frustrating, but at this particular moment it is necessary in my judgment to be cautious while we continue to vaccinate more and more people.\"\nA total of 3,326,005 people have had at least one dose of the vaccine in Scotland - of whom 2,170,570 have been given a second dose."

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,India,Reality Check,South Africa,Nepal,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Portugal is to be removed from the UK's green list of countries that are safe to visit. \nThe government said it's partly down to the emergence of a \"Nepal variant\" - but such a variant has not been recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO). So, what's going on?\nAnnouncing Portugal's move to the amber list, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said there was a \"Nepal mutation of the so-called Indian variant\". He said it wasn't known whether it could be \"vaccine defeating\". \nAnd speaking to the BBC, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the Indian variant was spreading and there was \"growing evidence of a further mutation- what's become known as the Nepal variant\".\nThe government said it did not want to take risks before the planned final easing of England's restrictions. Being on the amber list means UK tourists should not visit Portugal and returnees must isolate for 10 days.\nA mutated virus has been spotted in Nepal and elsewhere. But that doesn't mean a new variant of coronavirus has been found.\nThe WHO said it was \"not aware of any new variant of SARS-CoV-2 being detected in Nepal\", and the dominant variant there was the Delta or Indian variant.\nA small number of cases of the Delta variant have been identified as having an extra mutation - called K417N.  \nThe change is in the virus's distinctive spike protein and has been seen before, including in the so-called South African or Beta variant. \nSamples of the Delta variant with this extra change have been spotted about 90 times worldwide. Of these, 12 cases were spotted in Portugal, 36 in the UK, 12 in the US and four in India.\nIt is not clear that 12 cases is enough to count as being \"prevalent within Portugal\", as Mr Jenrick claimed. \nMore up-to-date UK data from Public Health England suggests 43 cases have now been spotted through genetic analysis (a process called sequencing). The UK does a lot of genomic sequencing so is likely to find more cases than countries that do less.\nThe Wellcome Sanger Institute said it had been observed \"once in Nepal (which does very little sequencing), and 14 times in Japan, of which 13 are samples from airport quarantine from travellers from Nepal\".\nRemember that viruses mutate constantly. When the changes are drastic enough, we start describing it as a new variant - like the Alpha variant identified in Kent, the Beta variant identified in South Africa and so on.\nThere is no scientifically agreed definition of when a mutation becomes a variant. We usually have to wait until a particular set of changes spreads enough that we can see a pattern. \nPublic health bodies and people who analyse or sequence the virus's genetic material investigate any changes to the virus. \nIf a distinctive set of changes, or variant, appears to be spreading better, making people sicker or resisting vaccines, then it will be upgraded to being a \"variant of concern\". \nThis hasn't happened with the mutation identified in Nepal and elsewhere, so far. \nIt is mentioned by Public Health England as a \"spike mutation of interest\", but it is not categorised as a variant. \nOther mutations that didn't amount to new variants have been spotted in Egypt, Vietnam and Yorkshire. \nIn February, a small number of cases of the UK or Alpha variant were found with a mutation, called E484K, that is already seen in the South Africa variant. It was feared this change could reduce vaccine effectiveness, but the mutation never took off.  \nThis change to the virus's spike protein is also seen in the Beta or South African variant.\nIt is thought to be part of why that variant is more resistant to vaccines. \n\"Because of this possibility, and because Delta appears more transmissible than Beta, scientists are monitoring it carefully,\" the Sanger Institute explained. \nAs well as concerning variants, the government says it looks at factors including how many cases of coronavirus a country has. \nPositive results in Portugal have nearly doubled since the last review, the government said, adding the situation \"has required swift action to protect the gains made with the [UK] vaccine rollout\".\nMr Jenrick said there had been a \"doubling in positivity within three weeks, bringing Portugal to a much higher level than here in the UK\".\nCases have risen considerably in Portugal over the last few weeks, but they are in fact only a little higher than in the UK (5.4 new cases per 100,000 compared with 5.1).\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions"

      "text": "The variant of coronavirus first identified in India is now the dominant strain in the UK, Public Health England (PHE) has said.\nThe number of cases confirmed by laboratory analysis rose by 79% over the last week to 12,431.\nScientists believe the variant, now known as Delta, has overtaken the Kent, or Alpha, variant.\nThey say that there may also be a higher risk of hospitalisation linked to the Delta variant.\nBut that is based on early evidence, and PHE say more data is needed to have more confidence in the finding.\n\"With this variant now dominant across the UK, it remains vital that we all continue to exercise as much caution as possible,\" said Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency.\n\"The way to tackle variants is to tackle the transmission of Covid-19 as a whole.\"\nPHE said the most affected area of the country remains the north west of England. \nConfirmed cases of the Delta variant in Bolton have risen by 795 over the past week to 2,149, with Blackburn with Darwen seeing a near doubling of cases to 724 in total.\nBut scientists say there are encouraging signs that the transmission rate in Bolton has begun to fall and that the actions taken by residents and local authority teams have been successful in reducing spread.\nEarly analyses from England and Scotland suggest that people infected with the Delta variant could be twice as likely to need hospital care. \nBut there are still low numbers of people being admitted to hospital with any variant, and PHE stress that more data is needed to confirm this analysis. \nIn the last week, 94 people in England were admitted to hospital after attending A&E with the Delta variant. \nThe majority had not yet been vaccinated. \nAnd 6% had had both jabs. \nPHE has also published a breakdown of outbreaks and clusters of variants in schools settings with cases rising in line with higher levels of the Delta variant in the community.\nThe latest data suggest that there have been 97 confirmed outbreaks in primary and secondary schools that have had at least one variant case linked to them over the most recent four-week period. That represents around one in 250 schools in the UK. \nIt said its protection teams continue to work closely with local authorities and academies to carry out surveillance to better understand and reduce transmission in these settings."

Estimates of the dead vary from a few hundred to several thousand.\nBut for the second year running, authorities in Hong Kong have banned an annual vigil for the event. They cite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic for the restrictions. \nOfficers closed off Victoria Park, where the annual vigil is normally held, and dispersed crowds who gathered with candles or their phone lights lit.\nThis year's anniversary is the first since a new controversial security law was approved, aimed at ending the city's pro-democracy movement and criminalising dissent.\nOn Friday, officials arrested pro-democracy activist Chow Hang Tung, vice chairwoman of the Hong Kong Alliance which organises annual vigils for victims of the Tiananmen Square crackdown.\nThousands defied last year's ban on the vigil, knocking down barricades around Victoria Park. \nBut this year commemorations are so far more constrained. The new security law - passed in 2020 - makes it easier to punish protesters and reduces Hong Kong's autonomy.\nThere were calls online from activists to light candles, house lights and even cigarettes to mark the event at 20:00 local time (12:00 GMT). \nPolice warned of more arrests, and Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said that citizens must respect the law.\nIn past years there were huge street demonstrations to mark the anniversary. \nThousands of people took part in a candle light vigil in 2019 - the last year the annual event could be held. \nIn mainland China, authorities have banned even oblique references to the events of June 4. Online, any discussion of the crackdown is strictly censored.\nTaiwan commemorates the anniversary every year, using the event to criticise China and urge Beijing to embark on real political reform.\nOn her Facebook page, President Tsai Ing-wen wrote: \"I believe that all Taiwanese who are proud of their freedom and democracy will never forget about this day and will firmly stick with their faith, unshaken by storms.\"\nAll photos subject to copyright.

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you on Saturday morning.\nTwo measures show cases are beginning to rise rapidly from a low level in the UK. A survey by the Office for National Statistics found that about 100,000 people tested positive in the week up to 29 May - a rise of two-thirds from 60,000 the week before. Daily reported test results also suggest a sharp rise, with 6,278 confirmed cases on Friday. Increased testing in hotspot areas for the Delta variant first detected in India may exaggerate the rise in daily figures, while hospital admissions and deaths continue to fall. But the ONS data, which is not skewed by how many people come forward for tests, shows there is a genuine increase.\nThe Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged 12 to 15, the first time a Covid-19 vaccine has been authorised for under-16s in the UK. The UK's medical regulator found it was safe and effective, with the benefits outweighing any risks. Vaccine committee the JCVI will now decide whether children should get the jab. The Pfizer vaccine was already approved for people aged 16 and over, but the UK is not routinely offering Covid-19 jabs to any under-18s at the moment. Children's risk of becoming ill with Covid is very low, but EU countries, the US and Canada are all beginning to vaccinate younger age groups. Read more about the debate.\nNepal's prime minister has made a plea to the UK for vaccines as it suffers one of the highest infection rates in the world. KP Sharma Oli said Nepal should be a priority for UK aid due to the historic ties the countries share and the contribution of its Gurkha soldiers. \"I want to convince the UK government, particularly Prime Minister Boris Johnson, about the situation in Nepal and how we are suffering,\" Mr Oli said. It comes as the UK blamed the spread of a \"Nepal variant\" for travel restrictions in Portugal, although no such variant has been officially designated yet.

Movie studio Paramount said it was following \"all safety protocols\" on the spy series, which stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. Filming has been taking place at the Warner Bros Studios in Hertfordshire and on location across the UK, with Cruise surprising locals in a North Yorkshire village in April when he arrived by helicopter for a shoot. An audio recording previously emerged in December, which seemed to capture the star berating the crew for not following distancing guidelines during filming. \nFirst it was dogs at polling stations, now one Melbourne pathology worker is livening up the city's lockdown with an Instagram account dedicated to the canines at Covid testing centres. Tiffany White began documenting the pooches accompanying their owners on her \"Swab dogs of Instagram\" account and workers at sites across the city joined in.

      "text": "The low level of physical activity among children and young people in Northern Ireland has been described as a \"major health concern\".\nThe warning is contained in a research paper on their physical activity and wellbeing just published by the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nIt said that more than a quarter of children in Northern Ireland were classed as overweight or obese.\nThe research paper was written for Stormont's Education Committee.\nIt said several studies suggested that physical activity, particularly at school, could improve children's mental as well as physical health.\nIt could improve children's resilience, wellbeing and self-esteem, as well as reducing anxiety and depression, for instance.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends 60 minutes of physical activity a day for children.\nBut the assembly paper said that children in Northern Ireland were less likely to meet that recommendation than any other country in Europe.\nA separate study carried out in 2018 suggested that only 13% of school children in Northern Ireland had an hour of physical activity a day.\nGirls are less likely to meet that target than boys, especially as they get older.\nThe paper said that was partly down to a lack of \"balance\" in what schools offered.\n\"While there is some breadth in the range of PE activities on offer in primary schools, the post-primary PE curriculum remains games dominated, particularly for males,\" it said.\n\"As a result, children whose interests are in non-traditional sports and physical activities are less likely to feel engaged with PE lessons and are less likely to develop an interest that they can carry into the community setting or adulthood.\n\"Children's emotional health, physical fitness and obesity levels are resultant of a complex range of individual, family and community level factors which schools alone cannot solve.\n\"However, schools can have a direct and measurable impact on children's weight and physical wellbeing.\n\"For many children, school is the main opportunity they have for being physically active, either through PE or after-school activities.\"\nBut the paper said that many primary school teachers did not get adequate training to deliver effective PE lessons.\nGuidance from the Department of Education recommends that schools provide pupils with a minimum of two hours of PE each week.\n\"However, it is up to individual schools to decide how much time is allocated to PE and research suggests schools are falling short on achieving this, particularly in the primary years,\" the research paper said.\nPrevious studies suggest that around one in five primary pupils get less than half an hour of PE a week, while only four in 10 post-primary pupils get the recommended two hours.\n\"Commentators have argued that the absence of a 'requirement' to meet this two hour per week guideline, means that progress and change is difficult to achieve in terms of time allocation in the face of 'curriculum squeeze' where increasing focus is placed on exam outcomes,\" the assembly paper said.\nA number of programmes have been set up in schools in Northern Ireland to try to increase pupils' physical activity, including the daily mile.\nThe Curriculum Sports Programme, which is run by Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) and Irish Football Association (IFA), also runs in some primary schools.\nWhile most of the previous research the assembly report cites was carried out prior to the coronavirus pandemic, children were prohibited from playing outdoor sport for a number of months in early 2021.\nAs children were being taught remotely from December until March, PE in schools was also affected by lockdowns."

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of people infected with coronavirus in the UK has risen by as much as two-thirds, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says.\nIt estimates that around 100,000 people tested positive in the week to 29 May, or one in 660 people - up from 60,000 the previous week.\nA growing proportion looked like they were the Delta variant, first detected in India, the ONS said.\nInfections were rising most steeply in England and Wales.\nA further 6,278 confirmed cases in the UK were announced by the government in official figures on Friday, with 954 people in hospital with Covid and 11 deaths recorded. \nThis equates to a large increase in cases from a low base, but hospital admissions and deaths are down slightly compared to last week. \nIncreased testing for the so-called Indian variant, or Delta variant, as it's been named by the World Health Organization, in hotspot areas may mean this spike looks larger than it really is.\nBut the ONS data, which is not skewed by how many people come forward for tests, shows a genuine rise, with the proportion of people in England and Wales testing positive almost doubling in a week. In Wales, this is from a low bar so the ONS said it was only the \"early signs\" of an increase in cases.\nThe picture in Scotland and Northern Ireland is less clear - although Scotland has seen significant growth in infections in recent weeks. \nAt the end of May, the number of people infected was:\nWhile the ONS does not conduct genetic testing on the samples it uses to track the virus, it found a growing proportion looked like they were the Delta variant.\nThe test used to work out if someone has coronavirus looks at three of the virus's genes, one of which cannot be detected in the Kent - now named the Alpha - variant. \nHowever a rising number of the ONS's samples did test positive for that gene, suggesting it is most likely the Delta variant (but could also be the Beta or Gamma variants found in South Africa and Brazil).\nThis chimes with genetic testing (known as sequencing) published on Thursday which suggested the Delta variant was now the dominant strain in the UK. It accounted for 79% of cases confirmed by laboratory analysis in the last week.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said he couldn't \"yet conclude with any confidence that there's an impact on your risk of hospitalisation,\" with the Delta variant. \nBut he added it was \"vital to protect people at home, and play our part in making sure the world gets vaccines\". \nPaul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: \"With the information available it is too early to say for certain whether the Delta variant does indeed cause more severe disease needing hospitalisation or not. \n\"What we can be confident about with available data is that if you have had one or preferably two doses of vaccine you are rather less likely to catch either Alpha or Delta variants, and even if you do become infected you are less likely to need hospital admission.\"\nThe virus's reproduction or R number - an estimate of how many extra infections each coronavirus case will lead to - is between 1 and 1.2 in England, meaning for every 10 people infected, another 10 to 12 more will catch the virus. \nIn Scotland the R number is estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.3.

      "tags": "Asia,Coronavirus vaccines,India",
      "text": "India has ordered 300 million doses of an unapproved coronavirus vaccine amid a devastating second wave. \nThe unnamed vaccine from Indian firm Biological E is in Phase 3 trials, and had showed \"promising results\" in the first two phases, the federal government said in a statement. \nThe $206m order is the first India has signed for a jab that has not received emergency approval. \nThis comes as the country struggles to speed up its lagging vaccine drive.\nIndia has administered just over 220 million jabs so far, although much of its 1.4 billion population is now eligible for the vaccine. Less than 15% of the country has received at least one dose of the vaccination, largely because of a severe shortage of doses. \nAlthough Covid case numbers have been dropping, India is still adding more than 100,000 news cases a day. It has recorded more than 340,000 deaths from the virus so far, but experts say the number is vastly underestimated.\nIndia's federal government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been criticised for not placing huge orders ahead of time with either Indian or foreign vaccine makers. \nIndia is currently giving three vaccines - Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Covaxin, developed by Indian firm Bharat Biotech and the government's Indian Council of Medical Research, and Sputnik V, which is developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute.\nCompared to the single order from Biological E for 300 million doses, India brought about 350 million doses from both Covishield and Covaxin between January and May. \nIndia's drug regulator gave Covaxin emergency approval in January before trials were completed - data on its efficacy is yet to be released. \nThe new vaccine from Biological E is \"likely to be available in the next few months,\" according to the government. \nMr Modi's government is racing to shore up its vaccine stocks as Covid numbers dip, hoping to be well-prepared for what experts say is an inevitable third wave. \nIndia's vaccine drive, which had a promising start in January, began to slow down because vaccine hesitancy crept in as cases dropped. But numbers soon rose again in a deadly second wave that saw hospitals falling short of beds and crematoriums running short of space. \nHoping to stem the tide, the government threw open the drive in May to everyone above the age of 18 but India's two vaccine makers - Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech - could not guarantee supply at that scale. \nBut shortages persist and have also led to vast inequalities in access with rural areas, the poor and women falling behind in the line for jabs.

      "text": "Airlines are laying on extra capacity to bring people back to the UK from Portugal before the country is removed from the travel green list on Tuesday.\nBritish Airways is increasing its flights, while Tui and EasyJet are upgrading the size of their planes.\nThe move to the amber list means UK tourists should not visit the country and returnees must isolate for 10 days.\nBut travel firm Tui says 50% of passengers due to travel there in June are still planning to go.\nAny travellers scrambling for return flights before the new rules come in at 04:00 BST on 8 June are facing steep prices for tickets - with a single BA ticket from Faro to London City going for more than \u00a3540. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the decision on Portugal, which includes the islands of Madeira and the Azores, had to be made because of a rise in cases of the Delta variant, first detected in India.\n\"It was not a decision I wanted to take,\" he said. \"But we're absolutely determined to keep this country safe, especially from novel variants coming from overseas.\"\nSpeaking from a G7 health ministers' meeting in Oxford, Mr Hancock added that \"tough\" rules on international travel were also necessary to protect the success of the UK's vaccine rollout.\nHowever, Portugal's minister of foreign affairs, Augusto Santos Silva, told the BBC the UK's decision was not sufficiently justified, and that he did not understand the \"logic\" of the move - as the pandemic situations were very similar in the two countries. \nHe also stressed that Portugal had only registered 12 cases of the so-called Nepal variant, saying: \"I don't find any statistical relevance in these numbers.\"\nIt comes as the coronavirus reproduction number, or R - the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average - in England is between 1 and 1.2.\nThe latest figures show a further 11 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and another 6,238 cases have been reported.\nNo new destinations were added to the green list in the latest review, but seven countries - Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and Trinidad and Tobago - are being added to the red list. \nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have confirmed they will adopt the same changes, and the green list will be reviewed again on 28 June.\nLabour has called for the amber travel list to be scrapped altogether - or \"at the very least\" for Thailand and Vietnam to be urgently added to the red list, citing research on a variant linked to Thailand and rising cases in Vietnam, potentially as a result of a new variant.\nThe travel industry has criticised the change, saying it will threaten jobs and consumer confidence - with the boss of Heathrow Airport warning the sector faces \"another lost summer\".\nRyanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told BBC Breakfast that the decision was not \"based on any science or public health\", and that  he did not understand why the UK \"which has been so successful with vaccines\" was expecting its vaccinated citizens to quarantine.\nAlan Richards travelled to the Algarve on Saturday with seven of his family, including grandchildren, and they were due to return home on Tuesday.\nNow he says there is no possible way to get back before Portugal is moved to the amber list, costing the family hundreds of pounds in additional Covid-19 tests, keeping him from his job on the London Underground for 10 days and forcing his seven-year-old granddaughter to miss school.\n\"We're not ignorant people, we understood that there may well be a situation where if anything changes you would start having to make plans to cut short your holiday. That's acceptable,\" he says.\nBut with just five days' notice of the change, there is not enough time to book new pre-flight Covid tests and get the results before departure. Alan says he has been told there is a four-day wait just to get a test in Portugal.\nThe extra coronavirus tests they will be required to take during the 10-day quarantine will also cost \u00a3120 each, he says, adding \u00a3960 to the family's holiday bill.\nA week's notice could have allowed them to rebook travel if necessary, Alan says.\n\"No matter how you look at this, the timescales for returning are absolutely awful. We're in a frantic situation,\" he says.\n\"Mr Shapps needs to understand the awful situation that he's put hundreds of thousands of people in. He needs to resign.\"\nPortugal's change followed increased concern about a mutation of the Delta variant first identified in India, the government said.\nSome 68 cases of the Delta variant have been identified in the country, including cases with an additional so-called Nepal mutation, according to official figures.\nPublic Health England (PHE) said there were cases of the mutation in several countries, including a small number in the UK, and that it was investigating whether it could be more more transmissible and less effectively tackled by vaccines. \nThe number of positive Covid cases in Portugal has nearly doubled in the last three weeks.\nOn 2 June, Portugal had 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a little higher than the UK at 5.1 - but differences in the amount of testing being done make direct comparisons difficult.\nPHE believes the Delta variant is now dominant in the UK and that it may be linked to a higher risk of hospital admission. \nEarlier, epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson told Today that estimates suggest the Delta variant could be \"60% more transmissible\" than the previously dominant Kent variant known as Alpha.\nAsked about whether the ending of Covid restrictions in England on 21 June needed to be delayed, he said the data was pointing \"towards the direction of being cautious\".\nIn other key developments:\nAre you in Portugal?

      "tags": "United States",
      "text": "F Lee Bailey, one of the defence lawyers in the 1995 murder trial of OJ Simpson, has died aged 87.\nMr Bailey defended a host of notorious clients, including the Boston Strangler and the US army commander at the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War. \nHe was renowned for his dramatic style and his ability to throw reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. \nBut he was banned from practising law in two states and eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2016. \nHe died of unspecified causes at a hospice in Georgia on Thursday, his son Bendrix Bailey said.\nMr Bailey was part of the \"dream team\" of lawyers that defended the American football player OJ Simpson when he was charged with murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. \nHis cross-examination of a Los Angeles detective was seen as a key factor in securing a not guilty verdict. Mr Bailey argued without success that the detective had planted a crucial piece of evidence, a bloodstained glove.\nHowever, he undermined the detective's credibility with recordings that destroyed his claim not to have used racial slurs. \nMr Bailey first rose to prominence in 1966, when he succeeded in overturning the conviction of an Ohio osteopath, Dr Sam Sheppard, who had been jailed for the murder of his wife.\nThe case was the inspiration for both the film and TV series The Fugitive. \nThe following year he took on the case of Alberto De Salvo, an inmate in a secure hospital who had been charged with sexual assault. De Salvo confessed to being the Boston Strangler, responsible for the rape and murder of 13 women between 1962 and 1964. \nDe Salvo later recanted his confession but was killed in his cell in 1973. \nIn 1971, Mr Bailey successfully defended Capt Ernest Medina, who was court-martialled over the massacre of 104 people in the village of My Lai, in what was then South Vietnam. \nHe took on the case of Patricia Hearst, a newspaper heiress who was kidnapped in 1974, when she was just 19 years old, by a violent far-left group calling itself the Symbionese Liberation Army. \nMs Hearst ended up taking part in armed robberies organised by the group - Mr Bailey claimed she had been brainwashed. She was convicted and jailed for 22 months before being pardoned by President Jimmy Carter. \nMr Bailey later represented families of passengers killed in the Lockerbie bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988. \nFrancis Lee Bailey was born in the Massachusetts town of Waltham in 1933. He was admitted to Harvard but dropped out after his second year and became a pilot in the Marines. \nHe took a law degree at Boston University in 1960. \nDuring his career, he was charged with perjury and contempt of court. He was disbarred in Florida in 2001 and in Massachusetts two years later. In 2016 he filed for bankruptcy in Maine. \nThree of Mr Bailey's marriages ended in divorce and his fourth wife died in 1999. He is survived by three sons, a sister, and five grandchildren. "

      "text": "Planning a wedding has been a frustrating process for many since the first Covid lockdown in March last year.\nRules on outdoor wedding receptions now allow guest numbers to match concerts and sporting events.\nBut some in the wedding industry have branded the changes \"confusing\", while entertainers have been \"forgotten\".\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said numbers would be based on how many people can be safely accommodated.\nUnder new guidelines from Monday, there will be no limit on numbers at indoor weddings, but the figure has to be calculated following a risk assessment by venue staff.\nThirty people had previously been able to attend indoor wedding receptions.\nMr Drakeford said that rule had now been relaxed: \"At quite a number of venues across Wales, the number able to be at a wedding will be higher than it is now.\"\nOther restrictions will remain however.\nGuests have to follow social distancing rules, including wearing face masks at indoor venues when not eating or drinking while seated.\nThe bride and groom do not have to wear masks when walking down the aisle, exchanging vows, or for their first kiss and first dance.\nThey are also able to remove them for indoor photographs just of themselves, but photos should be done outdoors where possible.\nOnly the bride and groom are allowed to take part in a first dance, and no other dancing is permitted.\nBackground music can be played at a low volume during the ceremony and the reception, but no singing or chanting is allowed.\nSpeeches can be made, but guidance issued states that microphones should not be shared and gifts should not be given out during speeches.\nStephanie Hobrow, 38, from Cowbridge in Vale of Glamorgan, has set a date for her wedding to fianc\u00e9 Matt Tomkins three times in the past year.\nShe also works with wedding venues as a marketing manager.\nShe said the Welsh government's update on wedding restrictions was \"slightly confusing again\".\n\"Wedding receptions that are outdoors have now been included in the numbers of 4,000 and 10,000 capacity. So, in theory, from Monday you can get married or have your wedding reception outside with unlimited amounts of guests.\n\"At the moment, work-wise, it's just a case of dealing with each bride and groom on a case-by-case basis, depending what they want to do. We've got some venues that have outside space, some that have only got inside space.\n\"Personally, I'm just sitting it out and waiting really. There's not a lot I can do now. We should have been last September, we then moved to April and now moved it to September.\n\"Dress is done, venue is done, flowers are done, band is done... it's just the evening part that's the uncertain bit at the moment.\n\"If there's the option to have possibly unlimited numbers now for a reception that's outside, I think people would be crazy to not explore that avenue.\"\nWedding DJ Matt Lane from Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, said: \"When the first lockdown started, all my brides and grooms postponed, most of them for either later on in the year or 2021.\n\"But the further we get into this year, they're all postponing again and it just keeps getting pushed back. My last wedding was March 2020. I haven't done a wedding since, people don't want to go ahead with it because they can't have the numbers they want. \n\"At the moment you can only have background music, the bride and groom can get up for the first dance, then after that everyone else has to sit back down, so everything's moving to 2022 now.\n\"How long before people decide they're not going to do it and cancel altogether?\"\nHe added that the entertainment industry had been \"forgotten about\", while pubs and restaurants reopened.\n\"I've been able to get some of the grants available, but it's nothing compared to what I've lost - I've lost thousands, I'd usually do around 30 weddings a year,\" he said.\n\"As a wedding supplier we're basically forced to shut down. There should have been more help for entertainers.\"\nPaul Rees and Yvonne Inglis from Pontardawe, Neath Port Talbot, had excitedly booked a secret wedding venue for 9 July, to be followed by a big party with their loved ones and a luxury honeymoon abroad.\nBut after Covid \"rolled on and on\" and they both experienced health scares, they have scaled back their plans to have a \"registry office job\" in four weeks' time. And they couldn't be happier.\n\"I think what happened was Covid actually brought it home, we both had health issues and we sat down and said why don't we just do it?\" said Mr Rees. \n\"So we've decided on the registry office and then we're having a very small reception, just with our children. The restaurant is where next year's big party will be. \n\"For our plan B honeymoon - we had booked this fabulous all-inclusive in Turkey - we're doing three days in Windermere at this spa hotel right on the shores of Windermere and then we're going up to Edinburgh the rest of the week, where Yvonne is from, and it gives us the opportunity to see her family.\n\"Out of disaster we've kind of rescued it, so we're really excited. We had to look at it very pragmatically. Given that we'd both been ill we decided we are going to get married come what may.\n\"Both Yvonne and I had Covid just before Christmas. I was significantly worse than Yvonne, but we were both really really ill. At the same time, she had an issue where she was getting pains down one side and the first thing she thought was a heart issue. We had that investigated and it was nothing.\n\"I'm 63, Yvonne is 55. At our time of life, we'd both had health scares, there's nothing to say that won't happen again, so why don't we just get married?\"\nMr Drakeford said he could \"understand and sympathise\" with those planning a wedding about the continued limitations on indoor gatherings, but his decision was based on the science, which suggested the chances of catching coronavirus indoors was 15 to 20 times higher than in outdoor settings.\n\"The distinction that we have made all the way through with outdoors being better than indoors has now been confirmed from data from around the world,\" he told the coronavirus briefing on Friday.\nHe added that outdoor wedding receptions would be subjected to the same restrictions as other outdoor events and restrictions on numbers in indoor settings would be reviewed in the coming weeks."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Kathmandu,Nepal,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nepal's prime minister has made an urgent plea for vaccines to his UK counterpart Boris Johnson, as the Himalayan nation experiences a devastating second wave of coronavirus.\nSpeaking to the BBC, KP Sharma Oli said it was Britain's responsibility given the historic ties the nations share.\nMr Oli said the sacrifices of Nepal's Gurkha soldiers serving the UK should make Nepal a priority for UK Covid aid.\nNepal reported a high of 9,000 daily infections last month.\n\"I want to convince the UK Government, particularly Prime Minister Boris Johnson, about the situation in Nepal and how we are suffering,\" Mr Oli said. \nNepal, which has one of the highest rates of positive tests in the world, saw a surge of cases in May, recording more than 4,000 deaths over the course of the month. \nLike its neighbour India, Nepal has struggled with shortages of beds and oxygen supplies. The situation has eased recently in places like the capital Kathmandu, but the virus is now spreading in rural areas.\nAt the start of February, Nepal was reporting around 100 daily cases, but by early May that figure had jumped to as many as 9,000 daily infections. A national lockdown which began in April remains in place but many say it came too late.\nThe country's borders with India remain open. Critics say that failing to close them allowed the Delta variant detected in India to spread quickly into Nepal as migrant workers returned home. \nThe Himalayan country has received some international aid, including 260 ventilators and 2,000 PPE kits from the UK. But Mr Oli said it was vaccines he needed. Fewer than 3% of Nepal's population of 30 million has been fully vaccinated.  \n\"If we vaccinate people, then we can control Covid-19, otherwise it will be hard for us,\" Mr Oli said.\nNepalese authorities have ordered supplies from China, but many elderly Nepalis who received their first dose of the Astrazeneca jab are now unable to get their second, after supplies promised from India were delayed because of the crisis there. \nPrime Minister Oli said he was making the direct appeal to the UK, as Nepal's \"oldest friend\".\n\"The Gurkhas have served the UK for many years, keeping their lives at risk,\" he said. \"People who are serving in Britain have their families in Nepal. So that is a very deep connection.\"\nA spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office told the BBC it \"stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Nepal during this pandemic\" and was \"one of the first countries to send health experts and life-saving medical equipment to Nepal\".\n\"The UK is a leading donor to COVAX, the international initiative to procure and distribute vaccines equitably,\" the spokesperson added. \"We have committed \u00a3548 million to the scheme that will provide more than a billion vaccines to developing countries, including Nepal, this year.\"\nMr Oli said his country's foreign minister had spoken to UK counterpart Dominic Raab to discuss the issue, but he was trying to establish direct telephone contact with Mr Johnson.\nThe appeal to the UK comes as the US has announced it will send vaccines to Nepal as part of a donation of 7 million doses to Asia. \nMr Oli has faced criticism of his handling of the pandemic and for failing to take the virus seriously. He previously claimed that it could be washed away by gargling guava leaves and turmeric, and said Nepali's have stronger immune systems because of their diets. \nLast month, as case numbers were rising sharply, he said the situation in Nepal was \"under control\".\nPrime Minister Oli, who remains in power after a recent vote of no confidence, also drew criticism for holding mass political rallies earlier this year as MPs in his own party withdrew support for him."

The Department of Health has yet to confirm how many other workplaces are in the pilot scheme.\nThe daily Covid test scheme is an extension of the workplace testing that previously ran as a pilot. It may be extended to people with the NHS Test and Trace app in future.\nAfter being notified by Test and Trace on Thursday - four days after he returned from Portugal - Mr Gove left a meeting he was attending with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak in Downing Street.\nThe three men had been discussing ways of recovering from the pandemic with the first ministers of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland with the prime minister via video link.\nMr Gove's spokesperson said: \"The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is participating in the daily contact testing programme after being advised to isolate today (Thursday) by NHS Test and Trace.\"\nThe Champions League football final between Chelsea and Manchester City took place in Porto on 29 May, with 6,000 fans from each club able to attend. \nOne Chelsea fan, who wished to remain anonymous, was on the same flight as Mr Gove. He told the BBC he received a text via Test and Trace on Thursday saying he had been exposed to the virus on the Sunday and should self-isolate for 10 days.\nHe added that he had heard of other football fans who had also been told to self-isolate after returning from Portugal.\nLabour's shadow sports minister Alison McGovern suggested it was unfair that, unlike Mr Gove, fans had to fully self-isolate asking \"doesn't that sound like one rule for him and one rule for everybody else?\"\nAt the time of the game Portugal had been on England's green list, meaning fans could attend without having to quarantine on their return.\nHowever, the UK government has announced it would be relegating Portugal to the amber list on Tuesday, following a doubling of infection rates since the previous travel review.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,G7 summits,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There are fresh calls for the UK to show \"historic leadership\" and start sharing its vaccine doses with the world right now.  \nThe country is hosting this year's G7 summit, where seven of the world's most powerful countries will come together in Cornwall next week. The Covid pandemic will be high on the agenda.\nIn an open letter to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the heads of the Wellcome Trust and Unicef in the UK are warning that hard earned freedoms in the country will be \"short lived\" if enough people in other countries are not vaccinated too. \nThe letter says decisions at the summit \"will define the 21st Century\", and calls on Mr Johnson and other G7 leaders to \"rise to this challenge and end this crisis for good\".\nThe UK says it has no surplus supplies to share at the moment, but will donate doses when it does.  \nBut Unicef says the UK and the other G7 countries could share 20% of their supplies in the next three months without impacting their own domestic rollouts.\nEver since India stopped exporting Covid vaccines because of the crisis there, countries in Africa have been counting down their last doses. \n\"It is deeply unfair,\" says Dr Phionah Atuhebwe, who is in charge of new vaccine introductions for the World Health Organization (WHO) in Africa.  \n\"Of the almost two billion doses that have been administered globally, sub-Saharan Africa has received about 1% of all these vaccines.\" \nShe says 18 African countries have either already run out of doses or are about to, including: \nIt's a massive blow to many low and middle income countries. \nIn Ghana, there's been a very successful rollout of the first dose of vaccines for the most at risk groups, including health workers. Their second doses are now due - but officials are unclear on when they will arrive. \nMeanwhile, richer countries have bought up the lion's share of global supplies and are pushing full steam ahead with their vaccination programmes, now administering doses to much lower-risk groups including teenagers.  \nThe UK, US and Canada have vaccinated more than half of their populations, while in Germany, Italy and France the numbers are over 30%. \nJapan's uptake has been much slower, but not because they're short on supplies.\nWhereas some countries in Africa have yet to vaccinate a single person, including health workers looking after Covid patients on the front line.  \nThe international vaccine equality scheme Covax, which is providing vaccines to some of the world's poorest countries, is currently 190 million doses short.  \nIn the open letter, Wellcome's Prof Sir Jeremy Farrar and Unicef UK's Steven Waugh said that because high income countries - including the UK and G7 - have most of the world's Covid vaccine supplies, they \"are the only ones who can makes doses available right now\".   \nWellcome and Unicef UK are calling for G7 countries to donate 20% of their doses in June, July and August to help plug the massive gap.  \nFor the month of June that works out as:\nSOURCE: Airfinity/ Unicef \n\"If we do not get\u2026 doses, we get back to the virus circulating and possibly mutating yet again, coming up with new variants that affect the world and take us all back to square zero,\" says Dr Atuhebwe.  \nSo far France and New Zealand are the only nations to have already started diverting some of their own supplies to poorer countries.    \nBoris Johnson promised to donate the UK's surplus doses three months ago.\nIn the open letter, the authors called on the prime minister to \"make that pledge a reality\".\nBut speaking at the G7 health ministers meeting in Oxford this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there were no plans to do that, yet.  \n\"The UK vaccination programme has very much been based on delivering vaccines as soon as they're delivered to us,\" he said.  \n\"So we don't have excess doses at the moment. But absolutely we want to lean in to this global effort, when there is spare capacity.\" \nIn the latest round of pledges this week, countries have promised another $2.4bn (\u00a31.7bn) to the Covax scheme to help get vaccines into poorer countries. \nBut with manufacturing unable to keep up with demand, and a few rich countries hoarding current supplies - it's the world's poorest who remain last in line. \nThat in turn could mean deadlier versions of a mutated version of Covid-19 ending up back on the shores of wealthier nations.\nFollow @tulipmazumdar on Twitter"

      "tags": "Tax,Trump tariffs,Rishi Sunak",
      "text": " A global agreement to end the \"race to the bottom\" on corporate taxation is within sight, according to the French and German finance ministers.\nFrance's Bruno le Maire told the BBC the G7 club of rich nations were \"just one millimetre away from a historic agreement\" on a global minimum rate.\nHe urged low tax states like Ireland to back a deal which would target tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft.\nThe German finance minister said a 15% rate would help pay back Covid debt\nTax on big tech and multi-nationals has been a source of friction between the US and fellow G7 countries such as the UK.\nGerman finance minister Olaf Scholz said it was important to stop the world's biggest companies from dodging tax.\nHe said it was \"absolutely necessary\" to reach a deal in order to \"get out of this race to the bottom we see with taxes today\u2026especially after the Covid crisis and all the money we spent to defend the health of the people, and to defend the economy.\"\nMr Le Maire also urged Ireland, which has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the European Union, at 12.5%, to get \"on board\".\nHe added: \"European countries, that in the past, opposed this new international tax system, must understand that they have to give the agreement to this major breakthrough\".\nBoth ministers said agreement on a minimum rate remained a sticking point.\nMr Le Maire said he saw the 15% rate as a \"starting point\". \nHe said: \"If it can be higher, it is better to have a higher rate than 15%.\"\nHowever, Mr Scholz suggested that 15% would be an effective starting point that would mark a \"turning point\" after years of going in the other direction.\nIt came after UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak says he was \"confident\" of reaching a global agreement on digital taxation ahead of a meeting of world finance leaders.\nFinance minsters will also discuss climate change at the two day meeting which starts in London on Friday.\nAhead of the G7 talks, starting in London on Friday, Mr Le Maire and Mr Scholz along with their counterparts in Italy and Spain co-signed a letter urging an agreement on an international tax system \"fit for the 21st Century\".  \nIn a letter to The Guardian, they wrote: \"Introducing this fairer and more efficient international tax system was already a priority before the current economic crisis, and it will be all the more necessary coming out of it.\"\nThose attending the G7 finance ministers summit are certain that a deal will be done on global taxation by Saturday morning - and they are not shy about its \"historic nature\". Mr Scholz told me they'll \"have an agreement which will really change the world... this will be a turning point in global co-operation\". \nAnother finance minister said privately the deal will start to set the rules for the 21st Century, because if the Western G7 democracies were incapable of doing it, then China would. \nThe UK's turnaround on minimum tax rates is quite something. Successive elections have been fought on the danger of corporation tax hikes to jobs and investment. Now, not only is that policy, but the UK looks set up to have overseen an agreement to limit the extent to which a future chancellor could cut it.\nThere are two sticking points, sources tell me. Firstly, there is the mention (or not) of a global minimum corporation tax rate of 15%. There is also a move to use the wording \"at least 15%\" to show some ambition - but also to provide some negotiation space at the wider G20 meeting chaired by Italy and including the likes of China and Russia. \nThe US also asked countries that have levied digital taxes - France, Italy and the UK, to withdraw them quickly as part of the deal. At least one finance minister said that was a \"non-starter\", as it could immediately result in the big tech giants paying less, not more tax. \nThe end result will depend on fine detail, but looks likely to involve a new ability to charge 100 or so of the world's largest companies based on where their sales are, not where they house the factories or patents and trademarks. \nThis could be transformative, and not just for Big Tech, but some more conventional multinationals.\nOn Wednesday, the US announced it would impose tariffs on about $2bn (\u00a31.4bn) of imports, including certain goods from the UK, in retaliation for taxes on big US tech firms.\nHowever, it suspended them for 180 days to allow further talks to take place in London and at a meeting of G20 nations in July.\nMr Sunak is expected to push for an agreement on taxes and call for all global businesses to commit to climate reporting.\nSpeaking ahead of the G7 meeting, Mr Sunak said: \"Securing a global agreement on digital taxation has also been a key priority this year - we want companies to pay the right amount of tax in the right place, and I hope we can reach a fair deal with our partners.\n\"I'm determined we work together and unite to tackle the world's most pressing economic challenges - and I'm hugely optimistic that we will deliver some concrete outcomes this weekend.\"\nThe ministers will be looking at how to stop the likes of Google, Amazon, Starbucks and Apple paying low or no taxes in countries where they generate revenues.\nThe meeting is being held as it emerged that an Irish subsidiary of US technology giant Microsoft paid no corporation tax on $315bn in profit it made last year, according to The Guardian.\nMicrosoft Round Island One is resident in Bermuda and the profit it generated last year is equal to nearly three-quarters of Ireland's GDP.\nMicrosoft said this was  due to \"a one-time event and reflects an inter-company reorganisation, not a cash gain\". \n\"Our organisational and tax structure reflects our complex global business. We are fully compliant with all local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate,\" a spokesperson added.\nAll G7 countries, bar the UK, have supported a proposal from the US for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% that could raise $50-$80bn for governments around the world.\nGermany, France, Italy and Spain said the commitment to a minimum 15% tax rate is \"a promising start\" but said G7 nations must reach \"a common position on a new international tax system\" in London before more nations meet next month.\nThey wrote: \"We are confident it will create the momentum needed to reach a global agreement at the G20 in Venice in July. It is within our reach. Let's make sure it happens. We owe it to our citizens.\"\nThe UK is holding out for reassurances about the Digital Services Tax, which levies 2% on revenues derived in the UK from online marketplaces, search engines and social media platforms.\nIt is open to the idea of a global corporate minimum tax rate and is said to be prepared to let the Digital Services Tax go if it obtains assurances that big tech will not simply be let off the hook.\nThe Biden administration initially pushed for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 21% but has now retreated to 15%. However, officials have said that's regarded very much as a \"floor\".\nFinance ministers from the US, Japan, France, Canada, Germany and Italy will be attending the meeting at Lancaster House, along with representatives from the European Commission, the Eurogroup, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development."

Some tell the BBC of cancelled holidays, wasted money and family visits postponed once again.\nKerry, a photographer from the Wirral, says her family - like many others - have had \"the year from hell\".  \nHer partner has been shielding for over a year due to an auto-immune disease, Kerry has had to nurse her mother through Covid-19 and a stroke, and her 18-month old son has hardly known a world without a pandemic.\nShe was just about to book a trip to Portugal, one of the few tourist destinations where quarantine-free travel was allowed, when the rules changed.\nFrom 04:00 BST on Tuesday, it will join the amber list, meaning holidaymakers should not visit and arrivals must self-isolate for 10 days.\nKerry says: \"This holiday was everything for us our first with our baby who has had no experiences in his first 18 months on this planet.\"\nKerry says there are countries with low rates of infection but the government refuses to \"let us holiday and live our life\", even when many people are fully vaccinated.\nRachel Richmond, from Edinburgh, also expects to be fully vaccinated by the time of her two-week trip to Portugal in early July, booked just last week.\n\"What is the point of being vaccinated if you cannot go anywhere?\u00a0It is so utterly frustrating and so unfair,\" she says.\nShe feels the government keeps \"shifting the goalposts on travel\", raising the hopes of people who follow the rules only to dash them a few weeks later.\nAlthough travel to Portugal will still be legally permitted for people willing to quarantine on their return, some people - like Paul Modley and his partner, Tom Griffith, from London - say they are cancelling their trip.\n\"It doesn't feel responsible\" to travel anyway, Paul says, adding: \"Neither of us are really up for doing quarantine for 10 days when we come back.\"\nThe couple will lose \u00a3360 spent on PCR tests to travel. They do not yet know if the airline or accommodation provider will give them a refund.\nPaul, 54, says he booked out of \"hope\" that they would be able to get away and relax after the stresses of the last 15 months.\nThe suspense of waiting to hear if they had a negative test had already meant it was \"not the most relaxing start or preparation for a holiday.\"\nBut he says: \"It was worth a punt.\" \nFor others, the news that the green list status might be revoked came when they were already in Portugal - in the case of Mervyn Dinnen, just as he landed at Faro airport in the Algarve from Gatwick.\nIt's not the first time he's experienced a travel U-turn from the UK government, having previously been in the Canary Islands in December when quarantine requirements were imposed.\nArriving on a plane more-or-less full of Britons to a hotel full of Britons, he says most people seem determined to make the most of their holiday.\n\"I had a lovely lunch, I've got a beer here, the sun is shining. I feel relaxed even though what's happened has completely thrown my plans into disarray,\" he says.\nBut he says the fact that thousands of football fans were able to travel to Portugal for the Champions League final on 29 May sent a signal that it was safe for others to make the trip and it was \"frustrating\" to see that change within a week.\nAlthough Portugal is a major tourist destination with about 2.5 million UK visitors before the pandemic, it is not only holiday plans that are being disrupted.\nStephanie Price, from Burnley, has tried five times to visit her family in Portugal after originally booking in 2019, each time being forced to rearrange due to the pandemic.\n\"I have worked all through lockdown and was looking forward to getting away to see my family,\" she says.\nShe says she has had both vaccinations and the virus is \"here to stay\" so people should not be \"confined to misery\" without being able to travel.\nPortugal's coronavirus infections are much higher in the north and centre than in southern regions such as the Algarve, she says, and the travel policy should reflect that.\nSome people are refusing to let the change to the travel list stop them, however.\nOne man, who is due to fly from London to Portugal on Saturday to stay in an AirBnB, says he may consider rebooking for another destination - but the need for a negative test in the 72 hours before travel means the options are limited. \nInstead, he tells the BBC he is \"leaning towards\" heading on the Portugal trip anyway \"because it is still legal\".\n\"Unless they say, you must not go, you will be fined if you go, we might well still go and just have to bear the additional costs of an extra PCR test and the fact that we have to quarantine,\" he says."

      "tags": "Yair Lapid,Israel,Naftali Bennett,Benjamin Netanyahu",
      "text": "Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu has lashed out at a newly agreed coalition which looks set to remove him from power after 12 years as prime minister.\nMr Netanyahu called on right-wing members of parliament to block the coalition from taking office.\nEight parties reached an agreement to work together to form a new government late on Wednesday.\nBut the group, from across Israel's political spectrum, still needs parliamentary backing to take office.\nNo date has so far been set for such a vote in the Knesset (parliament). But it is expected to take place next week at the latest, and there is still a chance this newly formed coalition could be upended by defections.\nIn his first comments since the coalition was announced, Mr Netanyahu urged members of the Knesset \"elected by votes from the right\" to oppose the coalition.\nIn a post on Twitter, he criticised them as \"left-wing\" and \"dangerous\". He has previously called the proposed new government the \"fraud of the century\", saying it endangered the state and people of Israel.\nObservers have already noted that Mr Netanyahu - who failed to form his own coalition despite his Likud party winning the most seats in the March vote - is likely to try to prevent the group getting the support it needs.\nNews of a fresh coalition emerged late on Wednesday, when Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, called President Reuven Rivlin to let him know that agreement had been reached. \nHe pledged to form a government which would \"work in the service of all Israeli citizens... respect its opponents and do everything in its power to unite and connect all parts of Israeli society\".\nHowever, Mr Lapid will not become prime minister immediately. Under a rotation arrangement, the head of the right-wing Yamina party, Naftali Bennett, would serve as prime minister first before handing over to Mr Lapid in August 2023.\nThe coalition members span the full spectrum of Israeli politics with little in common apart from their plan to replace Mr Netanyahu. For the first time in decades, the government will include an Israeli Arab party. \nAn image carried on Israeli media showed Mr Lapid, Mr Bennett and Mansour Abbas, leader of the Arab Islamist Raam party, signing the agreement, a deal many thought impossible.\nThe other five parties included in the agreement are:\nIf the coalition fails to win the support of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset, there is a risk of a fifth election in two years. All eight parties were needed to secure the 61-seat majority. \nNo rational political enemy of Benjamin Netanyahu can underestimate his ruthlessness and absolute determination to hold on to office. Until a new government with a new prime minister is sworn in, he will do all he can to stop it. \nIf he found himself leader of the opposition, he would do all he could to destabilise a coalition with a wafer-thin majority that would be trying to span the entire Israeli spectrum, from the nationalist right to the liberal left. All that unites them is their desire to remove him from office. \nHowever loudly he complains, the likelihood is that he is leaving office. In the end his defeat was sealed not by left-wing opponents but by fellow right-wingers he has made into enemies by his ruthless, high-handed tactics. \nNo-one should expect big, new initiatives from a new government. Just surviving the onslaught Mr Netanyahu is undoubtedly planning will be a full-time job. His opponents will be hoping that his fall will continue in the Jerusalem courthouse where he is already on trial on serious corruption charges.\nReaction to the agreement has been mixed. According to news agency AFP, other parties representing Israeli Arabs - who make up 20% of the population - have said they will oppose a government led by Mr Bennett, who rejects the concept of a Palestinian state.\nMeanwhile, right-wing politicians have also voiced concerns. \"The left is celebrating but it is a very sad day for the State of Israel,\" Miki Zohar, a prominent Likud member wrote on Twitter, saying the right-wing parties in the coalition \"should be ashamed\".\nBut elsewhere there was jubilation. Protesters who had been demanding Mr Netanyahu's resignation danced in the street.\nSome were just relieved at the prospect of an end to the political turmoil which has seen Israel hold four elections in just two years as politicians struggled to find someone to unite behind.\n\"I think that the political situation has been deadlocked for too long,\" protester Zvi Yosef told Reuters news agency. \"We have to try something new, even though it's a little bit scary and there's a lot of unknowns. But at the moment, I don't see any other option.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Millions of people in Scotland have moved into lower restriction levels, allowing them to meet in larger groups indoors and outside. \nIn Glasgow people are allowed to meet in each other's homes for the first time in nine months, and to drink alcohol in pub and restaurants.\nOther areas of the mainland are seeing soft play centres open for the first time in more than a year.\nBut restrictions on many of Scotland's islands are nearest \"normality\". \nOrkney, Shetland and the Western Isles have moved into level zero - the lowest of the Scottish government's five tier system for exiting lockdown. \nFourteen council areas in the north and south of mainland Scotland moved from level two to level one at midnight. \nHowever 13 areas with a combined population of 2.3million in the central belt remain in level two, rather than moving down to level one as planned due to high case numbers. \nThe whole country is due to move to level zero on 28 June but the prevalence of the Delta variant, first detected in India, may delay that.\nInfections have more than tripled in the past month with Friday's 992 new cases being the highest figure reported since 17 February. There were 860 new cases reported on Saturday. \nScotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said public health advisors were \"little bit worried\" and the country had to be \"cautious\" in its route out of lockdown. \nIn Glasgow, where residents and businesses have faced the toughest restrictions in Scotland for almost nine months, pubs and restaurants are opening later in the evenings and serving alcohol indoors again. \nSteve Aitken of Fl\u00f9r in Partick told BBC Scotland of his relief at being able to finally allow customers to drink alcohol inside. \n\"There's been a lot of ups and downs, a lot of times when we've felt like chucking it but now we've finally got the doors open, we've got some people inside, it's going to be amazing,\" he said. \nThe bar operated as a takeaway/bottle shop during lockdown but now he is hopeful for the future. \n\"Probably the biggest worry is another spike and another lockdown but hopefully with the vaccine and everyone playing the game, we won't have that,\" he added.\nCustomer Danny Whelen said: \"It feels like a lifetime ago the last time we could be indoors and enjoying drinks. I'm delighted - happy to be back.\"\nBob McVitie, of Inverclyde Leisure, said it was great to welcome back staff and customers to soft play for the first time in 440 days after the region moved to level one. \n\"I think it all gives us a little bit of hope that lockdown's easing and there's a bright future ahead,\" he said.  \nCustomer Monica Miller said it was the first time her young son, Blair, had been to the facility. \n\"It's wonderful experience... a small bit of normality back into life for us, to let him be among other kids, run about and have a bit of freedom.\"\nScotland's councils will be in the following levels from Saturday:\nLevel two - Glasgow, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Dundee, East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, North Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, East Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, Clackmannanshire, and Stirling\nLevel one - Highland, Argyll and Bute, Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire, Moray, Angus, Perth and Kinross, Falkirk, Fife, Inverclyde, East Lothian, West Lothian, West Dunbartonshire, Dumfries and Galloway, and the Borders\nLevel zero - Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles, and a number of smaller islands\nMeanwhile in Orkney the move to level zero means up to 10 people from four households can meet in a cafe, pub or restaurant. \nRaymond Hutchison, from the St Ola Hotel in Kirkwall, said it was a welcome boost to businesses on the islands.\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"What's more exciting for me is that we've got into level zero now at the start of June.\n\"So does that mean we can get to the next level, which is what we need, as early as the end of the month? That would be fantastic.\"\nBut the leader of Orkney Islands Council, James Stockan, also urged caution as increasing numbers of tourists visit the islands over the summer.\n\"It's the direction of travel that's really important. At the same time we've got to be very conscious that we have more and more people coming here,\" he told the BBC.\n\"We're really asking them to take a lateral flow test - and even our own community going away and coming back again. Just taking those tests to give us an extra degree of safety.\"\nOutside the central belt most of the mainland now faces level one restrictions.\nThe change to personal freedoms which comes from a move down from level two is not dramatic, but it does change the mood. The knowledge that it is possible to meet more friends and family members can lift spirits.\nIn Campbeltown this morning, for instance, the atmosphere seems much more relaxed almost - for want of a better phrase - normal.\nCustomers in shops still have to wear masks, of course, while cafes still have to take details from diners.\nBut mainland Argyll and Bute now has lighter restrictions than at any time since March 2020.\nIn much of rural Scotland tourism is hugely important to the economy and the stakes will be high for many businesses.\nBut in some rural areas there is a little nervousness too.\nOften these areas have had very low Covid rates all through the crisis. Some local people may be worried that reopening travel risks a rise in case numbers - despite optimism that vaccination is breaking the link between cases and serious illnesses.\nThat perhaps serves as a reminder to visitors to follow the rules and be mindful that some local people, who may seem like they are being over-vigilant, might be a little worried.\nAfter so long, finding a form of normal is about more than the legal easing of restrictions."

      "text": "The UK regulator has approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15, saying it is safe and effective in this age group and the benefits outweigh any risks.\nThe MHRA said it had carried out a \"rigorous review\" of the vaccine in adolescents.\nThe UK's vaccines committee will now decide whether children should get the jab.\nThe Pfizer vaccine is already approved for use in people aged 16 and over.\nDr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the safety of the vaccine in 12 to 15-year-olds would be carefully monitored.\n\"No extension to an authorisation would be approved unless the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been met,\" she said.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) must now advise government on whether this age group should be vaccinated as part of the UK rollout.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it would be \"guided by the expert advisers and will update in due course\".\nThe Health Secretary Matt Hancock said any decision would be \"clinically based\". He confirmed that the UK had enough supplies to vaccinate children if recommended to by the JCVI.\nAt present, there is no routine vaccination of under 18s against Covid in the UK.\nHowever, current advice is that 16 to 18-years-old who are in a priority group or who live in the same house as someone who is extremely vulnerable, should be offered a Covid vaccine.\nIn general, children's risk of becoming ill with Covid-19 is extremely low and they very rarely need hospital treatment, which is why the focus has been on vaccinating adults, who are more at risk. But the question of whether to protect children is now gathering pace. \nThe EU recently approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 12 to 15-year-olds, and the US and Canada started vaccinating children in this age group earlier this month.\nGermany has indicated it will start vaccinating children over 12 from 7 June.\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the JCVI, said there were lots of complex issues to consider in the UK, including the potential disruption to children's education if cases continued to rise in unvaccinated schoolchildren.\nBut he said the immediate question was \"what to do with the vaccines we have got - if we give them to 12 to 15-year-olds, then we are not giving to other adults who may be more at risk\", he told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme.\nProf Finn said Israel had managed to keep cases low by vaccinating their entire adult population, meaning they did not need to vaccinate children. \nBut the director of public health in Blackburn with Darwen has called for 12 to 18-year-olds to be vaccinated as quickly as possible to help shut down the transmission of the variant first identified in India, known as the Delta variant.\nProf Russell Viner, professor of adolescent health at University College London, said decisions about vaccinating all teenagers should also take potential side effects into account.\n\"The early reports about myocarditis [inflammation of the heart muscle] in young men need to be properly investigated and may not be related to the Pfizer vaccine, however they provide a warning that we should not rush into these decisions.\"\nAlongside the regulator, a UK independent advisory group also analysed data on the quality, effectiveness and safety of the vaccine in adolescents against any potential risk of side effects.\nThe Commission on Human Medicines concluded that \"its benefits outweigh any risk\".\nThe data is based on more than 2,000 children aged 12 to 15-years-old who took part in US trials of the Pfizer vaccine. There were no cases of Covid from a week after the second dose - compared to 16 cases in the placebo group, and the vaccine appeared to work as well in adolescents as in young adults aged 16-25.\nThe vaccine's side effects were usually mild or moderate, including tiredness, headaches, muscle and joint pain, and improved within a few days.\nAdditional safety data from 600,000 adolescents in the US who have had the vaccine will be available soon.\nBut some argue there are ethical issues over vaccinating children that have to be considered too.\n\"We urgently need to increase the supply of the vaccine to vulnerable people at high risk in countries with the greatest need,\" said Prof Dominic Wilkinson, consultant paediatrician and professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford.\n\"It is unethical to give vaccines to people at very low risk in our own country when there are others overseas at much higher risk who are dying.\"\nHalf of the UK adult population has now been fully vaccinated, a quarter has had one dose and the other quarter - around 13 million people - is yet to be vaccinated."

Hospitality and events firms have been struggling to get the staff they need to cope with a post-lockdown surge in demand.\nSome are warning of a staffing crisis this summer, partly caused by gaps left by EU workers who have returned home because of Brexit and the pandemic.\nThe survey's authors say skills and labour shortages, that already existed before the pandemic, are now the most pressing issue in the jobs market.\nThis means many employers will need to look at the wages and benefits they offer at a time when they're still struggling to financially recover from the last 14 months.\nThe jobs market \"seems to be firing on all cylinders\" said KPMG partner Claire Warnes.\n\"But the deterioration in staff supply intensified this month... This is a worrying trend,\" she added.\nShe called for government and firms to \"urgently address the skills gap\".\nKate Shoesmith, deputy chief executive of the Recruitment & Employment Confederation (REC), said: \"With demand spiking, the skills and labour shortages that already existed in the UK have come into sharper focus - and Covid has only made them worse.\n\"This is the most pressing issue in the jobs market right now, and has the potential to slow down the recovery.\" \nA government spokesperson said: \"Our multi-billion pound plan for jobs, including the Kickstart scheme, is supporting employers across the country to create jobs and help jobseekers get the skills and experience needed to develop their careers and fulfil roles for years to come.\n\"Additionally, we have increased the apprenticeship hiring incentive to \u00a33,000 per new apprentice hire and our lifetime skills guarantee - worth the equivalent of around \u00a33,400 per person - ensures all adults can gain new skills and qualifications.\""

      "text": "\"I felt like the scum of the earth,\" said Jade, after her third child was taken into care. \"Everybody's looking down on you, you've just had a baby and they're taking it away from you.\"\nJade - not her real name - had her first two children taken into care. \nShe knew she might lose the third - but didn't expect to be summoned to a family court hearing just a couple of days after the baby was born.\nShe is one of many mums who feel they did not have time to prepare for court.\nHer comments come as a new report obtained exclusively by the BBC has recommended a \"wholesale review\" of how care proceedings in England and Wales are conducted at birth, and warns that current practice might compromise parents' human rights. \nIt also found that a mother's chances of having a care application made for her baby very shortly after it is born were far greater in the north-east of England and Yorkshire, than in London.\nCare order applications are usually made when social workers decide a mother is unable to look after her child on her own. The baby will probably go into foster care and it may be adopted.\nThe former head of the Family Court, Sir James Munby, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the report's findings revealed a \"deeply troubling postcode lottery\" . \nSir James is now chair of the Nuffield Family Justice Observatory, which released the report.\nThe research is based on eight years of court data involving more than 21,000 babies in England and Wales.\nIt found there were more of these applications to take newborn babies into care than eight years ago. \nAnd it found these applications were increasingly issued at very short notice. \nThe report says most care applications for newborns - babies under two weeks - offer seven days' notice or less, with the majority of these with one or two days' notice. This means that the mother has very little time to prepare for a hearing. \nThe researchers also found significant variation between local authorities. \nIn the north-east of England, the data indicated many more newborn babies were being taken in to care - rising from 34 per 10,000 live births in 2012/13 to 83.1 per 10,000 in 2019/20. \nAnd more of these applications were being made at the shortest possible notice - 41% were \"same day\" applications.\nIn London, by contrast, there were far fewer applications to take newborns into care: 24.9 newborn babies per 10,000 live births in 2019/20. And less than 10% of these were same day applications.\nSir James added that more research was needed, saying: \"We now know what is happening but we know far too little about why.\"\nHe said he believed the current approach was leading to miscarriages of justice over the removal of newborns, based on \"what I have seen, what I have heard from others what I have read about and a substantial amount of anecdotal material\".\nIn the case of Jade, who is from the north-west of England but wished to remain anonymous, she said she was still bleeding and dressed in jogging bottoms and a T-shirt when she went to court.\nShe said she could not bring herself to go into the courtroom, but sat outside, feeling \"like the scum of the earth\".\nJade said she had only spoken briefly to her allocated solicitor, and did not know how to argue against the local authority's care application. \nShe returned, dazed, to the hospital, only to discover her daughter had already been taken away.\n\"I went into the ward, into the room and she was gone. And I was told to stay there, until someone came to get me. I looked out of the window and in the car park I could see the social worker taking her in her babyseat to the car. \"\nFor Jade, as for so many mothers in a similar position, it was as though her daughter had died. \"I think about her every day,\" she said. \"I grieve.\"\nAnother mother, Tasia - not her real name, from London, was devastated when, six months pregnant, she learned the local authority were going to take her baby into care. \"It was the last thing I was expecting,\" she said.\nShe was called to court eight days after her son's birth - but the hospital reported she'd taken excellent care of her son. \nThe judge decided they should go to a specialist mother and baby centre. \n\"It was frankly a miracle that the judge decided on very little evidence to give me a chance. I am incredibly incredibly grateful for the opportunity to have gone there. \"\nShe stayed for six months, kept her son, her life is now back on track: she hopes for a career in social care.\nProf Karen Broadhurst, one of the lead authors of the report, said: \"The statistics require us to look much more deeply into this issue.\"\nProf Broadhurst said this wasn't an argument against safeguarding or protecting babies - but about enabling parents to fairly participate in the process. \n\"It's a request for greater humanity. It's harsh enough to remove a baby at birth. So all the more reason why we need to strive for the fairest possible process.\"\nFamily Court judges have been worried about increasing numbers of these short notice cases. \nA working group set up by the most senior family court judge recently expressed concern that some were being issued because of insufficient planning and preparation on the part of local authorities. \nIn a statement, a spokesman for the judiciary welcomed the report, saying it would \"be the basis of further in-depth analysis, qualitative research and review\".\n\"We look forward to working with others across family justice in order to investigate more fully the overall context, experiences and issues which are raised by the data in the report,\" they added.\nCharlotte Ramsden, current president of the Association of Directors of Children's Services said: \"I think its rightly very challenging for us all, in terms of the current experience of families.\n\"The challenge is for us to do everything we can to avoid, reduce the need to remove babies at birth at all, but absolutely where we do that we do it in the best way, and we do it with parents properly represented.\"\nYou can hear Sanchia Berg's full report on BBC Radio 4's World At One."

This allows people to sign-in to other websites, services and apps using their Facebook log-in details.\nThe watchdog said it is examining whether the company has unfairly used the data to compete with other businesses through Facebook Marketplace, where firms and users put up classified adverts to sell items, as well as Facebook Dating which was launched in Europe last year. \nThe European Commission said it had opened a formal antitrust investigation \"to assess whether Facebook violated EU competition rules by using advertising data gathered in particular from advertisers in order to compete with them in markets where Facebook is active such as classified ads\".\nIt said: \"The formal investigation will also assess whether Facebook ties its online classified ads service \"Facebook Marketplace\" to its social network, in breach of EU competition rules.\"\nFacebook said its \"Marketplace and dating offer people more choices, both products operate in highly competitive environment with many large incumbents\".\nThe CMA and the European Commission said they will work closely with each other as their \"independent investigations develop\".\nAndrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, added: \"We intend to thoroughly investigate Facebook's use of data to assess whether its business practices are giving it an unfair advantage in the online dating and classified ad sectors.\n \"Any such advantage can make it harder for competing firms to succeed, including new and smaller businesses, and may reduce customer choice.\"\nThe opening of European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's first competition probe into the world's largest social network is latest fight with the US tech giants.\nShe has already his Google with more than \u20ac8bn (\u00a36.8bn) in fines, and is also investigating Amazon and Apple.\n\"In today's digital economy, data should not be used in ways that distort competition,\" Ms Vestager said.

      "text": "Facebook Inc has suspended former US President Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts for two years.\nHe was barred indefinitely from both sites in January in the wake of posts he made on the US Capitol riots, but last month Facebook's Oversight Board criticised the open-ended penalty.\nFacebook said Mr Trump's actions were \"a severe violation of our rules\".\nMr Trump said the move was \"an insult\" to the millions who voted for him in last year's presidential election.\nFacebook's move comes as the social media giant is also ending a policy shielding politicians from some content moderation rules.\nIt said that it would no longer give politicians immunity for deceptive or abusive content based on their comments being newsworthy.\nMr Trump's ban was effective from the date of the initial suspension on 7 January, Facebook's vice-president of global affairs Nick Clegg said in a post.\n\"Given the gravity of the circumstances that led to Mr Trump's suspension, we believe his actions constituted a severe violation of our rules which merit the highest penalty available,\" it added.\n\"If we determine that there is still a serious risk to public safety, we will extend the restriction for a set period of time and continue to re-evaluate until that risk has receded.\" \nOn his return, Mr Trump will be held to \"a strict set of rapidly escalating sanctions,\" for any violations, Mr Clegg's statement noted.\nIn a statement issued from his Save America political action committee, Mr Trump said: \"Facebook's ruling is an insult to the record-setting 75m people, plus many others, who voted for us...\"\n\"They shouldn't be allowed to get away with this censoring and silencing, and ultimately, we will win. Our country can't take this abuse anymore!\"\nIn a second statement on the two-year ban, Mr Trump attacked Facebook's founder.\n\"Next time I'm in the White House there will be no more dinners, at his request, with Mark Zuckerberg and his wife,\" the former president said. \"It will be all business!\"\nThe move by Facebook allows Mr Trump to return to the platform before the 2024 presidential election. \nIt also comes as he prepares to again hold the large scale in-person rallies that were a signature of his campaigns and presidency. One of his first is planned for Dallas, Texas, in early July, according to local media.\nEarlier this week, it emerged that the communications platform set up by Mr Trump in the wake of his social media bans - From the Desk of Donald J Trump - has been permanently shut down.\nIn addition to Facebook, which has over two billion monthly users, Mr Trump has also been banned from Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat, Twitch and other social media platforms over the January riot.\nLast month, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican Trump ally, signed the first law in the US that punishes tech companies for de-platforming politicians.\nFacebook's dilemma on Trump was complex, involved trade-offs, and was guaranteed to upset millions of people. The fact is - whatever their decision - it was bound to be polarising.\nBut just to be clear: today Facebook, the world's biggest social network, has denied access to its megaphone to a man who 74 million people voted for. They didn't just know him, or approve of him; they voted for him to be US president. That is a big call.\nFacebook says public figures who violate its rules by inciting unrest or violence will be suspended for a month or, in more serious cases, up to two years. \nIt comes as part of an effort to undo a previous policy of allowing newsworthy political speech despite a potential that it may cause harm. \nPosts that are deemed worthy of an exception, despite possible violations, may still be allowed but will be given a warning label by Facebook. The company says it will no longer treat \"content posted by politicians any differently\".\n\"Instead, we will simply apply our newsworthiness balancing test in the same way to all content, measuring whether the public interest value of the content outweighs the potential risk of harm by leaving it up.\"\nThe company's Oversight Board found that Mr Trump's initial ban was appropriate, but that there was no rationale for the ban to remain indefinitely. \nThe independent board, which is funded by Facebook, has 20 members who are able to make binding decisions on content. Among the members are legal scholars, journalists, freedom of speech experts and a former prime minister of Denmark.\nThe announcement comes on the same day that regulators in Europe and the UK begin formal anti-trust inquiries into whether Facebook misused customer data."

      "text": "More than half of UK adults have now had both doses of a coronavirus vaccine, official figures show.\nThe prime minister, who had his own second jab on Thursday, welcomed the \"amazing achievement\", tweeting: \"Now let's finish the job.\"\nA total of 26,422,303 second doses have been given out since the vaccine rollout began nearly six months ago.\nIt comes a day after Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed three quarters of UK adults have had a first jab.\nThree of the four vaccines approved for use in the UK require two doses for maximum protection against Covid-19.\nMeanwhile, cases continue to rise in the UK with another 5,274 infections reported on Thursday, and another 18 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test.\nMr Hancock said he was delighted with the progress of the vaccine rollout, and thanked \"everyone working together in our huge national effort\".\nAnd vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the UK had hit \"another important milestone\".\nEngland is slightly ahead of the other three nations in giving out second doses, with 50.7% of adults (22,442,383 people) having had two jabs.\nIn Scotland, 48.2% have had their second jab (2,137,618 people), Northern Ireland is on 47.1% (684,398 people) and in Wales it's 45.9% (1,157,904 people). These latest figures come from the UK's four health agencies.\nThe government has promised to offer a first dose of a vaccine to all adults by the end of July, and both doses to everyone aged 50 and over by 21 June.\nHerd immunity needs a lot of people being able to fight off the virus. \nSay every infected person would on average, in a fully unlocked society that hasn't seen the virus before, infect another six people. \nIf more than five out of every six people can fight off the virus - either because of vaccination or past infection - then the virus gets blocked and so the epidemic starts to shrink. \nWe're not there yet. \nBut herd immunity isn't all or nothing. Every person who is fully vaccinated makes it harder for the virus to spread. \nSo this is more great news about a successful vaccination programme that will hopefully keep us safer in the months to come.\nThe UK continues to be among those with the highest vaccination rates globally.\nThe number of first doses administered each day is now averaging about 170,000 - a drop from an average of about 500,000 in mid-March - as the schedule of second doses kicks in.\nAn average of more than 350,000 second doses are now being given a day.\nOn Wednesday, the health secretary confirmed the government was in talks with AstraZeneca to secure a future version of its jab which would be adapted to better tackle the Beta variant first identified in South Africa. \nAny altered vaccine would need to be approved by the medicines regulator.\nThe variant of coronavirus first identified in India is now the dominant strain in the UK, Public Health England (PHE) has said.\nThe number of cases confirmed by laboratory analysis rose by 79% over the last week to 12,431.\nScientists believe the variant, now known as Delta, has overtaken the Kent, or Alpha, variant.\nMeanwhile, Portugal is set to be downgraded from UK's green travel list to amber, meaning that people can only travel there for essential reasons.\nSeven countries and territories will be added to the red list facing toughest travel restrictions, including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Trinidad and Tobago."

      "tags": "DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Arlene Foster",
      "text": "Edwin Poots has defended his strategy as the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) new leader after criticism by one of his predecessors, Peter Robinson.\nWriting in the News Letter, the ex-leader and former first minister said decisions being made by those advising Mr Poots \"can only damage his prospects of moving the party forward\".\nMr Poots rejected that comment, saying Mr Robinson was \"out of the loop\".\n\"What was good for Peter doesn't seem to be good for anybody else,\" he said.\nInsisting his leadership would differ from that of Arlene Foster, who he has replaced at the helm of the party, Mr Poots said: \"What you're going to see is incremental change.\n\"Step by step we will ensure that the fortunes of the party are better and the fortunes of unionism per se are better,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\nLast week, the DUP endorsed an earlier vote by assembly members and MPs to make Mr Poots leader.\nBut it came amid anger from within the party about how Mrs Foster was ousted last month.\nIn his News Letter column, Mr Robinson contrasted how Ian Paisley - the DUP's first leader - was removed \"sensitively\" with the \"needlessly nasty\" nature of Mrs Foster's toppling and urged Mr Poots to accept that had been a mistake.\n\"Politics is a rough trade and of course it must hurt if a political career is ended before the participant's preferred time,\" wrote Mr Robinson.\n\"But the savage slaying of a leader in the public eye was totally unnecessary and vindictive.\"\nHe wrote that it was \"counterproductive\" and had \"caused serious damage to the party and equally inflicted self-harm upon her successor\".\n\"One has to wonder what kind of strategy those advising Edwin are following when they took - and continue to take - decisions which can only damage his prospects of moving the party forward,\" he added.\nMr Poots responded by saying: \"The problem that Peter has is that he's out of the loop and therefore doesn't know exactly what was going on or what happened.\n\"The only thing different in how things were done when Peter became leader and when I became leader is that, actually, the people who made things public were people who were not in the Poots camp.\"\nOn Thursday Mr Poots said he would lead DUP ministers at this month's North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting in Dublin.\nHe had denied boycotting some meetings in protest against the post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland, known as the Northern Ireland Procotol.\nThe protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that effectively creates a trade border in Irish Sea, meaning checks apply to goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nAfter his first meeting as DUP leader with Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin, Mr Poots said they had \"positive, frank and useful\" talks, mostly about the protocol.\nMr Martin said they had shared an \"open exchange of views\".\nSinn F\u00e9in vice-president and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was right that DUP ministers would attend NSMC meetings, saying that was \"where they should be\".\n\"I think [Mr Poots] was feeling the pressure clearly because it wasn't acceptable for his party to continue in that vein,\" she said on Friday.\nHowever, TUV leader Jim Allister criticised Mr Poots' decision and described it as a \"total flip flop\".\nHe said members of the DUP who backed Edwin Poots and thought they were getting \"strong leadership\" are going to be \"very disappointed\".\nThe DUP leader was accompanied at that meeting by close ally and senior DUP MLA Paul Givan.\nMr Givan is one of the favourites to be appointed first minister, with Mr Poots having said he will not take on the role and will instead remain agriculture minister.\nMr Givan told the BBC's The Nolan Show that he had spoken to Mr Poots about \"the kinds of responsibilities people are prepared to take on\".\n\"I've made it clear to Edwin that whatever role he wants me to do I've never shied away from taking on that responsibility,\" he said.\n\"Edwin has not asked me to [become first minister] and I have not asked to do that role.\n\"That is ultimately a decision for Edwin to take.\"\nThe Ulster Unionists and the Alliance Party have warned that political instability could be sparked by \"dithering\" over the appointment of a new first minister.\nMr Poots also attended a meeting of Stormont party leaders on Thursday at which it was agreed to convene a summit to start dealing with Northern Ireland's hospital waiting lists crisis.\nMore than 335,000 people are waiting for a first consultant-led appointment, meaning Northern Ireland has the worst waiting times of any UK region.\nJohn Compton, a former chief executive of the health service in Northern Ireland, said that solving the crisis was the biggest ever test for Stormont politicians.\n\"I don't think anybody now disputes that people are having their lives curtailed or dying because of the extent of waiting times,\" he told The Nolan Show.\nMr Poots said the lists had grown at a \"shocking rate\" between 2017 and 2020 when the power-sharing administration was not functioning due to disagreements between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, the two biggest parties.\n\"We do recognise that the waiting lists that have been allowed to develop in Northern Ireland are entirely unreasonable,\" he said.\nMs O'Neill said she had asked the UK government for financial help to deal with the waiting lists."

      "tags": "Tax,Trump tariffs,Rishi Sunak",
      "text": " A global agreement to end the \"race to the bottom\" on corporate taxation is within sight, according to the French and German finance ministers.\nFrance's Bruno le Maire told the BBC the G7 club of rich nations were \"just one millimetre away from a historic agreement\" on a global minimum rate.\nHe urged low tax states like Ireland to back a deal which would target tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft.\nThe German finance minister said a 15% rate would help pay back Covid debt\nTax on big tech and multi-nationals has been a source of friction between the US and fellow G7 countries such as the UK.\nGerman finance minister Olaf Scholz said it was important to stop the world's biggest companies from dodging tax.\nHe said it was \"absolutely necessary\" to reach a deal in order to \"get out of this race to the bottom we see with taxes today\u2026especially after the Covid crisis and all the money we spent to defend the health of the people, and to defend the economy.\"\nMr Le Maire also urged Ireland, which has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the European Union, at 12.5%, to get \"on board\".\nHe added: \"European countries, that in the past, opposed this new international tax system, must understand that they have to give the agreement to this major breakthrough\".\nBoth ministers said agreement on a minimum rate remained a sticking point.\nMr Le Maire said he saw the 15% rate as a \"starting point\". \nHe said: \"If it can be higher, it is better to have a higher rate than 15%.\"\nHowever, Mr Scholz suggested that 15% would be an effective starting point that would mark a \"turning point\" after years of going in the other direction.\nIt came after UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak says he was \"confident\" of reaching a global agreement on digital taxation ahead of a meeting of world finance leaders.\nFinance minsters will also discuss climate change at the two day meeting which starts in London on Friday.\nAhead of the G7 talks, starting in London on Friday, Mr Le Maire and Mr Scholz along with their counterparts in Italy and Spain co-signed a letter urging an agreement on an international tax system \"fit for the 21st Century\".  \nIn a letter to The Guardian, they wrote: \"Introducing this fairer and more efficient international tax system was already a priority before the current economic crisis, and it will be all the more necessary coming out of it.\"\nThose attending the G7 finance ministers summit are certain that a deal will be done on global taxation by Saturday morning - and they are not shy about its \"historic nature\". Mr Scholz told me they'll \"have an agreement which will really change the world... this will be a turning point in global co-operation\". \nAnother finance minister said privately the deal will start to set the rules for the 21st Century, because if the Western G7 democracies were incapable of doing it, then China would. \nThe UK's turnaround on minimum tax rates is quite something. Successive elections have been fought on the danger of corporation tax hikes to jobs and investment. Now, not only is that policy, but the UK looks set up to have overseen an agreement to limit the extent to which a future chancellor could cut it.\nThere are two sticking points, sources tell me. Firstly, there is the mention (or not) of a global minimum corporation tax rate of 15%. There is also a move to use the wording \"at least 15%\" to show some ambition - but also to provide some negotiation space at the wider G20 meeting chaired by Italy and including the likes of China and Russia. \nThe US also asked countries that have levied digital taxes - France, Italy and the UK, to withdraw them quickly as part of the deal. At least one finance minister said that was a \"non-starter\", as it could immediately result in the big tech giants paying less, not more tax. \nThe end result will depend on fine detail, but looks likely to involve a new ability to charge 100 or so of the world's largest companies based on where their sales are, not where they house the factories or patents and trademarks. \nThis could be transformative, and not just for Big Tech, but some more conventional multinationals.\nOn Wednesday, the US announced it would impose tariffs on about $2bn (\u00a31.4bn) of imports, including certain goods from the UK, in retaliation for taxes on big US tech firms.\nHowever, it suspended them for 180 days to allow further talks to take place in London and at a meeting of G20 nations in July.\nMr Sunak is expected to push for an agreement on taxes and call for all global businesses to commit to climate reporting.\nSpeaking ahead of the G7 meeting, Mr Sunak said: \"Securing a global agreement on digital taxation has also been a key priority this year - we want companies to pay the right amount of tax in the right place, and I hope we can reach a fair deal with our partners.\n\"I'm determined we work together and unite to tackle the world's most pressing economic challenges - and I'm hugely optimistic that we will deliver some concrete outcomes this weekend.\"\nThe ministers will be looking at how to stop the likes of Google, Amazon, Starbucks and Apple paying low or no taxes in countries where they generate revenues.\nThe meeting is being held as it emerged that an Irish subsidiary of US technology giant Microsoft paid no corporation tax on $315bn in profit it made last year, according to The Guardian.\nMicrosoft Round Island One is resident in Bermuda and the profit it generated last year is equal to nearly three-quarters of Ireland's GDP.\nMicrosoft said this was  due to \"a one-time event and reflects an inter-company reorganisation, not a cash gain\". \n\"Our organisational and tax structure reflects our complex global business. We are fully compliant with all local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate,\" a spokesperson added.\nAll G7 countries, bar the UK, have supported a proposal from the US for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% that could raise $50-$80bn for governments around the world.\nGermany, France, Italy and Spain said the commitment to a minimum 15% tax rate is \"a promising start\" but said G7 nations must reach \"a common position on a new international tax system\" in London before more nations meet next month.\nThey wrote: \"We are confident it will create the momentum needed to reach a global agreement at the G20 in Venice in July. It is within our reach. Let's make sure it happens. We owe it to our citizens.\"\nThe UK is holding out for reassurances about the Digital Services Tax, which levies 2% on revenues derived in the UK from online marketplaces, search engines and social media platforms.\nIt is open to the idea of a global corporate minimum tax rate and is said to be prepared to let the Digital Services Tax go if it obtains assurances that big tech will not simply be let off the hook.\nThe Biden administration initially pushed for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 21% but has now retreated to 15%. However, officials have said that's regarded very much as a \"floor\".\nFinance ministers from the US, Japan, France, Canada, Germany and Italy will be attending the meeting at Lancaster House, along with representatives from the European Commission, the Eurogroup, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development."

      "text": "Social distancing could continue in Wales for the rest of the year, the first minister has said.\nMark Drakeford said it remained one of the \"strongest defences\" against Covid.\nThe warning comes after the news outdoor sporting events and concerts can resume from Monday for up to 10,000 people sitting or 4,000 standing.\nExtended households can also expand to include a third and up to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors, including in private gardens.\nBut, Mr Drakeford said he was \"not certain there is a huge thirst\" for people to give up safeguards, including the 2m social distancing rule.\n\"I think they will remain part of the repertoire here in Wales during the rest of the summer, and maybe into the rest of this year,\" he told a coronavirus press briefing.\n\"Whether we will be able to move from them being mandatory to just [things] we advise people about will depend on whether we continue to see improvements of the position here in Wales.\"\nAllowing more people to meet indoors was ruled out until at least late June, as other lockdown rules were eased.\nThe decision to delay comes amid \"growing concern\" over the Delta variant, first identified in India, and the Welsh government said the delay was designed to allow more people to get vaccinated.\nThere are currently 97 cases of the variant in Wales, up 67% compared with the previous week.\nMr Drakeford said: \"The risk of infection is significantly less outdoors than it is indoors. This is why we are phasing in the changes in this three-week cycle.\n\"This will allow more people to enjoy events outdoors and take advantage of the Welsh summer, while we continue to roll out the vaccination programme to all adults.\"\nHowever, he added: \"We have to be realistic. The fact that the Delta variant is spreading so quickly in the north-west of England will mean that it will cross the border into Wales.\n\"That is why we are delaying some of the measures we might otherwise take to maximise the amount of vaccination that we can carry out because that is our best defence against that new variant.\"\nThe lockdown measures will be reviewed again on 21 June.\nThe changes - described as a phased move to Wales' alert level one - will begin from Monday.\nIt means three households are able to meet indoors and have physical contact - but each household can only meet one other at a time.\nA further household with a single adult, or single adult with caring responsibilities, will still be able to join extended households.\nFurther rule changes on indoor activity will be considered by the Welsh government before 21 June - when an ending to restrictions in England may happen. \nPubs and restaurants have been allowed to serve customers inside from 17 May, however, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective has called for all significant restrictions to be lifted before July, including scrapping the 2m social distancing rule.\nSarah Hemsley-Cole, of campaign group WeMakeEvents Cymru, said the announcement was \"great news\" for the industry, having been crippled by repeated lockdowns.\nIn recent weeks a series of test events have been held, including the Tafwyl and Eid festivals in Cardiff Castle, while the upcoming Wales v Albania football match at Cardiff City Stadium is limited to 4,000 spectators.\nMs Hemsley-Cole said while they were happy with the Welsh government's \"cautious\" approach, the test events had been \"incredibly restrictive\" with some limited to just 100 people amid social distancing.\nShe added: \"The reality is, as long as there is social distancing, that is a challenge for the sector... it's a real challenge to make things work, and people sort of forget they have to maintain it.\n\"But we understand it is there to make us safe and we will find solutions and a way to make it work.\"\nAnnual events, such as Brecon Jazz and Green Man Festival, were waiting to see if they would be allowed to go ahead this summer, while Live Nation have confirmed they will now hold four outdoor concerts, each for up to 10,000 people, in Cardiff Bay in September.\n\"There's been an optimistic outlook for the last month or so but we're very pleased with this news,\" said Rob Waller, of Live Nation. \"It's great to have live music back.\"\nThe Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd says businesses will be concerned there were no announcements on financial support.\nAndrew RT Davies said: \"There's \u00a3140m of unallocated money in the Welsh government's coffers for business support but there was no mention of that.\"\nPlaid Cymru welcomed the changes but pressed for more support to businesses while \"the economic devastation of the pandemic remains.\"\nWelsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds welcomed the \"cautious\" move, but warned that after more than a year of changing restrictions, people were \"exhausted\".\nShe also wanted a review of the rules on hospital visits.\nDespite concerns over the Delta variant, Wales will not push for a ban on travel from hot-spots in England, similar to that demanded last year.\n\"I don't think that's the position that we are in at the moment,\" said Mr Drakeford.\n\"We are asking people coming into Wales from those hotspot areas to behave carefully and responsibly, to take all the precautions you would expect them to take to keep themselves and other people safe.\" \nWales has the highest vaccination rate in the UK, with 2,169,624 people having been given a first vaccine dose, or 68.5%.\nFigures also show 1,181,259 people have now had a second jab, almost 40% of the population of Wales.\nThe case rate in Wales is currently 8 per 100,000 people over seven days.\nA cluster of cases, attributed to the Delta variant, has been responsible for a spike in Conwy county, taking the case rate there to 23.\nThere have been no new deaths with covid reported in Wales for the past nine days."

      "text": "Jobs vacancies in the UK are soaring but there are not enough workers to fill them, a report suggests.\nThe easing of Covid restrictions and reopening of various sectors meant demand for workers rose at its fastest rate in May for more than 23 years, according to a KPMG survey.\nBut the number of staff available to fill those jobs declined at the quickest rate since 2017.\nKPMG called on the government and firms to address skills gaps.\nWorkers were especially needed in IT and computing, which has been a long-term trend, as well as hospitality, the survey found.\nHospitality venues are struggling to fill thousands of job vacancies with waiting staff and chefs in particular demand as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease, industry body UK Hospitality said last week.\nMany hospitality firms have struggled during the pandemic despite extensive government support, including rates holidays and the furlough scheme, and staff have lost their jobs or seen their hours reduced.\nThe retail industry saw the least demand for workers.\nThis monthly survey is based on responses from 400 recruitment and employment agencies and is yet more evidence of the economic recovery gathering pace.\nIt says hiring activity has intensified across all job categories, particularly in IT and computing and hotels and catering.\nBut there's also a shortage of workers. Hospitality and events firms have been struggling to get the staff they need to cope with a post-lockdown surge in demand.\nSome are warning of a staffing crisis this summer, partly caused by gaps left by EU workers who have returned home because of Brexit and the pandemic.\nThe survey's authors say skills and labour shortages, that already existed before the pandemic, are now the most pressing issue in the jobs market.\nThis means many employers will need to look at the wages and benefits they offer at a time when they're still struggling to financially recover from the last 14 months.\nThe jobs market \"seems to be firing on all cylinders\" said KPMG partner Claire Warnes.\n\"But the deterioration in staff supply intensified this month... This is a worrying trend,\" she added.\nShe called for government and firms to \"urgently address the skills gap\".\nKate Shoesmith, deputy chief executive of the Recruitment & Employment Confederation (REC), said: \"With demand spiking, the skills and labour shortages that already existed in the UK have come into sharper focus - and Covid has only made them worse.\n\"This is the most pressing issue in the jobs market right now, and has the potential to slow down the recovery.\" \nA government spokesperson said: \"Our multi-billion pound plan for jobs, including the Kickstart scheme, is supporting employers across the country to create jobs and help jobseekers get the skills and experience needed to develop their careers and fulfil roles for years to come.\n\"Additionally, we have increased the apprenticeship hiring incentive to \u00a33,000 per new apprentice hire and our lifetime skills guarantee - worth the equivalent of around \u00a33,400 per person - ensures all adults can gain new skills and qualifications.\""

      "tags": "Norway,Brexit,Iceland,Trade",
      "text": "The UK has signed a post-Brexit trade deal with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, the government has announced.\nThe agreement will be a major boost for trade between the four non-EU nations, which is already worth \u00a321.6bn, UK minister Liz Truss said.\nShe claimed it would boost sectors such as digital and cut tariffs on UK farm products such as cheese and meat.\nBritain is Norway's top trading partner outside the European Union (EU).\nThe UK government said reduced import tariffs on shrimps, prawns and haddock would cut costs for UK fish processing, helping to support jobs in Scotland, East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire.\nAs Britain is no longer part of the European Common Fisheries Policy, it must deal directly with Norway and UK fleets are keen to have access to the country's sub-Arctic seas.\nHowever, many Norwegian farmers have expressed concerns at opening up the domestic market to British beef and cheese. \nState broadcaster NRK says the country's market of 5.4 million people is small but potentially lucrative, with strong purchasing power.\nThe countries involved are the three non-EU members of the European Economic Area, which allows them to be part of the EU's single market.\nNorwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said \"the deal allows for growth in trade for both our countries\".\nHowever, the Norwegian government said the deal with the UK would not restore all the advantages it had when both countries were in the EEA.\nIn terms of their overall trade volumes, this deal is more significant for Norway and Iceland than it is for the UK.\nBut politically, it's really important for the post-Brexit British government to show that new trade deals are being done quickly. Even if - as the Norwegian side points out - it is less open than the previous relationship inside the same single market. \nThe new deal builds on the rollover agreement the UK signed before it left the EU's economic zone, and the government is keen to stress it includes important elements on digital trade which go beyond what the EU has. \nBut digital and data provisions are relatively new elements in free trade agreements, and it's still unclear how effective they are in the long term. \n\"At first sight, the deal looks cautiously ambitious,\" says trade expert David Henig from the European Centre for International Political Economy. \n\"In many fields, from climate change to SMEs [small businesses] to digital, it sets out some goals, without it being obvious that the underlying provisions will deliver them.\"\nSo, it's a decent start. But it's the implementation that counts. \n\"Prior to the UK's exit from the EU, Norway enjoyed free movement of goods, services, capital and persons to the UK through the EEA agreement,\" Norway said. \n\"A free trade agreement will not provide similar access to the British market.\"\nThe UK's international trade secretary, Liz Truss, said the deal would be \"a major boost for our trade with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, growing an economic relationship already worth \u00a321.6bn, while supporting jobs and prosperity in all four nations at home\".\nIceland's Foreign Minister, Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson, said an agreement with the UK had been a priority for his country and would be \"crucial for both Icelandic companies and consumers\"."

      "tags": "Copenhagen,Denmark,Climate change,Sea level rise",
      "text": "Plans for an artificial island to house 35,000 people and protect the port of Copenhagen from rising sea levels have been approved by Danish MPs. \nThe giant island, named Lynetteholm, would be connected to the mainland via a ring road, tunnels and a metro line. \nThe approval by Denmark's parliament paves the way for the 1 sq mile (2.6 sq km) project to begin later this year. \nBut it faces opposition from environmentalists who have concerns over the impact of its construction. \nPlans for Lynetteholm include a dam system around its perimeter, with the aim of protecting the harbour from rising sea levels and storm surges. \nIf construction goes ahead as planned, the majority of the foundations for the island off Denmark's capital should be in place by 2035, with an aim to fully complete the project by 2070. \nA case against the development of Lynetteholm has been brought before the European Court of Justice by environmental groups.\nConcerns include the transportation of materials by road involving large numbers of vehicles. One environmental assessment suggested that up to 350 lorry journeys a day through Copenhagen would be required to deliver the raw materials once construction had begun. \nBuilding the artificial island, the size of about 400 football pitches, would require some 80 million tonnes of soil to be delivered to the area to create the peninsula alone, local media report. \nThere are also concerns among environmentalists about the movement of sediment at sea and the possible impact on ecosystems and water quality. \nProtesters gathered outside the parliament building in Copenhagen as the bill passed on Friday with a majority of 85 in favour and 12 against, according to Danish broadcaster DR.\nOne demonstrator from Copenhagen, Eva Larsen, said she was \"very worried\" about the prospect of construction lorries passing through the city on a daily basis, DR reported.\nAnother protester, Nicholas Woollhead, said a decision on Lynetteholm should not have been made before local elections in November.  \n\"This project, which is the largest in Copenhagen's history and one of the largest infrastructure projects in Danish history, is simply pulled down over our heads between election periods where we do not have a chance to be heard,\" he said. \nCarina Christensen, the head of the association for the Danish road transport of goods (IDT), said more \"climate-friendly\" transport was an option when delivering materials for the construction of Lynetteholm, but that it would require the go-ahead from government officials.\n\"Electric trucks will, for example, remove CO2 emissions and reduce noise, but in return cost more and lead to more trips,\" she said."

      "title": "Hearings in London aim to assess allegations of genocide in China",
      "tags": "Xinjiang,Human rights,China",
      "text": "A series of hearings begins in London on Friday aiming to gather evidence on whether the Chinese government's alleged human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region constitute a genocide.\nAn eight-member panel, chaired by the prominent British barrister Sir Geoffrey Nice, will hear from about 30 witnesses over four days of testimony. \nThe hearings have no government backing and the panel's conclusions are not binding on ministers, but the organisers say they hope the process will add to the body of evidence around the allegations against China.\nThe panel consists of academics, lawyers, and a former British diplomat. In selecting its members, the organisers intentionally drew from a mix of disciplines and avoided China experts to avoid a risk of prejudgment, Sir Geoffrey said.\nThe hearings, branded by organisers as the Uyghur Tribunal, were arranged by the London-based businessman Nick Vetch. Mr Vetch was previously involved with similar hearings in 2019 that examined allegations of organ harvesting in China.\nThe Chinese state has been accused of crimes against humanity and genocide in Xinjiang, a large region in the country's northwest which is home to the Uyghurs and other minority Muslim groups.\nExperts say that at least a million Uyghurs and other Muslims have been detained in the region and held in extra-judicial camps or sent to prisons. Former detainees and residents of Xinjiang have made allegations of torture, mass surveillance, and forced sterilisation.\nChina denies that abuses are taking place, and says its network of camps in Xinjiang are for \"re-education\" and vocational training purposes. Xu Guixiang, the spokesman for the Xinjiang regional government, called the hearings a \"total violation of international law and order, a serious desecration of the victims of real genocide, and a serious provocation to the 25 million people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang\".  \nA dozen experts have been invited to give evidence at the hearings, including Dr Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Denver, Colorado; Dr Jo Smith Finley, a reader in Chinese Studies at Newcastle University; Nathan Ruser, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute; and Adrian Zenz, who has published reports on forced labour and abortion in Xinjiang.\nDolkun Isa, the president of the World Uyghur Congress, will also give evidence. Mr Isa told the BBC that the privately-organised hearings were the only option available for investigating China's actions in Xinjiang because the two international courts which might otherwise take up a case had no plans to do so.\nThe International Criminal Court announced in December it would not investigate because China, as a non-member, was outside of its jurisdiction, and the International Court of Justice can only take a case that has been approved by the UN Security Council, over which China has veto power.\nMr Isa, who believes his mother died while in detention in Xinjiang, and who discovered this week that his brother had been sentenced to life in prison there, said he hoped the hearings would force politicians to \"pay more attention\".\n\"And not only pay more attention, but take concrete steps like imposing sanctions. This is the moral obligation of all countries,\" he said.\nAnother witness, the prominent Uyghur scholar and activist Abduweli Ayup, told the BBC the hearings were \"a platform to tell our stories\".\nMr Ayup said he would be thinking about his niece Mihray Erkin while he gave evidence. Ms Erkin was a graduate from Shanghai's Jiao Tong University and Tokyo University and went on to join the staff of Japan's Nara Institute of Science and Technology. In 2019, she returned to Xinjiang after authorities put pressure on her parents, Mr Ayup said.\nShe is believed to have died in November, aged 30, in Yanbulak Detention Center in Xinjiang. Reports of her death were confirmed in May by Radio Free Asia.\n\"If there is a question about my niece I will be happy to answer it. That is the personal side, the suffering,\" Mr Ayup said.\nThe panel will be chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice, who previously led the prosecution of the former Serbian president, Slobodan Milosevic. Sir Geoffrey told the BBC that the inability or failure of international criminal courts to take up investigating the allegations of genocide had left a \"void of information\".\n\"What we hope to achieve is to provide facts that others may use,\" he said. \"The tribunal will not go further than that, it will not look outside the crimes it has been asked to investigate, and it will not overreach by making recommendations about what others should or shouldn't do. It will simply provide facts for others to use.\"\nThe US State Department has previously described China's actions in Xinjiang as a genocide, and the parliaments of the UK, Canada, Netherlands, and Lithuania have passed resolutions making the same declaration.\nOthers have argued that genocide is a specific term with legal force that should only be determined by a criminal court.\nThe case for genocide is based on reports that China is taking steps to erase the culture of the Uyghurs and assimilate or diminish the population through programmes of forced relocation and birth control. \nIn a report published in April, the US-based charity Human Rights Watch concluded that China was responsible for crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, but stopped short of calling the state's actions a genocide."

      "tags": "Hong Kong anti-government protests",
      "text": "Pro-democracy activist Chow Hang Tung has been arrested by Hong Kong police on the 32nd anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. \nMs Chow is vice chairwoman of the Hong Kong Alliance which organises annual vigils for victims of Beijing's deadly crackdown on democracy protesters. \nShe has been arrested for promoting unauthorised assembly. \nIt comes as Hong Kong has banned the vigil for the second year running, citing coronavirus restrictions. \nPolice have closed off Victoria Park, where citizens usually gather each year to mark the anniversary. Thousands of officers have been placed on standby to stop any attempt to hold the event.\nHong Kong and Macau are the only places in Chinese territory where people can commemorate the deadly 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.\nBut this year, authorities in Macau also banned the vigil for the second year in a row, saying it would violate local criminal laws. \nHowever, Ms Chow continued to call on residents to commemorate the anniversary in their own ways.\n \"Turn on the lights wherever you are - whether on your phone, candles or electronic candles,\" she had posted on Facebook a day before her arrest. \nSome lit candles or held their phone lights aloft at 20:00 local time (12:00 GMT) to mark the anniversary. Officers dispersed groups and there were reports of one arrest in Mong Kok district.\nMs Chow was arrested early in the morning outside her office by officers in plain clothes, according to reports. \nShe was placed in a black saloon car and driven away, the AFP news agency said.\nSpeaking to the BBC ahead of her arrest, Ms Chow, who is also a lawyer and a human rights activist, said she was prepared for the inevitable.\n\"I am prepared to be arrested. This is how Hong Kong is now. If you fight for democracy under an authoritarian regime, being arrested is unavoidable. Let it come. I am willing to pay the price for fighting for democracy,\" she said.\nSeparately on Friday, police arrested a 20-year-old delivery man, identified only by his surname Cheung, \"promoting and announcing unauthorised assembly\" - the same charge Ms Chow faces. \nPolice called both their actions \"extremely irresponsible\".\nHuge crowds usually gather in Hong Kong's Victoria Park each year to mark the anniversary of Chinese troops crushing peaceful democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989.\nThere was international condemnation after troops and tanks opened fire on protesters in Beijing - estimates of the dead vary from a few hundred to several thousand.\nBut last year, Hong Kong banned the vigil for the first time in 30 years - citing virus concerns. \nDespite this, tens of thousands of people defied the ban, knocking down barricades that had been erected around Victoria Park. \nHowever, this year's Tiananmen anniversary is the first since a new controversial security law was approved, aimed at ending the city's pro-democracy movement and criminalising dissent.\nAround 100 people have been arrested since the law was enacted in June.\n\"This will be the first June 4 since the National Security Law. Many ask if the vigil will disappear. I think we have been persisting for more than 30 years. It is more or less in Hong Kong people's DNA,\" Ms Chow told the BBC before her arrest. \nLam Cho Wai, BBC Chinese\nChow Hang Tung was as defiant as ever when I interviewed her last month.  \nShe asked: \"I will light up a candle in the street. Are you going to arrest me for that?\" \nShe was arrested, before she even got the chance to do that. But it comes as no surprise. Around 7,000 police officers are patrolling the streets of Hong Kong today.\nThey might make more arrests over the course of the day, according to local media reports - a stark warning to those who might try to defy the vigil ban. \nMs Chow is considered the successor of the Hong Kong Alliance which has been fighting for democracy for more than 30 years. \nThe 36-year-old barrister became a key figure after her colleagues were jailed for participating in unauthorised assembly. \nMs Chow had told her followers that she would go to Victoria Park, the site of the annual demonstrations, to keep the tradition going.\nThe arrest is not her first. She was among the pro-democracy activists who were last year arrested for inciting and participating unauthorised assembly.\nIn mainland China, authorities have banned even oblique references to the events of June 4. Online, any discussion of the crackdown is strictly censored. \nTaiwan commemorates the anniversary every year, using the event to criticise China and urge Beijing to embark on real political reform.  \nOn her Facebook page, President Tsai Ing-wen wrote: \"I believe that all Taiwanese who are proud of their freedom and democracy will never forget about this day and will firmly stick with their faith, unshaken by storms.\"\nThe US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said America stands with the people of China in their fight for human rights, adding that US honours \"the sacrifices of those killed 32 years ago, and the brave activists who carry on their efforts today in the face of ongoing government repression.\""

      "text": "Access to Twitter through Nigeria's main phone providers has been blocked, according to reports from Lagos and the capital, Abuja.\nIt is still accessible on some wi-fi networks.\nThis comes after the government said it was suspending Twitter operations in the country \"indefinitely\".\nThe ban was due to \"the persistent use of the platform for activities... capable of undermining Nigeria's corporate existence\", a statement said.\nTwitter said Friday's announcement from Information Minister Lai Mohammed was \"deeply concerning\".\nBy Saturday morning, BBC reporters in Lagos and Abuja said they were unable to connect to Twitter through two of the countries largest phone networks: MTN and Airtel. Others have also been affected.\nAccess was still possible through some wi-fi providers, but this is not a common way to connect to the internet in Nigeria.\nSearch terms such as \"VPN\" were popular overnight, according to the search tracking site Trendsmap. \nA VPN - or Virtual Private Network - connection makes it appear as if the user is accessing the internet from another country, and has been a way to get round similar bans in other countries.\nThe move by the government came just days after a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari was removed for breaching the site's rules, though no mention of this was made in its statement.\nMr Mohammed has previously criticised the US social media giant's decision to take it down, calling it \"double standards\".\nThe tweet sent by Mr Buhari on 1 June referred to the 1967-70 Nigerian Civil War and to treating \"those misbehaving today\" in \"the language they will understand\".\nA Twitter spokesperson said at the time that the post \"was in violation of the Twitter Rules\".\nAnd in a statement on Friday, the company - which in April announced its new African headquarters would be based in neighbouring Ghana - said it was \"investigating and will provide updates when we know more\" about the Nigerian ban. \nThe government gave no details on how the ban would work in practice, or any explanation of how Twitter had undermined Nigeria's corporate existence.\nIts statement, which was released on Twitter, also revealed that the national broadcasting regulator, NBC, has been told to start \"the process of licensing all OTT [internet streaming services] and social media operations in Nigeria\".\nOsai Ojigho, director of Amnesty International Nigeria, condemned the announcement.\n\"This action is clearly inconsistent and incompatible with Nigeria's international obligations. We are calling on the Nigerian authorities to immediately reverse the unlawful suspension and other plans to gag the media, repress civic space, and undermine Nigerians' human rights.\"\nAnalysis by Nduka Orjinmo, BBC News, Abuja\nThe Nigerian government has toyed with the idea of regulating social media in the country, and this administration has been obsessed with the idea since it came into office in 2015. Deleting the president's tweet, however, was seen as the final straw.\nBut it was the role Twitter played in the #EndSars anti-police brutality protests which shook Nigeria last year that truly sealed its fate.\nThe demonstrations were mostly organised on the platform and the company's CEO, Jack Dorsey, made donations to one of the leading groups of organisers. A special emoji was also created for the protests.\nTwitter helped give Nigeria's many youths a voice. But in the eyes of the government, the company's role in galvanising the country's young population was a line crossed.\nYet the government appears not to have reckoned with the ingenuity of #EndSars protesters. People are already downloading VPNs to bypass the block when it happens. "

      "text": "A fresh row has broken out over the influence of the Unite trade union after leaked emails highlighted plans to challenge sitting Labour MPs.\nFormer Labour deputy leader Tom Watson accused Unite of playing \"hard left games\" that alienate mainstream voters.\nWatson, who stood down at the 2019 election, made a rare foray back into the political world after Newsnight saw emails by a West Midlands Unite activist outlining plans to try and unseat leading Labour figures.\nIn an email dated 12 February 2018 addressed to a senior Unite official Howard Beckett, the activist Steve Price outlined plans to \"put the skids\" under Mr Watson, then the MP for West Bromwich East, and former minister John Spellar, who represents Warley, in the West Midlands.\nNewsnight has also seen internal Unite emails in which officials discussed Mr Price's first email. One said that one hour may not be enough time to deal with all the issues he had raised.\nIn a second email on 15 March 2018, also addressed to Howard Beckett, Steve Price wrote about how his networking was vital in \"building trusted left roots across 59 constituencies\".\nPrice also wrote that it had been agreed that he would be paid but he needed a \"form of words to describe what I'm (not) doing\".\nIn a statement to Newsnight a Unite spokesperson said that Steve Price's plan was not accepted by the the union and no payments were made. Steve Price did not respond.\nBut the union strongly defended its political activity. \nThe spokesperson said: \"It is a long-established practice across the entire trade union movement is to fund candidates who stand on a platform that will advance the lives of our members. This is not unique to Unite.\"\nBut Tom Watson told Newsnight that he was alarmed by the emails. \nHe said: \"I think if people had known that these conversations were taking place when they were taking place, there would have been real shock. \n\"I think even Jeremy Corbyn would have condemned that kind of behaviour.\"\nThe former Labour deputy leader added: \"The problem, I think, for the Labour Party is whilst Unite carries on with its own internal politics and plays these hard left games and appeals to its narrow audience, that plays very badly with mainstream voters on the doorstep.\"\nHoward Beckett, one of Unite's assistant general secretaries who hopes to replace Len McCluskey as the union's general secretary, told Newsnight that the ideas outlined in the emails from Steve Price addressed to him were never followed.\nBeckett said: \"Steve made a proposal to me and I decided to go in a different direction. \n\"There was nothing wrong with the proposal that Steve made. The idea that Tom Watson is shocked by this is quite extraordinary. \nBut I decided to go in a different direction...So no the arrangement was never formalised with Steve.\"\nFormer Labour minister Dame Margaret Hodge has reported Unite to the police after Steve Price wrote in one of his emails that it had been agreed he would be paid via a third party. Trade unions have to declare spending on political matters.\nHoward Beckett dismissed the police complaint by Margaret Hodge as \"laughable\" and \"risible\". \n\"Margaret Hodge is making a political stunt. She's obviously doing it because of the fact that there is a Unite general secretary election. She opposes my candidature, she supports someone else in the race.\"\nYou can watch Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 on weekdays.

      "text": "Major design flaws have been identified in the Army's new fleet of armoured vehicles. \nAn internal leaked government report also raises serious doubts as to whether the \u00a35.5bn Ajax Armoured Vehicle programme will be delivered on time and within budget. \nProblems include excessive vibration and noise. \nThe Ministry of Defence signed a contract for 589 of the Ajax armoured vehicles in 2014.\nAn investigation by the government's Infrastructure and Projects Authority says the \"successful delivery of the programme to time, cost and quality appears to be unachievable\". \nThe BBC has seen extracts of the leaked report. It states that compelling evidence was found that the programme will not deliver the planned number of Ajax family armoured fighting vehicles to the British Army for planned operational deployments in 2023/24.\nThe MoD and the Army have said they remained committed to the Ajax programme.\nThe MoD has already spent nearly \u00a33.5bn on the flagship programme, which is meant to provide the British Army with a \"family\" of modern tracked armoured fighting vehicles. \nThe Army describes it as a \"core capability' and key to its modernisation. \nThe US-based defence contractor General Dynamics is assembling the vehicles in Merthyr Tydfil in Wales. But so far only 14 of the 589 have been delivered for trial - the Ares reconnaissance variant.\nThere have been reports of yet more problems with the turret and gun of the main Ajax vehicle. The Infrastructure and Projects Authority criticises the current contract for focusing on \"schedule and milestone payments over quality\".\nThe leaked report, first reported in the Sun, also highlights a number of issues with those vehicles delivered for trials, including excessive vibration and noise. \nThe MoD halted trials for four months following complaints that crews were suffering from temporary hearing loss and aching joints. \nThe MoD says the trials resumed in March. But the leaked report says crews are still having to observe strict health and safety restrictions, including \"limiting time in the platform to one hour 30 before a crew change or speed restrictions of 20mph\" - which is less than half its top speed. \nThe report also notes the \"vehicle cannot reverse over an obstacle more than 20cm high\". Defence experts say many of the problems stem from additional armour protection being put on the original hull, which has seen an increase in weight from 19 to more than 40 tonnes. \nThe report team said that, given the limitation of use, the impact of morale on troops should lead to questions as to the vehicles' credibility. It said there was \"a real risk\" that exposing the Army to vehicles in their current condition would undermine soldiers' confidence in Ajax.   \nThe MoD and the Army said they remained committed to the Ajax programme and that they were still planning to reach the vehicles' Initial Operating Capability by summer of this year. \nA defence source said: \"It was no secret that the programme, that was originally contracted in 2010 and 2014, has had problems, which is why the MoD has intensified scrutiny and work to rectify the issues. \n\"The Army, General Dynamics and the MoD is now engaged in an intensive round of assessments and rectification work to resolve any outstanding issues.\"\nSenior Army officers have told the BBC that they are confident of resolving the issues. \nGeneral Dynamics UK said: \"Recent trials have confirmed many of the required capabilities across the Ajax Family of Vehicles, including operations across the full range of speed and reverse step obstacle climb. \n\"A small number of remaining issues are being reviewed and closed out in partnership with the British Army and Ministry of Defence ahead of Initial Operating Capability.\"\nEarlier this year, MPs on the Defence Select Committee issued a damning report on the state of the British Army's armoured vehicle programme. \nIt said the Army had spent hundreds of millions of pounds with little to show for it. Earlier this year, the MoD scrapped its plans to upgrade hundreds of Warrior Armoured Vehicles. \nSome defence experts also question whether Ajax will ever enter service. \nFrancis Tusa, a defence analyst, described Ajax \"as the Army's Nimrod [MRA4]\" - the planned Maritime Patrol Aircraft scrapped in 2010 at a cost of \u00a34bn, without a single aircraft entering service. \nMr Tusa said the only thing the Ajax programme seemed to have delivered so far was tinnitus.

      "text": "A cluster of the Indian variant of Covid-19 is \"very serious\" and could affect the easing of restrictions in Wales, the health minister has said. \nEluned Morgan is \"very concerned\" the cluster in Conwy county is heading towards community transmission.\nThere are now 35 cases of the variant - renamed the Delta variant by the World Health Organization - in Llandudno, Llandudno Junction and Penrhyn Bay. \nPeople have been urged to get tested, even if they do not have symptoms.\nBetsi Cadwaladr health board has asked those without any Covid symptoms to get a lateral flow test at a mobile unit at Ysgol Awel y Mynydd in Llandudno Junction.\nThose in the area who do have symptoms have been asked to attend Conwy Business Centre for a more accurate PCR test.\nConwy county now has the second highest Covid rate in Wales.\nUpdated figures on the spread of the Delta variant are expected to be published by Public Health Wales later this week.\nThe UK government has said up to three-quarters of new cases in England could be of the variant, which has been renamed Delta by the World Health Organization.\nBaroness Morgan said the situation in Llandudno could affect further easing of restrictions across Wales.\n\"This is becoming very serious, we need to make sure that we try and nip this in the bud in that particular area and obviously all of this will play into how we assess the situation on Friday,\" she said.\n\"I don't think we'd define it quite yet as community transmission, but it's on its way to becoming that and that's why we really need people in the area to co-operate with us\u2026 to make sure that we can try and suppress this particular variant.\n\"The last thing we want to see is this spreading across the whole of Wales,\" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\nShe said the 35 cases of the Delta variant had been identified through the Test, Trace, Protect scheme, which she said had been a \"phenomenal success\" throughout the pandemic and was being extended until March. \n\"We do know where those 35 people are and we are tracing their contacts,\" she said.\n\"It's been a highly successful programme so far. It's one of the key weapons in our arsenal in our efforts to curb the spread of Covid.\"\nAn additional \u00a332m will go towards the scheme, which has reached 99.7% of all positive cases eligible for follow up since it was introduced last June, the Welsh government said. \nHelen Alefounder, a GP in Conwy, said the potential for social mixing during half term was \"slightly worrying\".\n\"What's reassuring is we've isolated these cases, we know where they are and we can make sure that those patients are isolated and [we can] try and prevent the spread of the virus any further,\" she said.\n\"But it is half term... we've got a lot of visitors in Wales and we just need to make sure we're maintaining our social distancing and keeping to the rules because otherwise there will be an increase in cases. We don't want to go back to where we were a few months ago. \n\"It's really important for everyone to remember that this is still very real, the virus is still out there but we can prevent this. We can stop the cases from increasing,\" she said.\nConwy's Covid case rate is currently the 163rd highest in the UK.\nFor context, where we have had clusters in recent weeks - Bridgend, Newport and Monmouthshire - these have all eased off now and they never got beyond 30 cases per 100,000. \nAll, including Conwy, according to the most recent surveillance, have had raised numbers of under-25s; the Bridgend and Monmouthshire clusters were linked to schools in Porthcawl and Abergavenny.\nConwy breaks down into 15 communities. Three of these are among the 23 across Wales which have shown any positive test numbers greater than two in the past week. \nThe other 12 local areas are among the 94% in Wales with fewer than two cases in the last seven days.\nThe lag in test results being published means it will be a few more days before the Conwy cluster starts to show up properly in the figures. The county's case rate stands at just under 20 but it has been below the 50 cases per 100,000 threshold for two months. \nDuring the second wave in January, Conwy reached 221 cases per 100,000. That is the third lowest peak of any local authority area of Wales, after Anglesey and Gwynedd."

      "tags": "Belarus,Belarusian presidential election 2020,Minsk,Alexander Lukashenko,European Union",
      "text": "The family of Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich says he was coerced into making a confession on TV of organising anti-government protests. \nMr Protasevich, 26, was arrested in Minsk last month after his flight to Lithuania was diverted.\nIn a tearful appearance on state TV, he praised President Alexander Lukashenko and admitted attempting to topple him. \nMarks were visible on his wrists. Human rights and opposition campaigners say he was tortured. \nMr Protasevich was editor of the opposition Nexta channel on the Telegram messaging app until last year. \nHe was put on a list of \"individuals involved in terrorist activity\" by the government in Belarus. \nMass protests erupted across Belarus after Mr Lukashenko claimed victory in a 9 August presidential election widely condemned as rigged, which was followed by a crackdown.\nThe protests have been curbed and opposition leaders have been sent to prison or into exile. \nIn the interview broadcast on Thursday evening, Mr Protasevich admitted to attempting to topple Mr Lukashenko and said that he was speaking to the television channel by choice.\nHe said that he had criticised President Lukashenko a lot but \"began to understand that he was doing the right thing and I certainly respect him\". \nAt the end of the interview, he burst into tears and said he hoped one day to marry and have children.\nThe journalist's father told AFP TV that it pained him to watch the interview. \n\"I know my son very well and I believe that he would never say such things. They broke him and forced him to say what was needed,\" he said. \"No one should believe these words because they were beaten out, through abuse and torture of my son.\"\nAnd his assertions were echoed by exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. \n\"You should understand in what conditions these people are, and they are for sure being tortured and violated, and we shouldn't believe any of the words of these people, including Roman Protasevich, because you have to understand how they are forced to say,\" she said.\nAdvocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the video was evidence of \"brutality\" by the security forces. \n\"It should be Exhibit A in a prosecution for torture and ill treatment under President Lukashenko,\" said HRW director Kenneth Roth. \nThursday's interview was Mr Protasevich's third appearance on state television since he was detained. \nIn one interview, he said there was no use in the opposition calling for further street protests. \nOn the face of it, it looked like a normal TV interview: there was a studio, multiple cameras, fancy lighting, two chairs.\nBut think of the circumstances in which it was being recorded and you realise this was no regular conversation between interviewer and interviewee.\nFor a start, Mr Protasevich is in custody in a Minsk detention centre. In most parts of the world, it would be highly unusual for an individual under arrest (and under interrogation) to appear on an interview show on state TV. Not unless he or she had been forced into it.\nMr Protasevich said he had agreed voluntarily to the interview. But he is not a free man: we should be wary of the programme's contents. The authorities' aim in putting him on TV is clear: to discredit the opposition and the protest movement.\nFor much of this long interview, Mr Protasevich spoke fluently and looked directly at the host. But most of the things he was saying were out of character, at odds with comments made before his arrest. \nWhen asked about his time in conflict-hit eastern Ukraine, he grew agitated. Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region have opened a criminal case against him over his alleged participation in the hostilities. \n\"Are you frightened you may be extradited?\" he was asked.\n\"Of course,\" Mr Protasevich replied, looking down. \nThat prospect clearly makes him nervous. And Minsk may use the threat of transfer to the Donbas to ensure Mr Protasevich cooperates with their investigation.\nThe journalist and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega were flying back to Lithuania, where they were both living, when their jet was made to land in Minsk over a fake bomb threat. \nHe faces serious charges. The charge of causing mass unrest can be punished by up to 15 years in jail. But terrorism offences carry higher sentences and as he was taken off the plane, passengers quoted him saying: \"I'll get the death penalty here\". \nMr Protasevich and Ms Sapega were led away by police and later appeared in videos where they were shown making what appeared to be forced confessions to crimes against the Belarusian authorities. \nAs a result of their arrests, the EU has now banned Belarusian airlines from overflying its airspace. \n\"We won't tolerate that one can try to play Russian roulette with the lives of innocent civilians,\" EU Council chief Charles Michel said.

      "tags": "Schools,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children",
      "text": "Pupils fell behind again in the second lockdown, losing progress in maths and reading from the autumn term. \nNew research for the government also reveals large regional differences across England in learning loss. \nIt follows the resignation of Sir Kevan Collins, education recovery commissioner for England, whose plans for helping pupils catch up were rejected by ministers as too expensive.\nThe government has invested \u00a33.1bn and more money may follow in the autumn.\nOn 4 January, schools in England opened briefly and then closed for a second national lockdown, leaving most pupils learning remotely at home.\nThis research for the government by the Education Policy Institute shows that by March 2021, primary pupils were almost as far behind as after the first lockdown and summer holidays last year. \nIn maths, that meant primary pupils were on average 3.5 months behind where children have been in previous non-pandemic years. \nFor reading, the learning loss by the end of the spring term was an average of 2.2 months for primary pupils. \nThe analysis shows schools helped pupils make progress during the autumn, but much of that was wiped out when they closed to all but key worker and vulnerable children. \nAnd some parts of the North East and East Midlands were among the areas worst affected. \nAt the beginning of the autumn term, researchers were able to capture how far behind primary pupils were in maths and reading compared with previous years. \nThis reveals in the South West, pupils in primary school were 1.5 months behind in reading, and two months in maths. \nBut in Yorkshire and Humber, the difference was 2.6 months in reading, and 5.8 months in maths.  \nAs the national picture shows that any progress made later in the autumn was lost in early 2021, the regional  differences may remain. \nThe research also confirmed that the poorest pupils had lost more learning than average. \nJon Andrews, report co-author and head of analysis at the Education Policy Institute (EPI) said: \n\"Our data analysis points to a clear penalty faced by disadvantaged pupils during the pandemic - these pupils have seen greater learning losses than their more affluent peers, which risks widening the overall gap in educational attainment.\"\nThe research has been published just days after the resignation of Sir Kevan who described government plans to help pupils catch up as \"half-hearted\". \nHe said the government response was \"too narrow\" and was being delivered \"too slowly\". He was reported as having put forward plans costing \u00a315bn.\nHead teachers said they were \"hugely disappointed\" by the  government 's latest  \u00a31.4bn Covid recovery package, calling it a \"damp squib\". \nIt followed an existing commitment to spend \u00a31.7bn in England's schools. \nThe prime minister said there would \"hopefully\" be more money to come in the autumn, as part of the government's wider spending plans. \nBut the influential economic think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) is warning that delaying decisions until the autumn risks being too late to help the pupils most in need of support.\n\"If these losses are not properly addressed, then the long-run costs could easily run into the hundreds of billions as a result of lost skills and productivity,\" the IFS says.\nThe IFS researchers point out that the recovery package is smaller than in other countries.\nThe IFS says \u00a315bn sounds like a lot of money to spend on education recovery, but spread over three years, it would have averaged about \u00a35bn per year, or just over 10% of annual spending on schools pre-Covid.\n\"If it genuinely helped to mitigate the future lost earnings of today's schoolchildren (which could easily run into the hundreds of billions over the coming decades), it could also prove to be a terrific investment,\" it said.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"This research provides further stark evidence of the very severe extent of learning loss among pupils as a result of the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and the particularly severe impact on disadvantaged children.\n\"It is abundantly clear that a recovery programme is urgently required at a scale and scope to address this massive issue.\"\nA spokesman for the Department for Education said: \"We have committed to an ambitious, and long-term education recovery plan, including an investment to date of over \u00a33bn and a significant expansion of our tutoring programme, to support children and young people to make up for learning lost during the pandemic.\""

      "tags": "Concorde,Engineering,Aerospace,Air travel",
      "text": "US airline United has announced plans to buy 15 new supersonic airliners and \"return supersonic speeds to aviation\" in the year 2029.\nSupersonic passenger flights ended in 2003 when Air France and British Airways retired Concorde.\nThe new Overture aircraft will be produced by a Denver-based company called Boom, which has yet to flight-test a supersonic jet.\nUnited's deal is conditional on the new aircraft meeting safety standards.\nSupersonic flight is when an aircraft travels faster than the speed of sound. \nAt an altitude of 60,000ft (18,300m), that means flying faster than 660mph (1,060km/h). \nA typical passenger jet may cruise at about 560mph (900km/h) but Overture is expected to reach speeds of 1,122mph (1,805km/h) - also known as Mach 1.7.\nAt that speed, journey times on transatlantic routes such as London to New York can be cut in half. \nBoom says Overture would be able to make the trip in 3.5 hours, shaving three hours off the flight.\nConcorde, which entered passenger service in 1976, was even faster with a maximum speed of Mach 2.04 - about 1,350mph (2180km/h).\nThere are two major concerns with supersonic passenger travel: noise and pollution.\nTravelling faster than the speed of sound causes a sonic boom, which can be heard on the ground as a loud thunderclap or explosion. It's where the company Boom got its name.\nThe boom limits where the planes can fly. Typically they must lower their speed until they are out over the ocean, away from citizens who may be disturbed by the loud bang.\nBoom says it is confident that its plane will not be any louder than other modern passenger jets while taking off, flying over land and landing. It also hopes improvements in aircraft design since Concorde will help it reduce and mitigate the sonic boom.\nThe other big issue is fuel consumption.\n\"In order to fly supersonic, you will need more power, you will need more fuel,\" Kathy Savitt, Boom's chief commercial officer, told the BBC.\nBut she expects Overture to be operated as a \"net-zero carbon aircraft\".\nCentral to Boom's plan is for Overture to run entirely on sustainable aviation fuel (Saf).\nThat can take the form of \"posh biodiesel\" made out of everything from waste animal fat from the farming industry to specially grown high-energy crops, explains Dr Guy Gratton, associate professor of aviation and the environment at Cranfield University.\nBut one big problem is that \"the world is very far from having anything like the production capacity needed\" to produce enough biofuel to power the entire aviation industry, he says.\nBoom predicts \"power-to-liquid\" processes - where renewable energy such as wind power is used to produce liquid fuel - will make up the shortfall.\n\"We expect that to be commercialised well before it's needed for our purposes,\" explains Boom's Raymond Russell. \n\"There are billions of dollars of both airline commitments and investments across the sector.\"\nBut it remains an industry that needs to be scaled up.\n\"Can you suddenly find an enormous additional supply of sustainable electricity at affordable prices?\" asks Dr Gratton.\n\"I'm not saying it can't be done. It may well be done but it has not been done yet.\"\nDespite the enormous cost of Concorde's development more than 50 years ago, it is thought to have been profitable for British Airways in its final years of operation.\nConcorde was seen as a luxurious way to travel with tickets costing more than a first class seat on a regular jet.\nToday, the wealthiest travellers may favour private business jets, says Dr Gratton.\nRather than travel first class on a commercial jet with the public, the rich can charter compact private planes that fly on demand, directly to-and-from their airports of choice. Avoiding the check-in desk and luggage carousel can shave time off travelling too.\nMs Savitt said Boom's research suggested passengers wanted speed and that faster planes could \"deepen human connections and make better business relationships\".\nUnlike Concorde, the company expects Overture to be profitable for airlines even if tickets are sold for the same price as a \"regular business-class fare\".\nUltimately, it is up to United to set its prices - but it will want to see a return on its $200m-per-plane (\u00a3140m) investment.

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer",
      "text": "The UK regulator has approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15, saying it is safe and effective in this age group and the benefits outweigh any risks.\nThe MHRA said it had carried out a \"rigorous review\" of the vaccine in adolescents.\nThe UK's vaccines committee will now decide whether children should get the jab.\nThe Pfizer vaccine is already approved for use in people aged 16 and over.\nDr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the safety of the vaccine in 12 to 15-year-olds would be carefully monitored.\n\"No extension to an authorisation would be approved unless the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been met,\" she said.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) must now advise government on whether this age group should be vaccinated as part of the UK rollout.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it would be \"guided by the expert advisers and will update in due course\".\nThe Health Secretary Matt Hancock said any decision would be \"clinically based\". He confirmed that the UK had enough supplies to vaccinate children if recommended to by the JCVI.\nAt present, there is no routine vaccination of under 18s against Covid in the UK.\nHowever, current advice is that 16 to 18-years-old who are in a priority group or who live in the same house as someone who is extremely vulnerable, should be offered a Covid vaccine.\nIn general, children's risk of becoming ill with Covid-19 is extremely low and they very rarely need hospital treatment, which is why the focus has been on vaccinating adults, who are more at risk. But the question of whether to protect children is now gathering pace. \nThe EU recently approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 12 to 15-year-olds, and the US and Canada started vaccinating children in this age group earlier this month.\nGermany has indicated it will start vaccinating children over 12 from 7 June.\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the JCVI, said there were lots of complex issues to consider in the UK, including the potential disruption to children's education if cases continued to rise in unvaccinated schoolchildren.\nBut he said the immediate question was \"what to do with the vaccines we have got - if we give them to 12 to 15-year-olds, then we are not giving to other adults who may be more at risk\", he told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme.\nProf Finn said Israel had managed to keep cases low by vaccinating their entire adult population, meaning they did not need to vaccinate children. \nBut the director of public health in Blackburn with Darwen has called for 12 to 18-year-olds to be vaccinated as quickly as possible to help shut down the transmission of the variant first identified in India, known as the Delta variant.\nProf Russell Viner, professor of adolescent health at University College London, said decisions about vaccinating all teenagers should also take potential side effects into account.\n\"The early reports about myocarditis [inflammation of the heart muscle] in young men need to be properly investigated and may not be related to the Pfizer vaccine, however they provide a warning that we should not rush into these decisions.\"\nAlongside the regulator, a UK independent advisory group also analysed data on the quality, effectiveness and safety of the vaccine in adolescents against any potential risk of side effects.\nThe Commission on Human Medicines concluded that \"its benefits outweigh any risk\".\nThe data is based on more than 2,000 children aged 12 to 15-years-old who took part in US trials of the Pfizer vaccine. There were no cases of Covid from a week after the second dose - compared to 16 cases in the placebo group, and the vaccine appeared to work as well in adolescents as in young adults aged 16-25.\nThe vaccine's side effects were usually mild or moderate, including tiredness, headaches, muscle and joint pain, and improved within a few days.\nAdditional safety data from 600,000 adolescents in the US who have had the vaccine will be available soon.\nBut some argue there are ethical issues over vaccinating children that have to be considered too.\n\"We urgently need to increase the supply of the vaccine to vulnerable people at high risk in countries with the greatest need,\" said Prof Dominic Wilkinson, consultant paediatrician and professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford.\n\"It is unethical to give vaccines to people at very low risk in our own country when there are others overseas at much higher risk who are dying.\"\nHalf of the UK adult population has now been fully vaccinated, a quarter has had one dose and the other quarter - around 13 million people - is yet to be vaccinated."

      "tags": "Anthony Fauci,United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The White House has defended the president's top coronavirus adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, amid scrutiny of his recently released work emails.\nDr Fauci has been the face of the nation's Covid-19 response, drawing both praise and criticism.\n\"I'm very confident in Dr Fauci,\" President Joe Biden said on Friday.\nBut emails have raised questions on whether he backed Chinese denials of the theory that Covid-19 leaked from a lab in Wuhan.\nA trove of Dr Fauci's emails covering the onset of the coronavirus outbreak were released this week to media under a freedom of information request.\nIn one email sent last April, an executive at a health charity thanked Dr Fauci for publicly stating that scientific evidence does not support the lab-leak theory.\nIn an interview with CNN, Dr Fauci said the email had been taken out of context by critics and he had an \"open mind\" about the origin of the virus.\nIn his defence, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Dr Fauci had been an \"undeniable asset\".\nIn a daily press briefing on Thursday, she said: \"The president and the administration feel that Dr Fauci has played an incredible role in getting the pandemic under control, being a voice to the public throughout the course of this pandemic.\"\nMr Biden reiterated his support after delivering remarks on Friday, when a reporter asked if he still had confidence in the infectious disease chief. \nThere is no proof Covid-19 came from a lab, but Mr Biden has ordered a review into the matter that angered China, which has rejected the theory.\nChinese authorities linked early Covid-19 cases to a seafood market in Wuhan, leading scientists to theorise the virus first passed to humans from animals.\nBut recent US media reports have suggested growing evidence the virus could instead have emerged from a lab in Wuhan, perhaps through an accidental leak.\nOn Thursday, Dr Fauci maintained there was nothing untoward in an email exchange between himself and an executive from a medical non-profit organisation that helped fund research at a diseases institute in Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid-19 was first reported.\nThe NIH, which is a US public health agency, gave $600,000 (\u00a3425,000) to the Wuhan Institute of Virology from 2014-19 via a grant to the New York-based non-profit group EcoHealth Alliance, for the purpose of researching bat coronaviruses.\nPeter Daszak, head of EcoHealth Alliance, emailed Dr Fauci in April 2020, praising him as \"brave\" for seeking to debunk the lab leak theory.\n\"Many thanks for your kind note,\" Dr Fauci replied.\nDr Fauci told CNN on Thursday it was \"nonsense\" to infer from the email any cosy relationship between himself and the figures behind the Wuhan lab research.\n\"You can misconstrue it however you want,\" he said, \"that email was from a person to me saying 'thank you' for whatever it is he thought I said, and I said that I think the most likely origin is a jumping of species. I still do think it is, at the same time as I'm keeping an open mind that it might be a lab leak.\"\nHe added: \"The idea I think is quite farfetched that the Chinese deliberately engineered something so that they could kill themselves as well as other people. I think that's a bit far out.\"\nAllies of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) infectious disease specialist say Dr Fauci's messages show nothing more than a dedicated public servant navigating the early days of a once-in-a-century pandemic.\nBut conservative critics are suggesting Dr Fauci may have engaged in a cover-up, and even claim he perjured himself in testimony to Congress.\nAccording to an investigation in Vanity Fair magazine published on Thursday, Department of State officials discussed the origins of coronavirus at a meeting on 9 December 2020.\nThey were told not to explore claims about gain-of-function experiments at the Wuhan lab to avoid attracting unwelcome attention to US government funding of such research, reports Vanity Fair.\nGain-of-function studies involve altering pathogens to make them more transmissible in order to learn more about how they might mutate. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that three employees at the Wuhan Institute of Virology fell ill and were admitted to hospital in November 2019, just before the first reported Covid-19 cases.\nDays later, President Biden instructed US spy agencies to conduct a 90-day review into whether the virus could have emerged from a Chinese lab.\nHis administration had previously deferred to the World Health Organization for answers on how the pandemic began.\n\"I would like to see the medical records of the three people who are reported to have got sick in 2019,\" Dr Fauci told the Financial Times on Thursday. \"Did they really get sick, and if so, what did they get sick with?\"\nHe called on China to also release the medical records of six miners who fell ill after entering a bat cave in 2012 in China's Yunnan province.\nThree miners died, and Chinese researchers later visited the cave to take samples from the bats. \n\"It is entirely conceivable that the origins of Sars-Cov-2 was in that cave and either started spreading naturally or went through the lab,\" he said.\nDr Robert Redfield, who led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Trump administration, told Vanity Fair that he received death threats from fellow scientists when he backed the Wuhan lab leak theory last spring.\n\"I was threatened and ostracised because I proposed another hypothesis,\" Dr Redfield said. \"I expected it from politicians. I didn't expect it from science.\"\nDuring congressional testimony on 12 May, Dr Fauci emphatically denied the US had ever funded controversial gain of function research at the Wuhan lab.\nDuring a subsequent Senate hearing on 26 May, Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, asked how Dr Fauci could be sure that Wuhan scientists did not use the money for gain-of-function research.\n\"You never know,\" Dr Fauci conceded, while adding that he believed the Chinese researchers were \"trustworthy\".\nFormer President Donald Trump - widely vilified last year when he raised the possibility that Covid-19 came from the Wuhan lab - said on Thursday that Dr Fauci had a lot of questions to answer.\n\"What did Dr Fauci know about 'gain of function' research, and when did he know it?\" Mr Trump wrote in a statement.\nHe added: \"China should pay Ten Trillion Dollars to America, and the World, for the death and destruction they have caused!\"\nThe same day, House of Representatives deputy Republican leader Steve Scalise demanded in a letter that Dr Fauci testify before Congress on the \"US government's role in funding research that may have contributed to the development of the novel coronavirus\".\nChina's foreign ministry last week dismissed the Wuhan lab leak theory as \"extremely impossible\".\nCovid-19 is known to have infected some 172 million people, killing more than 3.5 million."
