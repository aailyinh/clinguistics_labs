      "text": "Almost 10 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 197 countries worldwide. \nHowever, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world.  \nSome countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but others are some way behind.\nWith an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. \nOverall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with about three billion and 1.6 billion respectively. The US is third, with more than 530 million.\nMany poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine.\nCovax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021, but downgraded its supply forecast as a the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.\nThe scheme has now distributed more than one billion vaccines.\nThe vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. \nUnlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute.\nMost governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. \nThe Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, UK, Europe and other countries. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia.\nEarly studies suggest the newly identified Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. \nA third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 96 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes.\nWorldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. \nOur World in Data, a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, collated the information in the map and table above.\nPopulation figures have been sourced from the United Nations' mid-2021 estimates provided by Our World in Data."

      "text": "Plans to build a bridge or tunnel between Scotland and Northern Ireland have been ruled out due to forecasted costs and engineering challenges.\nA study examining if such a project was possible is expected to advise against proceeding with any proposals when it is released next week.\nThe BBC understands the government will agree with the report's recommendation.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has been a vocal supporter of a fixed link between Britain and Northern Ireland.\nThe Telegraph first reported that transport expert Sir Peter Hendy, who was asked by the government to examine connections between the different parts of the UK, had concluded the project was not currently viable.\nA government source said Sir Peter had examined the costs of a fixed link to Northern Ireland and found \"it would be technically very challenging at the moment\".\n\"That's not to say it won't become viable at some point in the future, but at the moment it would be very, very difficult and expensive,\" the source told the paper.\nThe Department for Transport told the BBC: \"We don't comment on speculation. The Union Connectivity Review will be published shortly.\"\nPlans for some kind of link between Northern Ireland and Scotland stretch back as far as the 1890s.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) revived the idea in its 2015 general election manifesto and Mr Johnson has previously described a bridge as a \"very interesting idea\".\nSome experts suggested such a project would cost \u00a315bn, while others have said that \u00a320bn would be a conservative estimate.\nTwo potential routes for a link were suggested - from Portpatrick to Larne, or near Campbeltown to the Antrim coast.\nIn September, Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said the \"distraction of a \u00a320bn fixed bridge, or three tunnels and a roundabout under the sea\" had \"finally been put to bed\".\n\"We all know around this table what we could do for infrastructure and for our communities with \u00a320bn,\" she said.\nThe 'Boris bridge' idea attracted a considerable amount of scorn but also had its supporters.\nThe DUP were keen on the idea and could point to similar projects like the Hong Kong - Zhuhai crossing, a 34 mile long combination of bridge and tunnel across the Pearl River Delta.\nBut Stormont's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon was exasperated by the idea, calling it a distraction.\nNow that a fixed link has been ruled out, attention will turn to the substance of the union connectivity review.\nOn both sides of the Irish Sea there are more mundane projects which could deliver economic benefits if they are funded."

      "tags": "Liverpool hospital blast,Liverpool",
      "text": "The Liverpool bomber attempted to launch a fresh legal appeal to stay in the UK in January and then began making purchases for his attack in April, it has emerged.\nCounter-terror police said Iraq-born Emad Al Swealmeen rented a property in the city seven months ago.\nHe had suffered from periods of mental illness which will \"form part of the investigation\", they added.\nEarlier police extended a cordon at an address linked to the asylum seeker.\nChristian convert Al Swealmeen, 32, was a passenger in a taxi when his homemade device exploded outside Liverpool Women's Hospital shortly before 11:00 GMT on Remembrance Sunday.\nA post-mortem found he died from injuries caused by the explosion and fire.\nThe driver David Perry escaped seconds before his car was engulfed in flames and has since been discharged from hospital.\nDetails of Al-Swealmeen's immigration legal history provided to the BBC by court officials show he had a long and complicated series of applications and appeals to remain in the country.\nIt remains unclear whether the Home Office tried to remove him after his first failed application to stay more than six years ago and why his final appeal was unresolved. \nAccording to court records provided by officials, Al Swealmeen was first refused asylum in 2014 and also lost further appeals in 2015.\nThe records show in August 2015 he began seeking to convert to Christianity and adopted a new name, Enzo Almeni, as part of the conversion.   \nThey also document that he renewed his immigration appeal under this alternative name in January this year. \nHis submissions were under review at the time of his death and the Home Office has refused to discuss the case with BBC News.\nPolice said Al Swealmeen had lived at a property in Sutcliffe Street in the Kensington area of Liverpool for some time and began renting a property in Rutland Avenue, near Sefton Park, in April.\nAssistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said \"significant items\" had been recovered from the Rutland Avenue address, where searches have been taking place.\nThe cordon was extended around Sutcliffe Street on Wednesday afternoon after several suspicious packages were found, Counter Terrorism Policing North West said.\nBut the cordon was retracted hours later to only cover Sutcliffe Street.\nThe public was warned bomb disposal teams may be present in the area on Thursday, but this will \"be solely out of caution in case further items are found,\" a spokesman added. \nNearby homes were not evacuated but residents living within the cordon were told they could not return home. \nA bomb disposal vehicle attended the scene, along with a fire engine and four police vans.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said the UK terror threat level had been raised from \"substantial\" to \"severe\", meaning an attack is \"highly likely\", because the explosion in Liverpool was the second incident in a month.\nAssistant Commissioner Matt Jukes, the most senior counter-terrorism policing officer in the UK, has urged the public to be vigilant in the run up to Christmas.\nHe told the BBC that in the past terrorist attacks have led to other attacks and that is why the threat level has been raised.\nSheikh Salem Al-Suwailmieen, one of Al Swealmeen's extended family, said in a statement the suspected bomber's mother was from Iraq and confirmed he was born there. \nHe said he lived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), before going to Syria then Turkey and eventually ending up in the UK where he applied for asylum on the grounds that he was Syrian.\nAl Swealmeen had suffered from mental illnesses, he added. \nMersey Care NHS Foundation Trust, which provides mental health services, said Al Swealmeen had received treatment in the past but was not under their care at the time of the explosion.\nMr Jackson, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said: \"A complex picture is emerging over the purchases of the component parts of the device, we know that Al Swealmeen rented the property from April this year and we believe relevant purchases have been made at least since that time.\"\nHe said police were \"not finding any link to others in the Merseyside area of concern but this remains a fast moving investigation and as more becomes known we cannot rule out action against others\".\nOn Monday evening, police released without charge four men who had been arrested under terrorism laws in Liverpool in connection with the attack.\nMalcolm Hitchcott, a Christian activist in Liverpool, said he and his wife offered Al Swealmeen a place to stay for eight months in 2017 after he told them he had lost his case and was destitute.\n\"He was absolutely genuine, as far as I could tell. I was in no doubt by the time that he left us at the end of that eight months that he was a Christian,\" Mr Hitchcott told BBC Radio Merseyside.\nAl Swealmeen was baptised at Liverpool Cathedral in 2015 and confirmed in 2017 but the Diocese of Liverpool's communications director, Stuart Haynes, said they lost contact with him in 2018.\nThe Church of England has said it is not aware of any link between conversion and asylum system abuse after newspaper reports suggested changing religion could be a way to \"game the asylum system\".\nLiverpool Cathedral said it had \"developed robust processes for discerning whether someone might be expressing a genuine commitment to faith\".\nThe Reverend Mike Hindley said Al Swealmeen was also involved in the Emmanuel Church in the Fazakerley area of Liverpool from 2017 to 2019, when they lost touch with him.\nHe said Al Swealmeen, who parishioners knew as Enzo, \"never made a secret\" of the fact he had mental health problems but did not go into great detail about them with him.\nA spokesman for the City of Liverpool College said Al Swealmeen was an adult cake decorating student at the college during the 2018-2019 academic year.\nJoy Gambardella, a lay reader at Emmanuel Church, said he \"used to make cakes for the church and sell them\".\nPraising her \"amazing\" and \"resilient staff\" for their response to the \"traumatic\" incident, Liverpool Women's Hospital chief executive Kathryn Thomson said she had \"no knowledge\" of whether Al Swealmeen had any previous connection to the institution."

      "text": "Germany is in the grip of a \"dramatic\" fourth Covid wave, Chancellor Angela Merkel has said on the eve of a crisis meeting with regional leaders.\nDaily infections hit a new German record of 52,826 on Wednesday as European governments responded to a surge on much of the continent.\nBelgium announced a series of measures in an attempt to avoid a lockdown.\n\"All the alarm signals are red,\" said Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, as he told people to limit personal contact.\n\"Europe's map is quickly going red, and we are the same.\"\nChildren in Belgium will have to wear masks from the age of 10, rather than the current age of 12. Working from home will become compulsory from Saturday for four days a week. Passes known as Covid Safe Tickets will be required in theatres, cinemas and museums.\nA third booster vaccination will be rolled out for all Belgians by the end of April 2022.\nAustria which imposed a lockdown on an estimated two million unvaccinated people on Monday, reported record daily infections on Wednesday. The Netherlands, which also reported record cases, has already brought in a partial lockdown.\nSweden is introducing a Covid vaccination pass from 1 December for the first time for concerts and other indoor events involving more than 100 people. \"You who are unvaccinated cannot just carry on as normal; your most important contribution is to get vaccinated,\" said Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren, who accepted the measure was tough but said Sweden was not isolated from the rest of the world.\nCzech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said anyone who had not been vaccinated (or could show they had had recovered from Covid-19) would be banned from accessing public events or services. From Monday, negative tests would no longer be enough.\nNeighbouring Slovakia, where a record 8,342 cases were reported on Wednesday, is planning similar measures: workplaces and non-essential shops will be accessible only to vaccinated staff or to people who could prove they have recovered, says Prime Minister Eduard Heger.\nVaccination rates vary across the continent. Slovak take-up is among the lowest in the EU at 44% while the Czech rate is 58%, in Austria it is 65% and in Germany 68%. \nBoth Germany and Austria have reported queues at vaccination centres, but they have some of the lowest take-up rates in Western Europe.\nAustria also has a very high incidence rate of 971.5 cases per 100,000 people, far higher than Germany's 319.5. \nAs well as its lockdown for the unvaccinated, some Austrian officials are calling for tighter restrictions for others too, such as a possible night-time curfew.\nAlthough Germany's overall death toll is far lower than that in the UK, 294 deaths have been recorded in 24 hours and Mrs Merkel spoke of an emergency with intensive care beds filling up in hospitals. The UK reported another 201 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for Covid on Wednesday, and a further 38,263 infections.\nMrs Merkel called for a faster booster drive, adding: \"It's not too late to decide to get a first vaccination.\"\nMany German regions are now only allowing vaccinated people access to most services, including bars, cafes, hairdressers and gyms.\nPolitically the situation is complicated as the outgoing Merkel government is set to be replaced by a coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and pro-business liberals who aim to present planned Covid measures to parliament on Thursday.\nFrance is being hit by a fifth wave of Covid, according to government spokesperson Gabriel Attal, with more than 20,000 new cases reported on Wednesday for the first time since Augusts. But there are no plans beyond the current Covid passport as \"we are coping better than previously thanks to the vaccines and the health pass\".\nHe said France was light years away from the situation a year ago, and anyone aged 50-64 could now make an appointment for a third Covid vaccination.\nMore on Merkel: Germany's outgoing chancellor"

Both Princess Eugenie's father, Prince Andrew, and their mutual cousins, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, were reported to be in attendance.\nThe Queen, 95, returned to public engagements on Wednesday, when she was pictured having a face-to-face audience with Gen Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, at Windsor Castle.\nShe had been out of the public eye for nearly a month, after she was advised by doctors to rest following a night in hospital on 20 October for checks.\nHowever, she did undertake some light duties during that time, including meeting ambassadors via video link from Windsor Castle.\nBuckingham Palace had said she intended to attend the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph last week, observing the annual commemorations from the balcony, but on Sunday morning the Queen made the decision to miss the event \"with great regret\".\nAs in previous years, a wreath was laid at the Cenotaph on the Queen's behalf by the Prince of Wales.\nThe back sprain which kept her away is believed to have been unrelated to her doctor's advice to rest."

      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People working from home in Northern Ireland during the first wave of the pandemic \"should be working from home\" again, the health minister has advised.\nRobin Swann said a previous decision to relax the working from home messaging should be reversed, it is understood.\nThe comments formed part of a document issued to the executive on Thursday.\nThis week the Department of Health said more restrictions before Christmas were possible unless transmission of the virus drops significantly.\nOn Friday Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride said: \"No-one should be in any doubt about the seriousness of the situation we are facing into.\n\"Unless we get this virus back under control... what we are looking at is potentially our hospital system being overwhelmed by mid-December,\" he told BBC News NI.\nHowever he said he did not believe that Northern Ireland would \"go back to the damaging impact of lockdowns\".\nDiscussing the topic of Christmas parties, Sir Michael urged people to be \"selective\" about which events they attended and for organisers to do risk assessments in advance.\n\"People should not be cancelling their plans at this stage but they should be thinking of planning carefully to minimise the risk to themselves and others,\" he said.\nMr Swann's advice on working from home came after he instructed officials to draft a paper looking at other ways to improve adherence with existing restrictions.\nIt followed a contentious vote by Stormont ministers to approve Covid-19 vaccine passports for domestic use in Northern Ireland from next month.\nThe plan means people will have to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or proof of a negative coronavirus test result to access nightclubs, pubs or restaurants.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had voted against the proposals but Mr Swann and other Stormont ministers said the use of vaccination status certification would save lives.\nAt present, executive advice on working from home is that people should continue to do so where they can.\nNew Covid-19 advice coming into effect in the Republic of Ireland on Friday is for anyone who can work from home to do so unless it is necessary to do otherwise.\nIrish bars, restaurants and nightclubs will also close at the earlier time of midnight.\nIt is understood that in Mr Swann's document he suggests that a decision taken by the executive on 23 September encouraging employers to \"begin planning a gradual return to the workplace\" for employees should be reversed.\nThe proposal states: \"I believe that message should be reversed to once again advise employees to work from home where they can and to advise employers to support this where possible.\"\nIt goes on to say that the message should be communicated by stating that if a person worked from home when the pandemic began in March 2020 then \"they should be working from home now\".\nAdvice from health officials suggests strengthening the message would help reduce the risk of transmission of coronavirus inside and outside workplaces.\nSir Michael, the chief medical officer, told BBC News NI on Friday that research had shown that working from home was \"one of the single most effective interventions\" to control the virus.\n\"It reduces mixing in the workplace, it reduces infection and transmission in the workplace but also travelling to and from the workplace,\" he said.\n\"There is strong scientific evidence that it is an effective intervention.\"\nHe said the level of transmission of the virus in Northern Ireland needs to be brought \"back under control\".\n\"Now is the time to act, we have time to act, we have a number of weeks to act and take action immediately,\" he said.\nIt is understood that in the advice paper Mr Swann has also proposed giving the Stormont assembly a debate on the Covid passport regulations before they become enforceable on 13 December.\nThe DUP had called for that to happen ahead of the measures taking effect.\nIt is understood that the document also advises ensuring enforcement against those breaching existing Covid restrictions, including people who do not comply with wearing face coverings where they are legally required.\nMr Swann said that unless that happened the public would see \"compliance as unimportant and optional\" and would lessen the benefits of wearing face coverings.\nSDLP MLA Colin McGrath said he believed the police should be enforcing penalties for people not wearing face coverings.\nSir Michael told BBC News NI that wider restrictions had to be considered in sectors \"where we know the risks are higher\".\n\"The Covid certificates for domestic use is one way of putting in those wider restrictions and keeping those higher risk settings open,\" he said.\nThe health minister is also understood to have said in his paper that communications on public health are \"much more effective when delivered with a united voice by all executive ministers\".\nIt is understood the minister is proposing that the executive asks the assembly speaker to allow a debate or an alternative method to allow MLAs to consider the regulations.\nThe executive will have to consider Mr Swann's paper but it is not clear yet when that may happen.\nAlliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw said she was concerned that Northern Ireland was moving \"into a very bleak Christmas for people\".\n\"We want people to enjoy their Christmas but it has to be with risk mitigations in place,\" she said."

      "text": "A wind farm is to become home to a state-of-the-art hydrogen storage facility which could eventually produce enough clean energy to help power the next generation of public transport.\nThe UK government has awarded the project, based at Whitelee Windfarm in East Renfrewshire, \u00a39.4m.\nIt said the project would help Glasgow reach net zero by 2030.\nThe cash will go towards developing the country's largest electrolyser, which converts water into hydrogen.\nThe hydrogen produced can be easily stored and transported to where it is needed.\nSplitting water and capturing the released hydrogen requires energy, and the project will use electricity produced from the wind farm, the largest onshore farm in the UK, to create the gas.\nOne use for the hydrogen generated will be to support local transport. The facility is expected to make so much of the zero-carbon fuel that it could provide the equivalent of enough zero-carbon fuel for 225 buses travelling to and from Glasgow to Edinburgh each day.\nGreg Hands, the UK government's energy and climate change minister, said: \"This first-of-a-kind hydrogen facility will put Scotland at the forefront of plans to make the UK a world-leading hydrogen economy, bringing green jobs to Glasgow, while also helping to decarbonise local transport - all immediately following the historic COP26 talks.\"\nAnd Alister Jack, secretary of state for Scotland, said the project showed \"how serious the UK government is about supporting projects that will see us achieve net zero by 2050\".\nHe added that it had never been more important to \"champion\" projects like this, which embrace new hydrogen technology while creating highly-skilled jobs. \nThe partnership, made up of ScottishPower, ITM Power and BOC, is currently going through the planning process for the new facility and aims to have green hydrogen available to the commercial market by 2023.\nSome argue that for public transport vehicles like buses, hydrogen is too expensive and electricity would be a better, cheaper alternative.\nHowever Dr Graham Cooley, chief executive of ITM Power, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that hydrogen was particularly good for heavy vehicles \"where you value payload\".\nHe said: \"You can make a vehicle that's very long duration - in other words, it can travel a long range without compromising the weight. \n\"If you want to travel a long distance using a battery, you need more and more batteries which makes the vehicles very heavy. You see vehicle manufacture now all over the world rolling out commercial vehicles based on hydrogen which have very long ranges and very short recharging or refuelling time.\"\nMeanwhile, Friends of the Earth Scotland director Richard Dixon argued that green hydrogen should be reserved for \"special uses\" in industry, rather than mainstream uses like public transport.\nHe told the programme: \"It's three times more sensible to use it [renewable electricity] as electricity rather than to use it to turn it into hydrogen - you've lost two thirds of the energy in making the hydrogen and then using it. \n\"We have such a desperate need to convert our homes to electric heating and to convert transport to electricity to get out of fossil fuels. That should be absolute top priority.\""

      "text": "From women learning to be midwives in Afghanistan to eagle hunters in Mongolia, from the Rockies of Wyoming to refugee camps in Calais; Claire Thomas has photographed the world.\nThe photojournalist from rural Carmarthenshire has spent years capturing parts of the planet which are fascinating, picturesque and extremely troubled.\nHer work has been shortlisted for a number of major awards, and featured in the New York Times, Sunday Times and National Geographic.\nShe explains the background to some of her most striking shots.\nClaire, a horse lover since the age of four, spent several summers working on a ranch in Wyoming, USA. \nShe said she hated the long days and hard physical work at first, but fell in love with the place, and returned year after year to care for more than 90 horses. \nIt was here she developed her photography passion, with horses and the Teton Range segment of the Rocky Mountains ideal subjects.\nAfter graduating, Claire continued to travel, and her time in Ghana helped her realise that her photos could make a difference. \nHer pictures were used in a successful charity campaign to help women hiding their HIV and Aids conditions. \nIt helped buy them mattresses, as previously they had to sleep on a cold, hard floor.\nThe photo which convinced Claire to make a full-time living as a photographer was her striking shot of a camel in front of the Great Pyramid of Giza near Cairo. \nIt was published by the National Geographic and Claire said it was \"the moment for me to go for it\".\nClaire said she felt \"most scared\" in the Palestinian city of Hebron on the West Bank. \nShe said on one occasion a group of young students were \"painting signs of peace and hope\". \n\"Soldiers started to run towards them. They saw me taking pictures of the scene, and threw a stun grenade at me. Things like this happened every day.\"\nIn the \"Jungle\" refugee camp in Calais, northern France, she captured the tensions as the authorities demanded its closure.\nClaire's encounters with a number of families in refugee camps in both France and Greece inspired her to spend three years in Iraq to find out why people had left their home countries.\nShe witnessed the destructive nature of conflict in Iraq. \nShe spent time in Qayyarah, south of Mosul in northern Iraq, and photographed firefighters tackling massive flames after Islamic State group militants set oil wells on fire.\nClaire said: \"I began covering the fighting against ISIS, but then I felt I wasn't telling the whole story. \n\"It's kind of easy to romanticise conflict when you focus on the military efforts, so I tried to find a way to get a more intimate, human perspective of the effect of the conflict on the people. \n\"And that's when I had the opportunity to accompany a team of medics who were working just behind the front line. I felt like my pictures had more meaning to tell the human story of conflict, which is shocking.\"\nIn Iraq, Claire was immediately struck by the famine. \nOne photo that remains more powerful than any other for her was of a two-month-old baby called Suleyman being treated by a doctor, Katie Batrouney. \nShe said: \"It was frightening. I'd never seen anything like that - he was severely malnourished. I think we all just assumed that he wasn't going to make it.\"\nBut she later learned that he had lived. \nTwo years after that first photo, having covered the story for The Sunday Times, the newspaper sent her to meet Suleyman and his mother, who were living in a refugee camp.\nClaire spent time in Afghanistan in 2019, before the country was retaken by the Taliban earlier this year. \nWhen she was there, women were able to forge new lives for themselves by going on midwifery courses, for example.\nBut Claire said she dreaded to think of their situation now. \nShe said: \"I have been receiving messages from some of them on a daily basis asking for help to escape, to flee the country. \n\"It was a very interesting, hopeful time and it felt quite safe. Now, of course, I think it's regressed, it's frightening.\"\nAway from conflict, Claire is able to pursue projects that often reflect her love of horses. \nIn the Altai mountains of Mongolia, she has marched with tribes people and learned about Kazakh eagle hunters. \nHer photography has helped put on record such ancient traditions threatened by urban growth and climate change - all a long way from her home village of Idole, a few miles outside Carmarthen.\nBut she said: \"I think we always hope that our work makes a difference. And I think collectively it does.\n \"If there were no photographers, if there were no storytellers, the stories wouldn't be heard.\""

The tariff has been approved by the Utility Regulator.\nPower NI said the increase was due to a rise in prices across the global wholesale gas market.\nIt has about 450,000 domestic customers and this is the second tariff increase it has announced this year.\nIn July, it announced a 6.9% price rise.\nConsumers across Northern Ireland are facing higher prices this winter as gas and electricity providers pass on increasing costs to customers. \nWilliam Steele, customer solutions director for Power NI, said the firm would try to assist customers struggling to pay their bills.\n\"We work very hard to keep our prices as low as possible but regrettably there has been a rapid and sustained increase in wholesale gas prices over recent months,\" he said.\n\"Like other suppliers we have no choice but to pay these increased costs, which feed into the cost of wholesale electricity and have a knock-on effect on our tariffs.\n\"In these challenging times and with such a volatile market we held off making this change for as long as possible, with this price change not coming into effect until January 2022.\n\"As soon as we see an opportunity to reduce prices, we will do so without delay.\n\"For any customers who are worried about paying a bill, please get in contact and we can help you.\"\nThe company said customers could help to offset the increase by ensuring they were on the best payment plan and registering for online billing.\nJohn French, chief executive of the Utility Regulator, said it was unclear how long it would be before global prices began to fall.\n\"The drivers behind this increase are that we have had one of the least windy summers since 1961, meaning generation from cheaper wind power has been very low,\" he said.\n\"This low output from wind has meant that there has been an increased use of conventional gas, coal, and oil fired power stations.\n\"Unfortunately, the cost of gas, coal, and oil has increased significantly on global markets over the last 12 months, and since the wholesale cost of electricity makes up over 60% of a domestic customer's bill these sharp increases impact heavily on Power NI's tariff.\"\nMr French said market analysts were predicting higher wholesale prices \"for the next 18 to 36 months\".\n\"If wholesale prices begin to reduce, our system of regulation in Northern Ireland allows us to act to make sure that reductions are fully passed onto consumers as quickly as possible.\""

      "tags": "Jonathan Ashworth,Social care,Sajid Javid",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion.\nThe Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new \u00a386,000 lifetime limit on costs.\nLabour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change.\nThe PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system.\nThe cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills.\nUnder the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023:\nOn Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246.\nNineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead.\nThe bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. \nDefending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win.\nPushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament.\nThe Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. \nMr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a \"step in the right direction\" and \"an improvement on what we have today\".\nBut he said its plans for calculating the cap were a \"big disappointment\" and \"not as generous as people like me wanted\".\nAfter a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like.\nBut that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place.\nAnd on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable.\nThe vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own.\nRead Laura's blog in full\nUnder the new plans, money spent on living costs such as food, bills and accommodation would not count towards the limit.\nThe threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will be more generous, with people with assets up to \u00a3100,000 able to qualify, rather than \u00a323,250 currently.\nThe government announced last week that only the payments people made out of their own pocket - not those from councils - would count towards the cap.\nLocal authorities will meet care costs beyond the \u00a386,000 cap, which ministers say will be funded through a new health and social care tax.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies for health and social care.\nSally Warren, policy director at the King's Fund health think tank, criticised the change that was \"sprung upon MPs with very little notice and with no impact assessment\".\n\"The change to the social care cap is a regressive step that will leave people with low levels of wealth still exposed to very high care costs,\" she said.\n\"It is likely to mean that some people with moderate assets living in poorer areas will still be forced to sell their home to pay for their care, while wealthier people from richer parts of the country will be protected from this.\"\nWhen asked whether people may still have to sell their homes to pay for care, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: \"I can't predict individual situations.\"\nAfter the vote result, Labour's Liz Kendall, shadow minister for social care, said: \"Tory MPs broke the promise they were elected on that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care.\n\"Instead they voted to tax ordinary working people, while the wealthiest in our country are unaffected.\"\nBut the prime minister said the new system would be \"progressive\" and \"much better\" than the existing one.\n\"Under the existing system nobody gets any support if they have assets of \u00a323,000 or more - now you get support if you have \u00a3100,000 or less, so we're helping people,\" Mr Johnson said.\nHe added: \"We're addressing a longstanding social injustice and it will benefit the people of this country.\"\nLorraine Hershon from Northumberland says her mother Roma, who lives in a care home, has spent \"every penny that she ever earned\" on care.\nDespite selling her house and drawing on her savings, a total bill of \u00a3140,000 and rising has left Roma unable to afford items such as new slippers and clothes, she adds. \nShe says for her mother, 83, selling her home was \"probably the worst thing ever\".\n\"She was a single parent, she worked night and day to have her own home - and then it's all gone,\" Lorraine adds. \n\"Nobody thinks it will happen to them... They have no idea the system is there to suck every penny out of you, regardless of your circumstances.\"\nHow will you be affected by the cap on social care costs?

      "text": "Holidaymakers are being urged to use \u00a3132m worth of unspent vouchers issued during the pandemic before they lose financial protection.\nThe credit notes were offered by travel firms as alternatives to cash refunds when holidays had to be cancelled.\nThe vouchers, backed by the Atol insurance scheme, can be used towards new holidays or exchanged for cash.\nBut the regulator said the refund protection against firms going bust will end on 30 September 2022.\nThe Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) also said travel firms would not longer be able to issue the Atol-protected cover after 20 December. The refund credit notes (RCNs) were issued from March last year, the month of the first UK coronavirus lockdown.\nMichael Budge, head of Atol, which is run by the CAA, said: \"With over \u00a3130m of Atol refund credit notes yet to be redeemed, and international travel opening up again, we want to remind consumers to redeem any unused credits to make sure they do not lose out.\"\nHe said RCNs were a fantastic tool to reassure consumers and support the industry. \nMany travel firms faced ruin if they were forced to hand back huge refunds in cash after large swathes of the industry closed down. But travellers were outraged at being offered credit notes instead of cash refunds, fearing that if firms went bust they would lose money. \nIn July 2020, the CAA decided to cover credit notes under the Atol scheme, and \u00a3131.7m of them remain unspent.\n\"The decision to end the scheme reflects the changing of international travel restrictions with significantly increased demand from consumers over recent months due to the opening up of more destinations.\" Mr Budge said.\nUnder the Atol scheme, if a firm goes out of business holiday costs will be refunded. If it happens when travellers are abroad they will be able to finish their holidays and fly home.\nAll tour operators selling package holidays by air must hold an Atol licence."

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon and Douglas Ross have held a joint visit to a drugs recovery group in a \"united effort\" to tackle Scotland's substance abuse death toll.\nThe SNP and Tory leaders agreed to \"put politics aside\" for their visit to the Bluevale Community Club in Glasgow.\nMr Ross said he would not \"stand in the way\" if ministers look to trial drug consumption rooms in Scotland.\nAnd Ms Sturgeon said she is \"absolutely open minded\" about backing a Tory bid to put a \"right to recovery\" in law.\nDrug-related deaths in Scotland hit a new record high of 1,339 in 2020, with the country suffering by far the highest fatality rate of any country in Europe.\nThe joint visit came about after the first minister challenged Mr Ross to join her in a working-class community, after he accused her of being \"out of touch\" - with the Tory leader responding with an invitation of his own to a drugs recovery group.\nThe Bluevale Community Club in Glasgow's Haghill area is a facility which helps people with addictions, as well as seeking to divert young people away from drugs.\nThe club's founder Kenny Trainer said he hoped it was not a \"one-off photo op\" by the politicians, but \"a turning point\" which could bring about change.\nScott Sharp, 50, has been addicted to heroin since his 30s and has been on methadone for 20 years.\nLast month, for the first time in decades, he come off the opiate substitute in a bid to become completely drug-free.\nHe told his story to the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Tory leader Douglas Ross during their visit.\nScott said: \"I was using on top of my methadone prescription - street valium or anything that could take me away from myself.\n\"It was a case of getting prescription, going to the chemist, going to a drug worker, going to the chemist\u2026 I was just like a mouse on a wheel, going round and round in circles.\"\nHe told BBC Scotland he could have been abstinent sooner if his choice of treatment was better.\n\"I don't think I should have been on this for 20 years,\" he said.\n\"I think maybe a short term prescription should be fine, and then maybe be told about recovery cafes or whatever suits that individual person.\"\nMs Sturgeon said her government had committed \"significant additional investment\" into tackling the \"shameful\" level of drug-related deaths in Scotland.\nHowever she said she would \"readily acknowledge there is much more that we need to do to turn around what is an unacceptable toll that drugs are taking on communities\".\nShe said: \"That is about faster access to treatment, it's about extending rehabilitation, both residential and non-residential, it's about supporting facilities focused on recovery and making sure we are seeing all these services in an integrated and joined-up way.\n\"Because behind all the discussion and terminology we are talking about human brings, real people and real families that are being torn apart by drugs.\"\nMs Sturgeon said she was open minded to a Tory proposal to enshrine a \"right to recovery\" in law, although she said she would need to see the detail of any proposed legislation.\nMeanwhile Mr Ross said he would back ministers in setting up safe consumption rooms, where people can take drugs in a clean and supervised environment.\nPrevious proposals to set up such facilities have failed to progress, with the UK government - which controls key drugs legislation - opposed to them.\nIn August, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he is \"instinctively\" opposed to anything which could \"encourage people to take more drugs\".\nHowever, Scotland's new Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain told MSPs that she could give \"fresh consideration\" to the legality of a \"precise\" and \"specific\" proposal.\nMr Ross said: \"I still have serious reservations about drug consumption rooms, the legality of them and how you police them. There are serious practical problems, but I also believe that when four people every day in Scotland are dying as a result of drug misuse we have to look at all the options.\n\"If the Scottish government bring forward plans to have a pilot scheme in Scotland, I won't stand in the way because I want to look at all the evidence surrounding this.\"\nThe Tory leader said no party had a monopoly on the right answers to the drug deaths crisis, saying it was important to \"show there is a united effort to deal with this national scandal\".\nHe added: \"On issues like this I'm sure people will expect us to leave our party politics to the side and actually work to deal with the situation in front of us.\"\nIt is a rare sight indeed. The first minister is not often seen shoulder to shoulder with the leader of the largest Holyrood opposition party. \nThere has never been much personal warmth between them. It is, after all, only eight months since his party tried to force her from office in a confidence vote. \nYes, they'll appear together at memorial events, in charity photocalls or in the line up to greet the Queen. But teaming up on a major matter of public policy? Not so much. \nThat they have agreed to do so over Scotland's drugs deaths crisis underlines how serious the problem is. \nThat the number of deaths has risen sharply on the SNP's watch means they can ill afford to reject ideas and political support from wherever it comes. \nFor the Conservatives, this is an opportunity for them to be relevant, purposeful and potentially have some of their suggestions adopted by the government. \nThat may not happen often in this session of the Scottish Parliament, where the SNP and Green partnership does not require the votes of other parties to get things done.

      "text": "The first minister and the Scottish Conservative leader are making a joint visit to a drugs recovery group. Why?\nThe visit was arranged after the pair had an exchange about Scotland's drug death rate at First Minister's Questions at Holyrood.\nThe first minister and SNP leader had challenged the Conservative leader to visit a working-class area with her, to see the impact of the Tory UK government bringing an end to the \u00a320-a-week uplift to Universal Credit. \nDouglas Ross agreed to this but also suggested they visit the Bluevale Community Club in Glasgow's Haghill area as he pushed for more action to tackle Scotland's drugs problem.\nHis party want a \"right to recovery\" to be enshrined in law, giving drug users a legal entitlement to receive addiction treatment.\nNicola Sturgeon has said she has an \"open mind\" on the Tory proposals and hopes to find \"maximum common ground\" in dealing with the drugs crisis. \nThey are going to the Bluevale Community Club in Glasgow.     \nIt's a facility which helps those with addictions, as well as diverting young people away from drugs. \nThe club's founder Kenny Trainer said the club was \"a place run by local people for local people, so they get access to the support and services they need.\"\nThe club runs a number of community initiatives including a recovery caf\u00e9, where those with experience of addiction can come together. It also provides access to sports classes.\nMr Trainer said he hoped it was not a \"one-off photo op\", but \"a turning point\" which changed things. \nThe latest annual figures show there were 1,339 drug-related deaths in Scotland last year, a record high for the seventh year in a row.\nThat's an increase of 75 from the 1,264 recorded the previous year.\nIt means Scotland continues to have by far the highest drug death rate recorded by any country in  Europe.\nAnd its rate is more than three-and-a-half times that of England and Wales.\nThe number of drug-related deaths has increased substantially over the past 20 years and is now almost three times higher than it was a decade ago, with the upward trend accelerating since 2013.\nMedicines, such as methadone, are offered to heroin addicts to reduce the risk of fatal overdose.\nHowever, methadone is controversial because it has been implicated in more drug-related deaths than heroin, the drug it substitutes.\nThe Scottish government has pledged to spend an extra \u00a3250m over the next five years in an attempt to reduce the number of deaths, including \u00a320m a year on increasing the number of residential rehabilitation beds across the country.\nThe Scottish Drug Death Taskforce, which was set up in 2019, has also been working to increase the distribution of Naloxone, a medication that can reverse the effects of an opiate-related overdose.\nAlmost two-thirds of ambulance crews are now able to distribute it to people who might need it.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has previously admitted that the number of deaths was \"indefensible\" and \"a national disgrace\", and that her government had not done enough to tackle the problem.\nThe Scottish government has also said it wants to introduce drug consumption rooms - where users take their own drugs under the supervision of medical staff at a special facility. \nHowever, it has faced \"legal barriers\" to doing so as the Misuse of Drugs Act is reserved to Westminster.\nThe prime minister has said that while the number of deaths from drugs was \"utterly tragic\", he was not in favour of any policy which could encourage people to take drugs.\nOpposition parties say cuts to drug rehab and addiction programmes by the Scottish government have had a big part to play in the upward trend in the number of deaths in recent years.\nMr Ross has called on Ms Sturgeon to back his party's proposal for a Right to Recovery Bill.\nThe bill, which has been developed with recovery and treatment experts, would enshrine in law that everyone can access the treatment they need, including a residential rehabilitation place.\nMr Ross has said the system was \"thoroughly broken\", and that \"small steps are not cutting it\". He has warned that \"the crisis is getting worse and spiralling out of control.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the deaths were the \"tragic consequences of years of failure to get to grips with this growing crisis in Scotland and to address the threat posed by drugs\".\nThis started as a political game of invitation ping-pong between the two party leaders.\nMs Sturgeon asked Mr Ross to join her in a working-class community after UK ministers opted to end the \u00a320 uplift to Universal Credit, hoping to hammer home the impact of the policy first-hand.\nMr Ross was loathe to duck the challenge, but responded with one of his own - to visit a drugs recovery group, in light of Scotland hitting a grim new record level of fatalities.\nBoth invitations were loaded with political intent, and delivered in the charged atmosphere of FMQs - but the point-scoring will likely be left behind at Holyrood. \nThis is because the drugs deaths crisis is something that all sides agree should be above petty party politics. It is literally a matter of life and death.           \nThis is the kind of issue on which people will expect even the fiercest of political rivals to put their differences to one side and work together to find solutions."

      "text": "A private investigator has apologised for targeting the Duke of Sussex's ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy for surveillance when they were dating.\nGavin Burrows told the BBC the press had focused on Prince Harry in the 2000s as \"the new Diana\".\nMr Burrows, a witness in ongoing legal cases against the News of the World and the Sun, said he and the press had been \"ruthless\".\nHis claims are yet to be tested in court and are strongly disputed.\nWatch The Princes and the Press on BBC iPlayer here\nPrince Harry is one of several people pursuing legal action against the publisher of the Sun and the News of the World, News Group Newspapers, as well as the owner of the Daily Mirror, over allegations of phone-hacking and other illegal newsgathering activity. \nThe News of the World was Britain's biggest Sunday newspaper until 2011, when the owners shut it down after a series of damaging reports, including that the paper hacked the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. \nNews Group Newspapers accepts a limited amount of unlawful activity occurred at the News of the World.\nHowever, it denies there was any wrongdoing at the Sun and says it has not accepted liability in any of the phone-hacking cases brought against it.\nThe private investigator's claims feature in a BBC documentary that investigates the relationship between the younger princes and the media. Media editor Amol Rajan speaks to journalists about how they were briefed on stories, including claims about the behaviour of the Duchess of Sussex.\nBuckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace released a joint statement to the BBC which was included in the programme.\nIt said: \"A free, responsible and open press is of vital importance to a healthy democracy.\n\"However, too often it is overblown and unfounded claims from unnamed sources that are presented as facts and it is disappointing when anyone, including the BBC, gives them credibility.\"\nMr Burrows' account sheds new light on the background to an impending conflict over the conduct of the press.\nPrince Harry, who has sharply criticised the media and advocated for reform, has so far declined to settle his phone-hacking claim, raising the prospect of a trial.\nFormer BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said the prince battling newspapers in court over allegations of unlawful activity - seemingly driven by \"avenging\" what he sees as unfair treatment of his mother - would be a \"massive\" moment in British public life.\nMr Burrows told the programme there was much greater interest in Prince Harry than in Prince William when he began working for the News of the World in 2000.\n\"As explained to me by a couple of editors, Harry had basically become the new Diana,\" he said.\nEditors had told him putting Prince Harry on the front page sold more copies of newspapers than Prince William, Mr Burrows said.\nThe private investigator said when Prince Harry began dating Ms Davy in 2004, it opened a lucrative new avenue of business as her communications were targeted.\n\"There was a lot of voicemail hacking going on, there was a lot of surveillance work on her phones, on her comms. Chelsy would brag to her friends when she was going to see him,\" he said.\nHe said investigators were interested in her medical records, ex-boyfriends and details of her education.\nMr Burrows apologised, saying he was \"very sorry\" and that he acted this way \"because I was greedy, I was into my cocaine, and I was living in a fake state of grandeur\".\nBut he said there was a \"ruthless\" culture in parts of the media around that time: \"They've got no morals - they absolutely have got no morals.\"\nHe also said he regretted his treatment of Prince Harry. \"I was basically part of a group of people who robbed him of his normal teenage years,\" Mr Burrows said.\nMr Burrows was one of many private investigators employed by UK newspapers during what came to be known as the phone-hacking scandal.\nThe exposure of unethical and sometimes illegal methods of getting information, including accessing voicemails, has prompted a wave of legal cases over the years.\nSolicitor Callum Galbraith, co-ordinating the current legal actions against News Group Newspapers, said the scale of the use of private investigators by the News of the World and other papers was \"absolutely phenomenal\", starting in the early 1990s and continuing to 2011, when police began a new investigation.\nA criminal trial in 2014 heard the News of the World's former royal editor Clive Goodman hacked the messages of Kate Middleton 155 times when she was dating Prince William. He also hacked the phones of both princes, the court heard.\nThe princes felt \"really violated\" and both were initially \"determined\" to resolve their issues with the publisher, said Mr Hunt, the former BBC royal correspondent.\nHe said: \"It's now just one of them who is pursuing it, which is Harry.\"\nWatch the Princes and the Press on BBC iPlayer\nFor more on the story, please subscribe to the podcast Harry, Meghan and the Media."

      "text": "Farmers could turn their poorest land into profitable assets under plans to help rural communities survive.\nLarge-scale investment companies have been buying farms across the country for afforestation - planting trees to offset carbon emissions.\nAbout 12 sites have been sold recently and the Farmers Union of Wales warned of a threat to culture and language.\nA new project called Stump Up for Trees wants to keep land in the hands of people in the area.\nThe group is urging farmers not to sell up, but to look at carbon offset as an opportunity to use land unsuitable for crops themselves. \nA reason big companies outside Wales are buying up the land is to take advantage of Welsh government forestry grants, aimed at encouraging trees to be planted to  improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gases.\nIn the Black Mountains, which straddle Monmouthshire and Powys, thousands of trees have already been planted on land so poor, even sheep do not wander on to its slopes.\nIf they do stray here, it is a farmer's nightmare to get them back. \nThis is common land, but across Wales there are thousands of acres like this covered in bracken, owned by farmers, which is lying largely unused and unprofitable.\nBut it is this land which the Black Mountains tree planters say could now become key to saving family farms and a way of life.\n\"We've seen the wholesale purchase and planting of farms by corporates. As a tree planting charity you'd think we'd think it was great, but actually we think its a disaster,\" said Stump Up for Trees' Keith Powell.\n\"If you destroy the local economy, there are no jobs, no community. It will also affect our food security and we need to have domestic food security.\"\nHe believes there is enough land in Wales for the country to maintain its food security and wants farmers to make the most of \"unproductive land\".\nThe project is working with Coed Cymru, which provides grant advice to farmers.\n\"We are hoping to make it possible for farmers to have other choices (apart from selling to corporations) and farmers are really up for this from the number of inquiries we are getting,\" said director Gareth Davies.\nUnderlining this is the fact London-based utility company UW has invested a large sum of money in the project. \nChief executive Andrew Lindsay believes it is good marketing to be associated with a scheme which is planting trees while not damaging land that could be used for food production.\nHe believes other large companies will come to regret buying up farms simply for carbon offsetting that could remain productive in other ways.\n\"We are definitely seeing big companies coming in with big cheque books saying we've got to plant trees, but its not going to work if it's all about money,\" he added.\n\"Trees matter, but people matter, the rural community is already under pressure.  We want to be perceived as a company that cares about communities.\"\nNFU Cymru has backed the plans, saying it means farmers make the decisions on where trees are planted and livelihoods are protected.\n\"Wales has been exploited before, people from outside Wales have made significant amounts of money and we need to make sure people in Wales benefit from the opportunity that Wales can provide,\" said chief executive John Davies.\nFarmers Union of Wales county executive for Gwent and Glamorgan Sharon Pritchard said it was important rural communities kept a \"united front\".\n\"It's a massive threat. I was in Maesteg last week where we are talking in the last couple of years over 500 acres had been sold to an outside-of-Wales purchaser, so that grant funding is accessed by that person outside of wales,\" she said.\n\"That money is lost to Welsh agriculture. We are seeing it on a weekly basis, worries and concerns that prime agricultural productive land is being taken out of food production.\""

I don't know. \n\"Is that enough for other people to feel safe?  Personally for ourselves it hasn't been,\" he said.\nThe independent review into the riot will look at the background to the violence and see if lessons can be learned.\nDet Insp Gareth Jones, of South Wales Police, said: \"Thirty-seven people have been arrested in connection with the incident in Mayhill, and files have been submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service and we are awaiting charging decisions.\n\"This is a very complex investigation and I appreciate the concerns that the local community may have, and our work continues to ensure that those responsible for actions that risked the lives of local people are brought to justice.\"\nSioned Williams, Plaid Cymru MS for South Wales West, said the close-knit Mayhill community pulled together after the incident. \n\"One rather elderly said to me 'you know what? It's one of the best things that happened to this place', and I couldn't believe what she was saying.\n\"She had her tongue very firmly in her cheek when she said it, but what she meant was, is that the authorities now respond to problems a lot quicker than they used to, and I think that's rather unforgivable.\"\nShe said there are communities across Wales facing similar social and economic problems to those some households in Mayhill have faced.\n\"Whatever actually sparked those violent events in Mayhill, there's been a lack of action on the social problems that are definitely a root cause of this kind of violence, and we have to tackle that inequality,\" she said.\nAdam Romain said he believed he could be suffering from PTSD and struggles with remembering and retaining information.\nHe is now setting up a new home away from Mayhill but hopes those involved will be dealt with.\n\"They have to think about their actions and have time to reflect,\" he said.\n\"I'm concerned that they will not get that and they need help and guidance, that's what I feel.\""

      "text": "Councils across the UK are to be forced to care for some of the unaccompanied asylum seeker children who have arrived via the English Channel in small boats.\nImmigration minister Kevin Foster said the decision was not taken lightly but was in the children's best interests.\nAuthorities will take children now being looked after by Kent and other councils on England's south coast.\nMore than 100 children are living in hotels because of a shortage of places in children's homes. \nThe change will see all 217 UK authorities with social services departments obliged to accept an allocation of the children. \nThe Home Office said it was taking \"urgent steps\" to allocate places in care for asylum-seeking children.\nIt has sent councils across the UK a letter giving them two weeks to present reasons why they should not accept them.\nThe letter says they will not need to accept more asylum-seeking children if they are already caring for a number that makes up 0.07% of their general child population.\nThe government will pay councils \u00a3143 per child per night under the scheme.\nSpeaking in the Commons on Monday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said councils around the UK needed to \"play their part\" in offering accommodation to asylum seekers.\nThe vast majority of councils have already offered places to unaccompanied children, according to Nick Forbes, chairman of the Local Government Association's asylum, refugee and migration taskforce.\nBut the Labour politician told the BBC he was \"very disappointed\" that about 15 to 30 councils - out of 217 - were yet to take any children.\nMr Forbes, who is also the leader of Newcastle City Council, said some local authorities were reluctant to volunteer due to the \"chaotic asylum system\" and national shortage of social workers and foster care placements.\nIt comes as the number of migrants to have reached the UK by boat this year has risen to more than three times the 2020 total. The Home Office said 886 people arrived on Saturday, bringing the 2021 total to more than 25,700. The figure for last year was 8,469.\nHowever, increased security and Covid restrictions have made traditional routes less viable for migrants and the overall number of people to have claimed asylum in the UK in the 12 months ending June 2021 was 31,115, a 4% year-on-year fall.\nThe people who cross the Channel come to the UK from the poorest and most vulnerable parts of the world - including Yemen, Eritrea, Chad, Egypt, Sudan and Iraq.\nUnder international law, people have the right to seek asylum in whichever country they arrive, and there is nothing to say they must seek asylum in the first safe country. It is very hard to apply to the UK for asylum unless you are already in the country.\nEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the government decision to compel councils to take unaccompanied children was \"important\". He said it \"should reduce the unacceptable delays in vulnerable children, who have often experienced great trauma, getting the vital care they need\".\nHowever, local government sources say there are concerns about the funding councils - which are already under financial pressure - will receive.\nThe Conservative leader of the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, Councillor James Jamieson, said: \"These new arrangements must continue to swiftly take into account existing pressures in local areas.\"\nThe home secretary criticised Scottish councils in the Commons on Monday for the numbers of children they had taken.\nKelly Parry, an SNP councillor who speaks for the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, said they were committed to participating on a voluntary basis and were already providing a \"proportionate share\" of placements.\nAdditional reporting by Alex Kleiderman and Dulcie Lee"

      "text": "Carina, a yoga teacher in Vienna, is not vaccinated against Covid-19 and wants to remain that way. \nSo she is now under lockdown, like around two million other unvaccinated Austrians.\nShe is only allowed to leave her home for essential reasons like work or shopping for food, and is barred from caf\u00e9s and restaurants. So I met her in a Vienna park, where she is allowed to take exercise. \nCarina says she doesn't understand the rationale behind the lockdown and that it makes her feel sad.\n\"I was walking by some cafes this morning,\" she told me. \"It's a bit strange to look inside and to know that I couldn't go in. It makes you feel really excluded, and ostracised.\" \n\"I'm one of these people that is made into the enemy,\" she said. \"And that doesn't sit well.\"\n\"I don't want people to get sick. I am careful. I get tested. I'm not at very great risk [from Covid-19] and I feel like it's a very personal decision. I understand people who do get vaccinated and when people don't want to get vaccinated.\"\nThere have been demonstrations in several parts of the country in protest against the lockdown. \nPolice say they'll carry out random spot checks on people in public places and fine anyone who can't show a certification of vaccination or recovery. \nAround 65% of Austria's population is fully vaccinated, one of the lowest rates in western Europe.\nThe country is currently seeing the highest rate of daily infections for Covid-19 since the pandemic began.\nChancellor Alexander Schallenberg says the government was forced to act because of the surge in new infections.\nHe said the vaccination rate was \"shamefully low\" and would \"keep us trapped in a vicious circle, from one lockdown to the next\".\nSince the measures tightened, more Austrians have been getting jabbed. Long lines have formed outside one Vienna vaccination centre. Some were coming for booster shots, others for their first injections. \nDr Thomas Szekeres, head of the Austrian Medical Chamber, says he is hoping the vaccination rate will rise to 80% or more.  \n\"We know that vaccination is the only way to decrease the number of infections,\" he says. \"We know this from other countries. We hope that the lockdown for unvaccinated Austrians will be enough to decrease the number of infections. But the experts are not sure about that. Maybe we will need additional measures to reach the goal to decrease the number.\"\nMany Austrians have welcomed the increase in vaccinations, but some are concerned the lockdown for the unvaccinated isn't constitutional.\nKarl Weller, a Viennese businessman, told me he is very much in favour of the jab. \"It is necessary for our health and our economy,\" he said. \n\"But I think it's a catastrophe, to divide between the vaccinated and not vaccinated. People start to become more and more angry and they are afraid.\"\n Shopping for clothes and other non-essentials is now only possible for the vaccinated. \nDoris, who was out in central Vienna, said she was losing patience with those who refuse to get jabbed. \n\"The only solution is that we all have to be vaccinated. That's the only solution. Otherwise, we have the problem for quite a long time. And we really want to get rid of it.\""

Several school children and grandparents were among the victims.\nWarning: This article contains upsetting content.\nThe victims named on Monday were:\nThey include members of the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies, who are a regular fixture in the city's parades.\n\"Our group was doing what they loved, performing in front of crowds in a parade putting smiles on faces of all ages,\" the group wrote in a statement on Facebook. \"Those who died were extremely passionate Grannies.\"\nOn Monday night hundreds of people gathered for a candlelight vigil at Waukesha's Cutler Park to remember the victims. Braving freezing conditions, community members listened as an interfaith service read out the names of the victims and volunteers handed out sandwiches, hot chocolate and candles to mourners. \nMayor Shawn Reilly told the crowd that the event was the \"beginning of many nights where we will grieve and mourn for those we lost\".\nDozens of people still remain in hospital. Police said the injured were taken to six area hospitals by first responders as well as other residents who were at the parade.\nEighteen children were admitted after the incident, the Children's Wisconsin paediatric hospital told reporters on Monday.\nCare providers described the incident as one of the state's largest mass casualty events involving children in recent history. Physicians said some children sustained serious head injuries and broken bones. \nThe injured range in age from three to 16 and include three sets of siblings, medical staff said. Ten children required treatment in the intensive care unit. \nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee said one of its priests, multiple parishioners and students at a local Catholic school were also among the injured.\n\"A lone subject intentionally drove his maroon SUV through barricades and into a crowd of people that was celebrating the Waukesha Christmas parade,\" city police chief Dan Thompson told reporters at a news conference on Monday. \nHe added that an officer had fired shots at the vehicle, but had to stop due to the number of people on the street.\nPolice said they were responding to a domestic incident involving Mr Brooks when he fled the scene and mowed through the parade crowd. Earlier media reports suggested he was escaping a knife fight, but police have not confirmed those details.\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper reported Mr Brooks is currently facing at least five other criminal charges - including for domestic abuse and battery - and had been released from jail on bond just two days earlier. BBC News has also reviewed the records belonging to the suspect.\nIn a statement on Monday, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, said the bail recommendation in Mr Brooks' open court case was \"inappropriately low in light of the nature of recent charges and the pending charges\" against him.\nMr Brooks is from the city of Milwaukee, about 24 km (15 miles) east of Waukesha.\nThe parade in Waukesha - a community of about 72,000 located to the west of Milwaukee - is traditionally held every year on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, and includes fancy dress, floats, dancers and marching bands. This year's theme was \"comfort and joy\". \nFamilies lined the sides of the road to watch the event, which was returning after a year's absence due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nLocal resident Angelito Tenorio told the Journal Sentinel he had just finished marching in the parade when the SUV \"put the pedal to the metal and just [started] zooming full speed along the parade route\" at about 16:40 (22:40 GMT) on Sunday. \n\"Then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle,\" he said. \nCorey Montiho, whose daughter's dance team was hit by the SUV, told the paper: \"There were pom-poms and shoes and spilled hot chocolate everywhere. I had to go from one crumpled body to the other to find my daughter.\"\nSarah Saldivar, who was at the parade with her two young children, told CBS News she saw \"a red blur\" and then saw \"little girls flying through the air\".\nOne video shared on social media shows the car crashing at high speed through street barriers, while another shows the vehicle driving into what looks like a group of musicians.\nPolice officers ran down the street during the incident, telling people to take shelter in shops. \nMayor Shawn Reilly described the incident as a \"horrible, senseless tragedy\". \n\"I am deeply saddened to know that so many in our community went to a parade but ended up dealing with injury and heartache,\" he said.\nPresident Joe Biden said he was praying for the community and \"monitoring the situation very closely\".\nWisconsin Governor Tony Evers has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff across the state in honour of the victims.\nWaukesha's public schools were closed on Monday, and counselling services were made available to those affected.\nA community fund has been created to help victims of the incident. \nWere you at the parade?

The refund credit notes (RCNs) were issued from March last year, the month of the first UK coronavirus lockdown.\nMichael Budge, head of Atol, which is run by the CAA, said: \"With over \u00a3130m of Atol refund credit notes yet to be redeemed, and international travel opening up again, we want to remind consumers to redeem any unused credits to make sure they do not lose out.\"\nHe said RCNs were a fantastic tool to reassure consumers and support the industry. \nMany travel firms faced ruin if they were forced to hand back huge refunds in cash after large swathes of the industry closed down. But travellers were outraged at being offered credit notes instead of cash refunds, fearing that if firms went bust they would lose money. \nIn July 2020, the CAA decided to cover credit notes under the Atol scheme, and \u00a3131.7m of them remain unspent.\n\"The decision to end the scheme reflects the changing of international travel restrictions with significantly increased demand from consumers over recent months due to the opening up of more destinations.\" Mr Budge said.\nUnder the Atol scheme, if a firm goes out of business holiday costs will be refunded. If it happens when travellers are abroad they will be able to finish their holidays and fly home.\nAll tour operators selling package holidays by air must hold an Atol licence."

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "tags": "Jonathan Ashworth,Social care,Sajid Javid",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion.\nThe Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new \u00a386,000 lifetime limit on costs.\nLabour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change.\nThe PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system.\nThe cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills.\nUnder the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023:\nOn Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246.\nNineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead.\nThe bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. \nDefending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win.\nPushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament.\nThe Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. \nMr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a \"step in the right direction\" and \"an improvement on what we have today\".\nBut he said its plans for calculating the cap were a \"big disappointment\" and \"not as generous as people like me wanted\".\nAfter a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like.\nBut that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place.\nAnd on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable.\nThe vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own.\nRead Laura's blog in full\nUnder the new plans, money spent on living costs such as food, bills and accommodation would not count towards the limit.\nThe threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will be more generous, with people with assets up to \u00a3100,000 able to qualify, rather than \u00a323,250 currently.\nThe government announced last week that only the payments people made out of their own pocket - not those from councils - would count towards the cap.\nLocal authorities will meet care costs beyond the \u00a386,000 cap, which ministers say will be funded through a new health and social care tax.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies for health and social care.\nSally Warren, policy director at the King's Fund health think tank, criticised the change that was \"sprung upon MPs with very little notice and with no impact assessment\".\n\"The change to the social care cap is a regressive step that will leave people with low levels of wealth still exposed to very high care costs,\" she said.\n\"It is likely to mean that some people with moderate assets living in poorer areas will still be forced to sell their home to pay for their care, while wealthier people from richer parts of the country will be protected from this.\"\nWhen asked whether people may still have to sell their homes to pay for care, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: \"I can't predict individual situations.\"\nAfter the vote result, Labour's Liz Kendall, shadow minister for social care, said: \"Tory MPs broke the promise they were elected on that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care.\n\"Instead they voted to tax ordinary working people, while the wealthiest in our country are unaffected.\"\nBut the prime minister said the new system would be \"progressive\" and \"much better\" than the existing one.\n\"Under the existing system nobody gets any support if they have assets of \u00a323,000 or more - now you get support if you have \u00a3100,000 or less, so we're helping people,\" Mr Johnson said.\nHe added: \"We're addressing a longstanding social injustice and it will benefit the people of this country.\"\nLorraine Hershon from Northumberland says her mother Roma, who lives in a care home, has spent \"every penny that she ever earned\" on care.\nDespite selling her house and drawing on her savings, a total bill of \u00a3140,000 and rising has left Roma unable to afford items such as new slippers and clothes, she adds. \nShe says for her mother, 83, selling her home was \"probably the worst thing ever\".\n\"She was a single parent, she worked night and day to have her own home - and then it's all gone,\" Lorraine adds. \n\"Nobody thinks it will happen to them... They have no idea the system is there to suck every penny out of you, regardless of your circumstances.\"\nHow will you be affected by the cap on social care costs?

      "title": "What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust?",
      "tags": "Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Bulb",
      "text": "Together Energy is the latest UK supplier to collapse due to rising gas prices. \nTwenty-eight energy companies have stopped trading in the UK since August, including Bulb, which is being managed separately because of its size. \nMore than three million customers have seen their energy firm collapse since the summer, though most suppliers are tiny compared to Bulb. \nOfgem said a new supplier will be found for Together Energy's 176,000 domestic customers, whose supply will continue without interruption. \nThe other companies which have already gone out of business are: \nAmpoweruk Ltd, Avro, Bluegreen, CNG Energy Limited, Colorado Energy, Daligas, Enstroga, Entice, Goto, Green, Hub, Igloo Energy, MA Energy Limited, Money Plus, Neon Reef, Omni Energy Limited, Orbit Energy, People's Energy, PFP, Pure Planet, Social Energy Supply, Symbio Energy, Utility Point, Zebra Power Limited and Zog Energy.  \nFirms have struggled because they offered customers cheap fixed deals. That meant they couldn't pass on the cost of soaring gas prices.\nIf your energy provider goes bust, you still receive gas and electricity. \nBecause of its size, Bulb has been put into an arrangement called \"special administration\". \nThe company is being run as normal by administrators Teneo, until a buyer can be found or its customers can be moved elsewhere. In the short-term, it means Bulb customers haven't been been transferred to another provider, and don't have to do anything. \nThe accounts held by the other failed firms are automatically moved to a new supplier by energy regulator Ofgem.\nYou can't choose the provider and may end up on a more expensive tariff.\nOfgem has sent customers to the following suppliers: \nOfgem and Citizens Advice both recommend making a note or taking a photo of your meter reading and downloading any bills, while waiting for your new supplier to get in touch.\nThere's no need to cancel direct debits.\nIf you're in credit, the balance will be added to your account with your new supplier. However, this may take several weeks.\nIf you're in debt to a company which has stopped trading, you still have to pay the money you owe. You will be contacted by its administrators, or the supplier which takes over its business.   \nIt's unlikely. \nUsually, consumers are encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise. \nBut at the moment better offers simply aren't available. In particular, people already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nThose coming to the end of fixed deals will be moved on to higher standard tariffs.\nA tariff set at the price cap limit - the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard deal - will be the most competitive.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, the Energy Saving Trust says simple changes to our homes and energy habits could help offset the current price rises.\nThe price cap sets the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The level of the cap is reviewed every six months.\nIt's the reason energy suppliers haven't been able to pass on all of the recent wholesale gas price increases.\nAbout 15 million households in England, Wales and Scotland saw a 12% rise in their energy bills on 1 October, when a higher price cap took effect.\nOfgem has now said it will review how the price cap is calculated to make sure it accurately reflects the risks faced by companies. \nIt will publish its conclusions in February, and a new price cap will be announced before it is implemented in April 2022.\nIn Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market, a number of suppliers have also announced price increases in recent months.\nA worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies has meant gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia have risen dramatically. \nSupplies of renewable energy in Great Britain were also reduced by the least windy summer since 1961. \nA fire at a National Grid site in Kent closed a power cable supplying electricity from France. \nRising gas prices also led to a shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is widely used in the food and drink industry."

      "tags": "Environment",
      "text": "Is this the start of a green revolution?\nRevolutions are often born out of crises and the government's long awaited plan to start a green industrial revolution is a central part of its ambition to \"build back better\" after the economic shock of the coronavirus crisis.\nBut does this plan deliver?\nThe eye-catching and headline-grabbing abolition of new petrol and diesel cars a decade earlier than originally planned has been welcomed by environmental groups. \nIt puts the UK toward the front of the pack in the electric vehicle race and was also widely expected in a year when the UK needed to demonstrate the kind of leadership required of the next hosts of the world's biggest environment summit COP 26. \nInvestment in capturing carbon at the point it is burnt and burying it deep underground has also been seen as an essential part of the roadmap to net zero.\nThere was also money for new nuclear - big and small - and a drive to make new homes more efficient by retro-fitting old ones with better insulation, or replacing old gas boilers with new electric pumps which convert and concentrate heat underground into central heating for our homes. \nA pilot to replace 600,000 home heating systems a year by 2028 sounds like a lot - but it's hard to exaggerate the scale and cost of the task involved in replacing 25 million gas boilers. \nIf that happens, this will be a revolution that won't be about international summits, climate protests, or huge and distant infrastructure projects. It's a revolution that is coming to our front doors and inside our cupboards.  \nHeating is the single biggest contributor to carbon emissions, and the Committee on Climate Change says this will be the hardest nut to crack and on its own could cost up to \u00a3500bn.  \nThat's the problem for many. Today's commitment of \u00a34bn in new money seems like a very small sum to be considered evidence that a \"revolution\" is under way. \nIn its defence, the government will rightly point out that a little bit of government money and political will can generate a lot of private investment. It will also point to the fact that the Covid crisis has limited its ability to commit right now to future spending. \nCritics cry that if there is a bigger crisis than coronavirus, it is climate change and there are no vaccines for this one on the horizon. \nBut in one way there is a mini-revolution here. \nIn the past, and in the parsimonious eyes of treasury officials, green stuff = cost. There is now a new orthodoxy that green stuff = jobs. \nThe government is very keen for these measures to be seen as not only steps towards hitting a climate target but a way of creating jobs in a post-Covid world. \nThe bigger the project, the more jobs it creates, the more favourably the government will look at it. \nThat's a new shade of green for a Conservative government.

      "text": "Farmers could turn their poorest land into profitable assets under plans to help rural communities survive.\nLarge-scale investment companies have been buying farms across the country for afforestation - planting trees to offset carbon emissions.\nAbout 12 sites have been sold recently and the Farmers Union of Wales warned of a threat to culture and language.\nA new project called Stump Up for Trees wants to keep land in the hands of people in the area.\nThe group is urging farmers not to sell up, but to look at carbon offset as an opportunity to use land unsuitable for crops themselves. \nA reason big companies outside Wales are buying up the land is to take advantage of Welsh government forestry grants, aimed at encouraging trees to be planted to  improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gases.\nIn the Black Mountains, which straddle Monmouthshire and Powys, thousands of trees have already been planted on land so poor, even sheep do not wander on to its slopes.\nIf they do stray here, it is a farmer's nightmare to get them back. \nThis is common land, but across Wales there are thousands of acres like this covered in bracken, owned by farmers, which is lying largely unused and unprofitable.\nBut it is this land which the Black Mountains tree planters say could now become key to saving family farms and a way of life.\n\"We've seen the wholesale purchase and planting of farms by corporates. As a tree planting charity you'd think we'd think it was great, but actually we think its a disaster,\" said Stump Up for Trees' Keith Powell.\n\"If you destroy the local economy, there are no jobs, no community. It will also affect our food security and we need to have domestic food security.\"\nHe believes there is enough land in Wales for the country to maintain its food security and wants farmers to make the most of \"unproductive land\".\nThe project is working with Coed Cymru, which provides grant advice to farmers.\n\"We are hoping to make it possible for farmers to have other choices (apart from selling to corporations) and farmers are really up for this from the number of inquiries we are getting,\" said director Gareth Davies.\nUnderlining this is the fact London-based utility company UW has invested a large sum of money in the project. \nChief executive Andrew Lindsay believes it is good marketing to be associated with a scheme which is planting trees while not damaging land that could be used for food production.\nHe believes other large companies will come to regret buying up farms simply for carbon offsetting that could remain productive in other ways.\n\"We are definitely seeing big companies coming in with big cheque books saying we've got to plant trees, but its not going to work if it's all about money,\" he added.\n\"Trees matter, but people matter, the rural community is already under pressure.  We want to be perceived as a company that cares about communities.\"\nNFU Cymru has backed the plans, saying it means farmers make the decisions on where trees are planted and livelihoods are protected.\n\"Wales has been exploited before, people from outside Wales have made significant amounts of money and we need to make sure people in Wales benefit from the opportunity that Wales can provide,\" said chief executive John Davies.\nFarmers Union of Wales county executive for Gwent and Glamorgan Sharon Pritchard said it was important rural communities kept a \"united front\".\n\"It's a massive threat. I was in Maesteg last week where we are talking in the last couple of years over 500 acres had been sold to an outside-of-Wales purchaser, so that grant funding is accessed by that person outside of wales,\" she said.\n\"That money is lost to Welsh agriculture. We are seeing it on a weekly basis, worries and concerns that prime agricultural productive land is being taken out of food production.\""

      "tags": "Social care",
      "text": "Boris Johnson said his speech to the CBI conference had \"gone over well\".\nReally? The prime minister has always played up the characteristics that set him apart from most politicians: gags, gaffes, informality, a shirt that's not quite tucked in. Given where he's ended up, with a historic majority, it hasn't exactly served him badly.\nIndeed for his backers it's precisely that personality that appeals to so many voters - he's not the same as the grey, managerial class of politician which provokes so many cries of \"They're all the same\".\nBut was his rambling appearance at the lectern on Monday any different? The prime minister lost his place in his notes, appeared to be side-tracked about his visit to Peppa Pig World and at one point seemed to compare himself to the Biblical figure of Moses.  It even prompted one reporter to ask Mr Johnson: \"Is everything OK?\"\nEveryone can have a bad day at the office, of course. And on a different occasion the Tories might have been able to laugh off what happened. But being asked how you are is not the kind of question that any prime minister would want to be posed.\nAnd many Conservatives are querying exactly what is going on in Downing Street at the moment.\nAfter a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Mr Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like.\nBut that is really not what panned out. If anything it gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place.\nOn Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable.\nThe vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own. There is a tribe of Conservative MPs not angry enough to beat its political masters, but disappointed enough to withhold full support.\nThere is also tangible concern about what is going on in Downing Street. One senior MP and former minister, a friend of Mr Johnson, said there were \"amateurs\" in Number 10 and complained about shortfalls in the operation.\nOthers, even inside Downing Street, are urging cabinet ministers to insist on improvements, saying: \"There is a lot of concern in the building... It's just not working.\" \nMr Johnson's political style does not rely on things always going smoothly, and the idea that the huge commitments this government has made would be pushed through without political disquiet is nonsensical.\nBut the prime minister's list of problems seems only to grow. His party's faith in his power to fix them seems to be going the other way.\nWhat neither his backers or detractors can be sure of is whether this autumn is the beginning of a significant slide or a nasty, and perhaps predictable, case of mid-term blues."

      "tags": "Eddie Redmayne,Film,LGBT,Transgender people",
      "text": "Actor Eddie Redmayne has said playing a transgender character in 2015 film The Danish Girl was \"a mistake\".\nThe British star was nominated for an Oscar for his role as Lile Elbe, one of the first people in the world to have gender reassignment surgery. \nThe film was praised by some at the time but others felt a trans actor should have been cast in the role.\n\"No, I wouldn't take it on now. I made that film with the best intentions, but I think it was a mistake,\" he said.\n\"The bigger discussion about the frustrations around casting is because many people don't have a chair at the table,\" Redmayne told The Sunday Times.\n\"There must be a levelling, otherwise we are going to carry on having these debates.\"\nThe Danish Girl was released months after Redmayne won the Oscar for best actor for playing Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything.\nAt the time, the star admitted there had been \"years of cisgender success on the back of trans stories\" and said he hoped more trans actors could play trans parts in the future.\nBut he added that any actor \"should be able to play any sort of part if one plays it with a sense of integrity and responsibility\".\nThe following year, after being criticised for appearing to suggest that The Danish Girl had helped bring trans issues to mainstream attention, he said it was \"an honour to be part of this conversation in some small way\" and that he was \"an ally of the trans community\".\nIn response to his latest comments, a spokesperson for trans charity Gendered Intelligence said trans representation on screen had \"come on leaps and bounds\" since The Danish Girl was released and \"a consensus is being reached that trans actors for trans roles should be de rigueur\".\nThey said: \"Not only does this help abate the possibility of telling our stories in unnecessarily denigrating ways, but the authenticity of trans actors playing trans parts means stories are being told in a more meaningful way for actors and viewers alike.\n\"We're increasingly hopeful that stories about and for trans people can be told by those actors themselves, with more diverse talent both on screen and behind the camera.\"\nRedmayne, who starred in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, also backed members of the trans community after author JK Rowling posted tweets taking issue with the phrase \"people who menstruate\".\n\"I disagree with Jo's comments. Trans women are women, trans men are men and non-binary identities are valid,\" the actor said in a statement.\nHe also later criticised the \"vitriol\" she faced and acknowledged the abuse aimed towards trans people online was \"equally disgusting\".\nRedmayne is currently starring alongside Jessie Buckley in a new production of Cabaret at London's Playhouse Theatre.\nThe actor's casting as The Emcee, a role that has often been played by LGBTQ+ actors since it first premiered on Broadway in 1966, has also attracted criticism.\n\"Of all the characters I've ever read, this one defies pigeonholing. I would ask people to come and see it before casting judgment,\" Redmayne told The Sunday Times."

      "text": "Tens of thousands of people have been marching in the Belgian capital, Brussels, to protest against anti-Covid measures. \nSome protesters threw fireworks at police officers, who intervened with tear gas and water cannon.  \nDemonstrators are mainly opposed to the use of Covid passes, which stops the unvaccinated from entering venues such as restaurants or bars.\nThis comes after fresh protests in the Netherlands against new lockdown rules.\nOn Saturday, people hurled fireworks at police and set fire to bicycles in The Hague, one night after protests in Rotterdam turned violent and police fired gunshots.\nThousands of demonstrators also took to the streets in Austria, Croatia and Italy as anger mounted over new curbs.\nIn Belgium, rules on face masks have been tightened, including in places such as restaurants where Covid passes are already required, and most Belgians will also have to work from home four days a week until mid-December. There are also plans to make vaccinations for health workers compulsory.\nEarlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was \"very worried\" about rising coronavirus cases on the continent.\nIts regional director, Dr Hans Kluge, told the BBC that unless measures were tightened across Europe, half a million more deaths could be recorded by next spring.\n\"Covid-19 has become once again the number one cause of mortality in our region,\" he said, adding \"we know what needs to be done\" in order to fight the virus - such as getting vaccinated, wearing masks, and using Covid passes.\nMany governments across the continent are bringing in new restrictions to try to tackle rising infections. A number of countries have recently reported record-high daily case numbers. \nIn the Netherlands, a second night of riots broke out on Saturday in several towns and cities.\nHooded rioters set fire to bicycles in The Hague, as riot police used horses, dogs and batons to chase the crowds away. Officials announced an emergency order in the city, and at least seven people were arrested.\nPolice said a rock was thrown through the window of an ambulance carrying a patient. Officers in the city tweeted that five police officers were injured, with one taken away by ambulance with a knee injury.\nElsewhere in the country, two top-flight football matches were briefly halted after supporters broke into the grounds and ran on to the pitch. Fans are currently banned from stadiums because of new coronavirus rules.\nThe unrest followed a night of riots in Rotterdam condemned by the city's mayor as \"an orgy of violence\". Police fired warning shots and direct shots \"because the situation was life-threatening\", a police spokesperson told Reuters.\nAt least three demonstrators are receiving hospital treatment for gunshot wounds, officers said. Authorities have launched an investigation.\nThe Netherlands imposed a three-week partial lockdown last weekend after recording a record spike in Covid cases. Bars and restaurants must close at 20:00, and crowds are banned at sports events.\nTens of thousands of people protested in Austria's capital, Vienna, after the government announced a new national lockdown and plans to make jabs compulsory in February 2022. It is the first European country to make vaccination a legal requirement.\nBrandishing national flags and banners reading \"Freedom\", protesters shouted \"Resistance!\" and booed the police. \nThe country will enter a 20-day nationwide lockdown from Monday, shutting all but essential shops and ordering people to work from home.\nThe mandatory vaccinations have been described as a \"double-edged sword\" by Andrea Ammon, director for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\nShe told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the strict rules could make people who were still doubting the vaccine - but not fully rejecting it - completely turn away from it.\nIn Croatia, thousands marched in the capital, Zagreb, to show their anger at mandatory vaccinations for public sector workers, while in Italy, a few thousand protesters gathered at the ancient Circus Maximus chariot-racing ground in Rome to oppose \"Green Pass\" certificates required at workplaces, venues and on public transport.\nFrench authorities are sending dozens more police officers to quell unrest on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, a French overseas department. \nOvernight riots saw looters ransack dozens of shops and set businesses alight after protests against France's own Covid pass turned violent.\nInterior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said that some involved in the unrest used \"live ammunition\" against law enforcement, and promised a \"firm\" response to those committing public disorder. \nUK Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said there are no plans to change travel rules between the UK and Germany at the moment, in view of the rising number of cases there.\nHe said this was because Germany was dealing with the Delta variant: \"We have Delta here already, I'm not sure there is much benefit in having more rules, but we do keep an eye out for any potential new variants,\" he told Andrew Marr.\nAre you in the Netherlands?

      "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell's brother, Ian, has said he doubts his sister will get a fair hearing at her trial on sex trafficking and other charges which is due to start next week.\nMs Maxwell, the daughter of the late media mogul Robert Maxwell, has been accused of trafficking minors for her former lover Jeffrey Epstein. \nShe has been in a New York jail since her arrest in July 2020. \nThe former socialite has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\"I think my sister's probably relieved finally that it is starting because she's been in prison now for over 500 days in isolation, so this has to come to an end,\" Ian Maxwell told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. \"The trial is starting, so I think there is relief on her part, and, I think, the family's part.\"\nMr Maxwell said he fears the media interest in his sister's case will jeopardise her shot at a fair trial. \n\"I think that there are several reasons for that; the enormous amount of negative media coverage of Ghislaine for at least the last 18 months - it's only been going in one direction and that level of negative reporting which is not coming in any other direction than against her, I think it has a potential to poison the jury pool at some level if they are only hearing one side of the story and not the other. \n\"I am not here to go against the accusers or to talk about innocence and guilt, the reason I think this is a difficult process is because the way in which the authorities have chosen to proceed against my sister and to lock her up in isolation is wrong. It is an abuse of human rights and an abuse of the due process that has taken place,\" he said.\nOne of Ms Maxwell's accusers, Virginia Giuffre, alleges she was recruited by her while working at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate some 20 years ago \"for the purpose of being trafficked\".\nShe alleges she had sexual encounters on Epstein's private island in the Caribbean and in his homes in Palm Beach and New York.\n\"Ghislaine Maxwell [is] the one who abused me on a regular basis. She's the one that procured me, told me what to do, trained me as a sex slave, abused me physically, abused me mentally. She's the one who I believe, in my heart of hearts, deserves to come forward and have justice happen to her more than anybody,\" she said in a deposition released last year.\nMs Maxwell has branded Ms Giuffre \"an absolute liar\".\nWhen asked why no friends of Ghislaine's had come forward to defend her, Mr Maxwell said: \"Ghislaine continues to have many friends. I know this because we receive mail, emails, letters and so forth from her friends, but we live in a world where people are cancelled for friendships of this type. \n\"Friends of hers have lost their jobs. A man helping us behind the scenes [in] the news-handling has lost two board positions because it's become known that he is somehow assisting the family.\"\nMr Maxwell was asked if he believes his sister should take the stand in court: \"One thing you can say is there's been an awful lot of talking by everybody for the last few years and the voice of Ghislaine has never been heard. \n\"The family is not going to leave it there. We are taking steps to lodge a complaint with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, because America needs to be held to account for the way it is choosing to discriminate against my sister. The treatment meted out to Ghislaine has been appalling.\"\nUS financier and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019, as he awaited his trial on sex trafficking charges.\nMs Maxwell was in a relationship with Epstein in the 1990s. She allegedly introduced him to wealthy and powerful figures including former President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew of the British Royal Family.\nShe faces charges including sex trafficking of a minor, sex-trafficking conspiracy and allegations of perjury.\nUS prosecutors say she would build a rapport with the girls she helped to groom - including by taking them shopping or to the movies - and would later coax them into giving Epstein massages during which they were sexually abused.\n\"Maxwell played a critical role in helping Epstein to identify, befriend and groom minor victims for abuse,\" said Audrey Strauss, acting US attorney for the southern district of New York last year.\nMs Maxwell's trial is due to begin on 29 November, and is expected to last for six weeks."

      "text": "Northern Ireland's largest electricity company Power NI is to increase its prices for domestic customers by 21.4% from 1 January 2022.\nIt means a typical household bill will go up by \u00a3131 a year. The tariff has been approved by the Utility Regulator.\nPower NI said the increase was due to a rise in prices across the global wholesale gas market.\nIt has about 450,000 domestic customers and this is the second tariff increase it has announced this year.\nIn July, it announced a 6.9% price rise.\nConsumers across Northern Ireland are facing higher prices this winter as gas and electricity providers pass on increasing costs to customers. \nWilliam Steele, customer solutions director for Power NI, said the firm would try to assist customers struggling to pay their bills.\n\"We work very hard to keep our prices as low as possible but regrettably there has been a rapid and sustained increase in wholesale gas prices over recent months,\" he said.\n\"Like other suppliers we have no choice but to pay these increased costs, which feed into the cost of wholesale electricity and have a knock-on effect on our tariffs.\n\"In these challenging times and with such a volatile market we held off making this change for as long as possible, with this price change not coming into effect until January 2022.\n\"As soon as we see an opportunity to reduce prices, we will do so without delay.\n\"For any customers who are worried about paying a bill, please get in contact and we can help you.\"\nThe company said customers could help to offset the increase by ensuring they were on the best payment plan and registering for online billing.\nJohn French, chief executive of the Utility Regulator, said it was unclear how long it would be before global prices began to fall.\n\"The drivers behind this increase are that we have had one of the least windy summers since 1961, meaning generation from cheaper wind power has been very low,\" he said.\n\"This low output from wind has meant that there has been an increased use of conventional gas, coal, and oil fired power stations.\n\"Unfortunately, the cost of gas, coal, and oil has increased significantly on global markets over the last 12 months, and since the wholesale cost of electricity makes up over 60% of a domestic customer's bill these sharp increases impact heavily on Power NI's tariff.\"\nMr French said market analysts were predicting higher wholesale prices \"for the next 18 to 36 months\".\n\"If wholesale prices begin to reduce, our system of regulation in Northern Ireland allows us to act to make sure that reductions are fully passed onto consumers as quickly as possible.\""

      "tags": "WhatsApp,Facebook,GDPR,Privacy",
      "text": "WhatsApp is rewriting its privacy policy as a result of a huge data protection fine earlier this year.\nFollowing an investigation, the Irish data protection watchdog issued a \u20ac225m (\u00a3190m) fine - the second-largest in history over GDPR - and ordered WhatsApp to change its policies.\nWhatsApp is appealing against the fine, but is amending its policy documents in Europe and the UK to comply. \nHowever, it insists that nothing about its actual service is changing.\nInstead, the tweaks are designed to \"add additional detail around our existing practices\", and will only appear in the European version of the privacy policy, which is already different from the version that applies in the rest of the world.\n\"There are no changes to our processes or contractual agreements with users, and users will not be required to agree to anything or to take any action in order to continue using WhatsApp,\" the company said, announcing the change. \nThe new policy takes effect immediately.\nIn January, WhatsApp users complained about an update to the company's terms that many believed would result in data being shared with parent company Facebook, which is now called Meta.\nMany thought refusing to agree to the new terms and conditions would result in their accounts being blocked.\nIn reality, very little had changed. However, WhatsApp was forced to delay its changes and spend months fighting the public perception to the contrary.\nDuring the confusion, millions of users downloaded WhatsApp competitors such as Signal.\nWriting about the new tweaks required by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), WhatsApp directly addressed those kinds of concerns.\n\"This update does not change how we process, use or share user data with anyone, including Meta, nor does it change how we operate our service,\" it wrote.\nAnd \"users will not be required to agree to anything new or to take any action in order to keep using WhatsApp\", it added.\nThe company was also keen to stress that its service is, and continues to be, end-to-end encrypted, meaning messages can only be read by the sender and recipient.\nThe new privacy policy contains substantially more information about what exactly is done with users' information, and how WhatsApp works with Meta, the parent company for WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram.\nThe fine handed to WhatsApp in September was the result of a years-long investigation into whether the social media giant was transparent enough about how it handles user information.\nThe Irish DPC had originally found against WhatsApp in some areas and not others, and proposed a fine of between \u20ac30m-50m.\nBut after it consulted with other EU nations' regulators as part of the process, it reassessed the amount.\nOnly Amazon has been issued a larger GDPR fine.\nWhatsApp continues to appeal against the decision, saying it believes that it had always provided the required information to its users.

      "text": "A wind farm is to become home to a state-of-the-art hydrogen storage facility which could eventually produce enough clean energy to help power the next generation of public transport.\nThe UK government has awarded the project, based at Whitelee Windfarm in East Renfrewshire, \u00a39.4m.\nIt said the project would help Glasgow reach net zero by 2030.\nThe cash will go towards developing the country's largest electrolyser, which converts water into hydrogen.\nThe hydrogen produced can be easily stored and transported to where it is needed.\nSplitting water and capturing the released hydrogen requires energy, and the project will use electricity produced from the wind farm, the largest onshore farm in the UK, to create the gas.\nOne use for the hydrogen generated will be to support local transport. The facility is expected to make so much of the zero-carbon fuel that it could provide the equivalent of enough zero-carbon fuel for 225 buses travelling to and from Glasgow to Edinburgh each day.\nGreg Hands, the UK government's energy and climate change minister, said: \"This first-of-a-kind hydrogen facility will put Scotland at the forefront of plans to make the UK a world-leading hydrogen economy, bringing green jobs to Glasgow, while also helping to decarbonise local transport - all immediately following the historic COP26 talks.\"\nAnd Alister Jack, secretary of state for Scotland, said the project showed \"how serious the UK government is about supporting projects that will see us achieve net zero by 2050\".\nHe added that it had never been more important to \"champion\" projects like this, which embrace new hydrogen technology while creating highly-skilled jobs. \nThe partnership, made up of ScottishPower, ITM Power and BOC, is currently going through the planning process for the new facility and aims to have green hydrogen available to the commercial market by 2023.\nSome argue that for public transport vehicles like buses, hydrogen is too expensive and electricity would be a better, cheaper alternative.\nHowever Dr Graham Cooley, chief executive of ITM Power, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that hydrogen was particularly good for heavy vehicles \"where you value payload\".\nHe said: \"You can make a vehicle that's very long duration - in other words, it can travel a long range without compromising the weight. \n\"If you want to travel a long distance using a battery, you need more and more batteries which makes the vehicles very heavy. You see vehicle manufacture now all over the world rolling out commercial vehicles based on hydrogen which have very long ranges and very short recharging or refuelling time.\"\nMeanwhile, Friends of the Earth Scotland director Richard Dixon argued that green hydrogen should be reserved for \"special uses\" in industry, rather than mainstream uses like public transport.\nHe told the programme: \"It's three times more sensible to use it [renewable electricity] as electricity rather than to use it to turn it into hydrogen - you've lost two thirds of the energy in making the hydrogen and then using it. \n\"We have such a desperate need to convert our homes to electric heating and to convert transport to electricity to get out of fossil fuels. That should be absolute top priority.\""

      "text": "Some teachers are leaving the profession after being labelled paedophiles on TikTok, a union says. \nA craze on the social media app has seen children share videos of staff with inappropriate hashtags and comments and, sometimes, superimposing their faces onto pornography. \nA Swansea Valley school said it called the police after staff were secretly filmed and labelled #paedo on the app. \nTikTok said it had no place for hateful behaviour, bullying and harassment.\nGemma Morgan, assistant head teacher at Cwmtawe Community School, Pontardawe, said a fake school TikTok account had been set up. \nIt contained edited videos of virtual parents' evenings and lessons, as well as covert filming of staff that had been uploaded and doctored. \n\"They had edited them, put hashtags over the top, they created memes\u2026 there were several hashtags with 'paedo',\" she said. \n\"Some members of staff had been filmed discreetly within classrooms.\"\nShe said there were \"extremely derogatory comments\" and \"very bad language\".\n\"In all honesty, things that were of great concern and we engaged with the local police.\"\nThe situation had been \"very upsetting\" for staff, she said. \n\"Especially for the families of these members of staff\u2026 it's a massive, massive concern.\"\nHelen Jones, head teacher at Maesteg Comprehensive School in Bridgend, said footage of her teachers had been used to create memes, some of which had been \"relatively innocent\".\n\"But where they have been unpleasant it's been quite cruel and it's easy to be cruel when the account holder is anonymous,\" she said. \nShe said the \"implication and nuances\" of one meme suggested the teacher in question was a paedophile. \n\"Those sorts of things are causing great upset and distress,\" she said. \nShe said everyone had been exhausted by the pandemic and both staff and pupil absence was at an \"all time high\". \nNeither school has excluded students but had focussed on educating pupils and parents. \nA number of councils and some of Wales' police forces have written to parents to inform them of the craze and ask them to discuss the appropriate use of social media with their children.\n\"I don't think they realise the consequences of their actions, at the end of the day they're still children,\" said Ms Jones.\nEllis Lloyd Jones, is a TikTok content creator with over 190,000 followers.\nThe 23-year-old from Treorchy in Rhondda Cynon Taf discouraged school children from taking part in the craze.\n\"As a child, you might think the teacher's not going to care and not going to see it but that probably will affect them behind closed doors\u2026 it could really affect them,\" he said. \n\"It's just keyboard warriors, people think 'I''m behind a screen, I can say whatever I want'.\"\nHe does not believe the media interest around the craze will do TokTok any harm: \"The more controversy that comes, the more people are talking about it, the more popular is going to get,\" he said.\nNASUWT's National Official for Wales Neil Butler said the craze was having a \"huge detrimental impact on the wellbeing of teachers in schools across the UK\".\n\"We have examples of teachers going off on sick, on stress, we have examples of teachers leaving the profession, which of course is the greatest worry - we can't afford to lose experienced teachers from the classroom,\" he said. \n\"It's the last straw really - it was bad enough what they had to go through during the pandemic.. and now [they're] having to face this.\"\nHe said he had seen one post encouraging pupils to hit a teacher.\n\"We will ensure that the full force of the law - if the law is broken - is brought to bear, because we have to protect our members,\" he said. \nEithne Hughes, Cymru Director at ASCL union, said she had also seen examples of racial slurs and teachers accused of having affairs.\n\"It is just horrible nasty dreadful stuff,\" she said.\n\"Teachers are looking over their shoulders... it's been a very squalid and sorry affair. \n\"It's cruel and unnecessary and the profession should not have to put up with it frankly.\" \nShe said complaints to TikTok had been met in one of two ways: \"No response at all, or that it does not violate TikTok's own protocols, which is extraordinary.\"\nShe said after talks with the company they still needed to do more: \"We don't need nice words, we actually need some action,\" she said.\nMrs Morgan said TikTok had taken \"a long time\" for the videos to be taken down.  \nMs Jones, said they had received \"quite a quick response\" from TikTok, adding it had had provided useful generic advice to the school's media marketing manager. \n\"I'm well aware of the lack of speed other schools have reported,\" she added. \nA spokeswoman for TikTok said: \"We are crystal clear that hateful behaviour, bullying and harassment have no place on TikTok. \n\"We regret the distress caused to some teachers as a result of abusive content posted to our platform.\"\nShe said the company had deployed additional technical measures and guidance and continued to \"proactively detect and remove violative content and accounts\". \nShe said the partner had partnered with the Professional Online Safety Helpline (POSH) to provide teachers with an additional way to report content and written to every school in the UK to ensure all staff had access to the resources they need.\nMr Butler said a letter has gone from his union's general secretary to the education minister of each UK nation and called for action from the Welsh government \n\"I don't think any government is doing enough on this,\" he said.\n\"The Welsh government has overarching control of education in Wales, it is becoming an extremely serious issue, so we would like now to see a more robust response from them to this issue.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"It is completely unacceptable that teachers are being targeted with abuse on social media.\" \nIt said it had asked TikTok to remove any instances of inappropriate or offensive content immediately and  advise affected staff to report any instances directly to TikTok and contact POSH."

      "title": "Beirut blast: UN ignored plea for port disaster evidence",
      "tags": "Lebanon",
      "text": "The BBC has learned that the UN has repeatedly ignored requests from bereaved families for information to help the official investigation into the Beirut port explosion which killed 219 people in August last year. \nThe probe has been beset by delays, rows and recriminations, leaving families and survivors no closer to finding out who, if anyone, was to blame, as BBC Middle East correspondent Anna Foster reports.\nWhen Ariana Papazian describes her mother Delia's death she does it clearly and calmly. She remembers every detail. The sound, and the silence that followed. The way she touched her mum's hair, and the exact words she used as she desperately tried to wake her up.\nAriana was just 16 on the day of the blast, and she wants answers about why she lost her beloved parent. \n\"I feel like my mother doesn't have a value, my mother's life doesn't have a value. My own health doesn't have a value. Like we are not humans.\"\nThe official investigation into the devastating explosion was supposed to provide the truth. But it has stalled. It's been suspended several times because senior political figures who were called to give evidence made complaints. A protest against the lead judge Tarek Bitar led to violent clashes in which seven people died. \nThe dispute has split Lebanon's cabinet, which hasn't met for a month now in a country that desperately needs leadership if it's to escape its current crises. \nThat lack of progress has led to international criticism. But a vital organisation that could have helped has ignored requests - the United Nations. \nOne week after the explosion it called for \"a prompt and independent investigation that leads to justice and accountability\". But the BBC has learned that when bereaved families asked for information to help that very inquiry, the UN didn't reply.\nThe Beirut Bar Association represents nearly 2,000 families and survivors at the investigation. Its chairman sent three separate letters directly to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, asking for some specific details. \nThey requested two things. Firstly, all available satellite photos taken on the day of the blast by member states. And secondly, whether Unifil (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) checked the MV Rhosus - the ship that carried the explosive material which caused the explosion - back in 2013, before it arrived at Beirut port. \nAya Majzoub, Lebanon Researcher with Human Rights Watch, explained why the satellite images are vital. \n\"Until this day we don't know what caused the explosion, we don't know if it was an intentional act, we don't know if it was caused by negligence, we have no idea,\" she says. \n\"And so satellite imagery of the port on that day would be very important in trying to answer outstanding questions about why the explosion happened.\" \nLast week Russia said its space agency Roscosmos was preparing to hand over images of the blast site, after a request from the Lebanese president, Michel Aoun.\nThe first of the families' letters was sent by the Bar Association on 26 October 2020. A follow-up was dispatched three weeks later on 19 November, noting \"it has been more than 100 days since the blast, to date none of the member states or Unifil has sent any photos or information\". \nThe third letter, dated 17 March 2021, states: \"Seven months have passed since the blast and five months since our letter, and unfortunately our letters remain unanswered and unacknowledged. Lebanon is a founder member of the UN and is asking for help.\"\nRamzi Haykal, a veteran lawyer in Lebanon and a member of the Beirut Bar Association, is defiant. \n\"Let me tell you something, we are fighters\" he said. \"We are fighters by law. And we will continue fighting, because we are responsible for 1,800 people who asked us to represent them to obtain justice.\" \nAya Majzoub thinks the UN response has fallen short. \"I'm sure the secretary general is inundated with letters and requests, but it's been disappointing to see the lack of co-operation with the Lebanese authorities. Also the lack of an international investigation into the blast, there's much more the international community could be doing that they aren't.\"\nI asked the UN about these letters, and why none of the three had even been acknowledged. The secretary general's office told me the UN is committed to supporting the Lebanese people, and has mobilised to help the victims. But it didn't explain why those specific letters - so important to the investigation and the quest for the truth - had simply been ignored, only saying it focused on answering those from officials.\nThe survivors and bereaved families say they deserve better, and that one of the biggest explosions in history should be properly investigated. \nBut while the Lebanese authorities procrastinate, and other countries don't give help where they can, the answers that a nation desperately needs will remain elusive."

      "tags": "Schools,Black Lives Matter,Young people",
      "text": "Adults should stop mocking young people by calling them \"woke\" for standing up for things they believe in, a leading head teacher has said.\nSamantha Price, president of the Girls' Schools Association, urged parents and teachers to keep up with the younger generation instead.\nShe told a conference on Monday that pupils are genuinely worried about racism, sexism and climate change.\nThey want to address these issues with support from adults, she added.\nWoke is an informal term from the US, meaning alert to injustice and discrimination in society, particularly racism and sexism. But it is often used in a derogatory way to criticise someone for a certain set of views.\nMs Price, headmistress of the prestigious independent Benenden School in Kent, told her organisation's annual conference: \"Adults comment that they feel today's teenagers are speaking a different language; that they can't say anything without being corrected or 'called out' by these PC children.\"\nShe said she is \"weary of hearing the older generation say, 'you can't say anything any more'.\"\nAnd she added: \"The fact is that times have changed, and we simply need to keep up with them.\"\nThe last few years have seen numerous protests by young people about social issues, such as the treatment of women, racism through the Black Lives Matter movement, and demands for action on climate change.\nSchools are hosts to young people as they develop and become aware of the issues that concern them.\nLarge numbers of young people have taken part in the Fridays for Future and School Strike climate change protests, sometimes with the support of their schools and teachers, over the last few years.\nMs Price added: \"This so-called 'woke' generation are actually simply young people who care about things: about causes, about the planet, about people. It ultimately comes down to something very simple: being kind.\n\"Isn't that what we all want our toddlers to be? We teach them to be kind. \n\"And then when they grow up to be impressive, kind young people with an understanding and appreciation for the world around them, how can it be right that we mock them, or dismiss them as unrealistic do-gooders?\"\nShe cautioned against the older generation dismissing the \"energetic changes of this generation\" in \"derogatory tones and sighs\".\nFormer US President Barack Obama is one of the highest-profile figures to call out self-righteous attitudes among \"woke\" young people.\nIn a TV interview in 2019, he said to try to bring about change by being \"as judgemental as possible in 2019\" against others with different views would not achieve much."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nAustria has returned to a full national lockdown - as protests against new Covid-19 restrictions spread across Europe. From midnight, Austrians have been asked to work from home and non-essential shops have closed. Last week, Austria became the first European country to indicate it would make Covid vaccination a legal requirement, with the law due to take effect in February. In the Belgian capital, Brussels, demonstrators clashed with police after tens of thousands of people marched through the city centre. In the Netherlands, rioting erupted for the third night in a row.\nAustralia is to relax the rules for certain foreign groups entering the country. Skilled migrants and international students, as well as Japanese and South Korean citizens, will be among those allowed entry from 1 December. All must be fully vaccinated. Australia has implemented some of the world's tightest border controls since March last year, including on its own citizens. Prime Minister Scott Morrison called Monday's announcement an \"important step forward\".\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross has said there is no evidence that vaccine passports do anything to stop the spread of Covid-19. The Scottish government will decide on Tuesday if the scheme - which came into effect in Scotland last month for nightclubs and large events - will be extended to other settings. Mr Ross spoke to BBC Scotland on Sunday - watch his comments below.\nStormont ministers will meet later to discuss proposals to curb the spread of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland. On Thursday, Health Minister Robin Swann advised anyone who worked from home when the pandemic began to do so again. Last week, the Department of Health warned that unless cases decrease significantly in the next three weeks, then more \"severe\" restrictions could be required before Christmas.\n\"I was on maternity leave and stuck in lockdown, so, for me, it really provided a way to ease my anxiety, keep busy and feel a sense of achievement,\" says Alice Smith, 34, who spent almost four months locked down in Sydney, Australia earlier this year. If 2020 was the year of baking banana bread and sourdough, then for many like Alice, 2021 was the year of knitting and crafts.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday.\nHolidaymakers are being urged to use \u00a3132m worth of unspent vouchers issued during the pandemic before they lose financial protection. The credit notes were offered by travel firms as alternatives to cash refunds when holidays had to be cancelled. The vouchers are backed by the Atol insurance scheme and can be used towards new holidays or exchanged for cash. But the regulator said the refund protection against firms going bust will end on 30 September 2022. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) also said travel firms would no longer be able to issue the Atol-protected cover after 20 December. \nGermany's health minister has issued his starkest warning yet on the importance of getting vaccinated, saying that \"by the end of this winter everyone in Germany will either be vaccinated, recovered or dead\". Jens Spahn was speaking at a news conference in Berlin as Germany, like much of Europe, continues to struggle with a fourth wave of coronavirus. The country has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Western Europe, with 68% of people fully vaccinated. Mr Spahn said he was against making Covid vaccines compulsory but that it was a \"moral obligation\" to get the jab because it impacts on other people.\nA doctor who died after contracting Covid-19 \"touched a lot of lives\" helping people, his brother has said. Dr Irfan Halim, 45, who worked at Swindon's Great Western Hospital, was taken ill on 10 September after collapsing on a coronavirus ward where he was working. The father-of-four died nine weeks later, not knowing that his father had also died in September. Amir Halim told the BBC he would make sure his brother's children knew \"what an amazing person he was\". Paying tribute to him, he said: \"He was always very happy, very energetic. Till the day he passed a week ago he was exactly the same.\"\nKenyans will be barred from bars, restaurants and public transport from 21 December if they are not fully vaccinated against Covid-19, Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe says. With less than 10% of the population currently vaccinated, the measures are aimed at increasing the rate of vaccinations ahead of the festive season. Mr Kagwe raised concern about the slow uptake, saying a 10-day vaccination campaign would begin from 26 November. The Kenyan government is confident it has enough vaccines for its inoculation campaign with only 6.4 million jabs delivered so far out of the 10.7 million it has received.\nA heart warming aspect of the pandemic has been some of the extraordinary efforts done in the name of charity. One of those who has gone to great lengths to do their bit is 12-year-old Max Woosey, from Devon, who began camping in a tent in his garden back in March 2020. Tonight marks his 600th night sleeping outside and North Devon Hospice said the near \u00a3680,000 it had received from his efforts was \"insane\". The hospice faced a \u00a31m drop in funding because of the lockdown and the funds raised by Max have equated to almost 20 nurses for the whole year, the hospice said. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nIf you're wondering how the vaccine rollout is going across the world you can read our explainer here.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Companies,Energy industry",
      "text": "Bulb Energy, which has 1.7 million customers, has announced that the firm will be put into administration.\nIt is the largest UK energy company to face difficulties following a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices this year.\nBulb will become the first energy company to be placed into \"special administration\", where it is run by the government through the regulator Ofgem.\n\"Customers of Bulb do not need to worry - Bulb will continue to operate as normal,\" Ofgem said.\n\"Customers will see no disruption to their supply and their account and tariff will continue as normal. Bulb staff will still be available to answer calls and queries.\"\nThe special administration measure is only used if Ofgem is unable to find another company to take over an energy firm's customers. The regulator said it was planning to apply to a court to appoint an administrator who will run the company.\nBulb said energy supplies were \"secure and all credit balances are protected\".\nBulb is the UK's seventh biggest energy company and has 1,000 staff. It has been trying to shore up its finances for several weeks.\nOfgem set up the Special Administrator Regime (SAR) for when an energy company goes bust but is too big to have its customers transferred to another firm.\nThe aim of the regime is to stop financial failure spreading across the industry.\nUnder the SAR scheme, the government can make grants and loans to the company while its future is sorted out.\nIt could come in the shape of a takeover by another company, selling parts of its business or customers being transferred to another firm.\nProvision for special administration, owing to the collapse of a major player in the UK energy sector, has been part of the law for 10 years. \nIt had never been needed until now.\nSo, this decision will be a hugely significant moment in this gas crisis. But it is one to which customers of Bulb are being urged to respond by remaining calm and essentially doing nothing.\nIt is written into the rules that a special administrator, unlike an ordinary administrator, has an obligation to consider consumers' interests as well as those of creditors who are owed money by Bulb.\nIt means customers have short-term certainty that their supply, their current tariff, their credit balance and their bills will continue as normal. That means switching now would be a bad, and expensive, idea.\nLonger-term, some of that certainty diminishes as decisions are made about the future sale or wind-up of the company.\nSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that in effect it meant the \"taxpayer is likely to take the strain, so we might all end up paying a price\".\nA host of energy companies have gone bust over the last three months as wholesale gas prices have soared, affecting nearly four million customers. \nOn Monday, Ofgem said British Gas would take on customers from Neon Reef and Social Energy Supply, which went bust last week. The two firms had a combined 35,000 customers.\nThe UK's energy price cap - which limits what providers can charge - has exacerbated the problem, firms say.\nJustina Miltienyte, an energy policy expert at Uswitch, said the failure of Bulb signalled the \"tipping point\" of the UK energy crisis. \n\"Ultimately this demise wasn't caused by a badly run business model. Instead, Bulb was choked off by the way the government decided to structure the current energy market with the price cap.\"\nBut Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said Bulb's fall into administration should \"focus minds on how the market operates\" and \"why so many companies have been allowed to operate so recklessly for so long\".\n\"The government has had to step in to protect customers from a failure of unprecedented size, and it will have to use taxpayers' money to do so,\" he added.\nJohn Arnold, a Bulb customer for several years from Potters Bar in Hertfordshire, told the BBC he was \"not surprised\" by the supplier's struggles given the current market, but added he was \"more than a little disappointed\" they had gone into administration.\n\"In my experience they have been a good company to deal with. I like their green credentials and their tariffs have been very fair,\" the 69-year-old said.\nDeborah Davenport, from Easton on the Hill in the East Midlands, said Bulb's customer service was \"absolutely brilliant\".\nWhile renovating her cottage which involved installing solar panels and a new gas supply, Ms Davenport said there were a few \"hiccups\" with meter readings and bills, but added Bulb solved the problems promptly.\nBulb was \"just really pragmatic\" to deal with, she said, compared to some other energy firms who she believes \"do not care about people\".\n\"I just thought I had a voice with Bulb.\"\nLondon-based Bulb, which caters to 5-6% of the UK energy market, said the gas price crisis meant it was unable to raise the financing it needed from investors to keep on operating. \n\"The rising energy crisis... has concerned investors who can't go ahead while wholesale prices are so high and the price cap - designed to protect customers - currently means suppliers provide energy at a significant loss,\" Bulb said on its website. \nBulb was founded in 2015 to compete with the Big Six energy firms and claimed to offer cheaper and greener electricity than its rivals.  \nIt grew quickly and launched divisions in France, Spain and the US, which will continue to trade. \nAccording to Bulb's latest available accounts, in the year to 31 March 2020 the company made losses of \u00a363m. It also had a \u00a355m loan facility due for repayment on 31 December this year.\nIn September, Bulb appointed investment bank Lazard to look into restructuring options, which reportedly included a joint venture or merger with another firm, and a cash injection from existing shareholders.\nRead more about the next best steps to take here."

      "text": "The number of children in care in England could reach almost 100,000 by 2025, according to new analysis.\nResearch commissioned by county councils said the figure would represent a 36% rise in a decade.\nAnd the expected increase is already putting \"unprecedented pressure\" on local authority's budgets. \nA government spokesman said they were providing \u00a34.8bn in funding to councils to help maintain \"vital front-line services\", including children's care.\nThe chairman of the County Councils Network (CCN), Tim Oliver, will explain the impact of the rising number of children in care to his organisation's annual conference in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, later.\nMr Oliver will say \"too many\" vulnerable children are being placed in what he will call \"expensive residential care settings\" and, on average, they are staying in the care system for longer.\nTaking a child into care is the most serious and expensive decision a local authority has to make.\nPutting up a child in a children's home costs more than \u00a34,000 per week on average in England.\nIn 2015, 69,000 children in England were looked after by councils - but by March 2020, the figure was 80,080.\nProjections for the CCN estimate that it could reach 95,000 in just over three years' time.\nThere is a rise in children entering residential care homes, being explained by, among other things, the number of foster carers not keeping up with the increased demand.\nOliwia was just 16 when she went into emergency foster care. \n\"It was so terrifying for me at that time,\" she told the BBC. \"I didn't know where I'd end up.\"\nShe had been living in Oxford, but had to move to the other side of the county to find a home able to take her in, due to the lack of availability in her area. \n\"No one had ever heard of the city,\" she said. \"I was worried how I was going to get to school.\n\"But they told me they didn't have enough carers in Oxford.\"\nOnce she had settled in though, Oliwia, now 24, had nothing but praise for the foster family she was with and their understanding for her situation. \n\"We had chats, we got to know each other and it was a really positive experience,\" she said. \n\"The family was nice, but I just wish it had been in Oxford.\"\nThe CCN's lead for children and Conservative leader of East Sussex County Council, Keith Glazier, said with local authorities spending their money on the growing need, councils \"aren't having the ability to go out and do more early intervention with families, to try and keep families together, rather than having to take children into care\".\nHe added: \"At the end of the day we have to ensure children are safe, that is the prime purpose\".\nIn Warrington, a new children's home - named the Lighthouse by its users - is part of a trial scheme taking place across five counties, looking to address the increase in children coming into care.\nThe No Wrong Door programme is funded in Warrington by both the Department for Education and the local authority, and brings therapists, police and social workers together within the home to try and work with families before they reach crisis.\nSince the Lighthouse launched in April, the number of children in care aged 12-17 has reduced by 5% in Warrington. \nThe trial is being evaluated by the charity What Works for Children's Social Care and will report back in 2025. \nIts director of research, Dr Aoife O'Higgins, said: \"Evaluating projects like No Wrong Door in Warrington is vital so we can understand what actually works to reduce the number of children and young people entering care. \n\"We wouldn't offer a medical treatment without testing it to make sure it works, so we need to be just as rigorous when thinking about how we are supporting some of our most vulnerable children and young people.\"\nWhile the scheme appears to be working so far, the council is not immune from the rising costs of finding residential places for children. \nWarrington's head of service for children in care and care leavers, Sharon Cooper, said she had recently been quoted \u00a322,000 a week for a child to be placed in a children's home.\n\"When you're faced with the prospect at 17:00 in the evening where you can't find a home for a child who needs to come into our care unfortunately, you're between a rock and a hard place,\" she said.\nAn independent review of children's social care is currently being conducted for the government by former teacher and charity boss Josh MacAlister. \nA government spokesman said: \"We recognise the challenges that councils are facing, including the pressure on children's services, which is why we are providing local authorities councils with \u00a34.8bn in new grant funding to help maintain vital front-line services, including children's social care.\""

      "text": "Police have had some success against a loyalist paramilitary group amid a crackdown that began last year, a senior officer has said.\nA specialist police unit has carried out almost 40 raids targeting suspected criminality linked to the north Antrim Ulster Defence Association (UDA) since September 2020.\nIt follows a surge in violence linked to the gang.\nA gun and ammunition were discovered in the latest police searches last week.\nThe gang was \"about crime, ego and control\", said Ch Supt Ian Magee.\nA former justice minister said the public wanted police to do more.\nThe Paramilitary Crime Taskforce - made up of specialist officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), the National Crime Agency and HM Revenue and Customs - was brought in to help local officers in the Causeway Coast and Glens policing district in summer last year.\nCh Supt Magee said the operation has dealt a blow to the loyalist group.\n\"We've seen a 60% reduction in violent attacks carried out by north Antrim UDA on members of our population,\" he said.\n\"We've also seen a 50% reduction in people subjected to shootings by that grouping.\n\"And we've seen a further 100% reduction in people who've been subjected to violent attacks using weapons in the north Antrim area.\"\nThe latest police searches targeting suspected UDA criminality took place in Ballymoney, Limavady and Coleraine last Monday.\nThe PSNI says seven people have been arrested by the Paramilitary Crime Task Force in the last 10 days.\nTwo of those individuals have since been charged.\nIn addition, 11 people were arrested for terrorism-related offences in the Causeway Coast and Glens District in the year to October.\nPolice statistics also show there were three fewer shootings in the area than the eight recorded in the previous 12 months.\nHowever, the district recorded the third-highest number of shootings in Northern Ireland, behind the Belfast (nine) and Derry City and Strabane (11) policing districts.\nIndependent assembly member and former justice minister Claire Sugden said the figures were moving in the right direction, but that there were still problems linked to paramilitarism in the community.\n\"Constituents are telling me daily that they are feeling terrorised by this type of activity,\" she said.\n\"Some people in Coleraine are seeing these criminals driving around the town in very expensive vehicles.\n\"They're questioning where the money is coming from and that's not being addressed, so the police need to do more.\n\"It's a positive step in terms of the figures but it's not necessarily being represented on the ground.\"\nCh Supt Magee said: \"There have been seizures of firearms linked to paramilitary groupings, there have been people arrested, people interviewed and a small number of people charged.\n\"But my work is more to do with prevention.\"\nHe said the gang was putting out a message that they were protecting their community and that the violence was necessary.\n\"They don't care about people, they don't care about justice and they do not care about social issues,\" he said.\n\"This is about crime, ego and control.\""

      "text": "JK Rowling has accused three people who campaign on transgender matters of posting a photo of her Edinburgh address on Twitter.\nThe author, who has been criticised for her views on trans issues, has reported the matter to police.\nPolice Scotland said they had been made aware and inquiries were ongoing.\nIn a now deleted social media post, one of the group said the photo had been removed after they had received \"threatening\" messages online.\nIn her own Twitter thread, Rowling said the image depicted the three activists in front of her home, \"carefully positioning themselves to ensure\" the address was visible.\nShe said: \"I want to say a massive thank you to everybody who reported the image to @TwitterSupport. Your kindness and decency made all the difference to my family and me. \n\"I implore those people who retweeted the image with the address still visible, even if they did so in condemnation of these people's actions, to delete it.\"\nRowling sparked controversy in June 2020 for posting tweets which took issue with the phrase \"people who menstruate\" - she objected to the avoidance of the use of the word \"women\".\nIn a lengthy blog post, the writer of the Harry Potter books said her interest in trans issues stemmed from being a survivor of abuse and having concerns around single-sex spaces.\nCritics said her views \"diminished the identity\" of trans people, while stars from the Harry Potter films, including Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, distanced themselves from her comments.\nThe author described the actions of the group which posted the picture displaying her address as \"doxxing\" - the malicious act of publishing personal information online.\nRowling said she believed the activists had attempted to \"intimidate\" her out of \"speaking up for women's sex-based rights\". \nShe said: \"They should have reflected on the fact that I've now received so many death threats I could paper the house with them, and I haven't stopped speaking out. \n\"Perhaps - and I'm just throwing this out there - the best way to prove your movement isn't a threat to women, is to stop stalking, harassing and threatening us.\"\nA Police Scotland spokesman said: \"We are aware of this incident and police inquiries are ongoing.\"\nOne of the people who was involved wrote on Facebook: \"Yesterday we posted a picture we took at JK Rowling's house.\"\nThe post, which has now been deleted, added: \"While we stand by the photo, since posting it we have received an overwhelming amount of serious and threatening transphobic messages so have decided to take the photo down.\""

      "title": "Covid-19: Venues 'may have to close doors during Christmas'",
      "text": "There is a possibility that hospitality venues may be asked to close over Christmas if Covid-19 cases continue to increase, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. \nBut he told the Northern Ireland Assembly it was not \"inevitable\".\nStormont ministers have met to discuss plans to help curb the spread of Covid-19 and will meet again on Tuesday.\nOn Thursday, Mr Swann advised anyone who worked from home when the pandemic began last year to do so again now.\nHis document also suggested introducing a \"scores on the doors\" Covid compliance rating for businesses.\nMr Swann said on Monday that \"if the current trajectory continues with regard to the increased cases we are seeing, we may once again face the possibility where venues are asked to close their doors during the Christmas season\".\n\"But let me be clear, it is not inevitable and I do not want to have to re-introduce further restrictions unless completely unavoidable,\" he added.\nMr Swann also expressed disappointment that some hospitality venues had not acted responsibly after social distancing rules were relaxed.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill tweeted that Mr Swann had presented a paper to ministers who met on Monday morning to consider it. \nShe said that while the \"meeting was constructive and progress was made, it was agreed more work was needed\".\n\"The executive will meet again in the morning to finalise the approach,\" she added.\nDecisions on whether to strengthen current mitigations must first be agreed by the executive.\nHealth officials believe the proposals could help reduce transmission of the virus.\nOn Monday, three Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland and a further 1,469 new cases. \nNorthern Ireland's infection rate has been climbing over the past week or so.\nIt is currently the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland.\nJustice Minister Naomi Long said on Monday that the executive was \"not planning for Christmas closures\".\n\"We started off in terms of looking at vaccine certification as one means of trying to ensure that we drive down transmission and as those who are in more high-risk environments are less likely to become seriously ill as a result, that's one means of keeping the doors open on businesses,\" she added.\n\"We've been considering the paper today around how we actually try to get the basics right and get people to comply with things like handwashing, wearing masks, trying to voluntarily reduce their number of close contacts, trying to ensure where people can work from home they do work from home.\n\"Our focus at the minute is not on closure but on trying to keep businesses open.\"\nMs O'Neill said on Twitter that it was \"vitally important that all executive ministers work together to get us through this difficult period\".\n\"It's time to redouble our efforts to limit the spread of the virus, protect lives and our hospital system,\" she added.\nI think this was the strongest warning from Robin Swann that unless people do change their ways, it is not inevitable, but a distinct possibility [that venues may be asked to close].\nIf we are talking about carrot and stick, I think that is potentially the stick.\nMr Swann will hope that hits home, because nobody wants that to happen.\nCertainly the people who run these establishments don't want it to happen.\nPeople would like a Christmas, but Robin Swann is saying people have got to change their ways.\nLast week, the Department of Health warned that unless cases decrease significantly in the next three weeks, then more \"severe\" restrictions could be required before Christmas. \nStormont ministers have said they do not want to have to impose tougher mitigations that could damage trade.\nThey have already agreed to put in place proof of Covid status for certain sectors, which will become enforceable from 13 December. \nThe plan means people will have to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or proof of a negative coronavirus test result to access nightclubs, pubs, cinemas, theatres and restaurants.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had voted against the proposals but Mr Swann and other Stormont ministers said the use of Covid status certification would save lives.\nDUP ministers had said they wanted to see other measures explored by health officials, which could also help reduce the number of Covid cases.\nAt present, executive advice on working from home is that people should continue to do so where they can.\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland's justice minister has raised concerns about a proposal for her department to \"take the lead\" in managing compliance around face coverings to help combat Covid-19.\nThe health paper suggested Naomi Long should oversee plans to raise compliance levels above 80%.\nShe said the proposal was \"entirely inappropriate\".\nIn Mr Swann's paper to ministers ahead of Monday's meeting, he suggested that a decision taken by the executive on 23 September encouraging employers to \"begin planning a gradual return to the workplace\" for employees should be reversed.\nThe proposal goes on to say that the message should be communicated by stating that if a person worked from home when the pandemic began in March 2020 then \"they should be working from home now\".\nOn Friday, Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride, said research had shown that working from home was \"one of the single most effective interventions\" to control the virus.\nAnother proposal raised by the minister is a \"Covid score\" for businesses based on their compliance with regulations and Covid safety measures.\nMr Swann said while this suggestion was dismissed as an option last year, he believes it should be revisited and has suggested the executive's Covid taskforce take on the development of such a scheme.\nThe document also advises ensuring enforcement against those breaching existing Covid restrictions, including people who do not comply with wearing face coverings where they are legally required.\nMr Swann said that since rules on mandatory face coverings in shops and public transport were introduced in summer 2020, only five fines had been issued to people for failing to follow the law.\nThe minister added that unless enforcement was strengthened, the public would see \"compliance as unimportant and optional\".\nMost of the proposals in the paper are aimed at improving messaging and communication of current coronavirus advice.\nMr Swann is also understood to have said in his paper that communications on public health are \"much more effective when delivered with a united voice by all executive ministers\"."

More than 85% of Australian over-16s are now fully vaccinated.\nThe pandemic's chokehold on international travel has highlighted Australia's economic dependency on foreign labour and international students. \nThe international education sector earned Australia an estimated A$40bn (\u00a321bn; $29bn) in 2019, making it the country's fourth-biggest export after iron ore, coal and gas. \nUntil recently, Australia barred even its own people from leaving the country under a strategy sometimes dubbed \"Fortress Australia\".\nThe policy was praised for helping to suppress Covid, but it has also controversially separated families. \nThe measure was only eased in November this year, giving long-awaited freedoms to vaccinated citizens and their relatives.

I then got called out and got given the news.\n\"I had to go back in to tell cabinet colleagues, many of whom had known David for decades, and I'm afraid several colleagues broke down in tears because it was just an appalling piece of news.\n\"I think we were also very shaken by the implications of what had happened, and the fact his life had been tragically ended in the way that it was.\n\"I've spoken to members of his family and they've had a very tough time, as you can imagine.\"\nAsked about Sir David's legacy, Mr Johnson said: \"I think David's legacy is multifarious - he did all sorts of things. \n\"He campaigned on endometriosis, on fuel poverty, on the registration of driving instructors, on children with learning disabilities - he has a tremendous, natural sympathy for people who needed help. He showed what a backbencher can do. \n\"He has a big legacy of things he actually achieved as a backbencher.\n\"He was a valiant campaigner for a long time for leaving the European Union, and he was ultimately successful in that, and he has the permanent memorial of having transformed Southend into a city.\n\"His legacy really is that he will be a kind of exemplar of what a constituency MP can do. \n\"All our strength and our enjoyment of the job ultimately derives from that interaction with our constituents and our ability to pick up what's really happening and to try and help.\"\nMr Johnson said he firmly believed Sir David would not want anything to impede the close relationship MPs had with their constituents.\n\"The last thing David would want now would be for that vital free exchange between MPs and constituents to be interrupted or closed down as a result of the appalling circumstances of his [death],\" he said.\n\"I think what he would want is for us to be able to continue to interact with our constituents in the normal way. \n\"We've got to make sure MPs take proper precautions. The police are renewing their advice to MPs on how to do it and we'll make sure the security services do everything they can to pick up possible threats and we try and anticipate problems wherever we can,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"But in the end, I think David would agree we've got to be able to meet our constituents and help them.\"\nFollowing a service for Sir David at St Mary's Church, Prittlewell, his casket will be carried in a horse-drawn hearse through Southend's streets. \nThere will be a funeral mass on Tuesday at the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral in London.\nMonday's private service at the Church of England parish church, led by the Reverend Paul Mackay and Monsignor Kevin William Hale, will begin at 13:00 GMT and will only be attended by the family of Sir David, who was married with four daughters and a son.\nThe service will be broadcast live on BBC Essex.\nThe hearse will pause for a few minutes outside the Civic Centre in Victoria Avenue and Sir David's Iveagh Hall constituency office in Leigh Road, before returning to the chapel of rest.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Wisconsin,United States",
      "text": "At least five people have been killed and more than 40 injured after a car ploughed into a Christmas parade in the US state of Wisconsin, police say. \nSchool bands and a dance troupe of grannies were among those marching through the city of Waukesha when a red SUV came speeding down the road. \nIt hit dozens of people, including children.\nOne person is in custody. The incident does not appear \"at this time\" to be an act of terrorism, one official said.\nWarning: This article contains upsetting content.\nThe suspect appeared to have been fleeing another scene - possibly a knife fight - when he ran into people at the parade, the law enforcement official, who is familiar with the early findings of the investigation, told the BBC's US partner CBS News.\nIt is unclear if the individual in custody was the driver of the vehicle.\nLocal resident Angelito Tenorio told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper he had just finished marching in the parade when the SUV \"put the pedal to the metal and just [started] zooming full speed along the parade route\" at about 16:40 (22:40 GMT) on Sunday. \n\"Then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle,\" he said. \nCorey Montiho said his daughter's dance team was hit by the SUV.\n\"There were pom-poms and shoes and spilled hot chocolate everywhere. I had to go from one crumpled body to the other to find my daughter,\" he told the paper.\nSarah Saldivar, who was at the parade with her two young children, told CBS News she saw \"a red blur\" and then saw \"little girls flying through the air\".\nThe parade in Waukesha - a community of about 72,000 located to the west of Milwaukee - is traditionally held every year on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, and includes fancy dress, floats, dancers and marching bands. This year's theme was \"comfort and joy\". \nFamilies lined the sides of the road to watch the event, which was returning after a year's absence due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nOne video shared on social media shows the car crashing at high speed through street barriers, while another shows the vehicle driving into what looks like a group of musicians.\nPolice officers ran down the street during the incident, telling people to take shelter in shops. Police chief Dan Thompson told reporters that officers had fired at the car to try to stop it. \nJason Kellner told the New York Times newspaper he had just watched his son go past with his school marching band when the car came towards the crowd and \"started mowing people down\". \n\"I've never felt a worse feeling; wondering what I'm going to find when I get to my kid,\" he said.\nMr Kellner found his son standing unharmed at the side of the road, but saw several injured people and pulled a bloody saxophone off the street. \nAnother witness told Milwaukee's Fox6 TV station that there was silence, followed by screaming, running and checking on those injured after the vehicle hit a dance team of girls aged between about nine and 15. \nThe Milwaukee Dancing Grannies said some of its members \"were impacted and we are waiting for word on their conditions\".\n\"Please keep the Grannies, all those injured, and all those who witnessed this horrible event in your thoughts and prayers,\" the group wrote on its Facebook page.\nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee said one of its priests, multiple parishioners and students at a local Catholic school were among the injured.\nPhotos of a red SUV with a crumpled bonnet parked in a driveway were posted on Twitter by TV station CBS 58.\nChief Thompson said officers had recovered a \"suspect vehicle\" and a person of interest was in custody, but gave no further details. He added that the investigation was \"very fluid\".\nOfficials in Waukesha warned that the number of fatalities and injuries could change as additional information is collected. They said some people had transported themselves to local hospitals. \nFire chief Steven Howard told reporters that his department had taken 11 adults and 12 children to nearby hospitals after the incident. \nThe Children's Wisconsin hospital said it had received 15 patients as of 20:00, while the Aurora Medical Center-Summit said it was treating 13 people, including three in a critical condition. \nMayor Shawn Reilly described the incident as a \"horrible, senseless tragedy\". \n\"I am deeply saddened to know that so many in our community went to a parade but ended up dealing with injury and heartache,\" he said.\nThe White House has said President Joe Biden is being regularly updated on the incident and has offered support to local officials.\nWisconsin Governor Tony Evers has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff across the state in honour of the victims.\nWaukesha's public schools will be closed on Monday, and counselling services have been made available to those affected.\nA community fund has been created to help victims of the incident. \nWere you at the parade?

      "text": "New homes and buildings in England will be required by law to install electric vehicle charging points from next year, the prime minister has announced.\nThe government said the move will see up to 145,000 charging points installed across the country each year.\nNew-build supermarkets, workplaces and buildings undergoing major renovations will also come under the new law.\nThe move comes as the UK aims to switch to electric cars, with new petrol and diesel cars sales banned from 2030.\nAnnouncing the new laws at the Confederation of British Industry's conference on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK was going to \"radically\" change its cars, trucks, buses and other modes of transport.\n\"The force driving that change won't be government, it won't even be business...it will be the consumer. It will be the young people of today, who can see the consequences of climate change and will be demanding better from us.\"\nBut Labour said the announcement does not address the \"appalling\" geographical divide in available charging points.\n\"London and the South East have more public car charging points than the rest of England and Wales combined. Yet there is nothing here to help address this.\n\"Nor is there help so lower and middle income families can afford electric vehicles or the investment required to build the gigafactories we need,\" Labour said.\nThe government said the new laws will \"make it as easy as refuelling a petrol or diesel car today\".\nIt said \"simpler ways to pay\" to charge vehicles through contactless payments would also be introduced at \"all new fast and rapid charge points\".\nBritain currently has about 25,000 charging points, but the Competition and Markets Authority has said it could need 10 times as many before 2030.\nThe switch to electric vehicles is part of the UK's strategy to hit climate targets, with cars and taxis accounting for 16% of UK emissions in 2019.\nSeveral major car manufacturers, such as Jaguar and Volvo plan to go all electric from 2025 and 2030 and Ford has said all vehicles sold in Europe will be electric by 2030. \nHowever, four of the world's biggest carmakers, Volkswagen, Toyota, Renault-Nissan and Hyundai-Kia failed to sign a COP 26 summit pledge to only sell zero emissions cars and vans by 2035.\nUK electric car sales are growing, with about 10% of cars sold in 2020 being electric, up from 2.5% in 2018.\nHowever, concerns have been raised about the lack of charging infrastructure. The Policy Exchange think tank has warned the rollout of charging points has fallen behind and said there is a risk of \"charging blackspots\" in small towns and rural areas unless it speeds up.\nMPs on the Transport Select Committee have also said people must be protected from excessive pricing for public electric car charging, with home charging being much cheaper.\nMike Childs, Friends of the Earth's head of policy, welcomed the government's announcement, adding that electric vehicles had a \"significant role to play in building a zero-carbon future\". \n\"New housing should also include secure cycle storage and access to high quality public transport, to provide real alternatives to driving and help cut congestion,\" Mr Childs added.\nAlong with its announcement on charging points, the government also confirmed almost \u00a310m will fund a new hydrogen project at the UK's largest onshore windfarm near Glasgow.\nThe cash injection will help the Whitelee green hydrogen project develop the UK's largest electrolyser, a system which converts water into hydrogen gas as a way to store energy and supply local transport providers with zero-carbon fuel."

The figure for last year was 8,469.\nMore than 1,000 migrants arrived in one day earlier this month, a new record.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel told MPs there was a \"global migration crisis\" and the number of illegal migrants departing France was \"unacceptable\". \nIn answer to an urgent Commons question on the crossings from shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds, she said the government's Nationality and Borders Bill was the \"long-term solution\" to tackling the issue \"on top of a raft of operational and diplomatic work\". \nA Home Office spokesperson added: \"The British public have had enough of seeing people die in the Channel while ruthless criminal gangs profit from their misery and our new plan for immigration will fix the broken system which encourages migrants to make this lethal journey.\"\nWhile the number coming across the Channel by boat has soared, that is only part of the picture regarding migrants - as this year has seen far fewer using other strategies to enter the country undetected.\nIt means that, overall, the number of people to have claimed asylum in the UK in the year ending June 2021 was 31,115, a 4% fall on the previous 12 months. \nThe government's plan would change the law so that people facilitating Channel crossings would face a maximum sentence of life in prison.\nThe proposed changes to immigration, being considered by MPs, would see people seeking protection as refugees having their asylum claim partly assessed on how they arrived in the UK. People arriving by what the government calls illegal means would no longer have the same entitlement to claim asylum. \nOn Saturday, there were 28 separate events, leading to the 886 people either being rescued or intercepted. That same day, French authorities intervened 14 times, preventing 466 people reaching the UK. \nIt is thought at least 10 people have died in the past few weeks while attempting to make the crossing.\nWhat we are counting here are the numbers of people who have crossed the Channel in small boats this year and arrived in the UK - the vast majority going on to claim asylum in Britain.\nHowever, Home Office figures on overall asylum claims show a 4% fall year-on-year, with fewer people requesting sanctuary in the year to June 2021 than a year earlier.\nWhat appears to have happened is that those looking to claim asylum in the UK have switched their strategy. \nIn the past, migrants might have come by aircraft or tried to enter on lorries - but a combination of factors including increased security and Covid have made those traditional routes less viable.  So now the people smugglers and the desperate migrants are using small boats.\nThe Home Office believes its best strategy is to reform the asylum system so that those who come by unauthorised routes are much more likely to be sent back.\nHowever, since Brexit, the UK has no return arrangements with any EU country. In the whole of this year, of the 25,000 migrants arriving in small boats, the UK has managed to return just five.\nA review into how to prevent migrants crossing the English Channel to reach the UK is going to be led by Cabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay, after the home secretary promised tougher action. \nMr Barclay will explore what ministerial departments can do to make the issue more of a priority in government.  \nThe prime minister's spokesman said \"there is more that can be done to step up this enforcement\" from both France and the UK.\n\"We continue to believe that there is more that can be done on both sides,\" he said. \"We are introducing these new powers [in the Nationality and Borders Bill], we will continue to work closely with our French counterparts.\nHe said that joint efforts had stopped more than 20,000 attempts at crossings so far this year.\nIn an agreement signed in July, the UK pledged to give France \u20ac62.7m (\u00a354m) during 2021-22 to help tackle the issue.\nThe deal said the UK would help France increase police patrols along its coastline, boost aerial surveillance and increase security infrastructure at ports.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on Monday, Labour MP Yvette Cooper highlighted evidence to the Home Affairs committee that UK-funded drones were not being used by the French authorities to help prevent the crossings.\nThe home secretary said France had in the past week accepted a number of UK proposals around the use of \"surveillance\" as well as other technology including sensors on beaches and automatic number plate recognition.\nThe people who cross the Channel come to the UK from the poorest and most vulnerable parts of the world - including Yemen, Eritrea, Chad, Egypt, Sudan and Iraq.\nUnder international law, people have the right to seek asylum in whichever country they arrive, and there is nothing to say you must seek asylum in the first safe country. It is very hard to apply to the UK for asylum unless you are already in the country."

      "text": "There has been progress in talks between the EU and UK but \"significant gaps remain\", Lord Frost has said.\nThe UK Brexit minister made the comments after meeting European Commission Vice-President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d.\nLord Frost said there was the potential to \"generate some momentum\" in the talks, which will continue next week.\nThe men were discussing the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe protocol is the deal between the EU and UK which was agreed as a way to avoid a hardening of the Irish land border.\nIt leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, meaning goods can flow freely with the Republic of Ireland.\nHowever, goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control - amounting to a so-called Irish Sea border.\nThe EU has acknowledged its is causing difficulties to some businesses and needs to be improved.\nHowever the UK is seeking more fundamental changes, including removing the European Court of Justice from an oversight role.\nTechnical talks ahead of Friday's meeting had focused on guaranteeing the supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said there had been progress in this area, adding: \"We now need to press on and get this crucial issue across the line. \n\"This is a real test of political goodwill.\"\nHe said that on the issue of customs there had been \"initial useful engagement at a technical level\".\nLord Frost said that with medicines, any solution needed to ensure that products were available at the same time and on the same basis across the whole of the UK.  \nHe added that there had not been \"substantive progress on the fundamental customs and SPS (agrifood) issues relating to goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland\".\nThe two men are due to meet again in London next Friday.\nEarlier, UK cabinet minister Michael Gove said he was confident of making progress on issues over the Northern Ireland Protocol without triggering Article 16.\nArticle 16 of the protocol allows unilateral \"safeguard\" measures to be taken if either the EU or UK concluded that the deal was leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade.\nThat would amount to a suspension of parts of the deal.\nOn Thursday, the Lord Frost reiterated that triggering Article 16 remained an option for the UK.\nThe EU believes the use of Article 16 is unjustified and would be used by the UK as pretext to repudiate the protocol.\nMr Gove said the protocol had meant disruption to trade and inconvenience for people in Northern Ireland.\nBut he praised a constructive approach from the European Commission.\nSpeaking at the British-Irish Council summit in Cardiff, Mr Gove said Lord Frost had \"signalled that while of course it is always possible Article 16 may require to be invoked - we are confident we will be able to make progress without it\".\nLate on Thursday night, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said there was \"serious intent\" in the EU to solve the disagreement on Northern Ireland.\nHe said the mood music surrounding EU-UK negotiations had improved in recent weeks but he admitted feeling frustrated that the issue had hindered the \"full flowering\" of the two sides' alliance."

      "text": "Double child killer Colin Pitchfork was arrested and recalled to prison because he had been approaching young women, the BBC understands.\nHe was released two months ago after spending 33 years in jail for murdering two teenage girls in the 1980s.\nSince then he is understood to have approached young women on multiple occasions while out on walks from the bail hostel where he was living.\nHe was arrested after probation staff raised concerns about his behaviour.\nBarbara Ashworth, whose daughter Dawn was murdered by Pitchfork in 1986, told the Daily Mail: \"It is worrying that he is approaching young women in this manner. It just goes to show that a leopard never changes its spots.\"\nThere have also been concerns he had been trying to cheat lie detector tests. The BBC's home and legal correspondent Dominic Casciani has been told he was doing this by using breathing techniques.\nPitchfork was jailed in 1988 for raping and murdering 15-year-olds Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth in Leicestershire.\nHe raped and strangled Lynda Mann in 1983 and did the same to Dawn Ashworth in 1986.\nThe Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said Pitchfork has not committed any further offences since being released.\nHowever, the step of recalling him is thought to have been taken as a preventative measure due to a concerning pattern in his behaviour.\nDawn Ashworth's uncle, Philip Musson, told BBC Woman's Hour that releasing Pitchfork had been an \"ill-judged\" experiment.\n\"The wellbeing of children and families [was] being subject to this experiment,\" he said.\n\"I appreciate we can't lock up the vast majority of criminals and throw away the key but there are just one or two who commit such heinous offences against society that they can't be successfully repatriated safely back into society, and he is one of them.\"\nThere was public outcry when the Parole Board deemed Pitchfork to be suitable for release, and even former Justice Secretary Robert Buckland challenged the decision.\nSpeaking to BBC Woman's Hour after Pitchfork was recalled, he said: \"My view bluntly is that he should never have been released, and that's why I raised my concerns back in the summer.\n\"Frankly I very much hope that we don't see this man being released again.\"\nCurrent Justice Secretary Dominic Raab is said to be looking at proposals to overhaul the Parole Board, with the findings of a review anticipated next year.\n\"I think reform is necessary and I think we can do better,\" Mr Buckland said.\n\"This case has thrown up, again, a horrific example of how things can go wrong. We need action soon.\"\nPitchfork was subject to an unusually high number of licence conditions. The MoJ said there were more than 40 - including exclusion zones, curfews and polygraph testing - while murderers are usually only subject to about seven.\nPitchfork's case must now be referred to the Parole Board within 28 days.\nThere will likely be a parole hearing due to the seriousness of the case, rather than considering the circumstances of the recall \"on paper\", meaning by solely reviewing documents.\nThe hearing will determine whether Pitchfork should stay in a closed prison, be transferred to an open prison or be released.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Boris Johnson,CBI",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has been criticised after he lost his place in a speech to British businesses leaders and referred to the children's cartoon Peppa Pig.\nSpeaking to the CBI conference, the PM also quoted Lenin and performed an impression of a car.\nHalting his speech led to an awkward 21 seconds of apologies and paper shuffling from the Tory leader.\nLabour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, called the speech \"shambolic\".\nShe added: \"No one was laughing, because the joke's not funny anymore.\"\nA senior Downing Street source told the BBC: \"Business was really looking for leadership today and it was shambolic.\"\nThey added there was \"a lot of concern inside the building\" about Mr Johnson.\n\"Cabinet needs to wake up and demand serious changes otherwise it'll keep getting worse. If they don't insist, he just won't do anything about it.\"\nA Downing Street spokesperson pointed out that CBI head Tony Danker had welcomed the PM's words on the private sector working with the government.\nMr Johnson's 25-minute speech to assembled business leaders focused on levelling up, but also took some awkward turns as the prime minister tried to fuel enthusiasm for his green industrial revolution. \nAfter saying government \"cannot fix everything\" and that \"the true driver of growth is not government but the energy and dynamism and originality of the private sector\", Mr Johnson turned to CBI chief Mr Danker and said: \"Yesterday I went, as we all must, to Peppa Pig World.\"\nHe asked the audience for a show of hands for who had been to the Hampshire attraction, and after saying \"not enough\", the PM continued.\n\"I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it,\" he said. \n\"Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. \n\"It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, a heavy emphasis on mass transit systems I noticed, even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig.\"\nMr Johnson added: \"The real lesson for me going to Peppa Pig World... was about the power of UK creativity. \n\"Who would have believed a pig who looks like... a Picasso like hairdryer, a pig that was rejected by the BBC, would now be exported to 180 countries and theme parks both in America and China, as well as in the New Forest and be a business worth at least \u00a36bn to this country and counting. \n\"I think that is pure genius don't you? No government in the world, no Whitehall civil servant, would have conceivably come up with Peppa.\"\nLiberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: \"Businesses are crying out for clarity. Instead, all they got was Boris Johnson rambling on about Peppa Pig.\n\"It is a perfect metaphor for Johnson's chaotic, incompetent government as it trashes our economy, but it is not worthy of a British prime minister.\"\nDuring the section in the speech on electric cars, accompanied by a potted history of his career as a motoring correspondent, Mr Johnson launched into a seemingly well-practised impression of a car. \n\"[Electric vehicles] may not burble like sucking doves,\" he said. \"And they may not have that 'vrrrom vrrrom raaah raaah' that you like.\n\"But they have so much torque that they move off the lights faster than a Ferrari.\"\nThe PM then moved onto his personal 10 point plan to support businesses going greener in the future. \nBut he made an ambitious jump when he appeared to compare himself to Moses as he \"came down from [Mount] Sinai and [told] my officials [about] the new 10 commandments\" - pledges including more investment in wind power and hydrogen technologies. \nThat was still less of a surprise than a Conservative prime minister, known for his quotations, turning to a Russian revolutionary to drive his point home.\n\"Lenin once said that the Communist Revolution was Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country,\" he told the crowd.\n\"Well, I hesitate to quote Lenin before the Confederation of British Industry, but the coming industrial revolution is green power plus the electrification of the whole country.\"\nAfter urging people back to office, saying there were \"reasons why Mother Nature does not like working from home\", the PM then lost his place in his speech\nWhat followed was 21 seconds of silence, filled with the occasional mumble of \"forgive me\" and much ruffling of papers.\nBut he returned to his script to talk about building up skills and the government's Integrated Rail Plan, which despite a raft of critical coverage, he claimed it would be \"transformatory\".\nAfter questions on other issues of the day - the government's announcements on rail, and criticism of plans for the social care cap - Mr Johnson left the stage.\nBut later, before heading back to Downing Street, the PM gave an interview to a reporter, who simply asked: \"Is everything OK?\"\nMr Johnson said he thought people had \"got the vast majority of the points\" he wanted to make and that the speech \"went over well\"."

      "tags": "Austria,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Brussels,Netherlands,Coronavirus pandemic,Belgium",
      "text": "Austria has returned to a full national lockdown as protests against new restrictions aimed at curbing Covid-19 infections spread across Europe.\nFrom midnight, Austrians have been asked to work from home and non-essential shops have closed.\nNew restrictions have sparked protests throughout Europe. People clashed with police in the Netherlands and Belgium. \nInfection rates have risen sharply on the continent, prompting warnings from the World Health Organization (WHO).\nOn Saturday WHO regional director Dr Hans Kluge told the BBC that unless measures were tightened across Europe - such as on vaccines, wearing masks and with Covid passes for venues - half a million more deaths could be recorded by next spring.\nLast week Austria became the first European country to make Covid vaccination a legal requirement, with the law due to take effect in February. Politicians in neighbouring Germany are debating similar measures as intensive care units there fill up and case numbers hit fresh records.\nThis is Austria's fourth national lockdown since the pandemic began.\nAuthorities have ordered residents to stay home for all but essential reasons, including work, exercise and shopping for food. \nRestaurants, bars, hairdressers, theatres and non-essential shops must all close their doors. These measures will continue until 12 December, although officials said they will be reassessed after 10 days. \nSpeaking on ORF TV on Sunday night, health minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said the government had to \"react now\".\n\"A lockdown, a relatively tough method, a sledgehammer, is the only option to reduce the numbers [of infections] here,\" he told the broadcaster.\nTens of thousands of people protested in the capital Vienna ahead of the lockdown. Brandishing national flags and banners reading \"Freedom\", protesters shouted \"Resistance!\" and booed the police.\nResinger Harald, a 62-year-old from the southern Carinthia region, is fully vaccinated and feels the lockdown is not necessary.\n\"It will hurt some of the smaller businesses severely and they might run into financial difficulties,\" she told the BBC.\nJennifer Wall, a British woman who moved to Vienna about two years ago, has also been double-jabbed. She described the protests over the weekend as \"disruptive\" and \"scary\".\n\"The situation here is really tense,\" she said. \"There is a clear divide between vaccinated and not vaccinated.\"\nAbout 65% of Austria's population is fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in Western Europe. The country's daily vaccination rate has risen sharply in November, but some people are still hesitant.\nIn Vienna, one unvaccinated woman told the BBC that Austria's plan to make vaccinations compulsory amounted to a \"restriction of human rights\". \"It's always a person's choice,\" she said.\nSeveral European countries saw angry protests against tougher restrictions turn violent over the weekend.\nIn Belgium's capital, Brussels, demonstrators clashed with police after tens of thousands of people marched through the city centre.\nProtesters are mainly opposed to Covid passes that stop the unvaccinated from entering cafes, restaurants and entertainment venues.\nThe march started peacefully but some launched stones and fireworks at officers, who responded with tear gas and water cannon.\nAcross the border in the Netherlands, rioting took place for the third night in a row.\nLocal media report that police arrested 15 people in the southern city of Roosendaal where a primary school was set ablaze. An emergency order has also been imposed in the town of Enschede to keep people off the streets overnight.\nOn Saturday, people hurled fireworks at police and set fire to bicycles in The Hague. That followed what Rotterdam's mayor called \"an orgy of violence\" on Friday, when officers opened fire after protesters threw rocks and fireworks and set police cars ablaze. \nFour people thought to have been hit by police bullets remain in hospital, authorities said on Sunday.\nThe Netherlands is under a three-week nationwide partial lockdown, forcing restaurants to shut earlier and banning fans at sports events. \nProtesters are also angry at a ban on fireworks on New Year's Eve and government plans to introduce a vaccine pass for indoor venues.\nThousands of demonstrators were also on the streets in Croatia's capital Zagreb on Saturday, while in Denmark around 1,000 people protested in Copenhagen against government plans to order public sector workers to be vaccinated in order to enter workplaces.\nThe French Caribbean department of Guadeloupe, meanwhile, has been rocked by three days of looting and vandalism, over a mandatory vaccine order for health workers as well as high fuel prices. \nSome 38 people were reportedly arrested and special police forces were sent to the island on Sunday in a bid to quell the unrest after protesters ransacked and torched shops.

or more - than the current one\" and to introduce gender quotas in law.\nOnce a cross-party group has finished drawing up policies for a Senedd reform bill, Labour and Plaid Cymru promise to introduce the draft law \"12 to 18 months\" later.\nMr Drakeford said the deal would give the \"stability we need in the Senedd to go on delivering for Wales\", while Mr Price said the parties were taking a \"historic step forward together\". \nThere is an aim to \"work towards the creation of Ynni Cymru, a publicly owned energy company for Wales, over the next two years, to expand community-owned renewable energy generation\".\nMajor reform to post-EU farm subsidies in Wales will not be brought in until 2025.\nThe parties have agreed to \"introduce a transition period as we reform the system of farm payments so stability payments will continue to be a feature of the Sustainable Farming Scheme during and beyond this Senedd term\" as the parties agree \"the longer-term arrangements for Welsh agriculture\".\nThe co-operation agreement promises to \"commission an independent review of the local government section 19 and Natural Resources Wales reports\" into the widespread flooding across south Wales after Storm Dennis last February.\nOther policies featuring in the 11-page document include:\nWelsh Labour and Plaid Cymru's ruling bodies both approved the deal on Saturday.\nThe deal could still be scuppered if, against expectations, Plaid members vote against it at the party's virtual conference on the weekend.\nThe deal includes a pledge to extend free school meals to all primary school pupils, and expand the free childcare offer for two-year-olds.\nThe deal includes a cap on second and holiday home numbers, a commitment to work towards parity of \"reward and recognition\" for health and care workers, and to reform building safety and provide more cash to help people in flats with cladding problems.\nOther policies, already reported, include introducing local tourism taxes, publishing proposals on rent controls to make properties affordable for locals, reforming housing law to end homelessness and plans to change council tax.\nThe first minister has previously explained the talks were necessary because Welsh Labour has no overall majority to deal with \"challenging and ambitious issues\" as it has 30 of the 60 seats in Cardiff Bay.\nThe deal would not amount to a coalition between the parties, and Plaid Cymru members of the Senedd will not be entering government.\nBut BBC Wales has been told Plaid would be able to appoint special advisers to work on the deal in government.\nA Welsh Conservatives spokesman said the \"deal is remarkable for its absence of solutions to fix the NHS - currently experiencing its worst performance on record - or improve the economy in Wales\".\n\"Labour's latest deal with the nationalists does not deliver on the priorities of working families across Wales, and will only cause constitutional chaos that risks holding back our economic recovery,\" he added.\nSpeaking at a press conference on Monday, Mr Drakeford said: \"The chance to work with other parties wherever we have shared and common interests is something that has been here in the Senedd since the start of devolution and this agreement means we can continue to do that here in Wales. \n\"Today's agreement is a bespoke deal, this type of agreement has not been done before in the way that we are committed to doing.\"\n\"My focus and the focus of the government is on those bread and butter issues, which improve people's every day lives and which will help Wales to recover from this long pandemic.\"\nMr Price said: \"Through it we plant together the seed beneath the snow of a new society, a new Wales, a new beginning.\"\nHe added the party leaders \"continue to disagree on many things\", but have an \"ability to come together on some things\". \nMr Price also criticised the \"selfishness and greed\" of Westminster and said Wales would be a \"beacon of hope, progress and civility\". \nThis agreement has been a long time coming and it is extremely wide-ranging, which demonstrates just how much Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru have in common in their political outlook.\nBut some commitments are aspirational in tone and throw forward well beyond the scope of the three-year deal.\nPlans to enlarge the Senedd are there, but Labour hasn't committed to a more proportional voting system. \nSome of the potentially big - and difficult -reforms being promise, such as council tax and social care for example, don't give much of a clue as to how the parties hope to get there.\nWhile this is not a coalition, Adam Price has argued for some Plaid special advisers in Welsh government to keep up momentum on this plan.\nBut momentum is key for Mark Drakeford, too - remember, he has said he's stepping down midway through this term.\nIf he wants legacy projects, like a fundamental reform of council tax - the nettle that no-one grasps because finding an alternative is so politically tricky - the clock is ticking."

(The first \u00a320,000 of someone's assets is protected under the proposals).\nHowever, someone with a \u00a3500,000 house would be left with \u00a3414,000 after reaching the cap - leaving them about 83% of the value.\nFurther changes to the cap were announced last week. \nThe government said:\nSo, if someone's care costs \u00a3860 a week and they are meeting the cost themselves, it would take 100 weeks to hit the cap.\nHowever, if the same person receives council help it would take longer than 100 weeks.\nThat means poorer people receiving means-tested help will make contributions from their own money for longer.\nSally Warren, director of policy at The King's Fund health charity said \"These changes will mean that the people who need the most protection from catastrophically high care costs - those with low to moderate levels of wealth - will get less protection than wealthier people.\" \nThe government, however, says it wants to ensure people get support but are not unfairly reaching the cap at an artificially faster rate than others. \nThe cap doesn't cover living costs, like rent, food and utility bills. The guidance says people will have to meet these costs \"including after they reach the cap\".\nThe government has confirmed living costs will be up to \u00a3200 a week.\nTen years ago, an independent review by Sir Andrew Dilnot proposed a lifetime cap of \u00a335,000 for social care costs - but this was not introduced.\nSir Andrew said the changes the government was now introducing were \"a significant step forward\".\nBut he said the move would not stop the less well-off facing \"catastrophic costs\"."

Much will depend on your individual circumstances, but there are a number of reasons it's not necessarily the silver bullet it may first appear. \nThe cap on care is just that - a limit on how much you pay for care.\nThere was no mention of it in the 33-page plan published - but the government confirmed to BBC News the daily living costs in a care home - those associated with food, energy bills and the accommodation - will not count towards the cap.\nThe government has not said how much people should be prepared to contribute for these daily living costs - care homes do not usually itemise them.\nBut previous incarnations of the cap - the coalition government first considered it - suggested people's contribution to these living costs should be fixed at \u00a312,000 a year.\nThat would mean when someone hits the cap they could still face \u00a31,000 monthly bills for living costs.\nIn many ways, this is understandable - after all, they would be liable for living costs if they remained in their own home.\nBut it would mean - based on the average care home cost of \u00a336,000 a year - only \u00a324,000 of the spending counting towards the cap once those \u00a312,000 living costs are taken off.\nThat would mean it would take the average care home resident more than three and a half years to hit it.\nBut the problem is not many people live that long once they move into a care home. \nHalf die in little over a year, with three-quarters not making it past three years.\nCare you receive in your own home will count towards the cap. \nBut this tends to cost much less and therefore people would normally need to be in receipt of that care for many, many years to hit the cap.\nWhat is more, spending on care will count towards the cap only for people assessed by the local council as in need enough to be eligible. \nOnly the very frailest qualify.\nAnd more than half requests are turned down - with the County Councils Network predicting this will not change significantly with the changes announced.\nThe only way to widen access would be spending more on services - it has been increasingly squeezed in recent years.\nBut councils worry the money being raised by the National Insurance hike will be largely swallowed up covering the cost of the cap and funding the NHS - a warning that has also been reiterated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in its analysis of the tax rise.\nIf these fears are realised, it would mean the system remains on its knees with insufficient staff to provide the care people need, council leaders are warning. \nAnd it is why, according to Natasha Curry, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, the changes risk leaving the public and care system \"short-changed\", despite the eye-catching announcements.\nMinisters may certainly be able to claim they are the first government in more than 20 years not to have dodged the issue - but fixing the problem is another matter.\nFollow Nick on Twitter.\nRead more from Nick.\nDo you or a loved one require social care?

      "text": "Germany's health minister has issued his starkest warning yet on the importance of getting vaccinated.\n\"By the end of this winter everyone in Germany will either be vaccinated, recovered or dead,\" Jens Spahn told a news conference in Berlin on Monday.\nGermany is in the grip of a fourth wave of coronavirus. Cases are rising rapidly and many hospitals are full.\nIt has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Western Europe, with 68% of people fully vaccinated.\nGermany's infection rate is at its highest since the pandemic began, and health experts have warned this wave could be the worst yet. \nIn the past 24 hours, there have been 30,643 new infections - 7,000 more than a week ago. This is among the highest rates in the world.\nTighter restrictions are to be brought in which will see the unvaccinated excluded from certain venues, and some of Germany's famed Christmas markets have been cancelled.\nMr Spahn said he was against making Covid vaccines compulsory, but that it was a \"moral obligation\" to get the jab because it impacts on other people.\n\"Freedom means taking responsibility, and there is a duty to society to get vaccinated,\" he said. \nThe minister said the highly contagious Delta variant is driving the latest wave and that \"anyone who is not vaccinated will, over the next few months, become infected and lack protection\". \nIn the news conference on Monday, Mr Spahn also promoted the US-made Moderna shot, calling it the Rolls Royce of vaccines, as high demand for the German-produced Pfizer/BioNTech jabs risked depleting stocks.\nHe warned that some 16 million Moderna doses could expire in the next few months if they are not used.\nThe country expects the European Union to approve vaccines for children aged five to 11 by the end of the week.\nSince the start of the pandemic, more than 99,000 people in Germany have died, and more than 5.4 million have been infected with Covid-19."

      "text": "One of Germany's top virologists has warned that a further 100,000 people will die from Covid if nothing's done to halt an aggressive fourth wave. \nCase numbers have soared and Germany on Wednesday registered its highest rate of infection since the pandemic began, with almost 40,000 cases in a day. \n\"We have to act right now,\" said Christian Drosten, who described a real emergency situation.\nDoctors in the intensive care Covid ward at Leipzig University Hospital warn this fourth wave could be the worst yet. \nOne patient here, a woman in her 20s, has just given birth. Her baby is fine, but staff say they don't know whether she'll survive. \nThis state of Saxony has the highest seven-day infection rate in Germany at 459 cases per 100,000 people. The national rate is 232.\nIt also has the lowest take-up of vaccine: 57% of the population here have been vaccinated. \nThere are 18 patients on the Covid ward. Just four were vaccinated. \n\"It's very difficult to get staff motivated to treat patients now in this fourth wave,\" says Prof Sebastian Stehr, who heads the department. \"A large part of the population still underestimates the problem.\"\nBy now, Prof Sehr says, most people will know someone who's had Covid and should, therefore, be aware of the risk of infection. \"Nevertheless,\" he adds, \"we are still seeing so many patients who are not vaccinated.\"\nGermany's health minister has publicly blamed those people for the soaring cases, describing the current situation as a \"pandemic of the unvaccinated\".\nAt the start of this week, Saxony banned unvaccinated people from bars, restaurants, public events and sport and leisure facilities. At least several other states are expected to follow suit. \nGermany's anti-vaxxers are furious. Several thousand protested last weekend in Leipzig. \n\"This is discrimination, and we want to express vehemently that we do not accept this in our society,\" said Leif Hansen, who represents anti-vax \"Bewegung Leipzig\" (Leipzig Movement). He doesn't trust the companies that made the vaccine or the authorities who approved it. \n\"They say the vaccination is ok, that I should give it to my children? Never!\" he told me. \"I have a feeling that it should never go into my body, and I will fight all I can to prevent it coming into my body.\"\nSixteen million Germans over the age of 12 have not been fully vaccinated. The German government has admitted it's unlikely to persuade many of those people now, and politicians worry that social divisions might deepen. \nWhat many fear is another lockdown. Nadine Herzog's bar in Leipzig barely survived the last one. She deftly prepares cocktails as she tells us that even before the authorities required it she and her co-owner banned unvaccinated drinkers. \n\"My business is dying. My dreams came true and now they suffer from people who don't do logical things to prevent others from getting ill or dying and I'm so angry,\" she told the BBC.\nA long queue formed outside a vaccine centre in the city earlier in the week. Evidence, perhaps, that some have changed their minds. But Germany is also now rolling out booster jabs amid concerns about waning protection in those who have been vaccinated. \nOn the intensive care Covid unit they fear the damage is done. Operations have already been cancelled, procedures postponed to make way for Covid patients. \nDoctors here told us that nearly half of the people who end up here will die. \nFor Germany, which invented one of the world's first Covid vaccines, that is a source of great shame.

      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People working from home in Northern Ireland during the first wave of the pandemic \"should be working from home\" again, the health minister has advised.\nRobin Swann said a previous decision to relax the working from home messaging should be reversed, it is understood.\nThe comments formed part of a document issued to the executive on Thursday.\nThis week the Department of Health said more restrictions before Christmas were possible unless transmission of the virus drops significantly.\nOn Friday Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride said: \"No-one should be in any doubt about the seriousness of the situation we are facing into.\n\"Unless we get this virus back under control... what we are looking at is potentially our hospital system being overwhelmed by mid-December,\" he told BBC News NI.\nHowever he said he did not believe that Northern Ireland would \"go back to the damaging impact of lockdowns\".\nDiscussing the topic of Christmas parties, Sir Michael urged people to be \"selective\" about which events they attended and for organisers to do risk assessments in advance.\n\"People should not be cancelling their plans at this stage but they should be thinking of planning carefully to minimise the risk to themselves and others,\" he said.\nMr Swann's advice on working from home came after he instructed officials to draft a paper looking at other ways to improve adherence with existing restrictions.\nIt followed a contentious vote by Stormont ministers to approve Covid-19 vaccine passports for domestic use in Northern Ireland from next month.\nThe plan means people will have to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or proof of a negative coronavirus test result to access nightclubs, pubs or restaurants.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had voted against the proposals but Mr Swann and other Stormont ministers said the use of vaccination status certification would save lives.\nAt present, executive advice on working from home is that people should continue to do so where they can.\nNew Covid-19 advice coming into effect in the Republic of Ireland on Friday is for anyone who can work from home to do so unless it is necessary to do otherwise.\nIrish bars, restaurants and nightclubs will also close at the earlier time of midnight.\nIt is understood that in Mr Swann's document he suggests that a decision taken by the executive on 23 September encouraging employers to \"begin planning a gradual return to the workplace\" for employees should be reversed.\nThe proposal states: \"I believe that message should be reversed to once again advise employees to work from home where they can and to advise employers to support this where possible.\"\nIt goes on to say that the message should be communicated by stating that if a person worked from home when the pandemic began in March 2020 then \"they should be working from home now\".\nAdvice from health officials suggests strengthening the message would help reduce the risk of transmission of coronavirus inside and outside workplaces.\nSir Michael, the chief medical officer, told BBC News NI on Friday that research had shown that working from home was \"one of the single most effective interventions\" to control the virus.\n\"It reduces mixing in the workplace, it reduces infection and transmission in the workplace but also travelling to and from the workplace,\" he said.\n\"There is strong scientific evidence that it is an effective intervention.\"\nHe said the level of transmission of the virus in Northern Ireland needs to be brought \"back under control\".\n\"Now is the time to act, we have time to act, we have a number of weeks to act and take action immediately,\" he said.\nIt is understood that in the advice paper Mr Swann has also proposed giving the Stormont assembly a debate on the Covid passport regulations before they become enforceable on 13 December.\nThe DUP had called for that to happen ahead of the measures taking effect.\nIt is understood that the document also advises ensuring enforcement against those breaching existing Covid restrictions, including people who do not comply with wearing face coverings where they are legally required.\nMr Swann said that unless that happened the public would see \"compliance as unimportant and optional\" and would lessen the benefits of wearing face coverings.\nSDLP MLA Colin McGrath said he believed the police should be enforcing penalties for people not wearing face coverings.\nSir Michael told BBC News NI that wider restrictions had to be considered in sectors \"where we know the risks are higher\".\n\"The Covid certificates for domestic use is one way of putting in those wider restrictions and keeping those higher risk settings open,\" he said.\nThe health minister is also understood to have said in his paper that communications on public health are \"much more effective when delivered with a united voice by all executive ministers\".\nIt is understood the minister is proposing that the executive asks the assembly speaker to allow a debate or an alternative method to allow MLAs to consider the regulations.\nThe executive will have to consider Mr Swann's paper but it is not clear yet when that may happen.\nAlliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw said she was concerned that Northern Ireland was moving \"into a very bleak Christmas for people\".\n\"We want people to enjoy their Christmas but it has to be with risk mitigations in place,\" she said."

      "text": "Priti Patel's \"incompetence\" in dealing with small boats crossing the Channel is \"dangerous\", Labour has said.\nMore than 24,700 people have made the crossing from France to the UK by boat so far this year to seek asylum or to immigrate - almost three times the total of 8,500 in 2020.\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds accused the government of \"comprehensive failure\" on the issue. \nBut ex-Home Secretary Sajid Javid said his successor was doing all she could.\nHe also questioned why people were making the dangerous journey, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: \"You have to ask the question, if you are a genuine asylum seeker, why have you not claimed asylum already if you're in a safe country [like France]?\"\nThe government has launched a review into how to prevent boats from crossing the 21-mile stretch of water from Calais, with the now-Health Secretary Mr Javid saying it wanted to \"bust the business model\" of people smugglers, who were \"ultimately responsible\" for the problem. \nBut Tory MPs are warning the issue is costing the Conservative Party in the polls.\nSpeaking to the BBC, South Thanet MP Craig Mackinlay said it had become a key issue on the doorstep and a solution was needed \"now\". \nA government source told the BBC the home secretary was the only one who had come up with a credible plan.\nBut they acknowledged there was no \"silver bullet\" to solve the issue. \nRecord numbers of people have made the crossing this year, with more than 1,000 making the journey in a single day earlier this month.\nHome Secretary Ms Patel has promised tougher action, but the numbers have continued to rise.\nAnd it is understood Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants more to be done. \nThe UK signed a deal with France in July, pledging \u20ac62.7m (\u00a354m) during 2021-22 to help the country increase police patrols along its coastline, boost aerial surveillance and increase security infrastructure at ports.\nBut Labour's Mr Thomas-Symonds accused his government counterpart of being \"more interested in a diplomatic spat [with France] than she is in a workable deal\". \nMinisters have often talked tough on small boats crossing the Channel - but record numbers are making the dangerous journey and potentially risking their lives.\nSome Tory MPs believe the government is increasingly looking weak by not managing to stop illegal crossings. \nThey report significant concern among constituents and believe that is being reflected in opinion polls.\nFor a party that promised to take back control after Brexit, they argue this shows the opposite. \nLabour wants closer cooperation with France - accusing ministers of indulging in \"spats\". \nBut it's not clear that would solve the issue either. \nMinisters argue the Nationality and Borders Bill going through the Commons at the moment will give them more powers, such as to process asylum cases in another country. \nThe argument is this would deter those people who are not genuine asylum seekers. \nBut it will be some time before ministers get those powers - and there are growing calls for a more immediate answer.  \nThe shadow home secretary said his party would reintroduce the Dubs scheme - intended to offer safe passage to unaccompanied child asylum seekers - as well as increasing patrols further away from the coast and reinstating overseas aid funding.\nHe also said a Labour government would find a replacement for the Dublin agreement, which allows EU countries to transfer asylum seekers back to the first member state they were proven to have entered - an agreement the UK left after Brexit.\nBetween January 2019 and October 2020, 231 migrants who crossed the Channel were returned to mainland Europe using the Dublin agreement.\nBut Immigration Minister Tom Pursglove told MPs last week that only five had been returned to mainland Europe so far in 2021.\nMr Thomas-Symonds told Andrew Marr: \"There are thousands of lives being risked in the English Channel on a day-to-day basis and the home secretary's incompetence on this matter is dangerous.\"\nBut Mr Javid said leaving the Dublin agreement had made little difference to the UK's ability to send asylum seekers back to other countries. \n\"Hardly any country in Europe enforced the Dublin agreement,\" the health secretary said.\n\"I can tell you that because I was home secretary at the time trying to enforce it and almost every country in Europe ignored it.\"\nThe minister said new agreements were needed with the EU, but he said Ms Patel had already signed some with countries like India.\nHe added: \"I would say that the pandemic has made returning people across the world, across asylum systems, much harder, and we do have to take that into account as well.\"\nMr Javid also said the home secretary \"is doing everything that she can and she hasn't taken anything off the table\" to tackle the issue.

      "text": "Businesses need to \"step up\" and help ensure the use of face coverings in their premises, Justice Minister Naomi Long has said. \nA a health paper has suggested Mrs Long's department should oversee plans to raise compliance levels above 80%. \nThe minister said her department did not have enforcement powers, adding personal responsibility was needed.\nShe said there should be a \"co-ordinated effort\" across departments to encourage greater usage. \nThe Alliance Party leader said the public needed to take \"personal responsibility\" for the wearing of face masks and adhering to other public health messaging such as maintaining hand hygiene and doing regular lateral flow tests.\n\"If we turn this into a just justice issue, then the automatic presumption is that it is for the police to enforce and it isn't that simple,\" the minister told BBC 's Evening Extra programme. \n\"We all have to take personal responsibility. \n\"Businesses need to step up too and say we will not grant admission to our premises, whether it's a retail environment or whether it's a cafe or restaurant, and say we will not grant admission unless you wear a mask and do the things we're asking you to do.\n\"Then if customers are difficult or abusive, that's the time the police can come in and enforce, but we cant reasonably expect the police to be in every shop, in every coffee shop, in every restaurant and in every setting.\"\nSince summer 2020, customers have been required to wear face masks in shops, on public transport and in a number of indoor settings - unless they are exempt.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann circulated a document to executive ministers last week with a range of proposals aimed at reducing transmission of the virus.\nIn it, he suggested that Mrs Long should \"take the lead in pursuing a minimum of 80% adherence to face coverings requirements, to gather evidence of this for the executive and to report of the number of fixed penalty notices issued\". \nMrs Long said she did not \"have a team of enforcers to send out even if I had the authority to do so, so it's not that simple\".\n\"There are a number of bodies that have an enforcement role, for example, the PSNI has a role, local councils have a role, the Health and Safety Executive has a role across the board,\" she added. \nStormont Executive ministers met on Monday to discuss the paper from the Department of Health.\nMrs Long said it was \"not unusual\" for departments to write a paper and then for other departments to give feedback and the paper be amended.\nShe said the issue had become a \"storm in a teacup\".\n\"The difficulty then comes when that paper is leaked and it looks as though there is a row between the ministers,\" she said.\n\"The ministers are all very much agreed that we need to see a step up in terms of personal levels of responsibility that people take.\"\nLast week, the Department of Health warned that unless cases decrease significantly in the next three weeks, then more \"severe\" restrictions could be required before Christmas. \nHowever, Mrs Long said the executive's focus at the minute is \"not on closure but on trying to keep businesses open\".\nIn a written response to the health minister's paper, the justice minister said she was \"at a loss to understand\" why Mr Swann suggested she take on responsibility for the matter.\nIn the letter to Mr Swann, seen by BBC News NI, she said a number of agencies were involved in overseeing compliance to Covid-19 restrictions including councils and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).\n\"The PSNI will also, rightly, only enforce where necessary,\" she added.\nMrs Long warned that the executive had to be aware of the \"wider impact\" of expecting the PSNI to adjust its approach to enforcement.\n\"We have seen public confidence in policing being adversely affected whenever the public believe the PSNI are taking a disproportionate approach.\"\nShe said the police and other enforcement agencies were there to be called on as a \"final measure\", as the duty remained with businesses to encourage compliance. \nShe said: \"The idea that compliance can be solely or even primarily an issue for justice is fundamentally flawed, as recognised by previous decisions of the executive.\"\nMrs Long said she also believed a \"key problem\" in improving compliance was the lack of consistent messaging across the executive.\nShe suggested that ministers needed to agree several \"key messages\" on public health advice at Monday's executive meeting and promote them \"relentlessly\".\nMark Lindsay, chairman of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, told BBC Radio Foyle that compliance can not solely be the responsibility of the PSNI.\n\"Police do have a role to play. It should not be misconstrued that police do not want to have anything to do with this, but it's about where we sit in the chain,\" he said.\nHe said funding a warden scheme could be \"a more effective way... than expecting police to step away from more urgent and risky situations to come and deal with this\".\nMeanwhile, Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, said businesses do not have the power to make people wear face coverings. \nHe told BBC's Radio Ulster's Nolan show: \"It is not our responsibility to police [it].\n\"Retailers and their staff do not have the power of sanction, they do not have the power to legally enforce what they have been doing and they have spent millions and millions on making sure their shops are safe, their staff are trained, their staff are safe, encouraging and reminding customers of their responsibility. \n\"If there is going to be enforcement, it is a matter for the police.\"\nOn Thursday, Mr Swann advised anyone who worked from home when the pandemic began last year should do so again now.\nHis document also suggested introducing a \"scores on the doors\" Covid compliance rating for businesses.\nDecisions on whether to strengthen current mitigations must be agreed by the executive first.\nHealth officials believe the proposals could help reduce transmission of the virus.\nStormont ministers have said they do not want to have to impose tougher mitigations that could damage trade.\nThey have already agreed to put in place proof of Covid status for certain sectors, which will become enforceable from 13 December.

      "tags": "Will Young,Sam Smith,Brit Awards,Music",
      "text": "Dua Lipa and J Hus will go down in history as the last stars to win best female and male at the Brit Awards.\nThat's because, from next year, the two categories will be combined into a single prize for best British artist, organisers have said.\nArtists like Sam Smith and Will Young had previously called for the change, saying the current system excludes non-binary artists.\nSmith, who is non-binary, missed out on a nomination at this year's awards.\nTheir album, Love Goes, reached number two in the UK chart, but they felt unable to enter the gender-based categories.\nWriting on Instagram at the time, the star called for awards shows to be more \"reflective of the society we live in\".\n\"The Brits have been an important part of my career,\" Smith said in a now-deleted post. \"Music for me has always been about unification not division.\n\"I look forward to a time where awards shows can be reflective of the society we live in. Let's celebrate everybody, regardless of gender, race, age, ability, sexuality and class.\"\nThe Brits have awarded prizes along gender lines since they began in 1977. Organisers promised to review the way the prizes in 2019, but kept the male and female categories intact until now.\n\"If you were starting the awards from scratch today, you'd probably do it on these terms,\" said Gennaro Castaldo, a spokesperson for music industry body the BPI, which runs the awards.\n\"Why shouldn't the likes of Adele and Ed Sheeran be able to go head to head and be judged as artists... assuming they're nominated?\"\nThe shift will also be reflected in the international category, where the best international male and female awards - won by The Weeknd and Billie Eilish this year - will be replaced by a single best international artist prize.\nDua Lipa's manager, Ben Mawson, said he approved of the change.\n\"It's good to see the Brits continuing to make progress to a more inclusive awards show that puts talent first,\" he told the BBC. \"It's a step that we welcome.\"\nWhen the change was first suggested in 2019, there were concerns that it could marginalise female acts. But the experiences of other music awards suggest that should not happen.\nThe MTV Video Music Awards replaced its best male and best female prizes with an overall best artist award in 2017 - since when the winners have been Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello, Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber.\nThe Grammys also merged the male and female categories for best pop vocal, country vocal and R&B vocal performances in 2012. In the 10 years since then, the prizes have been split exactly 50/50 between men and women.\nAt the Brits, the gender-neutral prize for best album has been won by female solo artists 10 times, and by male solo artists on nine occasions.\nBands have won best album 22 times, but only two of those have contained a female member - Fairground Attraction and Stereo MC's.\nDua Lipa would probably have won a combined award if it had been in place this year, and Adele is likely to sweep the board next year.\nThe singer's new album 30, which is on course to have the biggest opening sales week of 2021, will make her a prime contender for both album of the year and the best artist prize.\nMr Castaldo said that if the new system does prioritise male nominees, it would \"shine a spotlight\" on problems the industry needs to address.\n\"As an industry, we have to acknowledge those issues and we have to act on them. Keeping the status quo won't change things in the long term. So to achieve real equality for women and artists of all backgrounds, [this] is a very positive thing.\"\nReducing the number of artist awards has also allowed the Brits to reintroduce genre-based prizes for the first time since 2006.\nCovering pop, rock, dance and rap, the awards will be voted for by fans - a departure for The Brits, which typically distributes prizes based on votes from music industry insiders.\nWhen the prizes were last distributed 15 years ago, the winners included Kaiser Chiefs (best rock), Lemar (best urban act) and James Blunt (best pop).\nThe best dance prize has been absent for even longer - with the last recipient being Basement Jaxx in 2004.\nThe revamps come shortly before voting opens for the Brits, on 10 December.\nThe next ceremony will take place on 8 February 2022 at London's O2 arena, hosted for the first time by comedian Mo Gilligan, who will take over from Jack Whitehall.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The fiancee of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi has called on Justin Bieber to cancel his upcoming concert in Saudi Arabia next month.\nThe Canadian singer is among the stars set to perform at the kingdom's first Formula One Grand Prix in Jeddah.\nBut Hatice Cengiz wrote an open letter to Bieber urging him to \"send a powerful message\" by pulling out.\nKhashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi regime, was murdered at its consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.\nHe had gone there to pick up documents for the couple's wedding. The journalist's body was dismembered as Ms Cengiz waited outside.\n\"Do not sing for the murderers of my beloved Jamal,\" Ms Cengiz wrote in the letter, published in the Washington Post.\nShe said Bieber had a \"unique opportunity\" to show that his \"name and talent will not be used to restore the reputation of a regime that kills its critics\".\nBieber is set to headline at the F1 race on 5 December, joined by artists including A$AP Rocky, David Guetta and Jason Derulo.\nHuman Rights Watch has also called on Bieber and the other performers to pull out of the F1 concerts, saying the events are aimed at diverting attention from Saudi Arabia's human rights record.\nA US intelligence report found that Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman, effectively the kingdom's ruler, had approved Khashoggi's assassination. The crown prince however has repeatedly denied any involvement. \nThe 59-year-old journalist had once been an adviser to the Saudi government and close to the royal family, but he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017.\nBieber is not the first pop star to face pressure to pull out of a concert in Saudi Arabia.\nIn 2019, rapper Nicki Minaj cancelled a scheduled performance in Jeddah, citing her support for women and LGBT rights."

      "text": "The brother of a doctor who died after contracting Covid-19 said he \"touched a lot of lives\" helping people.\nDr Irfan Halim, 45, from Swindon's Great Western Hospital, was taken ill on 10 September after collapsing on a coronavirus ward where he was working.\nThe father-of-four died nine weeks later having not learned of his own father's death with Covid in September.\nAmir Halim told the BBC he would make sure his brother's children knew \"what an amazing person he was\".\nDr Irfan Halim had dedicated 25 years of work to the NHS as a surgeon, but when the coronavirus pandemic hit he switched to working on the frontline. \nHe came from a family of doctors and had a degree in law and had completed an MBA. \nAmir Halim said his family have been \"shocked and devastated\" by the loss. \nPaying tribute to his brother, he told the BBC's Today programme: \"He was always very happy, very energetic. Till the day he passed a week ago he was exactly the same.\n\"We hoped that he would recover and given his age, he was a fit and well young man. I think that's partly why we are so shocked and devastated.\n\"Until the day we were informed of the impending news, we had always hoped that he would pull through.\"\nAmir Halim described how his brother \"suddenly deteriorated\" and, being a medical doctor himself, he knew \"nothing else could be done at that stage\".\nWhen Dr Irfan Halim was on the hospital's intensive care unit, his primary focus was his dad, Dr Kamal Halim, who later died without him knowing, he said.\nDr Irfan Halim was put on a ventilator and transferred to the Royal Brompton Hospital in London where he stayed for nine weeks before he died on 14 November.\n\"He touched a lot of lives.\u00a0He had the abilities to help a lot of people in so many different ways,\" Amir Halim said.\n\"I will make sure his two sons and his two daughters grow up knowing what an amazing person their father was.\n\"We have struggled at times. Saying it's been the worst two months of my life is simply an understatement.\"\nFamily friend Mishal Husain added: \"Irfan was the eldest of three siblings and we knew each other as children when our families were living in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. \n\"It is tragic to think of a life of so many gifts cut short - and of a family grieving for a father and son, both lost to Covid, at the same time.\"\nWith Covid cases rising daily, Amir Halim warned about how \"we don't know who it's going to affect and how badly.\n\"This virus doesn't care if you are a gifted individual, it doesn't care if you are rich or poor and it will continue to affect lives unless we take necessary actions, which include getting your vaccinations, getting your boosters - limiting unnecessary contacts. \n\"There are people who have managed to get out of this infection unscathed and managed to have a very mild infection, but eventually it's going to affect someone you love in a very bad way.\"\nDr Edmond Adedeji and Dr Thaung Htaik, who worked at the same hospital, also died with coronavirus last year.\nSwindon health officials have sent their condolences to the family.\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Liverpool hospital blast,Liverpool",
      "text": "A couple who were yards away from a bomb that exploded outside Liverpool Women's Hospital on Sunday say they have been left in \"shock\" and \"numb\".\nLiam Spencer and Stephanie Stitt, who were in their car at the time, told the BBC they felt a \"big impact\" and first thought there had been a crash. \nEmad Al Swealmeen was killed when his homemade device exploded inside a taxi. \nMr Spencer said he tried to pull Al Swealmeen from the burning wreckage of the taxi but the flames stopped him.\nThe 21-year-old, who used to work at the hospital, had been visiting with Ms Stitt to collect some of his possessions when the explosion happened just before 11:00 GMT. \nAfter grabbing Ms Stitt, 20, and taking her to the hospital's reception, Mr Spencer returned to the burning car.\nRealising that taxi driver David Perry was safe, and not knowing what had caused the explosion, Mr Spencer went to see if there were any passengers.\nSeeing a man in the back of the cab, Mr Spencer said: \"I went to go grab him but he became engulfed in flames very quickly and I couldn't reach hold of them without setting myself on fire.\"\nHe and Ms Stitt returned to get help and a fire extinguisher but the flames went up \"so, so quickly\". \nIt was only later the couple were told what had actually happened. \nMs Stitt said: \"At the time, I just couldn't stop shaking. I think it was just the adrenaline and the whole shock of everything. \n\"I haven't stopped crying because... I thought the car had been hit and then all this stuff had gone flying over the car and I'm just thinking that things could have been different, like my life could have been lost more than anything or I could be in a worse situation than I am now.\"\nTaxi driver David Perry escaped seconds before his car fully caught light and has since been discharged from hospital.\nHis wife has said he was lucky to be alive. \nIn the days after the explosion it emerged that 32-year-old Al Swealmeen, whose claims for asylum in the UK had been turned down, began making purchases for his attack in April.\nMr Spencer and Ms Stitt said they remained in shock at what they had witnessed. \n\"As much as I'm laughing and joking with everyone, like I would normally, there's just always that feeling in the back of my head,\" Mr Spencer said.\n\"Just what if things had gone different and I'm just constantly worried about 'what if?'.\"\nMs Stitt said: \"I think I'm the same really. I think at the minute I'm an emotional wreck.\n\"There's a lot of anger in a sense at times. Why did that have to happen to me, why did I have to be in that wrong place, wrong time?\"\nMr Spencer said Al Swealmeen was a \"coward\".\n\"I just think it's a selfish and cowardly thing to do.\"\nMs Stitt added that the couple wanted to thank the doctors and nurses at the hospital for \"helping us on that day and doing whatever they could to help\".\nDetails of Al Swealmeen's immigration legal history provided to the BBC by court officials show he had a long and complicated series of applications and appeals to remain in the UK.\nIt remains unclear whether the Home Office tried to remove him after his first failed application to stay, more than six years ago, and why his final appeal was unresolved. \nAccording to court records provided by officials, Al Swealmeen was first refused asylum in 2014 and lost further appeals in 2015.\nThe records show in August 2015 he began seeking to convert to Christianity and adopted a new name, Enzo Almeni.\nThey also document that he renewed his immigration appeal under this alternative name in January this year. \nHis submissions were under review at the time of his death and the Home Office has refused to discuss the case with BBC News.\nSheikh Salem Al-Suwailmieen, one of Al Swealmeen's extended family, said in a statement the suspected bomber's mother was from Iraq and confirmed he was born there.\nAl Swealmeen had suffered from periods of mental illness, which will \"form part of the investigation\", police said.\nOn Monday, the UK terror threat level was raised to severe after the Liverpool explosion - the second terrorist incident in a month following the death of Conservative MP Sir David Amess, who was stabbed multiple times during a meeting with his constituents in Essex on 15 October.\nAssistant Commissioner Matt Jukes, the most senior counter-terrorism policing officer in the UK, has urged the public to be vigilant in the run up to Christmas.\nAdditional reporting by Phil Kemp"

      "text": "The Women's Tennis Association has said that a call between Peng Shuai and the president of the International Olympic Committee does not address its concerns over the Chinese player's wellbeing.\nAn IOC statement after the call said Peng appeared to be safe and well. \nPeng, 35, disappeared from the public eye for almost three weeks after she made sexual assault allegations against a senior Chinese minister.\nHer absence triggered widespread international concern.\nSports stars and governments called on China to provide proof that she was safe. \nThe outcry over the tennis star's apparent disappearance from the public eye prompted Chinese state media to release a series of photographs and videos that appeared to show all was well.\nOn Sunday, the IOC released a statement after IOC President Thomas Bach held a video call with three-time Olympian. \nThe IOC account said Peng had \"thanked the IOC for its concern about her wellbeing\".\n\"She explained that she is safe and well, living at her home in Beijing, but would like to have her privacy respected at this time,\" it added.\n\"She prefers to spend her time with friends and family right now,\" it said. \"Nevertheless, she will continue to be involved in tennis.\"\nThe IOC statement also included an image of the video call taking place, with Ms Peng seen smiling to the camera.\nBut the WTA said the recent videos \"don't alleviate or address the WTA's concern about her wellbeing and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion\".\n\"This video does not change our call for a full, fair and transparent investigation, without censorship, into her allegation of sexual assault, which is the issue that gave rise to our initial concern,\" it added.\nThe sporting rights organisation, Global Athlete, criticised what it called the IOC's \"nonchalant\" approach to Peng's disappearance and accused it of displaying \"an abhorrent indifference to sexual violence and the well-being of female athletes\".\n\"The release pretends that Peng never made sexual assault allegations and has not been missing for more than two weeks. The statements make the IOC complicit in the Chinese authority's malicious propaganda and lack of care for basic human rights and justice,\" it added.\nLord Sebastian Coe, President of World Athletics told BBC's Today programme that the question of where Peng is and if she is ok had been \"achieved by quiet diplomacy\" by the IOC. \n\"Nobody is suggesting that there aren't questions to be asked. Nobody is suggesting that there aren't challenges. Look we have to maintain international relationships across sport,\" he said, adding that Thomas Bach will be visiting Peng Shuai privately when he arrives in Beijing in January. \nOn Sunday, a rally was staged by a group of Chinese feminists in New York in support of Peng Shuai. \nEvent organiser Crystal Chen told the BBC that while the released videos and photos appear to show Peng \"physically unharmed\", she was \"not truly free\".\n\"She can't say whatever she wants to say in a safe condition,\" alleges Ms Chen, who has chosen not to be identified by her real name.\nParticipants of the rally also called for Peng to speak directly with the WTA and for her sexual assault allegations to be addressed. \nThe former number one-ranked tennis doubles player had in early November posted an allegation about former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli on Chinese social media site Weibo.\nShe alleged she was forced into sexual relations with him. The post that was taken down minutes later. \nIt is the first time such a claim has been made against one of China's senior political leaders and the most high profile case in China's #MeToo movement."

      "text": "A man who was killed outside Liverpool Women's Hospital on Remembrance Sunday when his homemade bomb went off has been identified as 32-year-old Emad Al Swealmeen. \nHe was an asylum seeker born in Iraq who is understood to have converted to Christianity in 2017. \nAl Swealmeen was the passenger of the taxi destroyed in the blast. The driver, David Perry, did not suffer life-threatening injuries.\nFour men were arrested under the Terrorism Act, but have since been released from police custody without charge. \nMerseyside Police were called at 10:59 GMT on 14 November to reports of a car explosion at Liverpool Women's Hospital.\nThe taxi carrying Al Swealmeen had pulled up to the hospital and exploded shortly afterwards. \nAl Swealmeen, who had been picked up from the Rutland Avenue area and asked to be taken to the hospital about 10 minutes away, died at the scene.\nOn Monday Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said the passenger appeared to have made an improvised device that caused the explosion. \nHe said officers investigating the incident could not \"at this time draw any connection\" with Remembrance Sunday events taking place near the hospital but he confirmed this was \"a line of inquiry\". \nTaxi driver David Perry has been discharged from hospital and his wife Rachel said it had been \"an utter miracle\" that he had escaped from the vehicle.\nMr Jackson said he could not confirm reports Mr Perry had locked the doors of the taxi before the explosion.\nHe said it appeared to have been an \"unremarkable journey\" to the hospital. \nAbout two hours after the blast, properties on Rutland Avenue near Sefton Park, in the south-east of the city, and in the Kensington area, east of the city centre, were raided by armed officers.\nThree arrests took place in Sutcliffe Street, in Kensington, where witnesses reported seeing armed officers approach a terraced house.\nThe second raid around Sutcliffe Street and the adjacent Boaler Street - about a mile from the hospital -  took place an hour later, at about 14:00 GMT. \nThere was a heavy police presence, including police negotiators, outside the house on Rutland Avenue overnight.\nPolice confirmed a controlled explosion had been carried out as a precaution in the Sefton Park area at about 16:00 GMT as part of the investigation but there was no wider risk to the public.\nMr Jackson said officers had made \"significant progress\" and had a \"much greater understanding of the component parts of the device, how they were obtained and how the parts are likely to have been assembled\". \nHe said following interviews with the arrested men, police were \"satisfied with the accounts they have provided\" and they were released from custody.\nThe wreckage of the taxi was removed on Wednesday and specialist officers were expected to continue searches at the hospital into Thursday, said Mr Jackson.\nA post mortem on Al Swealmeen found the cause of death to be \"injuries sustained from the fire and explosion\", he said.\nPolice have traced his next of kin who told them he was born in Iraq.\n\"Our inquiries have found that Al Swealmeen has had episodes of mental illness, this will form part of the investigation and will take some time to fully understand,\" said Mr Jackson.\nHe said they had not found any link to others in the Merseyside area but could not yet rule it out.\nNick Aldworth, a former counter terror co-ordinator, said investigators would be focused on what happened inside the vehicle.\n\"I have to say from what I've seen there is very little blast damage - a lot of fire damage but very little blast damage. So whatever was in that vehicle was either a low yield or didn't work properly or was possibly an incendiary.\"\nAl Swealmeen began making purchases for his attack in April, counter-terror police said.\nMr Jackson said the bomber had lived at a property in Sutcliffe Street for some time. And he began renting a property in Rutland Avenue in April. \nPolice recovered \"significant items\" from his latest address, where searches have been taking place since Sunday.\nAl Swealmeen is not believed to have been known to MI5, according to BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera.\nOne of the members of his tribe in Jordan told the BBC that Al Swealmeen was Jordanian, but born in Iraq. His family settled in the United Arab Emirates in 1996. \nAl Swealmeen left for Syria 12 years ago, then headed to Turkey, eventually applying for asylum by claiming he was Syrian.\nThe tribe member - who knows Al Swealmeen's father - said the attacker had a history of mental illness.\nImmigration records seen by the BBC show Al Swealmeen was first refused asylum in the UK in 2014. He challenged the decision, but in April 2015 a judge ruled the Home Office had been correct. \nIn June 2015 he launched an attempt to overturn that decision, but that application was refused in August 2015 by the Upper Tier Tribunal - the court dedicated to immigration appeals.\nAt that stage the case appears to have been closed - and by 2017 friends of Al Swealmeen in Liverpool understood his legal avenues had been exhausted. \nWhether the Home Office ordered him to leave the UK is not clear. \nDuring this period he turned to Christianity and became known locally as Enzo Almeni, a name he adopted as part of his conversion. \nCourt records show that he then renewed his immigration appeal - under this alternative name - in January this year. His submissions were under review at the time of his death. \nA Christian couple, Elizabeth and Malcolm Hitchcott told ITV News that Al Swealmeen briefly lived with them at their Liverpool home after his conversion to Christianity.\nMr Hitchcott described him as a \"very quiet fellow\" who formally converted from Islam at a ceremony in Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral.  \nAl Swealmeen is believed to have been baptised in 2015 and confirmed in 2017 - before the cathedral lost contact with him in 2018, according to the Diocese of Liverpool's communication's director, Stuart Haynes.\nThe Reverend Mike Hindley said Al Swealmeen was involved in the Emmanuel Church in the Fazakerley area of Liverpool from 2017 to 2019, when they lost touch with him.\nA spokesman for the City of Liverpool College said Al Swealmeen was an adult cake decorating student at the college during the 2018-2019 academic year.\nIn the years before the attack, Al Swealmeen was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for about six months because of his behaviour with a knife, Mr Hitchcott said.\nAl Swealmeen was described as a \"lovely guy\" by Mrs Hitchcott, who told the BBC \"we just loved him\", adding she was saddened and \"very shocked\" by Sunday's incident.\nDid you witness what happened?

      "title": "Covid-19: Venues 'may have to close doors during Christmas'",
      "text": "There is a possibility that hospitality venues may be asked to close over Christmas if Covid-19 cases continue to increase, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. \nBut he told the Northern Ireland Assembly it was not \"inevitable\".\nStormont ministers have met to discuss plans to help curb the spread of Covid-19 and will meet again on Tuesday.\nOn Thursday, Mr Swann advised anyone who worked from home when the pandemic began last year to do so again now.\nHis document also suggested introducing a \"scores on the doors\" Covid compliance rating for businesses.\nMr Swann said on Monday that \"if the current trajectory continues with regard to the increased cases we are seeing, we may once again face the possibility where venues are asked to close their doors during the Christmas season\".\n\"But let me be clear, it is not inevitable and I do not want to have to re-introduce further restrictions unless completely unavoidable,\" he added.\nMr Swann also expressed disappointment that some hospitality venues had not acted responsibly after social distancing rules were relaxed.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill tweeted that Mr Swann had presented a paper to ministers who met on Monday morning to consider it. \nShe said that while the \"meeting was constructive and progress was made, it was agreed more work was needed\".\n\"The executive will meet again in the morning to finalise the approach,\" she added.\nDecisions on whether to strengthen current mitigations must first be agreed by the executive.\nHealth officials believe the proposals could help reduce transmission of the virus.\nOn Monday, three Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland and a further 1,469 new cases. \nNorthern Ireland's infection rate has been climbing over the past week or so.\nIt is currently the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland.\nJustice Minister Naomi Long said on Monday that the executive was \"not planning for Christmas closures\".\n\"We started off in terms of looking at vaccine certification as one means of trying to ensure that we drive down transmission and as those who are in more high-risk environments are less likely to become seriously ill as a result, that's one means of keeping the doors open on businesses,\" she added.\n\"We've been considering the paper today around how we actually try to get the basics right and get people to comply with things like handwashing, wearing masks, trying to voluntarily reduce their number of close contacts, trying to ensure where people can work from home they do work from home.\n\"Our focus at the minute is not on closure but on trying to keep businesses open.\"\nMs O'Neill said on Twitter that it was \"vitally important that all executive ministers work together to get us through this difficult period\".\n\"It's time to redouble our efforts to limit the spread of the virus, protect lives and our hospital system,\" she added.\nI think this was the strongest warning from Robin Swann that unless people do change their ways, it is not inevitable, but a distinct possibility [that venues may be asked to close].\nIf we are talking about carrot and stick, I think that is potentially the stick.\nMr Swann will hope that hits home, because nobody wants that to happen.\nCertainly the people who run these establishments don't want it to happen.\nPeople would like a Christmas, but Robin Swann is saying people have got to change their ways.\nLast week, the Department of Health warned that unless cases decrease significantly in the next three weeks, then more \"severe\" restrictions could be required before Christmas. \nStormont ministers have said they do not want to have to impose tougher mitigations that could damage trade.\nThey have already agreed to put in place proof of Covid status for certain sectors, which will become enforceable from 13 December. \nThe plan means people will have to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or proof of a negative coronavirus test result to access nightclubs, pubs, cinemas, theatres and restaurants.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had voted against the proposals but Mr Swann and other Stormont ministers said the use of Covid status certification would save lives.\nDUP ministers had said they wanted to see other measures explored by health officials, which could also help reduce the number of Covid cases.\nAt present, executive advice on working from home is that people should continue to do so where they can.\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland's justice minister has raised concerns about a proposal for her department to \"take the lead\" in managing compliance around face coverings to help combat Covid-19.\nThe health paper suggested Naomi Long should oversee plans to raise compliance levels above 80%.\nShe said the proposal was \"entirely inappropriate\".\nIn Mr Swann's paper to ministers ahead of Monday's meeting, he suggested that a decision taken by the executive on 23 September encouraging employers to \"begin planning a gradual return to the workplace\" for employees should be reversed.\nThe proposal goes on to say that the message should be communicated by stating that if a person worked from home when the pandemic began in March 2020 then \"they should be working from home now\".\nOn Friday, Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride, said research had shown that working from home was \"one of the single most effective interventions\" to control the virus.\nAnother proposal raised by the minister is a \"Covid score\" for businesses based on their compliance with regulations and Covid safety measures.\nMr Swann said while this suggestion was dismissed as an option last year, he believes it should be revisited and has suggested the executive's Covid taskforce take on the development of such a scheme.\nThe document also advises ensuring enforcement against those breaching existing Covid restrictions, including people who do not comply with wearing face coverings where they are legally required.\nMr Swann said that since rules on mandatory face coverings in shops and public transport were introduced in summer 2020, only five fines had been issued to people for failing to follow the law.\nThe minister added that unless enforcement was strengthened, the public would see \"compliance as unimportant and optional\".\nMost of the proposals in the paper are aimed at improving messaging and communication of current coronavirus advice.\nMr Swann is also understood to have said in his paper that communications on public health are \"much more effective when delivered with a united voice by all executive ministers\"."
