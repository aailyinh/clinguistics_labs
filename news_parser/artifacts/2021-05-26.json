      "text": "Images of dead children and women washed up on a beach in Libya have been shared by a Spanish charity.\nThe NGO Proactiva Open Arms received some of the photos from inside Libya and said they are of people who had tried to cross the Mediterranean to Europe, a dangerous route for migrants. \nThey show the partially clothed bodies of small children and a woman, bloated and half buried in the sand. \nAt least 743 migrants are known to have died in the Mediterranean this year.\nAccording to the data published by UN's International Organization for Migration, there have been 630 recorded deaths in the central Mediterranean alone in 2021, compared with 289 deaths for the whole sea in 2020. \n\"We are in shock,\" Open Arms head of communications Laura Lanuza told the BBC. \"When people try to flee from Libya they shouldn't be taken back or left adrift in the Mediterranean. There should be a search and rescue operation... to protect lives at sea.\"\n\"The Mediterranean is the biggest graveyard in the world,\" she said. \"It shouldn't be like this.\"\nReacting to the photos, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said: \"Images of bodies of babies and toddlers washed up on a beach in Libya are unacceptable.\"\nOne of the images posted online shows a small child in a polka dot one-piece sleepsuit. Sand has partially obscured the body.\nAnother photo is of a woman in green trousers spread eagle on the sand, her top pulled up over her head.\nOscar Camps is the founder of Proactiva Open Arms. He tweeted photos of the bodies on Monday, of \"young children and women who had only dreams and ambitions to live\", saying they had been left there for three days.\nFreelance journalist Nancy Porsia - who has also posted images of the bodies online - tweeted however that a contact of hers found the bodies on Saturday and informed the authorities, who buried them the same day in Abu Qamash cemetery.\nEurope is grappling with a fresh influx of people heading to the continent across the Mediterranean. Some 13,000 people have already arrived in Italy this year, with warmer weather in the area raising fears of even more people trying to make the crossing. \nAnd in the western Mediterranean last week, some 8,000 people including children swam or waded around a border fence to get to the Spanish territory of Ceuta from Morocco. Authorities returned several thousand soon after.\nIn 2015, the image of drowned three-year-old Aylan Kurdi sparked global outrage. The Syrian child was photographed lying face down on the sand in Turkey after his family tried to reach Europe. "

      "tags": "Barnard Castle",
      "text": "Dominic Cummings' controversial trip to County Durham during lockdown was due to security threats, not just childcare reasons, the ex-No 10 aide has said.\nSpeaking to MPs, Mr Cummings said he moved his family out of London after his wife received death threats from a gang of people outside his home.\nHe said not explaining this at the time was \"a terrible, terrible mistake\". \nHe described the episode as \"a major disaster for the government\" which had \"undermined public confidence\". \nMr Cummings faced considerable criticism when it emerged he had travelled from his London home to his family's farm on the outskirts of the City of Durham, during the coronavirus lockdown in spring 2020.\nAt the time he defended his actions, explaining he left to ensure his son could be looked after when he and his wife caught Covid.\nHowever, appearing before the Health and Science committee on Wednesday, Mr Cummings said he had first moved his family out of the home for six weeks in autumn 2019 following security threats.\nHe then said that on 25 February he received a call from his wife who told him \"there was a gang outside the family home saying 'they're going to break into the house and kill everybody inside'.\"\nHe continued, saying that on 22 March a \"fake quote\" appeared in a news story \"saying I was happy for everyone to die\".\n\"After that weekend I then said to my wife...we've got to get out here by Friday - it had already been decided that I was going to move my family out of London regardless of Covid rules.\"\nWhen, in May, the story emerged that Mr Cummings had left London, he said \"the prime minister and I agreed that because of the security things, we would basically just stonewall the story and not say anything about it.\"\nHowever, he later gave a press conference in Downing Street's rose garden to defend his actions. \nRecalling the event he said: \"What I said was true but we left out a kind of crucial part of it all.\n\"The whole thing was a complete disaster and the truth is... if I just basically sent my family back out of London and said here's the truth to the public, I think people would have understood the situation.\n\"It was a terrible misjudgement not to do that - the prime minister got that wrong, I got that wrong.\"\nDuring the press conference, Mr Cummings also defended making a 30 mile journey from his family's home in County Durham to Barnard Castle, explaining he wanted to test his eyesight before returning to London.\nAsked by committee chair Jeremy Hunt if the trip was actually a birthday celebration for his wife rather than to test his eyesight, Mr Cummings replied: \"If I was going to make up a story I would come up with a better one than that.\"\n\"If you're going to drive 300 miles to go back to work, popping down the road for 30 miles and back to see how you feel... it didn't seem crazy.\"\nMr Hunt asked if it seemed \"crazy to do the trip with your wife and son\", Mr Cummings said no.\n\"I wish I'd never heard of Barnard Castle... I can only apologise for the whole debacle,\" he added."

      "tags": "Bolton,Bedford,North Tyneside Council,Leicester,Coronavirus testing,North Shields,Blackburn,Hounslow,Burnley,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Ministers have backtracked over travel advice for eight areas worst hit by the Indian virus variant, after a change in guidance led to widespread confusion.\nThe amended advice asks people to minimise travel into and out of Bolton, Blackburn, Kirklees, Bedford, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside.\nEarlier advice had asked people to avoid non-essential travel altogether.\nDowning Street has admitted it caused \"confusion\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said: \"We've updated the guidance online to make it clearer that these are not local restrictions and we do acknowledge the confusion this caused [on Tuesday].\"\nIt came as Mr Johnson's former chief adviser Dominic Cummings gave evidence to a joint Commons committee hearing on key government decisions during the pandemic.\nMany people cancelled plans at short notice after it emerged on Monday that advice specifically for the eight areas had been published the previous week without any government announcement, which included asking people to avoid non-essential travel.\nThe new advice - updated on Tuesday evening - asks people in the affected areas to meet outdoors and stay two metres apart from anyone in other households, wherever those things are possible.\nThat advice also refers people to their local authorities' Covid guidance and says anyone travelling to red or amber list countries should arrange \"a testing or managed quarantine package\".\nShadow foreign secretary and MP for Wigan Lisa Nandy said people in many areas had \"stopped listening\" to official advice and that confused messaging had undermined public trust.\n\"We woke up on Monday morning to find apparently that guidance had been in force on the government's website since Friday, telling us not to move in and out of affected areas but nobody had bothered to tell us,\" she said.\nShe said that \"to treat us as an afterthought on a government website is to treat people's lives with absolute contempt.\"\nDr Bharat Pankhania, an infectious disease expert who advises local authorities on health plans, said confusion was leading to a fall in cooperation from the public.\nHe told Radio 4's Today programme that \"when people like us in local authorities start changing the game plan or do things without really explaining our actions, they stop eventually listening to us.\"\nAmong those considering cancelling plans as a result was Julie Suttar, from Aberdeen, who  told the BBC on Tuesday that she had booked a non-refundable hotel in Leicester to visit family she had not seen for more than a year.\n\"I can't believe it, I've been on the phone to my sister, in tears. Where's this come from? Where's the notice?\" she asked.\nThe uncertainty prompted a swift denial from Downing Street that it was imposing local lockdowns by stealth.\nThat came after several of the local authorities affected by the new advice said they had not been consulted about it - and only learned of its existence from journalists.\nIt has become an accepted fact that public health messaging during the pandemic needs to be clear and concise.  \nOn that test, government communications to people in the eight identified hotspot areas in England failed in recent days.  \nPeople in most of those communities were simply unaware of tighter new guidelines posted on the government website on a Friday afternoon. \nWhen they emerged late on Monday evening there was understandable frustration with the suggestion that people should not leave their council areas unless for essential reasons. \nThen it took nearly 24 hours for officials to clarify and amend the guidelines to simply minimising travel. \nThe row will blow over but it raises bigger long-term questions. \nMinisters say they want to shift from legal restrictions to public guidance as the roadmap progresses in England - in other words not using the law to dictate behaviour but giving the public enough information to allow them to moderate their own behaviour.  \nThis sounds fine in theory but recent events in the hotspot areas reveal the potential risks of this approach.  \nFailure to provide clarity on what people can or cannot do at a time of uncertainty might potentially cause confusion and frustration - the opposite of what is intended.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, local councils for the eight areas - which together represent more than two million people - emerged from a meeting with government officials and insisted there were no restrictions on travel in their areas and \"no local lockdowns\".\nThey said they were working to increase vaccination and testing - with Kirklees the latest area to announce door-to-door testing - as well as to support people self-isolating.\nGreater Manchester's Labour mayor Andy Burnham said the confusion over the advice was a \"major communications error\" which had a \"major effect on people's lives\".\nNorma Redfearn, Labour mayor of North Tyneside, said \"after a day of confusion\" it had been confirmed the area was \"at the same stage of the road map as the rest of the country\".\nOverall cases of Covid are at their highest rate for six months in Bolton, at 452.1 cases per 100,000 people.\nThe original guidance, published on a page titled \"what you can and cannot do\", advised people in the eight areas of England to meet outside where possible and avoid travelling in and out unless essential.\nIt was first published on 14 May to cover Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen and Bedford, before being updated, without an announcement, to include the six other areas on Friday.\nEfforts to contain the virus come as people aged 30 and 31 in England are being invited to book an appointment to receive their first dose of Covid vaccine.\nThe NHS is urging these million or so to take up the offer of a jab at one of the 1,600 available locations, including mosques, museums and rugby grounds, as well as pharmacies.\nNearly three-quarters of adults in the UK have already had one dose, and more than two-fifths have had two.\nOn Tuesday, the UK reported 15 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test and 2,493 new confirmed cases. Figures for reported deaths early in the week are sometimes higher due to weekend reporting delays."

      "tags": "Patrick Harvie,Scottish Parliament election 2021,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Greens,Lorna Slater",
      "text": "First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been discussing a formal co-operation agreement with the Scottish Greens. \nShe told MSPs that the SNP and the Greens were exploring different policy areas where they could work together. \nInformal talks had begun after the election, she said, and these would now become structured talks with a view to agreeing a formal arrangement. \nAlthough a full coalition deal is not likely, Ms Sturgeon said ministerial jobs for Green MSPs was a possibility.\n\"Exactly what the content, extent and scope of any agreement will be is what the talks will focus on,\" she added.\nThe SNP won 64 seats in the Holyrood election - one short of a majority - and Ms Sturgeon would have a stable majority if she could also rely on the seven Scottish Green MSPs. \nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the parliament had to choose between spending the next term focused on delivering on voters' priorities or being \"distracted about independence\". \nAnd Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the Scottish government had to be more \"bold and ambitious\" in its plans for recovering from the pandemic, and that his party would work to be a \"credible alternative\" for voters. \nMs Sturgeon said she has had \"a series of exploratory discussions\" with the pro-independence Greens since the election,  and that these informal discussions would now become \"structured talks\", supported by the civil service, with a view to reaching a formal cooperation agreement. \nThe talks are expected to conclude before the next parliamentary recess, which is in a month's time. \nThe first minister said the two parties would discuss specific policy areas where they could cooperate, including the climate emergency and how Scotland could accelerate its progress towards net zero. \nShe added: \"As we embark on this process, we are setting no limits on our ambition.\n\"So in that vein let me be clear that while this is not a guaranteed or pre-agreed outcome, it is not inconceivable that a cooperation agreement could lead in future to a Green minister or ministers being part of this government.\n\"The key point for today is that we are both agreeing to come out of our comfort zones to find new ways of working for the common good\".\nScottish Greens' co-leader Patrick Harvie said that Green parties across Europe and in countries such as New Zealand had \"rolled up their sleeves and worked with other parties to deliver a better future\".\nThis showed that \"there is more than one way for government and opposition parties to work together, without losing the ability to challenge one another,\" he said. \nMr Harvie added: \"We believe the people of Scotland want to see grown-up politics like this, and will approach the forthcoming talks in this spirit.\" \nDouglas Ross said there were some areas where parties across the chamber could agree and work constructively. \nBut he added: \"Ultimately, as always, this comes down to independence for the SNP\". \nThe Scottish Conservative leader added that the parliament had to choose between \"wasting\" another five years on independence or using its existing powers to \"get things done\".\nAnd Mr Sarwar, Scottish Labour's leader, said he was willing to work with anyone in the national interest or on the issues they agreed on.  \nBut, Mr Sarwar said, a \"bold and ambitious opposition and a credible alternative\" was needed, and called for the Scottish government to be more \"bold and ambitious\" in its plans for recovering from the pandemic. \nThis is not a done deal yet but both sides clearly think a formal cooperation agreement is possible. \nWeeks of hard bargaining lie ahead as the two sides prepare to enter formal talks. \nThe SNP will want to maximise the range of areas where they are guaranteed Green support in parliament. \nIn exchange, the Greens will want to push Nicola Sturgeon to go further and faster in key policy areas like tackling climate change. \nWith 64 SNP votes and seven from the Greens a cooperation agreement between the two parties would give the Scottish government a very comfortable majority. \nThat would protect them from ambush in confidence votes, at budget time and when passing other key pieces of legislation. \nIt would also underline the majority that exists at Holyrood for another independence referendum. \nBut if they stop short of a full coalition, there would be areas where the Greens could still vote against the government it otherwise supports. \nThe talks emerged shortly before Ms Sturgeon set out her government's plans for its first 100 days in office.\nShe told MSPs that recovering from the Covid pandemic would be the immediate priority. \nOver the next three weeks, the first minister said, the government would set out its expectations for how the Covid restrictions levels system would be wound down after the pandemic, allowing a return to \"a much greater degree of normality\". \nTackling climate change was another priority, she said, and the first minister also outlined policies to tackle child poverty and inequality. \nAnd she said legislation to create a national care service will be introduced in the next 12 months, with a view to having the service operational by the end of this parliament.\n\"This will be, in my view, the most important public sector innovation since the establishment of the National Health Service,\" she said. \nMs Sturgeon also repeated her pledge to hold an independence referendum once the pandemic is over. \nShe said the election result had delivered a \"substantial majority\" in parliament for an independence referendum within the current parliamentary term, adding that there could be no justification for the UK government seeking to block that mandate.

      "text": "A woman who was \"pawned off like cattle\" into a forced marriage by her dad said it was \"absolutely horrific\".\nSara (not her real name) was 19 when she went with her family to Pakistan for her elder sister's wedding but once there, learnt she was getting wed too.\nOne charity has warned there could be a spike in cases as international travel restrictions ease and the UK Border Force should be \"on alert\".\nUK Border Force said it trains officers in protecting vulnerable people.\nSara, from south Wales, said that years later she was still affected by what happened.\nShe told Wales Live: \"I wanted a life, a career and everything else, and I'm being told I'm getting married to somebody I don't even know. \n\"I felt upset, angry. I was just being pawned off to somebody, like I was basically cattle.\n\"It was a big punch in the guts, a very big punch.\n\"You're angry because you're in that situation, but then you're also fearful because you don't know this person, you don't know what they're going to do to you or how they're going to be with you. \n\"And then, obviously, it's the emotional side of the relationship and the physical side too.\n\"Because if you don't know this person and they want to be laying down with you, if you like, your resistance to that only results in physical violence, and rape of course.\n\"It was absolutely horrific. At the time I was 19, so I was a virgin, and to have your virginity taken away by rape stays with you basically forever.\"\nSara was in Pakistan for a year and said she was \"physically and mentally tortured\". She was only able to come back to Wales when her visa ran out.\nShe moved back in with her family and one day, she heard a car outside.\n\"I was getting ready for work and I looked out of the window. My dad got out and then my husband got out the other side,\" she added. \n\"They had gone to the airport to get him, but I'd had no idea he was coming here.\"\nSara's father tried to make her continue in the marriage.\n\"I went to my father and I told him what was going on, and his reply back to my plea for help was 'get on with it, this is what happens, get on with it'.\n\"The way I see it was I was thrown to the wolves, because obviously when it was just me and him, he was able to do what he wanted to.\n\"I've been held by my ankles over a well, I've looked down the barrel of a gun and I've had a gun pointed to my head and someone flicking the trigger, like they're playing Russian roulette. \n\"And having to go through experiences like that, knowing that those experiences have only happened to you because of your family - not my family as a whole, a few of the members of my family - it changes you.\"\nSara managed to escape with the help of a friend and went to a refuge run by the charity Bawso, which offers support and refuge to victims of forced marriage.\nBawso said \"escape routes\" have been shut down during the pandemic.\nFrom March 2020 to January 2021, Bawso supported 49 victims of honour-based violence and forced marriage compared with 151 victims in the year to March 2020.\nAccording to UK government figures, the number of forced marriage protection orders issued in Wales has plummeted since the start of the pandemic, going from 60 in 2019 to fewer than five in 2020.\nThese orders allow young people to apply to the courts for protection by, for example, stopping their family taking them out of the UK, while keeping them out of the criminal system.\nNancy Lidubwi from the charity said she expected a spike in cases when international travel restrictions eased and the UK Border Force should be \"on alert\".\n\"We all just have to be on the lookout. We all have to work collaboratively - schools, social services, police, UK Border Agency has got to be looking at young people going out of the country and ask those key questions,\" she added.\n\"Don't shy away from asking if they see there is a young person and they look like they are under duress and they are travelling with a family out of this country.\"\nA Home Office spokeswoman said: \"No-one should be forced to marry and our Border Force officers are always on high alert to ensure they can safeguard victims from so-called honour-based abuse.\n\"All Border Force officers receive mandatory training in protecting vulnerable people, which includes learning how to identify potential victims of forced marriage. We also have a cadre of specialist safeguarding officers operating at the border who are on hand to assist potential victims.\""

      "tags": "Poverty,Personal finance",
      "text": "More than a million households are struggling to pay their water bills, a consumer group has said.\nSome people have even had to skip meals to pay for water, the Consumer Council for Water (CCW) said.\nIt is calling for a single \"social tariff\", based on a percentage of people's incomes to lower the costs. \nThe government said it would work with industry to \"build a stronger, better and fairer water service for those who need it most\".\nAccording to the CCW, there are about 1.7 million people in \"water poverty\", which it defines as having to spend more than 5% of their income after housing costs on water bills.\nHowever, about three million households are in danger of slipping into this category.\nThese include people on Universal Credit, where any small shocks to their income could tip them over the edge, said Andy White, senior policy manager at CCW.\nHe said about 260,000 people were getting help with their bills from a patchwork of social schemes run by water companies. \nHowever, it is a \"postcode lottery\" as to how much help people can get - and the watchdog believes a social tariff would tackle this.\nThere has been significant focus in recent years on fuel poverty, and pressure placed on private companies to make sure the most vulnerable are protected. This research shifts that spotlight onto the affordability of another essential utility - water. \nWhether you are part of the 1.5 million households classed as currently in water poverty or the 3 million who are on the cusp of it, where you live can make a huge difference to the help you receive.\nSome companies ask struggling households to pay just 20% of a bill, while in other areas they still face the full charge. Some have a lowest bill guarantee, but many companies don't, and only half of the providers have a crisis fund for those most in need. \nAlthough most of these changes could be implemented immediately by companies themselves, the government would have to bring in new laws to create a social tariff which standardised that basic payment rate.\nCCW chief executive Emma Clancy said: \"We have a golden opportunity to create a simpler and fairer system and end the indignity of people skipping meals or other essentials to pay their water bill.\n\"Many people are craving certainty in these difficult times and these proposed changes would give millions of households one less thing to worry about and greater peace of mind - whatever the future holds.\"\nThe tariff would either be taxpayer funded, or taken from a single pot created by taking money from everyone's water bill in England and Wales.\nCCW has conducted independent reviews of water affordability in England and Wales. It found that five out of six customers who cannot afford their water bills are not getting the help they need, despite a significant rise in company support schemes over the past decade.\nIt also found that some of the schemes were hampered by insufficient funding and large regional variations in eligibility criteria.\nThose who are eligible get an average bill reduction of \u00a3190.\nCCW also urged the industry to do more to prevent households slipping into water poverty.\nThat could include giving customers greater choice over how they pay their water bills through technology, and providing tailored financial help.\nCompanies should also write off water charges while benefits claimants are awaiting their first Universal Credit payment, it added. \nEnvironment minister Rebecca Pow said she would consider the recommendations and work with the sector \"to build a stronger, better and fairer water service\".\nChristine McGourty, chief executive of Water UK, which represents water companies, said: \"Levels of support for customers have never been greater. \n\"Over the past year water companies have gone to unprecedented lengths to help hundreds of thousands of household customers who could least afford their bills, with support such as payment breaks and extra assistance for those most in need - but we know there's more to be done.\"\nGillian Cooper from Citizens Advice said: \"Water is essential, but sadly we know not everyone can easily afford it.\n\"As households continue to feel the impact of the pandemic, people facing financial difficulties need better support to help them pay their bills.\n\"CCW's proposal to establish a single social tariff would help make water bills affordable for all households on low incomes.\""

However the pair have now been unable to find anywhere to move on to.\n\"The properties that we've been to see, they're going for \u00a320,000 to \u00a330,000 over the asking price,\" Ms Davies told BBC Wales Live.\n\"There's so much competition out there at the moment and Aberdare is just mad, it's just gone mad.\n\"We've seen a house today that's gone live 15 minutes ago, we were told 'we've got no bookings left'.\n\"We've gone through agents, we've gone through social media, we've gone through the selling pages for houses, Rightmove etc.\n\"I'm at the point now where I think, do we do flyers in the estates that we want to live on? That's the point we're at. There's nothing around. It really does take over your life.\"\nRhiannon Williams, 30, said she had given up trying to buy her first home near Caerphilly after struggling for months with high asking prices.\n\"The first house viewing looked amazing on the photos, but when I viewed I wasn't sold by the property. The estate agent said someone had put an offer in on the house and hadn't viewed it,\" she said.\n\"I thought that was absolutely insane as the asking price was already the top end for that area.\n\"I had two viewings booked for this week, both have been cancelled as they have now been sold. \n\"It's a huge step to purchase your first home, I think the prices are so high at the moment and people are offering over the asking price too, so I don't stand a chance to get on the ladder.\"\nMel John, an estate agent in Caerphilly, said she had been hearing more stories of practices like \"gazumping\" - where a seller goes back on a verbal agreement and accepts a higher offer.\n\"I've walked away from a number of properties where the sellers would have encouraged gazumping, as an estate agent I wouldn't want to be any part of that,\" she said. \"I don't think it's ethical really for anybody to go down that route.\"\nMs John said the property market boom was great news for many, but she had sympathy for buyers who were frequently missing out.\n\"There's a lot of buyers out there,\" she said. \n\"When a property comes on the market we'll do a block booking of viewings on that property and whoever makes an offer, we'd be looking for their best and final offer. \n\"Of course it's not nice telling people that they can't buy the properties, that the seller has decided to go with someone else.\n\"It is really difficult and especially with young first-time buyers who can only afford a certain amount - which is more or less in the investors price range. \n\"They're desperate to get on the property ladder and they've got so much competition.\"\nIn north and west Wales the current housing market boom has re-energised debates around second homes.\nHowever James Skudder, the director of Country Living Estate Agents in Pembrokeshire, said the landscape among his clients had significantly shifted from second-home buyers, with many now moving over the border to make Wales their permanent home. \n\"Since Covid has hit, the market hasn't stopped,\" said Mr Skudder.\n\"I would say on a daily basis 95% of the enquires are from people outside of the area.\n\"Pembrokeshire has always had a pull with second-home buyers, whereas now people are relocating for their primary residence.\n\"What we're finding is if you've holidayed in an area for 20 or 30 years and now you're finding you can work from home - people are saying to each other 'look let's make the dream move we've always wanted to'.\n\"People are relocating themselves and they're relocating their businesses.\n\"They're now moving their businesses online because it's an easier way to live and it can bring happiness to the business and the family. \n\"People have just had an awakening to what's going on surrounding Covid and certainly this is what's helping push the pricing in the area, people being unhappy over working long hours and being stuck in the city. An area like this is being pushed through the roof.\"\nHe added: \"It's a crazy market, right the way from low end, right up to the premium market.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nIn an explosive, and lengthy, appearance before MPs, Dominic Cummings, the former chief aide to the prime minister, made a series of claims about the government's handling of the pandemic - including that his ex-boss was \"unfit for the job\". He claimed that thousands of people had died needlessly due to mistakes, Health Secretary Matt Hancock should have been sacked for lying multiple times, and that Boris Johnson had wanted Chris Whitty to inject him with the virus on TV.  Mr Cummings also discussed the reasons behind his \"infamous trip\" to County Durham during the first lockdown - and said it was \"complete nonsense\" to say that a protective shield had been placed around care homes during the first lockdown.\nIsland destinations, such as the Canary Islands and Majorca, could be placed on the UK's green list for holidaymakers, the transport secretary has said. Grant Shapps said the move could happen when there is a review of the current measures on 7 June. Arrivals to the UK from green list countries are still required to take a test before departure - and on day two of their return - but don't need to isolate.\nTravellers from the UK to France will have to undergo a period of quarantine amid concerns about rising cases of the Indian variant, the French government has said. It follows a similar move by Germany, which imposed a two-week quarantine on almost all UK arrivals last week - although the length of the \"compulsory isolation\" in France has not been confirmed.\nLast Monday, as lockdown restrictions eased, choir director Lucy McLean held her first real-life practice since October 2020. But the joy was short-lived, as the government updated their guidelines a day later, without warning, to say that amateur choirs in England could only gather in groups of six people indoors and 30 outdoors. Ms McLean described it as \"devastating\", and a petition calling on the government to change its guidance has already received 30,000 signatures. You can read more about the situation here.\nMore than 30 West End performers of South Asian and Middle Eastern heritage have recorded a song in aid of Covid relief efforts in India. They performed It Means Beautiful from the show Everybody's Talking About Jamie as part of the Same Voices Unite project, which aims to raise awareness about the devastation caused by India's second coronavirus wave. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThere have been a further nine coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, according to the daily figures released by the government, as well as a further 3,180 infections. You can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nAnd if you have been plagued by strange pandemic dreams, here is a guide on what they could mean, and how they could be caused.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Spice,Drug legalisation,Drug use,Drugs trade",
      "text": "Psychoactive drugs such as Spice are easier than ever to buy, despite a ban which came into force five years ago, drugs charities have warned.\nThey said trade had gone to the dark web, making them \"more available\" and \"more dangerous\" for problem users.\nSince it became illegal to make, sell or supply such drugs, just 28 people have been convicted in Wales.\nThe Home Office said the new law had \"eliminated\" the open sale of drugs in shops and on UK-based websites.\nThe offence carries a maximum sentence of seven years in prison.\nThe drugs are known as new psychoactive substances (NPS), but used to be called \"legal highs\".\nData obtained from Welsh police forces by BBC Wales under the Freedom of Information Act showed 124 arrests were made in the past five years, leading to 86 charges and 28 convictions. \nFormer North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Arfon Jones said psychoactive substances were \"under the radar\", with enforcement more concentrated on heroin and cocaine. \nMr Jones, who is also a campaigner on drugs, believes the legislation is counter-productive and the UK should look to decriminalisation.\n\"Psychoactive substances is very much a problem in two countries, the UK and Turkey,\" he said. \n\"Look at the Netherlands, where they decriminalised cannabis many years ago, would Spice and mamba be a problem in the UK if we decriminalised cannabis 30 years ago? I think not.\"\nDrugs charity Kaleidoscope said the legislation had \"failed in its first objective to reduce harm\" because the number of users in Wales had not gone down.\nChief executive Martin Blakebrough said it had made the job of drug agencies more difficult as - before the ban - new psychoactive drugs were being sold openly in head shops.\nHe said if a \"bad batch\" of drugs was causing overdoses or deaths, sellers could be warned to take them off the market. \nThe legislation has \"driven this market underground, but also made it incredibly accessible\", he added.\nHe said hundreds of anonymous websites, mainly linked to large manufacturers in China, were selling directly into the UK market so, with the \"click of a button, the postman will deliver these drugs to you within 24 hours, causing people who have problems with drugs more significant issues\".\nMr Blakebrough called the legislation \"purely a publicity stunt to show the UK government was doing something\".\nNicky Lane, 40, from Newport, struggled with an addiction to Spice for three years and ended up living on the streets before being sent prison. \nHe said even after it was made illegal it was \"easy to get a hold of and quite cheap\" but as his addiction worsened he was spending up to \u00a340 a day. \nNicky said Spice was being smuggled into prison, with a liquid form being sprayed onto personal letters to prisoners. \n\"I was having money sent to people that were selling it on the wing so as soon as the money landed your Spice landed,\" he said. \"So it's as easy as that if you've got the money.\"\nNicky said Spice leaves people \"totally out of it\" so some homeless use it to numb themselves from the pain and boredom of life on the streets. \nHe said Spice \"ripped away everything\" from his life and he warned people to \"leave it alone\".\nHe added: \"I believe they made the right decision in banning it because it's one of the worst drugs out there, but for people addicted it's hard.\"\nMr Blakebrough added: \"But let's be honest, when we saw the scenes of Spice being used in Wrexham, for example, you know where people were zombies - I mean that terrified local communities, much more than if you're selling it from a head shop. \n\"America is now legalising cannabis and, across Europe, it's a similar picture. \n\"Britain is standing on its own by still saying the best way of controlling drugs is by hitting people with legal sanctions when the evidence doesn't show that is effective and we've got the highest drug-related deaths in Europe.\n\"I don't want to see a free-for-all of drugs in our streets, but what we need to do is regulate it.\"\nFigures from the Office for National Statistics indicated there were seven deaths in Wales involving an NSP in 2019, nearly as high as the eight deaths in 2015, a year before they were banned. \nNPS deaths made up just over 3% of the 240 drug-related deaths in Wales in 2019, below the number caused by opiates (121), cocaine (30), benzodiazepine (22), amphetamine (12) and Ecstasy/MDMA (8).\nThe drug analysis laboratory in Cardiff, Wedinos, said most NPS deaths were now linked to Spice.\nPublic Health Wales' head of substance misuse, Josie Smith, said making psychoactive substances illegal had deterred some users.\nShe said substance missuse also needed to be treated as a \"health issue\" with problem users quickly identified and given help.\n\"We are now in a global borderless environment in terms of the manufacturing and transport of drugs, and psychoactive drugs, particularly,\" she said. \n\"We need to address the challenges to that in a much more holistic way.\" \nThe Home Office said the UK government was committed to preventing drug use in communities, including tackling the supply of illegal drugs.\nA spokesman added: \"Since the Psychoactive Substances Act has come into force, hundreds of suppliers have been arrested and convicted, retailers have either stopped selling psychoactive substances or closed down and action by the National Crime Agency has resulted in the removal of psychoactive substances being sold by UK-based websites.\""

      "tags": "Social media,Instagram,Facebook,Mental health",
      "text": "Instagram is offering its users the option to hide the number of likes they receive on posts on the app.\nThe aim is to \u201cdepressurize people\u2019s experience\u201d on the platform, the social media giant said.\nUsers with the feature enabled will now see the username of a follower who has liked the post, \u201cand others\u201d, instead of a number.\nThe tool has been tested in several countries since 2019, but it is now being rolled out globally.\n\u201cThis has taken longer than I had hoped, but I am pretty excited about\u2026 giving people more control over the experience,\u201d Instagram's boss Adam Mosseri told the BBC.\nIn its testing and research, Instagram said that removing likes had little impact on behaviour or wellbeing - after concerns that using the platform could be linked to insecurity and poor mental health.\nA recent Oxford Internet Institute study also found there was \u201clittle association\u201d between social media use and mental health in teenagers. \nDespite this, Mr Mosseri said Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - introduced the feature to make \u201cpeople feel good about the time they spend\u201d on the platform.\n\u201cI do think there\u2019s more to do in this space,\u201d he added. \u201cThe more we can give people the ability to shape Instagram and Facebook into what's good for them, the better.\u201d\nThe feature can be switched on or off at any time. To change it:\nEven if a user has Like Counts enabled, they will not be able to see the number of likes on accounts or posts that have hidden them.\nUsers will also have the option hide counts on a specific post, before and after it goes live on the platform.\n\u201cThe spirit of this is to give people a choice,\u201d Mr Mosseri added, using the example of going through a break-up in a relationship or switching schools.\n\u201cMaybe you want to be a little bit less worried about how many likes everyone's getting for a couple weeks or a couple of months, and then maybe you want to switch back.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a one-way door, people tend to get hesitant about using the control.\u201d\nInstagram\u2019s algorithm will still take the number of likes into account when promoting posts on the platform, but it also takes into consideration other factors, such as what the user follows or engages with.\nMr Mosseri said there had been a \"polarised\" reaction from creators - accounts which make money through brand partnerships and advertising on the platform - but that the new feature didn\u2019t affect revenues.\nEarlier this year, concerns were raised over leaked plans to design a version of Instagram for children.\nPlans to create an Instagram for under-13s were not \"fully fledged\", Mr Mosseri said, explaining that it was difficult to verify ages, as children often didn't have IDs.\n\"It has to be more responsible to give parents oversight and transparency than to have kids continue to lie about their age.\"\nHe said the app would \"take some time\" to create."

      "tags": "Bolton,Bedford,North Tyneside Council,Leicester,Coronavirus testing,North Shields,Blackburn,Hounslow,Burnley,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Ministers have backtracked over travel advice for eight areas worst hit by the Indian virus variant, after a change in guidance led to widespread confusion.\nThe amended advice asks people to minimise travel into and out of Bolton, Blackburn, Kirklees, Bedford, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside.\nEarlier advice had asked people to avoid non-essential travel altogether.\nDowning Street has admitted it caused \"confusion\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said: \"We've updated the guidance online to make it clearer that these are not local restrictions and we do acknowledge the confusion this caused [on Tuesday].\"\nIt came as Mr Johnson's former chief adviser Dominic Cummings gave evidence to a joint Commons committee hearing on key government decisions during the pandemic.\nMany people cancelled plans at short notice after it emerged on Monday that advice specifically for the eight areas had been published the previous week without any government announcement, which included asking people to avoid non-essential travel.\nThe new advice - updated on Tuesday evening - asks people in the affected areas to meet outdoors and stay two metres apart from anyone in other households, wherever those things are possible.\nThat advice also refers people to their local authorities' Covid guidance and says anyone travelling to red or amber list countries should arrange \"a testing or managed quarantine package\".\nShadow foreign secretary and MP for Wigan Lisa Nandy said people in many areas had \"stopped listening\" to official advice and that confused messaging had undermined public trust.\n\"We woke up on Monday morning to find apparently that guidance had been in force on the government's website since Friday, telling us not to move in and out of affected areas but nobody had bothered to tell us,\" she said.\nShe said that \"to treat us as an afterthought on a government website is to treat people's lives with absolute contempt.\"\nDr Bharat Pankhania, an infectious disease expert who advises local authorities on health plans, said confusion was leading to a fall in cooperation from the public.\nHe told Radio 4's Today programme that \"when people like us in local authorities start changing the game plan or do things without really explaining our actions, they stop eventually listening to us.\"\nAmong those considering cancelling plans as a result was Julie Suttar, from Aberdeen, who  told the BBC on Tuesday that she had booked a non-refundable hotel in Leicester to visit family she had not seen for more than a year.\n\"I can't believe it, I've been on the phone to my sister, in tears. Where's this come from? Where's the notice?\" she asked.\nThe uncertainty prompted a swift denial from Downing Street that it was imposing local lockdowns by stealth.\nThat came after several of the local authorities affected by the new advice said they had not been consulted about it - and only learned of its existence from journalists.\nIt has become an accepted fact that public health messaging during the pandemic needs to be clear and concise.  \nOn that test, government communications to people in the eight identified hotspot areas in England failed in recent days.  \nPeople in most of those communities were simply unaware of tighter new guidelines posted on the government website on a Friday afternoon. \nWhen they emerged late on Monday evening there was understandable frustration with the suggestion that people should not leave their council areas unless for essential reasons. \nThen it took nearly 24 hours for officials to clarify and amend the guidelines to simply minimising travel. \nThe row will blow over but it raises bigger long-term questions. \nMinisters say they want to shift from legal restrictions to public guidance as the roadmap progresses in England - in other words not using the law to dictate behaviour but giving the public enough information to allow them to moderate their own behaviour.  \nThis sounds fine in theory but recent events in the hotspot areas reveal the potential risks of this approach.  \nFailure to provide clarity on what people can or cannot do at a time of uncertainty might potentially cause confusion and frustration - the opposite of what is intended.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, local councils for the eight areas - which together represent more than two million people - emerged from a meeting with government officials and insisted there were no restrictions on travel in their areas and \"no local lockdowns\".\nThey said they were working to increase vaccination and testing - with Kirklees the latest area to announce door-to-door testing - as well as to support people self-isolating.\nGreater Manchester's Labour mayor Andy Burnham said the confusion over the advice was a \"major communications error\" which had a \"major effect on people's lives\".\nNorma Redfearn, Labour mayor of North Tyneside, said \"after a day of confusion\" it had been confirmed the area was \"at the same stage of the road map as the rest of the country\".\nOverall cases of Covid are at their highest rate for six months in Bolton, at 452.1 cases per 100,000 people.\nThe original guidance, published on a page titled \"what you can and cannot do\", advised people in the eight areas of England to meet outside where possible and avoid travelling in and out unless essential.\nIt was first published on 14 May to cover Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen and Bedford, before being updated, without an announcement, to include the six other areas on Friday.\nEfforts to contain the virus come as people aged 30 and 31 in England are being invited to book an appointment to receive their first dose of Covid vaccine.\nThe NHS is urging these million or so to take up the offer of a jab at one of the 1,600 available locations, including mosques, museums and rugby grounds, as well as pharmacies.\nNearly three-quarters of adults in the UK have already had one dose, and more than two-fifths have had two.\nOn Tuesday, the UK reported 15 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test and 2,493 new confirmed cases. Figures for reported deaths early in the week are sometimes higher due to weekend reporting delays."

      "text": "Surge testing for Covid will begin in parts of Kirklees on Wednesday, amid criticism of \"chaotic and confusing\" government travel guidance.\nThe advice for areas hardest hit by the Indian variant was published online on Friday without an announcement, with local leaders not formally notified. \nWest Yorkshire mayor Tracy Brabin called the decision to update the guidance without fanfare as \"shocking\". \nThe government said it intended to take a national approach to lifting rules. \nSpeaking in Dewsbury, Ms Brabin said: \"The community of Kirklees has absolutely suffered [over] this last year. We've been in some version of restrictions for over a year.\n\"Businesses have gone bust, people have lost loved ones, they've not been able to see the people they care about - and now a Friday teatime announcement that can change people's lives.\n\"It just feels so disrespectful.\"\nDoor-to-door testing is going to take place in Savile Town and Thornhill Lees, with people aged over 11 being invited to take PCR tests, Kirklees Council said.\nAll adults in those areas are being offered the chance to be vaccinated if they have not already received a first dose, it added.\nJonathan Hughes, 58, lives in Gomersal and planned to go to Edinburgh on 1 June to visit his son, but said the trip is now \"unlikely\" after the latest advice.\nMr Hughes, who has terminal cancer, said: \"There is a large point of me that would like to go 'to hell with what the rules are' but I've spent my life caring what the rules are so it's difficult for me to go all cavalier about it and not care about it now. \n\"A year ago, my oncologist advised that I plan for 'quality of life - not quantity'. The government's lack of clarity means that I'm increasingly unlikely to see much of either.\"\nJo Richmond, general manager of the Old Bridge Inn in Holmfirth, said: \"I don't think this has been communicated very well at all - I only found out about it because it came up on the news on my phone this morning.\n\"We've just had a brilliant opening week and it's a major worry that bookings could now be affected with people travelling into the area to stay at the hotel.\"\nShe said it seemed unfair that Holmfirth, which had a small number of Covid cases, was treated the same as larger towns like Dewsbury and Huddersfield because they were all within the Kirklees district.\nRakiya Maqsoon, 45, who commutes with her husband from Bradford to Dewsbury to run a market stall, said: \"If we're not meant to be commuting in and out, we've not been made aware of it.\n\"If it's not in law, what does it actually mean - how does it affect us? We'll still wear masks, keep hands clean and keep a social distance, but we'll still be commuting in. \n\"You've got to continue at some point to live a normal life,\" she added.\nMuhammad Muhammad, from Dewsbury, 55, said: \"Not everyone knows how to use the government website, a lot of my friends don't because we're old-school, we still use old mobile phones. \n\"It is concerning, everyone's getting ready for a grand reopening but I don't think there's going to be normality, is there, how things are going.\"\nAnalysis by Rob England, BBC England Data Unit\nCases in Kirklees have increased by 45% in the last seven days, compared with the previous week.\nIn the most recent data, the area had the fourth highest rate of infection in England, standing at just below 100 weekly cases per 100,000.\nThis isn't as extreme as some other parts of the country, such as Bolton, but the number of new cases being recorded do not show signs of slowing.\nThe majority of these cases seem to be in the younger age groups and to the north, such as Dewsbury Savile Town and Thornhill Lees, but not exclusively and there are hotspots appearing in the south in places like Honley and Brockholes.\nThought by the government to be one of the areas where the variant B.1.617.2 is \"spreading fastest\", according to the most recent data released, three of the 12 cases examined in Kirklees were identified as being from this variant, first identified in India.\nHowever, this only covers up to the 15 May, so it is possible more cases have been identified since.\nAdvice against travelling to Bolton in Greater Manchester and nearby Blackburn with Darwen, other than for essential reasons, and for people there to meet outside where possible, was issued on 14 May.\nIt was updated to include six more areas - Kirklees, Bedford, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside - on Friday. \nThe prime minister's official spokesman said the government wanted to encourage the public \"to exercise their good judgement\", rather than issuing \"top-down edicts\".\nKirklees Council leader Mr Pandor said he hoped it had been \"an error\" as the district's hospital rates and death rates were low.\n\"We are doing whatever we can to respond to the pandemic but the responsibility overall is the government's, he said.\n\"We will step up and do our part but we can't do it when there's no trust or no confidence in how they communicate with us. It's not on.\"\nWork and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said she was \"surprised\" to hear local leaders declare they had not been told about the fresh guidance.\n\"We have been working in close contact, so I'm surprised to hear people think this has come out of the blue - it hasn't,\" she told Sky News.\n\"It is about formalising on the record the guidance we believe people can and should follow in order to make sure we tackle and don't have more spread of the Indian variant.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "A former colleague of opposition journalist Roman Protasevich, who was arrested in Belarus after being taken off a diverted flight on Sunday, says dissidents now fear for their lives.\nStepan Putilo told the BBC that he had received death threats in the past, but now he was \"taking them seriously\".\nMr Putilo founded the opposition social media channel Nexta on Telegram, where Mr Protasevich had acted as editor.\nMr Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega are both in custody in Belarus.\nThe journalist, 26, has said he fears the death penalty after being placed on a terrorism list.\nMr Protasevich and Ms Sapega, a 23-year-old Russian national, were detained after Belarus scrambled a military jet to escort their plane - flying from Athens to Vilnius, in neighbouring Lithuania - to Minsk, the Belarusian capital.\nWestern countries accuse Belarus of hijacking the Ryanair plane that was rerouted over a supposed bomb threat. \nAddressing MPs on Wednesday, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko defended the decision to divert the flight. \n\"We need to take appropriate measures to protect our country,\" he said, adding that he had acted within the law. \nDuring his speech, Mr Lukashenko did not mention the arrest of Mr Protasevich. \nThe journalist's lawyer, Inessa Olenskaya, told the BBC she has not been allowed to speak with him yet.\n\"At the moment I haven't been shown a single document or told anything. I didn't even get past the reception desk...  I've spent the last two days on chairs in the entrance,\" she said.\nNexta, a channel on the messaging app Telegram that has more than a million subscribers, was used for mobilising street protests last year.\nMr Putilo told the BBC that the Belarus government under Mr Lukashenko \"fears us because we show the truth\".\n\"We show what they want to conceal,\" he said. \"If the regime cares enough to bring down Roman's plane, then we are doing something right, and we will carry on fighting.\"\n\"Roman is more in danger than other political prisoners in Belarus,\" he said, speaking from the Polish capital, Warsaw, adding: \"He is Lukashenko's personal enemy.\"\nThe BBC's Jean Mackenzie reports from the Nexta headquarters in Poland\nHundreds of miles from Minsk, half a dozen young activists, all in exile, are working to keep Nexta's social media platforms running. \nTwo police officers guard the entrance to their dilapidated office. Roman Protasevich's old desk is empty. Although he left in November, it now serves as a reminder of the risk they are all taking. \nMost of the employees do not want their identities to be known. They have parents back home in Belarus, who they need to protect. But they feel this is their duty, to keep fighting for the country's democracy.  \nNexta's founder Stepan Putilo is younger than his former colleague, having fled Belarus when he was only 20. He checks his phone constantly, hoping for news of his friend, but there is none. He knows he is just as much of a target as Roman Protasevich - if not more. They had felt relatively protected here in exile, but that has changed. Now, not even the streets of Warsaw feel safe. \nMr Putilo's comments come after the families of Mr Protasevich and Ms Sapega - who have both been filmed giving statements in detention - spoke of their concern for the pair's safety. \n\"I'm calling on the whole international community to save him,\" Mr Protasevich's mother, Natalia, said.\nIn Ms Sapega's video statement, she says she edits a Telegram channel that publishes personal information of Belarusian policemen. However, it is likely she is speaking under duress.\n\"Today Sofia was interrogated. She was accused of committing a criminal offence. A preventive measure was chosen - detention for a period of two months,\" her lawyer, Alexander Filanovich, told the BBC's Russian service on Tuesday.\nMs Sapega is now in a pre-trial detention centre in Minsk, he said.\nMs Sapega's mother cast doubt on how freely her daughter was speaking in the video, released by a pro-government Telegram channel.\n\"She sways, eyes in the sky - as if afraid of forgetting something,\" she told the BBC. \n\"I enlarged [the video] as much as possible - it seems that [she looks] okay. We are now packing warm clothes, we will go to Minsk. I want to try to give her a parcel - I saw she only had a thin jacket.\" \nOn Monday, Belarusian authorities released video of Mr Protasevich that appears to have been recorded under duress.\nNatalia Protasevich told AFP news agency that she had not slept since her son's arrest.\n\"I'm asking, I'm begging, I'm calling on the whole international community to save him,\" she said, breaking down in tears during an interview in Wroclaw, southern Poland.\n\"He's only one journalist, he's only one child but please, please... I am begging for help. Please save him! They're going to kill him in there!\"\nShe added that her son was a \"fighter for justice\".\n\"They sent a fighter jet to get this young man! It's an act of terrorism, I don't think you can call it anything else. He's been taken hostage. This is an act of pure revenge!\" she said.\nHer voice breaking, she added: \"My son, this young man, just wanted to tell the truth about the situation. He didn't do anything wrong.\"\nBelarus sent a fighter jet to escort Ryanair flight FR4978, claiming there was a bomb threat. It touched down in Minsk at 13:16 local time (10:16 GMT) on Sunday.\nPolice then took Mr Protasevich away when the plane's 126 passengers disembarked. The activist, who witnesses said was \"super scared\", was arrested along with Ms Sapega.\nOn Tuesday, the Belarusian transport ministry released a transcript of a conversation said to be between an air traffic controller in Minsk and a pilot on the Ryanair flight.\nAccording to the transcript, which has not been independently verified, Belarus suggested several times that the plane should land in Minsk on \"our recommendation\".\nThis appeared to contradict earlier statements from the Belarusian authorities that said the decision to land was made independently by the pilot.\nWhere is Belarus? It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.\nWhy does it matter? Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed \"Europe's last dictator\" - he has been in power for 27 years.\nWhat's going on there? There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile."

Multiple countries have reported infections in farmed mink which, in some cases, have fallen severely ill or died.\nThe largest mink outbreak happened in Denmark, which culled millions of animals and shut down the industry completely until 2022.\nThere is also some evidence that mink have passed the virus back to humans in a mutated form."

      "tags": "Italy",
      "text": "Three people have been arrested in Italy over Sunday's cable car accident that left 14 dead.\nInvestigators say the emergency brakes had been disabled and the three members of the operating company were aware.\nAccording to a local transport official, the brake failure meant the car was travelling at over 100km/h (62 mph) when the cable broke.\nThe car plunged 20m (65ft) into the side of the Mottarone mountain near Lake Maggiore in northern Italy.\nProsecutors are carrying out an investigation into suspected involuntary homicide and negligence. \nThe three suspects have been identified as the owner, director and chief of operations of the company that managed the cable car.\nAFP reports that local prosecutor Olimpia Bossi told a press conference that the brake had been tampered with in a \"conscious act\" and suggested the car was unsafe before Sunday's accident.\nThe prosecutor alleged a fork-like clamp had been placed over the emergency brake, which had been malfunctioning, after repair work on the car was unsuccessful, according to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\"It had been applied to avoid continuous disruptions and blockages of the cable car,\" she said, adding that the suspects had believed that the cable would never break.\nAccording to the newspaper, investigators had initially believed the clamp had been left in place by mistake.\nFive families were on board the cable car when it crashed, including two children who were among the dead.\nThe sole survivor of the accident has been named as Eitan Biran, a five-year old Israeli boy whose parents, great-grandparents and younger brother were all killed. \nAccording to reports, he was protected from the impact of the crash by his father, who shielded him with his body.\nEitan was placed in a medically induced coma after an operation on Sunday but briefly opened his eyes on Wednesday, a medical official said. His aunt is with him in the hospital and he is expected to fully regain consciousness in the coming hours.\n\"This is the most delicate moment,\" Turin's health chief was quoted as saying by Italy's La Repubblica newspaper.\nSince the cable car reopened after lockdown a month ago, it had been operating with the tampered break system. For those who took the journey in that period, it's been described as Russian roulette.\nThe investigators' findings are chilling. The first assumption was that the clamp had been inserted and left inside by mistake. But it appears to have been a conscious decision by the maintenance workers. \nAlmost three years since a bridge in Genoa collapsed killing 43 people - a result of years of failed maintenance and conflict of interest - Italy is now facing another scandal over neglect of transport infrastructure with deadly consequences. \nAnd a shaken country is asking how many more such disasters will follow.\nMatteo Gasparini, provincial head of Italy's Alpine rescue service, said earlier this week that the emergency brake had failed to work after a cable snapped.\nThe cable car then sped backwards and \"ended up catapulted out of the support cables,\" Mr Gasparini added.\nIt is believed the car struck a pylon and plummeted to the ground, tumbling down the mountain until it crashed into trees.\nInitial reports said the towing cable failed at about 12:30 (10:30 GMT) as the gondola neared the end of its 20-minute journey to the top of the mountain from the resort town of Stresa. Nearby hikers heard a loud hiss before it crashed to the ground.\nThe cable car service originally opened in 1970 and was closed for maintenance between 2014 and 2016, according to local media reports. It recently reopened following the lifting of coronavirus measures. Numbers inside the gondolas were restricted. "

To change it:\nEven if a user has Like Counts enabled, they will not be able to see the number of likes on accounts or posts that have hidden them.\nUsers will also have the option hide counts on a specific post, before and after it goes live on the platform.\n\u201cThe spirit of this is to give people a choice,\u201d Mr Mosseri added, using the example of going through a break-up in a relationship or switching schools.\n\u201cMaybe you want to be a little bit less worried about how many likes everyone's getting for a couple weeks or a couple of months, and then maybe you want to switch back.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a one-way door, people tend to get hesitant about using the control.\u201d\nInstagram\u2019s algorithm will still take the number of likes into account when promoting posts on the platform, but it also takes into consideration other factors, such as what the user follows or engages with.\nMr Mosseri said there had been a \"polarised\" reaction from creators - accounts which make money through brand partnerships and advertising on the platform - but that the new feature didn\u2019t affect revenues.\nEarlier this year, concerns were raised over leaked plans to design a version of Instagram for children.\nPlans to create an Instagram for under-13s were not \"fully fledged\", Mr Mosseri said, explaining that it was difficult to verify ages, as children often didn't have IDs.\n\"It has to be more responsible to give parents oversight and transparency than to have kids continue to lie about their age.\"\nHe said the app would \"take some time\" to create."

And it is this hopeful feeling that has made it a book readers of all ages enjoy and remember.\"\nBorn in upstate New York to German immigrant parents, Carle moved as a child with his family to Stuttgart in the mid-1930s because his mother was homesick, only for his father to end up drafted into the army during World War Two and get taken prisoner by the Soviets.\nExperiencing the trauma of war gave Carle a different way of seeing the world.\nHe eventually moved back to New York and worked as a graphic designer and then at an advertising agency, before collaborating on his first picture book Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What do you see?\nThe first version of The Very Hungry Caterpillar was called A Week With Willi Worm, inspired after Carle used a hole punch to create circles into a stack of paper.\nIt gave him the idea of a bookworm but Carle said his editor was not keen on a worm so various other animals were discussed. Finally they settled on a caterpillar and butterfly.\nNo US printers would publish the book because of the differently shaped pages with the holes, but eventually a printing company in Japan was found. \nIt is estimated that nowadays Carle's book is being bought every 15 seconds.\nIt is not just the book that remains popular, there are animated versions of the story, various merchandise spin-offs and a stage production that to date has been watched by a million children."

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Coronavirus testing,Care homes",
      "text": "Claims the government put a protective shield around care homes at the start of the pandemic were \"complete nonsense,\" Dominic Cummings has said. \nThe former government adviser told MPs he was shocked, in April 2020, to find residents were not being tested before going back to care homes.\nHe said Health Secretary Matt Hancock had previously agreed Covid testing would take place. \nThe government said it had taken a number of steps to protect care homes.\nThe prime minister's spokesman said: \"We have always been guided by the latest advice at that time, and we have taken a number of steps to protect care home residents and those being discharged from hospitals into care homes.\" \nThe PM's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, faced questions about early decisions around care homes, at a hearing of the Commons Health and Social Care and Science and Technology committees. \nHe told MPs: \"We were told categorically in March that people would be tested before they went back to care homes. We only subsequently found out that that hadn't happened.\n\"The government rhetoric was we put a shield around care homes - it was complete nonsense.\n\"Quite the opposite of putting a shield around them - we sent people with Covid back to the care homes.\"\nMr Cummings said the situation was made worse because care home staff did not always have adequate PPE or testing equipment. \nNadra Ahmed, of the National Care Association, said Dominic Cummings' remarks about care homes were disappointing. \nShe told the PA news agency: \"It is with great sadness that listening to Mr Cummings, it emerges that our initial thoughts and the evidence that was around us was right - that there was no shield around care homes, there was no thought on the impact on the vulnerable people that we care for.\"\nAsk almost anyone who works in care, those who need services and their families, whether the government put a \"protective ring around the care sector from the very start\" of the pandemic, as it claims, and their response is one of disbelief - even of derision. \nSo for many today's comments from Dominic Cummings will have confirmed their memories. \nGiven the vulnerability of the people they look after, in early March 2020 many care providers started asking for guidance on how to protect against Covid. \nWith each week that passed those voices got louder. They struggled to get protective equipment, felt official guidance was too slow and had almost no testing. \nSome homes complained of being pressurised to take patients from hospitals. And the government only published its plan for social care when deaths among care home residents were already at a peak. \nFor the families of care home residents who died and care workers, today's testimony will have further underlined the importance of the coming inquiry into what happened.\nShadow social care minister, Liz Kendall, said the government was too slow to act to protect residents and staff. \nShe added: \"Over 30,000 care home residents have died of coronavirus during this pandemic - 25,000 elderly people were discharged from hospitals to care homes without any tests whatsoever, and frontline care workers were left without PPE.\n\"As we emerge from this pandemic, ministers must put in place a plan to transform social care, and ensure that care homes never again face a crisis of this scale.\"\nNatasha Curry, of the health think-tank the Nuffield Trust, said serious questions needed to be asked about the timing and effectiveness of measures in place for social care. \nShe said: \"The government was reportedly warned as early as January last year that the care home sector in particular would be hit hard by what was known about the virus, yet routine testing, adequate PPE and a plan for the sector came much later. \n\"Care homes were left often ill-prepared and sadly the extension of testing to social care staff and care home residents in late April came far too late to protect many of the most vulnerable.\"\nA National Audit Office report in June 2020 said about 25,000 hospital patients were discharged into care homes in England at the height of the pandemic, without them all being tested for Covid-19.\nAfter initially saying a negative result was not required before discharging patients from hospitals to care homes, the government later said on 15 April that all patients would be tested.\nRegular testing for staff and residents in care homes in England was rolled out in July.

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nAfter advising people not to travel into and out of eight areas in England worst hit by Indian coronavirus variant, the government has now said travel should be minimised, clarifying local restrictions are not being imposed. The government came under fire on Tuesday over the initial advice for Bolton, Blackburn, Kirklees, Bedford, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside. Although advice on avoiding all non-essential travel has changed, around two million people in those affected areas are still being asked to meet outdoors and stay two metres apart from anyone in other households, wherever possible.\nThe vaccine rollout continues at pace in England with people aged 30 and 31 being invited to book their first dose of a Covid jab. The NHS is urging the million or so in the latest category to book an appointment at one of the 1,600 available locations. Several areas are seeing a surge in coronavirus cases linked to the Indian variant and two doses of the vaccines are needed for strong protection. Meanwhile, over-18s in most areas of Wales, over-25s in Northern Ireland and those aged 30 and above in Scotland are all being invited to book appointments for their first dose.\nThe prime minister's former aide, Dominic Cummings, will be questioned by MPs later as part of an ongoing inquiry into \"lessons learnt\" about coronavirus. Mr Cummings - who has been increasingly critical of the government in recent months - will be asked about ministers' handling of the pandemic. He says \"secrecy\" had \"contributed greatly to the catastrophe\". Downing Street says it is getting on with the \"huge task\" of recovery.\nMost people have been doing some DIY during Covid restrictions and it appears building materials are now running short in the UK. Due to \"unprecedented levels of demand\" - which is set to continue - cement, some electrical components, timber, steel and paints are all in short supply, the Construction Leadership Council warns. Some building firms may have to delay projects, others could be forced to close as a result and people are being advised to delay home improvement projects until autumn.\nWhen Gracie was born two months early visiting was restricted for her parents due to the pandemic. But thanks to new technology, Grant and Lucy have been watching their daughter grow via updates from nurses at Evelina Children's Hospital.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAlthough restrictions have eased, advice has changed in some areas due to the Indian variant of Covid-19.

      "text": "Brussels must show common sense and take a pragmatic approach to the NI Protocol, the UK government has said. \nIt said it was disappointed that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was not fully recognising the effects of the protocol.\nIt is the part of the Brexit deal that puts a trade border in the Irish Sea.\nMs von der Leyen said on Monday that there was no alternative but the \"full and correct implementation\" of the protocol.\nThe UK government said its priority was the Good Friday Agreement, while the European Union was focussed on the single market.\nTechnical talks to simplify the operation of the protocol are ongoing.\nThe protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports - but it is strongly opposed to the protocol among unionists, who see it as separating Northern Ireland from the UK. \nIt was agreed by the United Kingdom and European Union in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020.\nHowever, in recent weeks the UK government's rhetoric against the protocol has hardened.\nEarlier this month the UK's Brexit minister said it was hard to see how the current operation of the protocol was sustainable.\nThe UK was committed to working with the EU, but there needed to be a \"pragmatic, risk-based approach\" to challenges over the protocol, said a government spokesman. \n\"The protocol relies on the support of all communities in Northern Ireland so it is disappointing that there was not more recognition from the commission president of the impact that the current operation of the protocol is having in Northern Ireland,\" said the spokesman.\n\"While the EU prioritise protection of the single market and treat the regulatory boundary as if it were like any other external EU border, our focus remains on protecting the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all its dimensions.\"\nSpeaking in Brussels on Monday night, Mrs Von der Leyen said the protocol was the \"only possible solution to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland while protecting the integrity of the EU single market\".\nShe added that any problems flowed from Brexit rather than the protocol, but the UK and EU had \"a common duty to do whatever we can to reduce tensions in Northern Ireland\".\nShe said the current technical talks were exploring practical solutions to help minimise disruption to everyday life in Northern Ireland.\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader-designate Edwin Poots said that costs for businesses in Northern Ireland of the protocol would \"spiral\" as 15,000 checks will ultimately have to be made every week on goods.\n\"This protocol will hurt every single individual in Northern Ireland,\" Mr Poots told the Stormont Assembly on Tuesday.\n\"I will continue to press hard with the UK government the issues that are at stake here. The case is unarguable that this protocol is bad for Northern Ireland.\"\nDUP MPs Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gavin Robinson, along with Lord Dodds, met the Brexit minister on Tuesday.\nThe trio told Lord Frost the protocol should be replaced, with Sir Jeffrey saying their message was \"clear and unambiguous\".\n\"The protocol has no support from any shade or quarter of unionism. Its imposition without the consent of both traditions in Northern Ireland and overriding of cross-community voting safeguards has seriously undermined support for devolution,\" Sir Jeffrey added.\nOutgoing First Minister Arlene Foster accused the EU of having a \"tin ear\" to concerns about the protocol. \n\"It is hugely disappointing, in spite of everything that has happened, the fact that we are talking about cancer drugs being prevented from coming into Northern Ireland,\" she said.\n\"The fact that there are more checks from Great Britain into Northern Ireland than there are in Rotterdam; that still the European Union and the European Commission have had a tin ear to the concerns and the absolutely genuine concerns of the people in Northern Ireland.\"\nOutgoing UUP leader Steve Aiken said Ms von der Leyen's remarks were \"tone deaf\", and urged her to engage with his party, \"the party that helped write and implement the Good Friday Agreement\". \nHe said: \"She is at best badly informed, or at worst, is wilfully misrepresenting the impact of the EU's failure to come to an acceptable agreement with the UK, and the people of Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, we are all stuck in the middle. \n\"Northern Ireland is being used as a bargaining chip between Brussels and London.\"\nBut Ms von der Leyen's comments were welcomed by Sinn F\u00e9in MP Chris Hazzard, who said Northern Ireland businesses wanted \"the protections the protocol provides\". \n\"It's time the British government stopped the charades and implement what it has already agreed,\" he said.\n\"We also need to see the economy minister in the north using the unique situation the protocol affords the north to attract investment and jobs.\" \nDuring Brexit negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority.\nIt meant keeping the land border between the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) and Northern Ireland (in the UK) open and avoiding new infrastructure like cameras and border posts. That was easy when the whole island of Ireland was part of the EU.\nBut after Brexit, a new arrangement was needed because the EU requires certain goods to be inspected at the point of entry into its single market.\nSo, the EU and the UK negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which came into force on 1 January 2021.\nThe Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) said Mrs Von der Leyen's comments \"showed how little she cares about peace and stability in Northern Ireland\". \nThe LCC was set up in 2015 to represent a range of individuals and views from the wider Protestant, unionist and loyalist communities.\nLoyalist paramilitary groups like the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association are also represented on it.\nLCC Chairman David Campbell said: \"I would appeal to her to start listening and to recognise that the imposition of the protocol on the people of Northern Ireland without their involvement or consent is unsustainable and actually contrary to many of the key founding tenets of the European Union.\"\nWhen Ursula von der Leyen talks about practical solutions, she is alluding to the technical negotiations which are happening right now between EU and UK officials. \nOfficials are crunching through about 30 different issues relating to the protocol -  everything from pet travel to VAT on second-hand cars to steel tariffs to medicines and the movement of plants. \nThey're working through those to see what can ease the implementation of the protocol on the ground. \nBut the difficulty is a dramatic shift is not going to happen at a technical level. \nIt's something where there needs to be a political commitment and, at the moment, there is no sign of the EU or the UK being prepared to make that big political compromise. \nLast week, an LCC member told MPs violence could not be ruled out if the protocol remained. \nThe organisation also met Lord Frost to discuss the protocol earlier this month.\nRioting erupted in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in April - with tensions around the protocol partly blamed.\nSince then, there has been a switch to demonstrations largely in the form of loyalist band parades and marches.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland is currently investigating about 303 unlawful parades against the protocol. \nMeanwhile, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has said she has sought legal advice over the DUP's absence at north-south meetings.\nThe DUP is boycotting some North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings due to its opposition to the protocol.\nMs Mallon told the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday that ministers are legally obliged to attend.\nEarlier this month, Agriculture Minister and DUP leader-designate Edwin Poots was criticised for preventing another north-south ministerial meeting from taking place."

      "text": "James Newman says competing at the Eurovision Song Contest has been \"life-changing\" - despite his entry Embers getting zero points. \nIt's only the second time in history the UK has failed to get a single point at the event.\nItaly won this year's contest in Rotterdam with rock band M\u00e5neskin's anthemic Zitti E Buoni.\nAsked if he'd do anything differently, James said he \"wouldn't change a thing\" about his performance. \nBut clearly something didn't work for the United Kingdom. Was it the song? The staging? Did politics come into it? \n\"Maybe people just didn't like my music,\" says James. \n\"We tried as hard as we could. I need time to process what it is that we could have done better.\"\nThe result means the UK has now come bottom in the last two contests (2019 and 2021).\nOn the night, the points are revealed in two halves. \nThe national juries are the first to give their scores and because James got zero from them, he became the first act to receive the public's scores.\nWith pauses for dramatic effect, host Jan Smit announced: \"The United Kingdom\u2026 gets\u2026 from the public\u2026 zero points.\"\nThe news was met by a huge cheer in the arena.\n\"I genuinely had the best night of my life. I loved the crowd's reaction because I got a standing ovation and everyone was cheering,\" says James.\nSpain, the Netherlands and Germany also received 'nil points' from the public, but James came bottom because they'd at least got a few points from the juries. \nAfter years of middling to low results for the United Kingdom, the BBC had tried a different approach to Eurovision by getting record label BMG on board to help pick the act. \nJames was originally chosen for the 2020 contest with a ballad called My Last Breath. It was cancelled so after reselection, he entered an upbeat, dance track - Embers. \nSpectator editor and Eurovision enthusiast Fraser Nelson wrote: \"The UK was simply outsung and outclassed by smaller countries who made more effort.\"\n\"We have to keep showing Europe that we care about the Eurovision Song Contest,\" says James.\n\"I suppose if you look at a lot of the songs that did well, they might have been a little less pop than what I was doing. We just have to keep trying.\"\nFor the first time in years, none of the top three songs were sung in English. Italy won, with France in second and Switzerland in third (both sung in French).\nIn fourth place was the much-hyped Da\u00f0i Freyr for Iceland, and fifth went to Ukraine's techno-banger Shum by Go_A.\nJames says he was \"trying to start a process of showing people that we were bringing the British music industry to the stage\" and \"putting in songs at Eurovision that stand up to the radio and streaming services\".\n\"If I was choosing, I'd probably try and carry that strategy on.\"\nEmbers is on course to enter this week's Official Chart Top 40, along with the Italian winners M\u00e5neskin. \nJames says he's got support from loads of people, including Coldplay's Chris Martin, who Facetimed him on Monday morning.\n\"He told me to not take the result personally, said I was amazing and told me to keep my chin up. I've grown up listening to him, he's an amazing songwriter so it made me feel so much better.\"\nJames has watched his performance back and says he \"couldn't have done any better\".\n\"The dancers nailed it every time and I think it looked great.\"\nLaughing, he says \"someone called me James Nil-man the other day. It was funny but I don't want that to catch on.\"\nLooking forward, James says he's going to working on new music and \"getting back to a normal life after this rollercoaster I've been on for the past two years\".\nAnd whether he embraces it or not, he'll always be a small part of Eurovision history - just probably not in the way he'd hoped. \nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "tags": "Physics,Nuclear fusion ,Climate change,Engineering,Renewable energy",
      "text": "Initial results from a UK experiment could help clear a hurdle to achieving commercial power based on nuclear fusion, experts say.\nThe researchers believe they now have a better way to remove the excess heat produced by fusion reactions.\nThis intense heat can melt materials used inside a reactor, limiting the amount of time it can operate for.\nThe system, which has been likened to a car exhaust, resulted in a tenfold reduction in the heat.\nThe tests were carried out at the Mast (Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak) Upgrade nuclear fusion experiment at Culham in Oxfordshire. The \u00a355m device began operating in October last year, after a seven-year build.\nNuclear fusion is an attempt to replicate the processes that power the Sun - and other stars - here on planet Earth.\nBut the trick is getting more energy out of the reactions than you put in. This goal continues to elude teams of scientists and engineers around the world, who are working to make fusion power a reality.\nExisting nuclear energy relies on a process called fission, where a heavy chemical element is split to produce lighter ones. Fusion works by combining two light elements to make a heavier one. \nOne common fusion approach uses a reactor design called a tokamak, in which powerful magnetic fields are used to control charged gas - or plasma - inside a doughnut-shaped container.\nAn international fusion megaproject called Iter is currently under construction in southern France. Prof Ian Chapman, chief executive of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), said it would be crucial for demonstrating the feasibility of bringing fusion power to the grid. \nBut he added that Iter's size and cost meant that \"if every time you wanted to build a unit, you had to raise that sum of money, then the penetration into the market would be determined by economics, not technology\". \nMast Upgrade is one attempt to come up with a template for more compact, cheaper fusion reactors. It makes use of an innovative design known as a spherical tokamak to squeeze the fuel into a 4.4m-tall, 4m-wide space. By comparison, the containment vessel Iter will use to control its fusion reactions is 11.4m tall and 19.4m wide.\nBut Mast Upgrade's bijou dimensions come at a price: \"You're making something that's hotter than the Sun... in a smaller volume. How you then get the heat out becomes a big challenge,\" said Prof Chapman.\nThe core of the plasma within the tokamak reaches temperatures of 100 million C. Without an exhaust system that can handle this unimaginable heat, materials in the design would have to be regularly replaced - significantly affecting the amount of time a power plant could operate for.\nThe new exhaust system being trialled at Culham is known as a Super-X divertor. This would allow components in future commercial tokamaks to last for much longer; greatly increasing the power plant's availability, improving its economic viability and reducing the cost of fusion electricity.\nTests at Mast Upgrade have shown at least a tenfold reduction in the heat on materials with the Super-X system.\nResearchers said the results were a \"game-changer\" for the promise of fusion power plants that could provide affordable, efficient electricity. Against the background of climate change, fusion could offer a clean and virtually limitless source of energy.\nDr Andrew Kirk, lead scientist on Mast Upgrade, said the results were \"the moment our team at UKAEA has been working towards for almost a decade\".\n\"We built Mast Upgrade to solve the exhaust problem for compact fusion power plants, and the signs are that we've succeeded.\n\"Super-X reduces the heat on the exhaust system from a blowtorch level down to more like you'd find in a car engine. This could mean it would only have to be replaced once during the lifetime of a power plant.\"\nThe success of the exhaust system for Mast Upgrade delivers a boost to plans for a prototype fusion power plant in the UK called Step. It is expected to come online sometime in the 2040s.\nThe Mast Upgrade facility will have its official opening ceremony on Wednesday, where guest of honour, astronaut Tim Peake, will create his own artificial star by running a plasma test on the machine.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson's former chief adviser Dominic Cummings has made a series of explosive claims about mistakes made by the government during the Covid pandemic.\nDuring a seven-hour joint session of the Commons Heath, and Science and Technology committees, Mr Cummings made a number of allegations - here are the key points.\n\"Tens of thousands of people died, who didn't need to die,\" Mr Cummings said.\nEarlier, he said sorry for ministers, officials and advisers \"like me\" for falling \"disastrously short of the standards that the public has a right to expect\".\n\"When the public needed us most the government failed,\" he added, apologising to \"the families of those who died unnecessarily\".\nMr Cummings said the government was not on a \"war footing\" when the virus emerged in January and February last year and \"lots of key people were literally skiing\".\nMr Cummings made a series of allegations against his former boss Boris Johnson, including:\nDescribing a decline in his relationship with Mr Johnson after the summer of 2020, he said \"it was clear in July that our relations were very far from where they had been\".\nHe added: \"They took another terrible dive after the second lockdown in October because the prime minister knew that I blamed him for the whole situation - and I did - and by 31 October our relations were essentially already finished... \n\"The heart of the problem was, fundamentally, I regarded him as unfit for the job. And I was trying to create a structure around him to try and stop what I thought would have been bad decisions, and push things through against his wishes.\"\nAsked later by Labour MP Sarah Owen whether Boris Johnson was a \"fit and proper person to get us through this pandemic\", Mr Cummings replied: \"No.\"\nDowning Street rejected many of the remarks and Mr Johnson insisted his government at \"every stage tried to minimise loss of life\".\nMr Cummings appeared to reserve his harshest criticism for Health Secretary Matt Hancock.\nMr Hancock \"should have been fired for at least 15 to 20 things\", Mr Cummings said, as he alleged the health secretary:\nA spokesman for Mr Hancock later said: \"We absolutely reject Mr Cummings' claims about the health secretary.\"\nMr Hancock added he had not seen Mr Cummings' evidence to MPs in full \"and instead I've been dealing with getting the vaccination rollout going, especially to over-30s, and saving lives\".\nHe said he would make a statement in the Commons on Thursday when he would \"have more to say\".\nMr Cummings said it was \"obvious\" in retrospect that the UK should have locked down in the first week of March at the latest - and it was a \"huge failure\" on his part not to alert the prime minister.\n\"I bitterly regret that I didn't hit the emergency panic button earlier than I did,\" he added.\nMr Cummings said that, on 14 March, Boris Johnson had been told that models showing the peak of infections was \"weeks and weeks and weeks away\" in June were \"completely wrong\".\nMr Cummings said that meeting came after the then deputy cabinet secretary, Helen MacNamara, relayed concerns that there was \"no plan... we're in huge trouble\".\nHe said the PM was warned: \"The NHS is going to be smashed in weeks. Really we've got days to act.\"\nMr Johnson announced a national lockdown nine days later on the evening of 23 March.\nMr Cummings painted a vivid picture of the chaotic atmosphere in Downing Street on one \"crazy\" day in March 2020 when the government was considering a national lockdown - at the same time as officials considered a bombing campaign in Iraq.\nOne morning, he claimed, the \"national security people came in\" and said \"[US President Donald] Trump wants us to join a bombing campaign in the Middle East tonight\" and this \"totally derailed\" meetings about quarantine and the coronavirus.\nAt the same time, he said, \"the prime minister's girlfriend was going completely crackers\" over a story in Times newspaper with the headline \"Downing St dog to be reshuffled\".\nThe article reported a Whitehall source as saying they were not sure Carrie Symonds' dog Dilyn would \"make it through the next reshuffle\" due to the mess he had created in her and Mr Johnson's No 11 flat.\nMr Cummings said: \"So, we have this sort of completely insane situation in which part of the building was saying, 'are we going to bomb Iraq?', part of the building was arguing about whether or not we're going to do quarantine or not do quarantine, the prime minister has his girlfriend going crackers about something completely trivial.\"\nMr Cummings said that, as late as 12 March last year, the UK's top civil servant championed a plan of rapid herd immunity involving \"chicken pox parties\" for the virus.\nThen cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill is alleged to have suggested to Mr Johnson: \"Prime minister, you should go on TV tomorrow and explain the herd immunity plan and that it is like the old chicken pox parties. We need people to get this disease because that's how we get herd immunity by September.\"\nBut Mr Cummings said he told him not to use the analogy, which was \"not right\", as - according to data expert Ben Warner - Covid was \"spreading exponentially and killing hundreds of thousands of people\".\nAsked about more recent decisions over a second lockdown in the autumn of 2020, Mr Cummings alleged Mr Johnson rejected a recommendation last September for a shorter stay-at-home order in England.\n\"He was ignoring the advice,\" he added, saying the prime minister believed he had been pushed into imposing the first one and that the economic harm done by lockdown would be worse than Covid itself.\nHe added: \"All credible serious people in my opinion were saying essentially the same thing so I was very, very clear with him about it.\n\"He wasn't taking any advice, he was just making his own decisions, he was going to ignore the advice. Cabinet wasn't involved or asked.\n\"I've been very critical of Matt Hancock but I think Hancock agreed with me actually in September about acting then.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Ocado,Marks & Spencer,Coronavirus pandemic,UK High Streets",
      "text": "Marks & Spencer has said it plans to close another 30 shops over the next 10 years as part of its turnaround plan.\nM&S has already closed or relocated 59 main stores, as well as cutting 7,000 jobs across stores and management.\nThe chain has reported big losses for last year as the pandemic took its toll on clothing sales.\nBut food sales were up thanks to its Ocado tie-up, contributing to \"a resilient financial performance in a year of disruption\".\nM&S made a pre-tax loss of \u00a3201.2m in the 52 weeks to 27 March, down from a \u00a367.2m profit in the previous year.\nThe High Street stalwart currently has 254 full-line stores, selling clothing, homewares and food. It says that a number of them are in long-term decline and cannot justify future investment. \nAbout 30 stores will gradually close over the next decade, while another 80 will be moved to better locations or merged with nearby shops. \nThe group will open 17 new or expanded main stores over the next two years, including a number of former Debenhams sites. \n\"We are committed to stores and believe they can be a true source of competitive advantage,\" chief executive Steve Rowe told investors and journalists on a conference call.\n\"But they need to be the right stores, in the right location, with the right services.\"\nAfter accounting for one-off restructuring costs, the business made a profit of \u00a341.6m, but this was still down almost 90% on the previous year. \nThe M&S losses were mainly due to the performance of its clothing division, which suffered as non-essential retail was closed during lockdown.\nThe 137-year-old chain said clothing and homeware sales had fallen by 31.5%, reflecting the \"heavy impact\" of lockdowns on stores. \n\"In most of this time, our operations have been severely constrained by the change in day-to-day living, the effects of social distancing and partial or full closure of large parts of our store estate,\" M&S said.\n\"This has resulted in substantial changes to the mix of products customers have bought and a wide divergence of store formats and channels.\"\nHowever, M&S said clothing and home sales had been growing since reopening.\nThe store chain also took heart from improved figures in its food division as its tie-up with online grocer Ocado took effect.\nIt said food delivered \"strong underlying like-for-like growth\" of 6.9%, after adjusting for the closure of hospitality and the adverse impact on franchise sales. \n\"In a year like no other, we have delivered a resilient trading performance,\" said chief executive Steve Rowe.\n\"In addition, by going further and faster in our transformation through the Never the Same Again programme, we moved beyond fixing the basics to forge a reshaped M&S. \n\"With the right team in place to accelerate change in the trading businesses and build a trajectory for future growth, we now have a clear line of sight on the path to make M&S special again. The transformation has moved to the next phase.\"\nLike many other retailers, Marks & Spencer has endured a difficult 12 months thanks to the pandemic. But there are signs in these results that the ordeal may have started to forge a stronger company, one more attuned to customer tastes and the move to online shopping. \nM&S traded profitably, but posted an overall loss of \u00a3201m because of the cost of its restructuring plans. It is closing shops, laying off staff and investing heavily in the internet. \nFood sales were up 7%, clothing sales down by one third, with sales in High Street and city centre outlets sharply down. One of the new online ventures, a joint venture with Ocado, is proving a success. One quarter of every Ocado delivery is now M&S products, and the partnership contributed \u00a378m of profit. \nInvestors liked the idea of a revival plan at M&S that for once seems to have some bite: the shares were up 4% at 162p in early trading.\nM&S said it had received government support of \u00a3306.1m, which had partly offset the effect of lost trade and enabled it to keep its employees on.\n\"The figures show the catastrophic effect the pandemic has had on business with retail stores on the High Street,\" Catherine Shuttleworth, founder of retail consultancy Savvy Marketing, told the BBC's Today programme. \n\"There is some glimmer of hope as we come out of it, but it's one of those years that we can't draw too many conclusions from, because it's been so unbelievably different and something that no retailer could have reasonably planned for.\"\nBut she added that \"real benefits\" were starting to come from the M&S turnaround programme.\n\"Ocado's driven an awful lot of income and is really introducing a whole new group of shoppers to M&S and there's never a better time than to tie up with a food delivery business than during a pandemic,\" she added."

But in March it changed its stance after the Supreme Court ruled that its drivers should be classified as workers - a category entitling them to better pay and conditions.\nNow it provides them with a National Living Wage guarantee, holiday pay and a pension.\nAnd by recognising GMB, the ride-hailing giant has gone a step further, giving a union the right to negotiate on behalf of drivers for the first time.\nThe two sides will meet quarterly to discuss driver issues and concerns while Uber has agreed access rights for GMB representatives at driver hubs.\nUnder the agreement, GMB and Uber will discuss topics such as Uber's National Living Wage guarantee, pensions and holiday pay.\nDrivers won't automatically become members, and to be represented by the union, they will have to sign up.\nGMB called on other operators to follow suit, saying the deal offered a golden opportunity to improve workers' rights. \n\"This agreement shows gig economy companies don't have to be a Wild West on the untamed frontier of employment rights,\" said Mr Rix.\nTUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the agreement would give Uber drivers \"a real voice at work\".\nBut the organisation that brought the Supreme Court employment case against Uber, the App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU), said there was \"good reason for workers and their unions to be cautious\".\nIt said Uber was still not providing a minimum wage for all working time and holiday pay in the UK, \"despite the recent UK Supreme Court ruling in our favour\".\n\"At this time ADCU is not prepared to enter into a recognition agreement with Uber,\" it added.\nThe UK is the only country in which Uber has recognised a union, and its is still being challenged by its drivers in many other markets over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed."

      "text": "Building materials are running short in the UK, leaving DIY projects in doubt and building companies under pressure.\nThe Construction Leadership Council has warned that cement, some electrical components, timber, steel and paints are all in short supply.\nIt blamed \"unprecedented levels of demand\" that are set to continue.\nThe Federation of Master Builders said that some building firms may have to delay projects and others could be forced to close as a result. \n\"Small, local builders are being hit hardest by material shortages and price rises,\" said chief executive Brian Berry.\n\"We can't build our way to recovery from the pandemic if we don't have the materials.\"\nRoland Glancy, managing director of design service Peek Home, advised people to delay home improvement projects until autumn.\n\"The last thing you want is to knock through a wall and then struggle to get hold of a bag of plaster to complete your vision leaving you living in a building site, just when we should be enjoying our new freedoms,\" he said.\nThe supply problems stem from a number of factors. Construction industry projects have surged since lockdown began easing which has led to skyrocketing demand for already scarce materials.\nThere are also issues hitting specific products, such as the warmer winter affecting timber production in Scandinavia while the cold winter weather in Texas affected the production of chemicals, plastics and polymer.\nThere has also been a sharp rise in shipping costs, said Noble Francis, economics director of the Construction Products Association.\n\"Shipping costs have risen sharply due a shortage of empty containers from Covid-19-related issues and the sharp recovery in global demand,\" he told the BBC.\nFor instance the cost of shipping a 40ft container from Asia to Northern Europe soared from $1,500 (\u00a31,061) in summer 2020 to more than $8,300 (\u00a35,873) by May 2021, he said.\nWith demand globally increasing and the UK importing many of its raw materials, lead times for orders are lengthening while prices are shooting up.\nMohsen Kashan of Milton Keynes has been waiting nine months to have his bathroom renovated after a leak. \nBut with problems getting parts and tradespeople he told the BBC he now simply can't afford the rising costs he is being quoted. \n\"It's a simple job for a small bathroom just 2 metres by 2.5 meters. But we have been quoted \u00a310,000 for what used to be less than \u00a35,000. \n\"To expect to pay between \u00a38,000 and \u00a310,000 for a small bathroom seems too much,\" Mohsen said.  \nHe's been struggling since September to get the repairs done.  \n\"We've tried B&Q, a couple of other stores, as well as installers and half a dozen fitters.  \n\"Either the cost of the materials has been too high, the cost of labour too high or materials are simply unavailable.\" \nThe Office for National Statistics has projected a rise of 7-8% in material prices, with increases for certain materials, such as timber, expected to more than double during the course of the year.\n\"My members are experiencing price rises of 10-15% across the board, rising to 50% on timber and 30% on cement,\" said Mr Berry.\n\"It is really challenging in terms of supplies. It's nothing that we've ever experienced before,\" said Amy Archer, deputy managing director of the Swift Group, based in Cottingham near Hull, which makes caravans, motorhomes and holiday homes.\nShe said there are two issues: \"The first is a shortage of materials in the first place and the delays that we've seen through the ports because of shipping container shortages.\"\nThe second is rising prices: \"Commodity prices are going up because there's such a huge demand for products.\"\nBooming activity domestically hasn't helped too, she said. \"Lots of people are doing home improvements such as new kitchens and that's all draining the materials that are available.\"\n\"This really is unprecedented,\" said Chris Husband, commercial director at wood supplier Bayram Timber. \"The sheer volume of timber that's being demanded at the moment, they are struggling to keep pace with it in Scandinavia, where we source most of our raw material.\"\nHis company, based in North Ferriby near Hull. competes against others across the globe for the timber and is \"having to wait in line\", he said. \"It's having a huge inflationary effect on the raw material price and obviously the lead times as well.\"\nIs the current situation here to stay? \"We're pretty much certain that this is with us for the rest of this year,\" he said.\nBrexit has also affected the UK's timber supply as 80% of softwood comes from Europe, said Thomas Goodman, construction expert, from MyJobQuote.\nSteel is also in short supply, as global demand exceeds supply. \"Many steel manufacturers have stopped taking orders, as they are worried that panic buying will result in extremely low stock,\" he said.\nThe shipping costs issue is likely to subside in the next three to six months but global demand is likely to remain high for the next six to nine months, predicted Mr Francis.\nMr Berry pointed out that small builders can't stockpile or plan jobs far in advance, unlike larger firms, so they need to be assured that the materials will be at the merchants when they need them. \n\"Consumers must be aware that shortages are causing delays to projects, and that costs may change in the months ahead because of this pressure,\" he said.\nBuilding materials supplier Travis Perkins said: \"In instances where we have seen some challenges posed by global demand for raw materials or inflationary pressures, we continue to work closely with our suppliers and partners to ensure healthy stock availability for our customers.\"\nBut with higher material prices for the moment, many homeowners and builders are choosing to delay work until the necessary resources become more affordable."

      "text": "Islands such as the Canary Islands and Majorca could be placed on the UK green list of destinations for holidaymakers, a government minister has said.\nThe move may happen from 7 June, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said.\nAt present, people from England can holiday in green list countries without having to quarantine on their return.\nBut travel operators and airlines have been pushing to be allowed to fly to holiday islands when the rest of the country is on the amber list.\nSo, that could mean people could holiday in popular destinations such as the Canary Islands and Majorca even if mainland Spain stays on the amber list.\nMr Shapps told the transport select committee that he has \"asked The Joint Biosecurity Centre to consider islands within their criteria and where possible they would look to include if them if facts stacked up\".\nWhen pushed on whether this was possible by the review on 7 June, Mr Shapps replied: \"technically that is possible, but I actually don't know because I don't have the data yet as to whether islands make the grade.\"\nPeople across the UK can legally take foreign holidays - although Welsh residents have been asked not to travel abroad.\nOn England's traffic light list, foreign countries are classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests in place for each.\nGovernment guidance is that you should not holiday in red or amber countries - which include Spain and most other countries.\nHolidays to countries on the green list - including Portugal - can go ahead without a need to quarantine when you return.\nThe list is reviewed every three weeks and countries can change status at short notice. There are similar rules for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nRead more here.\nMr Shapps was pushed to explain why so few countries were on the green list when UK vaccination levels were high.\nHe said: \"If you send people, even vaccinated people, to other countries, given vaccinations are not 100% reliable, then you are exposing them to risks that they don't have if they stay in the UK.\n\"'That's fine', you might say, 'That's their risk'. But not if they bring that back, then that is all of our risk, so we do have to move with the science.\"\nMr Shapps said there is scientific analysis of each destination when decisions are made to include countries on the list, including vaccination levels, virus levels and ability to track how the virus is evolving. \nAt the moment this is a waiting game, he said, and that travel would change when other countries catch up with UK levels of vaccinations. \"Part of this is having the patience to let this come through the system.\" \nHe also said deaths in Germany and France are now higher per day than in the UK and allowing UK citizens to travel there exposes them to risk.\nMr Shapps added: \"I am the Secretary of State for Transport, I want people to be able to travel, I have no other agency than [to] get people travelling, but we also recognise as a responsible government that it has to be safe.\"\nMr Shapps added that people may be able to use vaccine certificates rather than tests to travel later on in June.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the bosses of Tui, Jet2, Easyjet and Manchester Airport called on the government to expand the green list of destinations.\nThe holiday bosses didn't feel that Portugal, the only mass-market tourist destination on the green list, is enough of an offering for the summer. \nTour operators want the British holidaymakers' favourites of Majorca, Tenerife and Gran Canaria opened up, destinations they believe have good health protocols in place.\nThey want UK holidaymakers back on some of their favourite beaches. \nSteve Heapy, the chief executive of Jet2, said: \"We feel the government is overly cautious and that the list of green countries could be expanded with little increase in risk.\"\nHe said that there was currently no benefit of the vaccination programme when travelling, adding: \"People need a break, people want to get back to normal.\""

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson,Leave campaigns spending investigations,Brexit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Dominic Cummings was never going to go quietly after being forced out of Downing Street at the end of last year.\nBut the number, and seriousness, of his claims about what went on at the heart of government, as ministers battled to get on top of the coronavirus crisis, are unprecedented in modern times.\nRarely has a former adviser made so many potentially damaging revelations about a sitting prime minister.\nHis critics say Mr Cummings is motivated by revenge against Boris Johnson, and will not rest until the PM has been removed from No 10.\nMr Cummings insists he is driven by a desire to make what he views as a broken and chaotic government machine work better in future. \nHe left his Downing Street role following an internal power struggle, amid claims the PM's then-fiancee had blocked the promotion of one of his allies, Lee Cain, after months of internal warfare.\nIn his final year at Downing Street, Mr Cummings had a \u00a340,000 pay rise, taking his salary to between \u00a3140,000 and \u00a3144,999.\nThere was speculation that the 49-year-old would seek a post-politics career as the first head of Aria, the UK's new \"high risk\" science agency, which had been one of his pet projects.\nBut he appears to have a different career path in mind. \nIn February, he started a technology consultancy firm, Siwah Ltd. He is the sole director of the firm, according to Companies House, and it is registered at an address in his native Durham, in north-east England. This would appear to be a successor to Dynamic Maps, his previous tech consultancy. \nBut in recent months, most of his time appears to have been taken up with spilling the beans on his time in government.\nThe BBC did not pay Mr Cummings for his exclusive interview with political editor Laura Kuenssberg.\nAnd he has not yet taken the time-honoured route of selling his story to a newspaper, or signing a book deal.\nBut he has found a way of generating income through online platform Substack, where he has launched a newsletter.\nHe plans to give out information on the coronavirus pandemic and his time in Downing Street for free, but \"more recondite stuff on the media, Westminster, 'inside No 10', how did we get Brexit done in 2019, the 2019 election etc\" will only be available to subscribers who pay \u00a310 a month.\nHe is also offering his marketing and election campaigning expertise, for fees that \"slide from zero to lots depending on who you are / your project\".\nThis new venture has incurred the wrath of Whitehall watchdog Lord Pickles, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which vets jobs taken by former ministers and top officials.\nIn a letter to Cabinet Office Minister Micheal Gove, he says Mr Cummings has sought advice on working as a consultant. \nBut he adds: \"It appears that Mr Cummings is offering various services for payment via a blog hosted on Substack, the blog for which he is also receiving subscription payments.\n\"Mr Cummings has failed to seek the committee's advice on this commercial undertaking, nor has the committee received the courtesy of a reply to our letter requesting an explanation.\n\"Failure to seek and await advice before taking up work is a breach of the government's rules.\" \nThere are few repercussions for failing to consult Acoba, however.\nLittle was heard from Mr Cummings for several months after his departure from Downing Street - but that all changed in April.\nAfter being named in media reports as the source of government leaks, he launched a scathing attack on Mr Johnson via a 1,000-word blog post in April.\nAs well as denying he was behind the leaks, he went on to make a series of accusations against the PM and questioned his \"competence and integrity\". \nThe following month, Mr Cummings expanded on his criticisms at a seven-hour select committee appearance, declaring Boris Johnson \"unfit for the job\", and claiming he had ignored scientific advice and wrongly delayed lockdowns.\nHe also turned his fire on then-health secretary Matt Hancock, who he said should have been fired for lying.\nThis sparked a bitter war of words with Mr Hancock, who flatly denied all of Mr Cummings's allegations.\nIt thrust Mr Cummings back into the spotlight for the first time since his now infamous visit to County Durham, four days after the start of the first national lockdown, in March last year.\nWhile staying with his family at his father's farm, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London.\nThis revelation - at a specially-convened press conference in the Downing Street garden - made Mr Cummings a household name and led to furious allegations of double standards at a time when the government had banned all but essential long-distance travel.\nIn an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Cummings said that, during the Barnard Castle trip, he had been trying to work out \"Do I feel OK driving?\"\nHe also said he had decided to move his family to County Durham before his wife fell ill with suspected Covid because of security concerns over his home in London.\nAsked why he had given a story that was \"not the 100% truth\" when he held a special press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on 25 May, Mr Cummings admitted that \"the way we handled the whole thing was wrong\".\nBoris Johnson stood by his adviser throughout the Barnard Castle episode - to the consternation of some of his supporters, who feared it was undermining his attempts to hold the country together during a national crisis. \nSome said the episode burned through the political capital the prime minister had generated months earlier during the 2019 general election.\nBut it is hard to overstate how important Mr Cummings was to the Johnson project.\nThe two are very different characters - Mr Johnson likes to be popular, Mr Cummings appears indifferent to such concerns - but they formed a strong bond in the white heat of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU, which Mr Cummings led as campaign director. \nThe combination of Mr Johnson, the flamboyant household-name frontman, with Mr Cummings, the ruthless, data-driven strategist, with a flair for an eye-catching slogan, proved to be unbeatable. \nMr Cummings was credited with formulating the \"take back control\" slogan that appears to have struck a chord with so many referendum voters, changing the course of British history.\nYet some were surprised when Mr Cummings was brought into the heart of government as Mr Johnson's chief adviser, given his past record of rubbing senior Tory politicians up the wrong way.\nIt proved to be a shrewd move. It was Mr Cummings who devised the high-risk strategy of pushing for the 2019 election to be fought on a \"Get Brexit Done\" ticket, focusing on winning seats in Labour heartlands, something no previous Tory leader had managed to do in decades. \nMany of the policy ideas that have shaped the Johnson government's agenda have his fingerprints all over them.\n\"Levelling up\" - moving power and money out of London and the South East of England - is a Cummings project, as are plans to shake-up the civil service, take on the judiciary and reform the planning system.\nThe team that surrounded Mr Cummings at Downing Street, some of whom are Vote Leave veterans, were fiercely loyal to him and shared a sense that they were outsiders in Whitehall, battling an entrenched \"elite\".\nLee Cain, the former Downing Street and Vote Leave communications chief, left No 10 just before Mr Cummings did.\nThere had been rumours of a rift between the Vote Leave veterans and other No 10 aides, who didn't like Mr Cummings's and Mr Cain's abrasive style.\nThere were tales of crackdowns on special advisers suspected of leaking to the media and angry, dismissive behaviour towards Tory MPs, civil servants and even secretaries of state.\nNone of this will have come as much of a surprise to veteran Cummings watchers.\nMr Cummings has been in and around the upper reaches of government and the Conservative Party for nearly two decades, and has made a career out of defying conventional wisdom and challenging the established order.\nBut he has never been a member of the Conservative Party, or any party, and appears to have little time for most MPs.\nA longstanding Eurosceptic who cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group, Mr Cummings's other passion is changing the way government operates.\nHe grabbed headlines when he posted an advert on his personal blog for \"weirdos and misfits with odd skills\" to work in government, arguing that the civil service lacked \"deep expertise\" in many policy areas.\nMr Cummings is a native of Durham, in the North East of England. His father, Robert, was an oil rig engineer and his mother, Morag, a teacher and behavioural specialist.\nHe went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history and spent some time in Russia, where he was involved with an ill-fated attempt to launch an airline, among other projects.\nHe is married to Spectator journalist Mary Wakefield, the daughter of aristocrat Sir Humphry Wakefield, whose family seat is Chillingam Castle, in Northumberland.\nAfter a stint as campaign director for Business for Sterling, Mr Cummings spent eight months as chief strategy adviser to then Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who fired him.\nHe played a key role in the 2004 campaign against an elected regional assembly in his native North East.\nIn what turned out to be a dry run for the Brexit campaign, the North East Says No team won the referendum with a mix of eye-catching stunts - including an inflatable white elephant - and snappy slogans that tapped into the growing anti-politics mood among the public.\nHe is then said to have retreated to his father's farm, in County Durham, where he spent his time reading science and history books in an effort to attain a better understanding of the world.\nHe re-emerged in 2007 as a special adviser to Michael Gove, who became education secretary in 2010 and turned out to be something of a kindred spirit. \nThe pair would rail against what they called \"the blob\" - the informal alliance of senior civil servants and teachers' unions that sought, in their opinion, to frustrate their attempts at reform. \nHe left of his own accord to set up a free school, having alienated a number of senior people in the education ministry and the Conservative Party.\nHe once described former Brexit Secretary David Davis as \"thick as mince\" and as \"lazy as a toad\" and irritated David Cameron, the then prime minister, who called him a \"career psychopath\". \nHis appointment as head of the Vote Leave campaign - dramatised in Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War - was seen as a risk worth taking by those putting the campaign together but he left a controversial legacy.\nVote Leave was found to have broken electoral law over spending limits by the Electoral Commission and Mr Cummings was held in contempt of Parliament for failing to respond to a summons to appear before and give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. \nLike most advisers, he shunned media interviews when he was in government, and his rare appearances before MPs were characterised by animosity on both sides.\nAll that has changed in recent weeks, but it would be a brave person who said he had now joined the ranks of the former Westminster insiders who make their living as pundits - a class he appears to view with as much disdain as he does his former colleagues in government."

      "text": "Not the prime minister, nor the health secretary, nor the government's top scientists, nor the Whitehall machine, nor even Mr Cummings himself, escaped the barbs today. \nThe hours of testimony gave a disturbing sense of an administration simply overwhelmed by the scale of the Covid crisis at the start of last year - scrambling, and failing to keep up on many fronts.\nIn one sense, given that the situation was unlike any other event in recent history, that was not surprising. \nWith the success of the vaccination programme, there is little sign that much of the public right now is in a strong mood to punish the prime minister for those early mistakes. \nBut the extent of the problems is now out there for all to see in gory and tragic Technicolor - the way the official plan woefully underestimated the scale of the problem, the prime minister's private hesitancy about accelerating to lockdown, Mr Cummings' claim about his offer to be injected live on TV by Chris Whitty, a bizarre script in a pandemic version of the Truman Show, the mistakes in testing policy, the decision to send patients back to care homes, the list goes on and on and on. \nIt confirms No 10's fiercest critics' most trenchant views of the prime minister. \nIt provides particularly tricky questions for the health secretary who he repeatedly said had misled the public - claims Matt Hancock's team rejected. \nChris Whitty and Patrick Vallance are also likely to be asked, when they next appear in front of a microphone, did they, as the former aide suggested, argue with him for a short sharp lockdown in the autumn?  \nBut the testimony also showed that Mr Cummings himself had only told the partial truth about his own journey out of lockdown. \nHis bizarre press conference all those months ago in the Rose Garden was not \"the truth, and nothing but the truth\", as today he cited security concerns about his family, rather than just his wife falling ill. \nIt is the first time that one of those involved in making the decisions during those risky months has admitted in public that so many mistakes were made. \nIt is the first time that some of Boris Johnson's most controversial alleged comments about Covid have been put on the record, despite the prime minister's denial. \nAnd it is the first time, most importantly perhaps, that someone who wielded significant power has said publicly that tens of thousands of people lost their lives in this country unnecessarily. \nImagine what that must have felt like for a bereaved family, or care home staff to hear. \nMinisters right now refer to the public inquiry that won't get under way until next year. \nBut at some point, that is a claim they will have to answer in full. \nThe relationship between Mr Cummings and Mr Johnson is bitter, and broken. \nThe former adviser's suggestion now, that the prime minister is not fit for office, is both extraordinary but not, in fact, surprising given how toxic it became. \nAnd remember, Mr Cummings' own reputation is not stain free. \nHe had a reputation for picking a fight in an empty room, as hated by some in Westminster as he was loyally followed by a tight tribe. \nAnd today, he displayed precisely why some of the prime minister's old allies were appalled that he hired him in the first place. \nTheir fear back then? Mr Cummings' desire to wield influence would trump loyalty every time. \nLastly, looking back, how does the former adviser himself justify helping put Mr Johnson into No 10 when he quite clearly believed he was flawed? \nIn the short term, the government is unlikely to do anything other than brush off the claims. \nBut whatever the true balance of Dominic Cummings' motivations, the multiple very public accusations of failure can't be dismissed out of hand.

      "tags": "Patrick Harvie,Scottish Parliament election 2021,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Greens,Lorna Slater",
      "text": "First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been discussing a formal co-operation agreement with the Scottish Greens. \nShe told MSPs that the SNP and the Greens were exploring different policy areas where they could work together. \nInformal talks had begun after the election, she said, and these would now become structured talks with a view to agreeing a formal arrangement. \nAlthough a full coalition deal is not likely, Ms Sturgeon said ministerial jobs for Green MSPs was a possibility.\n\"Exactly what the content, extent and scope of any agreement will be is what the talks will focus on,\" she added.\nThe SNP won 64 seats in the Holyrood election - one short of a majority - and Ms Sturgeon would have a stable majority if she could also rely on the seven Scottish Green MSPs. \nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the parliament had to choose between spending the next term focused on delivering on voters' priorities or being \"distracted about independence\". \nAnd Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the Scottish government had to be more \"bold and ambitious\" in its plans for recovering from the pandemic, and that his party would work to be a \"credible alternative\" for voters. \nMs Sturgeon said she has had \"a series of exploratory discussions\" with the pro-independence Greens since the election,  and that these informal discussions would now become \"structured talks\", supported by the civil service, with a view to reaching a formal cooperation agreement. \nThe talks are expected to conclude before the next parliamentary recess, which is in a month's time. \nThe first minister said the two parties would discuss specific policy areas where they could cooperate, including the climate emergency and how Scotland could accelerate its progress towards net zero. \nShe added: \"As we embark on this process, we are setting no limits on our ambition.\n\"So in that vein let me be clear that while this is not a guaranteed or pre-agreed outcome, it is not inconceivable that a cooperation agreement could lead in future to a Green minister or ministers being part of this government.\n\"The key point for today is that we are both agreeing to come out of our comfort zones to find new ways of working for the common good\".\nScottish Greens' co-leader Patrick Harvie said that Green parties across Europe and in countries such as New Zealand had \"rolled up their sleeves and worked with other parties to deliver a better future\".\nThis showed that \"there is more than one way for government and opposition parties to work together, without losing the ability to challenge one another,\" he said. \nMr Harvie added: \"We believe the people of Scotland want to see grown-up politics like this, and will approach the forthcoming talks in this spirit.\" \nDouglas Ross said there were some areas where parties across the chamber could agree and work constructively. \nBut he added: \"Ultimately, as always, this comes down to independence for the SNP\". \nThe Scottish Conservative leader added that the parliament had to choose between \"wasting\" another five years on independence or using its existing powers to \"get things done\".\nAnd Mr Sarwar, Scottish Labour's leader, said he was willing to work with anyone in the national interest or on the issues they agreed on.  \nBut, Mr Sarwar said, a \"bold and ambitious opposition and a credible alternative\" was needed, and called for the Scottish government to be more \"bold and ambitious\" in its plans for recovering from the pandemic. \nThis is not a done deal yet but both sides clearly think a formal cooperation agreement is possible. \nWeeks of hard bargaining lie ahead as the two sides prepare to enter formal talks. \nThe SNP will want to maximise the range of areas where they are guaranteed Green support in parliament. \nIn exchange, the Greens will want to push Nicola Sturgeon to go further and faster in key policy areas like tackling climate change. \nWith 64 SNP votes and seven from the Greens a cooperation agreement between the two parties would give the Scottish government a very comfortable majority. \nThat would protect them from ambush in confidence votes, at budget time and when passing other key pieces of legislation. \nIt would also underline the majority that exists at Holyrood for another independence referendum. \nBut if they stop short of a full coalition, there would be areas where the Greens could still vote against the government it otherwise supports. \nThe talks emerged shortly before Ms Sturgeon set out her government's plans for its first 100 days in office.\nShe told MSPs that recovering from the Covid pandemic would be the immediate priority. \nOver the next three weeks, the first minister said, the government would set out its expectations for how the Covid restrictions levels system would be wound down after the pandemic, allowing a return to \"a much greater degree of normality\". \nTackling climate change was another priority, she said, and the first minister also outlined policies to tackle child poverty and inequality. \nAnd she said legislation to create a national care service will be introduced in the next 12 months, with a view to having the service operational by the end of this parliament.\n\"This will be, in my view, the most important public sector innovation since the establishment of the National Health Service,\" she said. \nMs Sturgeon also repeated her pledge to hold an independence referendum once the pandemic is over. \nShe said the election result had delivered a \"substantial majority\" in parliament for an independence referendum within the current parliamentary term, adding that there could be no justification for the UK government seeking to block that mandate.

      "text": "Former adviser Dominic Cummings is to be questioned by MPs about the government's response to the pandemic.\nMr Cummings, who left Downing Street last autumn, has been highly critical of the government in recent weeks.\nHe is also expected to claim later that Boris Johnson was keen to visit the Queen in person five days before the first Covid lockdown began.\nDowning Street has denied this happened and said their conversation on 18 March last year took place on the telephone.\nThe Queen went from Buckingham Palace to Windsor Castle shortly afterwards.\nThis happened in order to protect the then 93-year-old monarch from the danger of catching coronavirus.\nMr Cummings will appear before a joint parliamentary committee looking into the handling of the pandemic.\nHe has already claimed that \"secrecy\" within Whitehall \"contributed greatly to the catastrophe\".\nAhead of his meeting, Mr Cummings tweeted a picture which he called the \"first sketch of Plan B, PM study, Fri 13/3 eve - shown PM Sat 14/4\".\nIt appears to show a whiteboard with sketches from attendees at the meeting. Mr Cummings promised to reveal further details later.\nThe questioning of Mr Cummings will take place at a joint session of Parliament's health and social care and the science and technology select committees.\nMr Cummings - who gave evidence to one committee in March - will be grilled by MPs at 09:30 BST for around four hours, with live coverage taking place on the BBC News website.\nQuestions are expected to cover a range of topics including decision-making in the early months, the timings of lockdowns and other restrictions and the procurement processes. \nIt is likely that Mr Cummings will also face questions about his controversial trip to Barnard Castle during the first lockdown in 2020, when he said he wanted to check his eyesight before driving back to London. \nLast week, he tweeted the government's pandemic plan had been \"part disaster, part non-existent\" and he called for more scrutiny of policy to ensure the Indian variant is dealt with.\nAnd in March, he described the department of health as a \"smoking ruin in terms of procurement and PPE (personal protective equipment)\" at the start of the pandemic. \nAhead of Mr Cummings's committee appearance, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he would \"leave others to judge how reliable a witness that former adviser happens to be\".\n\"I think most people will have come to their own conclusions a long time ago about [this] particular adviser and the reliability of statements and the rest of it,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\"There was no manual to deal with a pandemic - and it's easy to be captain of hindsight on these things but we had to work on things day by day,\" he added. \nDominic Cummings was in the room when decisions about lives and deaths were made during the Covid emergency. \nHe's made no secret of his frustration now, at the speed of decision-making when the virus had arrived in the UK, blasting the level of preparations and the government's original plan. \nThe former adviser's real fire today is expected to be turned on the prime minister's attitude to bringing back restrictions in September when Covid was again taking hold, but No 10 did not act until later on. \nIt is understood he will share his belief that the failure to toughen the rules led to a much bigger outbreak of the disease. \nAnd he will suggest that was Boris Johnson's terrible mistake because the government by then had a much better understanding of the virus, could have predicted what would happen and could have prevented much of it. \nYet Mr Cummings cannot extricate himself from what went wrong. \nFew others had more influence over the decisions that were made.\nRead more from Laura.\nMore than 127,000 people diagnosed with coronavirus have died in the UK since the start of the pandemic, but 72% of the adult population has had one vaccine jab and 44% have had two doses. \nAccording to the government's \"roadmap\", the remaining restrictions on social contact in England are set to end on 21 June.\nThe government says it was always guided by the \"best scientific data\".\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"There is a huge task for this government to get on with.\n\"We are entirely focused on recovering from the pandemic, moving through the roadmap and distributing vaccines while delivering on the public's priorities.\n\"Throughout this pandemic, the government's priority has been to save lives, protect the NHS and support people's jobs and livelihoods across the United Kingdom.\"\nThis session is not part of a proposed independent public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic, which the prime minister says will be held in spring 2022."

      "text": "France has become the latest European country to introduce restrictions on UK tourists due to the spread of the Indian coronavirus variant.\nThe French government has announced that from 31 May only essential travel from the UK will be allowed. A week's self-isolation is also required.\nGermany imposed a two-week quarantine on UK arrivals last week. Austria has banned direct UK flights from 1 June.\nBy last week, the UK had recorded 3,424 cases of the B.1.617.2 variant.\nThat number had risen by 2,111 cases from the previous week.\nEngland's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has said the Indian variant is \"more transmittable\" than the UK variant first identified in Kent, which was responsible for the UK's deadly wave of coronavirus infections this winter. \n\"We expect, over time, this variant to overtake and come to dominate in the UK,\" he said.\nHowever, a study earlier this week found that two injections of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines offered a similar level of protection against symptomatic disease from the Indian variant as from the Kent one. But protection after a first dose was lower in the Indian variant compared with the Kent variant, with 33% and 50% effectiveness respectively.\nFrance, Germany and Austria are all on England's \"amber\" list, meaning that the government advises against travel there and passengers must quarantine upon return.\nHowever, France had planned to allow fully vaccinated travellers from the UK - or those who had tested negative - to visit from 9 June, when travel restrictions around the EU are set to be eased. The decision to allow only essential travel, for example for bereavement or childcare, from 31 May is a setback to anyone in the UK who had planned to go on holiday in France. \nUK travellers to France are already required to self-isolate in a designated hotel for seven days, but tighter quarantine restrictions, such as proof of quarantine location and possible police checks, will not be imposed.\nSpain, another amber country, has already reopened to UK tourists.\nLast week, the EU agreed on a pass to allow travel across the bloc's 27 countries for all those who have been fully vaccinated with an approved vaccine, recently tested negative or recovered from an infection. It is expected to launch by July."

He left a huge imprint on everyone who knew him and will be greatly missed.\"\nMs Innes wrote in a post on Facebook: \"Bill will be remembered for many things, including a taste for mischief.\"\nShe said he had always been proud to be from Coventry and had served as a governor at Allesley Primary and Coundon Court schools.\nWest Midlands Labour group said on Twitter: \"Bill made global headlines as [the first] man to have Covid vaccine.\n\"His decades of service to the party were recently recognised by Keir Starmer.\n\"Our thoughts are with Joy and Bill's family and friends.\"\nCouncillor Angela Hopkins said Mr Shakespeare had helped her when she had campaigned for the Bablake ward.\n\"He was very thoughtful and always, in his work as a parish councillor, very much putting forward the concerns and views of the local residents in his area,\" she said.  \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "An international charity working to prevent children being trafficked from Afghanistan says a delay to promised UK government funding is \"devastating\".\nThe government had agreed to pay War Child \u00a3500,000 from July this year in a much-publicised donation match scheme. \nBut they now say they will not pay out the money until April 2022. \nActress Carey Mulligan, a patron of War Child, said the \"damaging decision\" needed reversing - but the government said it had to take \"tough\" decisions.\n\"The children at risk of abuse and exploitation need our support now not next year,\" the star of the Great Gatsby and Promising Young Woman told BBC Two's Newsnight.\nThe government must \"keep their word to the public who donated so generously in such a challenging year, and most importantly the children we all committed to helping\", she added.\nUK Aid Match is a government scheme which is designed to allow the British public have a say in how UK aid is spent overseas, whilst helping the poorest people in developing countries.\nFor every \u00a31 donated to a UK Aid Match charity appeal, the UK government will also contribute \u00a31 of UK aid, up to \u00a32 million.\nLast year War Child launched an urgent appeal in Afghanistan, which it said would have reached 3,430 children and their families.\nThey raised \u00a3500,000 from the public and the additional funding from the government was due to be used to reunite children with their families and build two multipurpose support centres in the local community to provide training, help children return to formal education.\nWar Child chief executive Rob Williams told Newsnight: \"A delay of a year is a disaster and it is a major breach of faith because all those people who raised money in response to the government's promise that they would match the money have basically been let down.\"\n\"Whilst the government might think a delay of a year is a reasonable proposition, the project means that we won't be able to stop about three thousand children being trafficked into Iran over the next 12 months or so,\" he added.\nGovernment sources told Newsnight that all affected charities have been given cast iron guarantees that they will receive the money next year.\nNewsnight's Political Editor Nick Watt said that, in Whitehall, that is seen as significant in light of what is described as difficult spending decisions.\nWar Child works to help the thousands of Afghan children, some as young as eight, who every year are forced to leave their families in search of work. After decades of war in the country, many families have little financial security and parents stay at home to care for the youngest in their families.\nChildren cross the border to Iran on dangerous journeys to find work to support their families and are left vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.\nIn a statement, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: \"The seismic impact of the pandemic on the UK economy has forced us to take tough but necessary decisions, including temporarily reducing the overall amount we spend on aid. \n\"We will still spend more than \u00a310 billion this year to and improve global health, fight poverty and tackle climate change.\n\"We have protected War Child's UK Aid Match funding because we value their work and the results they will deliver. \n\"All UK Aid Match commitments will be protected, as set out in the foreign secretary's written ministerial statement. In some cases there will be a delay in releasing the guaranteed funding\".\nFollowing the economic shock of the coronavirus crisis, the chancellor last November cut the UK foreign aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of total national income - a reduction of around \u00a34bn.\nRishi Sunak said the government had to make \"tough choices\". Even with the reduction UK is still be the second-highest aid donor in the G7 group of major economies.\nBBC Newsnight is on BBC Two at 22:45 BST."

      "tags": "Physics,Nuclear fusion ,Climate change,Engineering,Renewable energy",
      "text": "Initial results from a UK experiment could help clear a hurdle to achieving commercial power based on nuclear fusion, experts say.\nThe researchers believe they now have a better way to remove the excess heat produced by fusion reactions.\nThis intense heat can melt materials used inside a reactor, limiting the amount of time it can operate for.\nThe system, which has been likened to a car exhaust, resulted in a tenfold reduction in the heat.\nThe tests were carried out at the Mast (Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak) Upgrade nuclear fusion experiment at Culham in Oxfordshire. The \u00a355m device began operating in October last year, after a seven-year build.\nNuclear fusion is an attempt to replicate the processes that power the Sun - and other stars - here on planet Earth.\nBut the trick is getting more energy out of the reactions than you put in. This goal continues to elude teams of scientists and engineers around the world, who are working to make fusion power a reality.\nExisting nuclear energy relies on a process called fission, where a heavy chemical element is split to produce lighter ones. Fusion works by combining two light elements to make a heavier one. \nOne common fusion approach uses a reactor design called a tokamak, in which powerful magnetic fields are used to control charged gas - or plasma - inside a doughnut-shaped container.\nAn international fusion megaproject called Iter is currently under construction in southern France. Prof Ian Chapman, chief executive of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), said it would be crucial for demonstrating the feasibility of bringing fusion power to the grid. \nBut he added that Iter's size and cost meant that \"if every time you wanted to build a unit, you had to raise that sum of money, then the penetration into the market would be determined by economics, not technology\". \nMast Upgrade is one attempt to come up with a template for more compact, cheaper fusion reactors. It makes use of an innovative design known as a spherical tokamak to squeeze the fuel into a 4.4m-tall, 4m-wide space. By comparison, the containment vessel Iter will use to control its fusion reactions is 11.4m tall and 19.4m wide.\nBut Mast Upgrade's bijou dimensions come at a price: \"You're making something that's hotter than the Sun... in a smaller volume. How you then get the heat out becomes a big challenge,\" said Prof Chapman.\nThe core of the plasma within the tokamak reaches temperatures of 100 million C. Without an exhaust system that can handle this unimaginable heat, materials in the design would have to be regularly replaced - significantly affecting the amount of time a power plant could operate for.\nThe new exhaust system being trialled at Culham is known as a Super-X divertor. This would allow components in future commercial tokamaks to last for much longer; greatly increasing the power plant's availability, improving its economic viability and reducing the cost of fusion electricity.\nTests at Mast Upgrade have shown at least a tenfold reduction in the heat on materials with the Super-X system.\nResearchers said the results were a \"game-changer\" for the promise of fusion power plants that could provide affordable, efficient electricity. Against the background of climate change, fusion could offer a clean and virtually limitless source of energy.\nDr Andrew Kirk, lead scientist on Mast Upgrade, said the results were \"the moment our team at UKAEA has been working towards for almost a decade\".\n\"We built Mast Upgrade to solve the exhaust problem for compact fusion power plants, and the signs are that we've succeeded.\n\"Super-X reduces the heat on the exhaust system from a blowtorch level down to more like you'd find in a car engine. This could mean it would only have to be replaced once during the lifetime of a power plant.\"\nThe success of the exhaust system for Mast Upgrade delivers a boost to plans for a prototype fusion power plant in the UK called Step. It is expected to come online sometime in the 2040s.\nThe Mast Upgrade facility will have its official opening ceremony on Wednesday, where guest of honour, astronaut Tim Peake, will create his own artificial star by running a plasma test on the machine.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "text": "China has overtaken Germany to become the UK's biggest single import market for the first time since records began.\nGoods imported from China rose 66% from the start of 2018 to \u00a316.9bn ($24bn) in the first quarter of this year, the Office for National Statistics said.\nImports from Germany fell by a quarter to \u00a312.5bn in the same period.\nThe change came as trade with the European Union was disrupted by Brexit and the pandemic boosted demand for Chinese goods.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) report aimed to assess the impacts of Brexit and the coronavirus on the UK's trade in goods.\nIt found evidence that trade had been disrupted at the start of the new relationship between the UK and the EU.\nThe ONS said German imports to the UK had fallen since April 2019, amid uncertainty over the details of Britain's exit from the EU.\nGermany's motor industry also felt the impact of the pandemic as both vehicle production and global exports were hit.\nIn the UK, demand for new vehicles slumped as car showrooms were shut due to lockdown measures.\nExports of goods to Ireland saw the greatest proportionate fall of the UK's top five exporting partners after the EU transition period, the ONS said.\nSince modern records began in 1997, Germany had been the UK's biggest source of imports, except for a six month period at the end of 2000 and the start of the following year when the US briefly took the top spot.\nDespite a 23.1% fall in total trade with European Union countries as a whole in the period, the EU remains the UK's biggest trading partner, the report found.\nThe figures also showed there was a jump in imports from China of textiles used for face masks and other personal protective equipment, as well as stronger demand for electrical devices.\nChina was the only major economy to see its global trade grow last year as it became the first big country to emerge from the pandemic."

      "text": "Brussels must show common sense and take a pragmatic approach to the NI Protocol, the UK government has said. \nIt said it was disappointed that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was not fully recognising the effects of the protocol.\nIt is the part of the Brexit deal that puts a trade border in the Irish Sea.\nMs von der Leyen said on Monday that there was no alternative but the \"full and correct implementation\" of the protocol.\nThe UK government said its priority was the Good Friday Agreement, while the European Union was focussed on the single market.\nTechnical talks to simplify the operation of the protocol are ongoing.\nThe protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports - but it is strongly opposed to the protocol among unionists, who see it as separating Northern Ireland from the UK. \nIt was agreed by the United Kingdom and European Union in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020.\nHowever, in recent weeks the UK government's rhetoric against the protocol has hardened.\nEarlier this month the UK's Brexit minister said it was hard to see how the current operation of the protocol was sustainable.\nThe UK was committed to working with the EU, but there needed to be a \"pragmatic, risk-based approach\" to challenges over the protocol, said a government spokesman. \n\"The protocol relies on the support of all communities in Northern Ireland so it is disappointing that there was not more recognition from the commission president of the impact that the current operation of the protocol is having in Northern Ireland,\" said the spokesman.\n\"While the EU prioritise protection of the single market and treat the regulatory boundary as if it were like any other external EU border, our focus remains on protecting the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all its dimensions.\"\nSpeaking in Brussels on Monday night, Mrs Von der Leyen said the protocol was the \"only possible solution to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland while protecting the integrity of the EU single market\".\nShe added that any problems flowed from Brexit rather than the protocol, but the UK and EU had \"a common duty to do whatever we can to reduce tensions in Northern Ireland\".\nShe said the current technical talks were exploring practical solutions to help minimise disruption to everyday life in Northern Ireland.\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader-designate Edwin Poots said that costs for businesses in Northern Ireland of the protocol would \"spiral\" as 15,000 checks will ultimately have to be made every week on goods.\n\"This protocol will hurt every single individual in Northern Ireland,\" Mr Poots told the Stormont Assembly on Tuesday.\n\"I will continue to press hard with the UK government the issues that are at stake here. The case is unarguable that this protocol is bad for Northern Ireland.\"\nDUP MPs Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gavin Robinson, along with Lord Dodds, met the Brexit minister on Tuesday.\nThe trio told Lord Frost the protocol should be replaced, with Sir Jeffrey saying their message was \"clear and unambiguous\".\n\"The protocol has no support from any shade or quarter of unionism. Its imposition without the consent of both traditions in Northern Ireland and overriding of cross-community voting safeguards has seriously undermined support for devolution,\" Sir Jeffrey added.\nOutgoing First Minister Arlene Foster accused the EU of having a \"tin ear\" to concerns about the protocol. \n\"It is hugely disappointing, in spite of everything that has happened, the fact that we are talking about cancer drugs being prevented from coming into Northern Ireland,\" she said.\n\"The fact that there are more checks from Great Britain into Northern Ireland than there are in Rotterdam; that still the European Union and the European Commission have had a tin ear to the concerns and the absolutely genuine concerns of the people in Northern Ireland.\"\nOutgoing UUP leader Steve Aiken said Ms von der Leyen's remarks were \"tone deaf\", and urged her to engage with his party, \"the party that helped write and implement the Good Friday Agreement\". \nHe said: \"She is at best badly informed, or at worst, is wilfully misrepresenting the impact of the EU's failure to come to an acceptable agreement with the UK, and the people of Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, we are all stuck in the middle. \n\"Northern Ireland is being used as a bargaining chip between Brussels and London.\"\nBut Ms von der Leyen's comments were welcomed by Sinn F\u00e9in MP Chris Hazzard, who said Northern Ireland businesses wanted \"the protections the protocol provides\". \n\"It's time the British government stopped the charades and implement what it has already agreed,\" he said.\n\"We also need to see the economy minister in the north using the unique situation the protocol affords the north to attract investment and jobs.\" \nDuring Brexit negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority.\nIt meant keeping the land border between the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) and Northern Ireland (in the UK) open and avoiding new infrastructure like cameras and border posts. That was easy when the whole island of Ireland was part of the EU.\nBut after Brexit, a new arrangement was needed because the EU requires certain goods to be inspected at the point of entry into its single market.\nSo, the EU and the UK negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which came into force on 1 January 2021.\nThe Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) said Mrs Von der Leyen's comments \"showed how little she cares about peace and stability in Northern Ireland\". \nThe LCC was set up in 2015 to represent a range of individuals and views from the wider Protestant, unionist and loyalist communities.\nLoyalist paramilitary groups like the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association are also represented on it.\nLCC Chairman David Campbell said: \"I would appeal to her to start listening and to recognise that the imposition of the protocol on the people of Northern Ireland without their involvement or consent is unsustainable and actually contrary to many of the key founding tenets of the European Union.\"\nWhen Ursula von der Leyen talks about practical solutions, she is alluding to the technical negotiations which are happening right now between EU and UK officials. \nOfficials are crunching through about 30 different issues relating to the protocol -  everything from pet travel to VAT on second-hand cars to steel tariffs to medicines and the movement of plants. \nThey're working through those to see what can ease the implementation of the protocol on the ground. \nBut the difficulty is a dramatic shift is not going to happen at a technical level. \nIt's something where there needs to be a political commitment and, at the moment, there is no sign of the EU or the UK being prepared to make that big political compromise. \nLast week, an LCC member told MPs violence could not be ruled out if the protocol remained. \nThe organisation also met Lord Frost to discuss the protocol earlier this month.\nRioting erupted in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in April - with tensions around the protocol partly blamed.\nSince then, there has been a switch to demonstrations largely in the form of loyalist band parades and marches.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland is currently investigating about 303 unlawful parades against the protocol. \nMeanwhile, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has said she has sought legal advice over the DUP's absence at north-south meetings.\nThe DUP is boycotting some North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings due to its opposition to the protocol.\nMs Mallon told the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday that ministers are legally obliged to attend.\nEarlier this month, Agriculture Minister and DUP leader-designate Edwin Poots was criticised for preventing another north-south ministerial meeting from taking place."

      "text": "Housing charity Shelter has called on the government to build 90,000 good-quality social homes a year.\nIt commissioned a survey which suggested that around a third of adults do not have safe or secure homes, based on criteria including whether the accommodation had enough bedrooms, was mouldy or structurally unsound.\nShelter calls it a \"housing emergency\".\nThe UK government said it is spending \u00a312bn over the next five years on affordable housing.\nAnd the Welsh government said it had invested \u00a32bn over the last Senedd term to exceed its target to deliver 20,000 affordable homes.\nThe Scottish government said Scotland had \"led the way across the UK with almost 100,000 affordable homes delivered since 2007 and we are committed to delivery of a further 100,000 by 2032\".\nOver the course of a week last month, Shelter, via polling organisation YouGov, asked 13,000 people about their home and housing experiences and combined the results with government data on homelessness to calculate that 34% of adults in Britain did not have safe or secure homes.\nPeople were defined as being affected if they agreed with at least one of the following statements:\nShelter said black people were 70% more likely to be affected by housing issues or homelessness than white people, while Asian people were 50% more likely.\nIts survey also suggested that more than half (54%) of people with a significant disability did not have a safe or secure home, compared with 30% of people without a disability.\nAnd nearly two-thirds (65%) of single mothers did not have a safe or secure home under the criteria, it said.\nThe charity also found that 23% of the people it surveyed were living in homes with significant damp, mould and condensation, or cannot keep warm in winter, while one in 12 reported that they were regularly cutting back on essential items to pay their housing costs.\nShelter chief executive Polly Neate said: \"Decades of neglect have left Britain's housing system on its knees. \n\"A safe home is everything, yet millions don't have one. \n\"Lives are being ruined by benefit cuts, blatant discrimination and the total failure to build social homes.\"\nA Ministry of Housing statement said it was \"unacceptable for people to live in unsafe accommodation\" and said the government had given councils stronger tools to crack down on rogue landlords as well as announcing reforms to support tenants, including its charter for social housing residents\".\nThey added it was providing \u00a3750m this year to help tackle homelessness and rough sleeping.\nLabour's shadow housing secretary Lucy Powell said Shelter's report came as no surprise \"after a decade of neglect and failure by ministers on housing\". \nShe said the Covid pandemic had shown \"deep inequalities in our housing system\", with those in insecure, overcrowded homes more at risk of the health and economic impacts of the crisis.\nA Welsh government statement said legislation on tenancy laws, due to come into force around spring next year, would require landlords to ensure the properties they rent are \"fit for human habitation, tackling the poor conditions in some rented properties\".\n\"We are now looking to build a further 20,000 new, low carbon social homes and will be announcing further details shortly,\" they said.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said it would carry out an audit of its housing and homelessness legislation to ensure it met the needs of everyone and said its Housing to 2040 report outlined its long-term housing strategy.\nIn a statement the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland said communities minister Deirdre Hargey had begun the \"biggest reform of social housing in over 50 years\", which included building more homes with 2,403 social housing starts in 2020/21 - the highest annual figure for more than a decade."

      "tags": "Belarus,Alexander Lukashenko",
      "text": "The families of a dissident journalist and his girlfriend, held after a plane was diverted to Belarus, have spoken of their concern for their safety.\nRoman Protasevich and his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega are now in detention.\n\"I'm calling on the whole international community to save him,\" said his mother Natalia Protasevich.\nA video of Ms Sapega was released on Tuesday as authorities said they would hold her for at least two months.\nIn the video, Ms Sapega says she edits a Telegram channel which publishes personal information of Belarusian policemen.\nHowever, it is likely she is speaking under duress.\nMs Sapega and Mr Protasevich were detained on Sunday, when a plane flying from Athens to Vilnius, in neighbouring Lithuania, was diverted to land in Minsk, the Belarusian capital.\nWestern countries accuse Belarus of hijacking the Ryanair plane that was rerouted over a supposed bomb threat. \nSeveral European airlines have said that they will not fly over Belarus as a result.\n\"Today Sofia was interrogated. She was accused of committing a criminal offence. A preventive measure was chosen - detention for a period of two months,\" her lawyer, Alexander Filanovich, told the BBC's Russian service on Tuesday. \nMs Sapega is now in a KGB pre-trial detention centre in the Belarusian capital, he said.\nIn the video, Ms Sapega states that she is the editor of the Black Book of Belarus Telegram channel, which publishes the personal data of the country's security forces.\nBut Ms Sapega's mother cast doubt on how freely her daughter is speaking in the video, released by a pro-government Telegram channel.\n\"Even my friends called me and said ... this is an unusual manner for her,\" she told the BBC. \"She sways, eyes in the sky - as if afraid of forgetting something.\" \n\"I enlarged [the video] as much as possible - it seems that [she looks] okay. We are now packing warm clothes, we will go to Minsk. I want to try to give her a parcel - I saw she only had a thin jacket.\" \nIt comes after Belarus authorities on Monday released video of Mr Protasevich that appears to have been recorded under duress.\nThe 26-year-old faces charges related to his reporting of last August's disputed election and subsequent crackdown on mass opposition protests, and has said he fears the death penalty after being placed on a terrorism list.\nThe BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports from Minsk\nTo a casual observer, Minsk seems relaxed. On Tuesday evening, there were teenagers with guitars on the embankment, young rappers practising on a city square and no hint of the political turmoil that swept this country after last summer's disputed presidential election. \nBut behind closed doors, people say the audacious arrest of Roman Protasevich has only shown the outside world the reality and the risk that opposition activists inside Belarus have been living with. \nJust on Tuesday, another seven activists were handed long prison sentences. Last week, the country's best-known independent news website was taken offline, with multiple arrests for supposed financial irregularities. Since the protests were crushed, bloggers and businesspeople, politicians and protesters have all ended up behind bars and no-one knows who might be next. That's why many who would once have spoken freely here are now nervous. They prefer to lie low and keep quiet, just in case. \nBelarus is the only European country that still executes prisoners.\nMr Protasevich's mother Natalia told the AFP news agency that she had not slept since her son's arrest.\n\"I'm asking, I'm begging, I'm calling on the whole international community to save him,\" she said, breaking down in tears during an interview in Wroclaw, southern Poland.\n\"He's only one journalist, he's only one child but please, please... I am begging for help. Please save him! They're going to kill him in there!\"\nShe added that her son is a \"fighter for justice\".\n\"They sent a fighter jet to get this young man! It's an act of terrorism, I don't think you can call it anything else. He's been taken hostage. This is an act of pure revenge!\" she said.\nHer voice breaking, she added: \"My son, this young man just wanted to tell the truth about the situation. He didn't do anything wrong.\"\nBelarus sent a fighter jet to force Ryanair flight FR4978 - which had departed from the Greek capital, Athens, and was bound for Vilnius in Lithuania - to land, claiming there was a bomb threat. It touched down in the capital Minsk at 13:16 local time (10:16 GMT) on Sunday.\nPolice then took Mr Protasevich away when the plane's 126 passengers disembarked. The activist, who witnesses said was \"super scared\", was arrested along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega.\nOn Tuesday, the Belarusian transport ministry released a transcript of a conversation said to be between an air traffic controller in Minsk and a pilot on Sunday's Ryanair flight.\nAccording to the transcript, which has not been independently verified, Belarus suggested several times that the plane should land in Minsk on \"our recommendation\".\nThis appeared to contradict earlier statements from the Belarusian authorities that said the decision to land was made independently by the pilot.\nAt a meeting in Brussels on Monday, the leaders of the 27 European Union member states called for the overflight ban, and promised further economic sanctions.\nWhere is Belarus? It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.\nWhy does it matter? Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed \"Europe's last dictator\" - he has been in power for 27 years.\nWhat's going on there? There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile."

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),China,Wuhan,United States,Coronavirus pandemic,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has ordered intelligence officials to \"redouble\" efforts to investigate the origins of Covid-19, including the theory that it came from a laboratory in China. \nHe said the US intelligence community was split on whether it came from a lab accident or emerged from human contact with an infected animal.\nMr Biden asked the groups to report back to him within 90 days. \nChina has rejected the laboratory theory. \n\"Smear campaigns and blame shifting are making a comeback, and the conspiracy theory of 'lab leak' is resurfacing,\" its embassy in the US said in a statement on Thursday.\nSince it was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, more than 168 million cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed worldwide and at least 3.5 million deaths reported. \nAuthorities linked early Covid cases to a seafood market in Wuhan, leading scientists to theorise the virus first passed to humans from animals. \nBut recent US media reports have suggested growing evidence the virus could instead have emerged from a laboratory in China, perhaps through an accidental leak. \nIn what passes for relative transparency in the US government, the Biden administration has conceded the American intelligence community is split on Covid-19's origins - it could be the lab or animal-to-human contact - and no-one is near certain about it.\nThat marks a big shift from the derision heaped on the lab theory by many in the media and politics last year, when Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Senator Tom Cotton and others floated the idea.\nMr Trump and Mr Pompeo didn't help the situation, however, as they were coy about the grounds for their suspicion. And their theories floating alongside more far-fetched ones, such as that the disease was manufactured as a bioweapon in a Chinese lab. That possibility still seems highly unlikely.\nThe public may never know the full truth about the virus' origins, particularly if China continues to be uncooperative. Mr Biden is pledging a full investigation, however, and if the US finds conclusive evidence of a lab leak, it will mean more than just a few prominent figures having to eat crow and re-evaluate their trust in authoritative \"conclusions\". It could place very real strain on US-China relations for years to come.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, President Biden said he had asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office, \"including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident\".\nOn receiving it this month, he asked for \"additional follow-up\".\nMr Biden said the majority of the intelligence community had \"coalesced\" around those two scenarios, but \"do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other\".\nThe president has now asked agencies to \"redouble their efforts to collect and analyse information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion\".\nHe concluded by saying the US would \"keep working with like-minded partners around the world to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation\". \nBeijing has previously suggested Covid-19 could have come from a US laboratory instead.\nIn its statement, the Chinese embassy said it supported a full investigation into \"some secretive bases and biological laboratories all over the world\". \nA spokesman for China's foreign ministry on Thursday hit out at the \"dark history\" of the US intelligence community, and said the Biden administration's \"motive and purposes\" were clear.\nMr Biden's statement came as CNN reported that the president's administration this spring shut down a state department investigation into whether the virus could have leaked from a Wuhan lab, deeming the probe an ineffective use of resources.\nSpeculation about the Wuhan Institute of Virology - one of China's top virus research labs - began last year and was propagated by former US President Donald Trump.\nIn April 2020, US State Department cables came to light that showed embassy officials were worried about biosecurity at the lab. \nThe leak allegations were widely dismissed as a fringe conspiracy theory.\nEarlier this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a report written jointly with Chinese scientists on the origins of Covid-19 which said the chances of it having started in a lab were \"extremely unlikely\". \nIt said the virus had probably jumped from bats to humans via another intermediary animal, but more research was needed. \nHowever, questions have persisted and recent reports attributed to US intelligence sources say three members of the Wuhan Institute of Virology were admitted to hospital in November 2019, several weeks before China acknowledged the first case of the new disease in the community.\nAnthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, has maintained he believes the virus was passed from animals to humans, though he conceded this month he was no longer confident Covid-19 had developed naturally.\nMr Biden's statement came the day after Xavier Becerra, US secretary for health and human services, urged the WHO to ensure a \"transparent\" investigation into the virus's origins.\n\"Phase 2 of the Covid origins study must be launched with terms of reference that are transparent, science-based and give international experts the independence to fully assess the source of the virus and the early days of the outbreak,\" he said.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Trump sought to take credit in a statement to the New York Post. \"To me it was obvious from the beginning but I was badly criticised, as usual,\" he said. \"Now they are all saying: 'He was right.'\""

      "text": "House buyers are making offers on homes before viewing them in order to gain an edge in a \"mad\" housing market, estate agents and sellers have said.\nWales has seen the biggest house price growth in the UK, up by an average of 11% in the past year. \nMany estate agents claim some properties sell within hours, sometimes with dozens of offers on the table.\nBut the rapid sales have also left some sellers stuck as they have not had enough time to find new homes.\nMegan Davies, 32, a midwife and mother-of-two from Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, is hoping to find a family home with her partner. \nLast month demand for some properties in the town saw people queueing overnight outside an estate agents. \nMs Davies sold her house within hours of putting it on the market and her partner was made an offer on his property before any viewings. However the pair have now been unable to find anywhere to move on to.\n\"The properties that we've been to see, they're going for \u00a320,000 to \u00a330,000 over the asking price,\" Ms Davies told BBC Wales Live.\n\"There's so much competition out there at the moment and Aberdare is just mad, it's just gone mad.\n\"We've seen a house today that's gone live 15 minutes ago, we were told 'we've got no bookings left'.\n\"We've gone through agents, we've gone through social media, we've gone through the selling pages for houses, Rightmove etc.\n\"I'm at the point now where I think, do we do flyers in the estates that we want to live on? That's the point we're at. There's nothing around. It really does take over your life.\"\nRhiannon Williams, 30, said she had given up trying to buy her first home near Caerphilly after struggling for months with high asking prices.\n\"The first house viewing looked amazing on the photos, but when I viewed I wasn't sold by the property. The estate agent said someone had put an offer in on the house and hadn't viewed it,\" she said.\n\"I thought that was absolutely insane as the asking price was already the top end for that area.\n\"I had two viewings booked for this week, both have been cancelled as they have now been sold. \n\"It's a huge step to purchase your first home, I think the prices are so high at the moment and people are offering over the asking price too, so I don't stand a chance to get on the ladder.\"\nMel John, an estate agent in Caerphilly, said she had been hearing more stories of practices like \"gazumping\" - where a seller goes back on a verbal agreement and accepts a higher offer.\n\"I've walked away from a number of properties where the sellers would have encouraged gazumping, as an estate agent I wouldn't want to be any part of that,\" she said. \"I don't think it's ethical really for anybody to go down that route.\"\nMs John said the property market boom was great news for many, but she had sympathy for buyers who were frequently missing out.\n\"There's a lot of buyers out there,\" she said. \n\"When a property comes on the market we'll do a block booking of viewings on that property and whoever makes an offer, we'd be looking for their best and final offer. \n\"Of course it's not nice telling people that they can't buy the properties, that the seller has decided to go with someone else.\n\"It is really difficult and especially with young first-time buyers who can only afford a certain amount - which is more or less in the investors price range. \n\"They're desperate to get on the property ladder and they've got so much competition.\"\nIn north and west Wales the current housing market boom has re-energised debates around second homes.\nHowever James Skudder, the director of Country Living Estate Agents in Pembrokeshire, said the landscape among his clients had significantly shifted from second-home buyers, with many now moving over the border to make Wales their permanent home. \n\"Since Covid has hit, the market hasn't stopped,\" said Mr Skudder.\n\"I would say on a daily basis 95% of the enquires are from people outside of the area.\n\"Pembrokeshire has always had a pull with second-home buyers, whereas now people are relocating for their primary residence.\n\"What we're finding is if you've holidayed in an area for 20 or 30 years and now you're finding you can work from home - people are saying to each other 'look let's make the dream move we've always wanted to'.\n\"People are relocating themselves and they're relocating their businesses.\n\"They're now moving their businesses online because it's an easier way to live and it can bring happiness to the business and the family. \n\"People have just had an awakening to what's going on surrounding Covid and certainly this is what's helping push the pricing in the area, people being unhappy over working long hours and being stuck in the city. An area like this is being pushed through the roof.\"\nHe added: \"It's a crazy market, right the way from low end, right up to the premium market.\""

      "text": "Hundreds of women forced into giving up their babies for adoption in the 1950s, 60s and 70s have called on the prime minister to issue a government apology.\nUp to 250,000 women in Britain were coerced into handing over their babies because they were unmarried.\nMany of the women never had more children and say the loss caused them to lead a lifetime of grief.\nThey want the UK to follow Australia, which in 2013 was the first country to apologise for forced adoptions.\n\"It was the most shameful thing that could happen,\" says Jill Killington from Leeds. \nShe became pregnant in 1967, aged 16, and says being an unmarried mother \"was described as a fate worse than death\". \nShe recalls having to stay upstairs at her home to hide her growing tummy, so she was out of sight when anyone visited. \n\"My mother asked me to wear a wedding ring when I went out. It was a deeply humiliating time,\" she says. \nVeronica Smith became pregnant in 1965 while working as a nurse at a Butlin's Holiday Camp in Bognor Regis in West Sussex.  \nThe chilling reality of her situation hit home when she broke the news to her mother. \n\"My mother told me if my father found out it would kill him, so I never told him, ever.\"  \nInstead, Veronica was secretly sent to a mother and baby home in a part of London not far from her parents' house and she would meet up with her mother on Wimbledon railway station every Saturday. \n\"She would bring a blank airmail envelope and I would write a letter saying I was in Spain enjoying work and life. She would then take the letter home and show it to my father, who believed I was in Spain.\" \nLawyers examining the birth mothers' cases have focused on the period between 1945 and 1975 - before a change in adoption law - when around 500,000 babies were adopted in Britain, mostly from mothers who were under 24 and unmarried.\nTheir research suggests about half of those women faced sustained pressure to give up their babies from professionals, including doctors, midwives, workers in mother and baby homes and adoption staff in religious and council-run homes.\nAnn Keen was 17 when she became pregnant in 1966 and recalls a particularly cruel moment during the birth of her son. \n\"I wasn't given any pain relief,\" she says. \"The midwife said 'you'll remember this, so you won't be wicked again'.\" \nAnn says she wasn't even given the opportunity to say goodbye to her son. \n\"Eight days after giving birth, I went to the hospital nursery to see him and he wasn't there,\" she says. \n\"The midwife told me 'he's gone. He's in that room over there. They'll be happy and that's the last you'll see of him'.\"\nAnn says: \"It was coercion. The phrase they used was, 'This is for the best' and 'if you really love your baby, you should give him up'.\"\nFor Diana Defries, who was 16 when she became pregnant, it was a different kind of trauma. \nShe says the moment after she gave birth someone in the delivery room announced, \"this baby is flagged for adoption and I'll take her away\".\n\"I yelled to bring her back,\" says Diana. \"But the nurse then just walked past me and put my daughter on a table out of my reach. They all then left the room with just me and my crying baby. All I could croak was 'help me, please'.\n\"At that moment, I remember thinking, it would be better for me to die.\" \nDiana says: \"I do feel my social worker used coercion. The bullying wore me down\". \nTo enable an adoption, the women were supposed to sign consent forms. But some experts have doubts about the legality of some of the consent processes.\u202f \nSolicitor Carolynn Gallwey, who has acted for the birth mothers, says all of those she has spoken to said they had no choice but to sign the consent form.\nShe says there is also evidence to show some mothers' forms may have been signed by other people, such as their parents or even their GP.  \nOne document, shown to the BBC by a woman who didn't want to be named, suggests a judge in one of the adoption hearings questioned the authenticity of a signature. \nMs Gallwey said the women were also not told they were entitled to financial help or other kinds of support that might have meant they could have kept their children. \nMany of the adoptees who were given to new families in forced adoptions have also spoken of their shock at what happened to their birth mothers.\nSome of them say it has added to their own sense of loss.\nGaynor Weatherly, whose mother was 16 when she was born in 1963, says: \"It's like a piece of me has been missing. It can eat you up.\"\nGaynor says she has found happiness through her own marriage and children but that she feels \"cheated out of a different life\".\nSome of the adoptees were eventually reunited with their birth mothers, but it often took decades.\nRachel Langham, who was born to Veronica Smith, went to live in Canada after she was adopted.\nShe had a loving relationship with her adoptive parents, but says what happened to Veronica was \"inhumane\".\n\"I feel terrible empathy and sorrow for her and someone should apologise,\" Rachel says.\nIn her 40s, Rachel was reunited with Veronica. But building a relationship after so many years has been hard, and Veronica says these lifelong repercussions are one more reason why an apology is so essential.\nHundreds of women have now written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say they deserve one from the UK government, on behalf of the institutions and individuals who treated them so badly. \nBirth mothers in Australia received the world's first government apology in 2013 when Julia Gillard, the prime minister at the time, apologised to around 150,000 women whose babies were taken from them. \nAnd three years ago, the Canadian Senate recommended the federal government issue an apology to 300,000 Canadian women. \nIn January of this year, the Irish Taoiseach, Micheal Martin, apologised to former residents of mother and baby homes in Ireland for the way they were treated over several decades. \nThe women in Britain, most of whom are now in their 70s and 80s, say an apology would bring lasting comfort.\nAnn Keen, who went on to become an MP and junior minister, says: \"I did not give up my son or abandon him. An apology would clear my name and my son's name. An historical injustice is what happened. It's time to say sorry.\" \nIn a statement, Children and Families minister Vicky Ford said: \"I want to express my deepest sympathy to all those affected by historic forced adoption. We cannot undo the past, but we can be reassured that our legislation and practices have been significantly strengthened since then.\"\u202f \n\u202fThe 1975\u202fand 1989 Children Acts\u202fand the 1976 Adoption Act were among the laws that have made it easier for\u202fadopted children\u202fand their birth mothers to regain contact with each other.

      "tags": "Islamophobia",
      "text": "Boris Johnson's comments about women wearing the burka have given an impression that the Tories are \"insensitive to Muslim communities\", an independent review has said. \nThe prime minister ordered a report in 2019 into how the party handles discrimination allegations.\nIt found anti-Muslim views were seen at local association and individual level.\nBut claims of \"institutional racism\" were not borne out by evidence of the way complaints were handled.\nHowever, there is \"clear evidence\" the Conservative party's complaints system is \"in need of overhaul\", according to Professor Swaran Singh's independent review.\nThe report warned it \"should make for uncomfortable reading for the party\".\nIn a statement Prof Singh said: \"For those unable or unwilling to read all of its 44,000 words, here's a summary: we found evidence of discrimination, and while the problem is not systemic the party must now act to root it out.\"\nResponding to the report, Conservative party co-chair Amanda Milling apologised \"to anyone who has been hurt by discriminatory behaviour of others or failed by our system\".\nShe said the party accepted all the recommendations and would publish a plan to implement them in six weeks' time.   \nFormer Conservative Chancellor Sajid Javid said the report contained \"distressing examples of anti-Muslim sentiment\" but insisted that Mr Johnson was not Islamophobic and \"respects anyone from any background, any community\".\nAnother former cabinet minister - and long-standing critic of the party over Islamophobia - Baroness Sayeeda Warsi told Sky News the report showed that \"the party was institutionally racist\" and said the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) should investigate.\nShe also described the prime minister's apology as \"mealy-mouthed\" but added there was \"an acceptance that what he said was wrong\".\nLabour's shadow equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova said the report was \"a damning indictment of the discrimination rife in the Conservative Party, and it goes all the way up to the prime minister\".\nShe urged Mr Johnson to make a \"full and proper apology\" for his burka comments and to acknowledge \"the pain and hurt he has caused in the Muslim community\".\nThe Muslim Council of Britain gave a \"guarded welcome\" to the report but said \"it does not address the structural nature of Islamophobia in the Party\" or \"how racism had impacted many elements of its culture\".\nThe report was commissioned in December 2019 after accusations of Islamophobic behaviour by some Conservative party members and representatives.\nIt considered cases including allegations against Zac Goldsmith's London mayoral campaign against Sadiq Khan in 2016, and comments made by Boris Johnson in a Telegraph column in 2018, when he wrote that women wearing burkas looked like \"letter boxes\" or \"bank robbers\".\nThe review said such cases \"give an impression to some of a party and leadership insensitive to Muslim communities\".\nSpeaking to the inquiry, Mr Johnson said: \"I am obviously sorry for any offence taken\" and added he would not \"use some of the offending language from my past writings\" now.\nConcerning his 2016 London mayoral campaign, the report said Zac Goldsmith - now Lord Goldsmith \"accepts poor judgement in the way his campaign was conducted but forcefully denies harbouring anti-Muslim sentiments or using such sentiments for political advantage\".\nThe report also found:\n\"Judging by the extent of complaints and findings of misconduct by the party itself that relate to anti-Muslim words and conduct, anti-Muslim sentiment remains a problem within the party,\" the report added.\n\"This is damaging to the party, and alienates a significant section of society.\"\nThe Singh report said the Conservatives should, within six weeks, publish a plan laying out how it intends to tackle the failings highlighted by the investigation.\nIt also recommended producing a code of conduct and said at least one member of every party association should receive training on the complaints process.\nResponding to Prof Singh's report, the Equality and Human Rights Commission said it would assess the report and await the Conservative Party's response.\nThe Conservative Party has been accused of failing to tackle Islamophobia within its ranks for a number of years.\nIn 2018, the then-chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum Mohammed Amin, accused his party of putting \"electoral concerns\" ahead of \"decisive action\" on tackling Islamophobia.\nThe Conservatives' first female Muslim cabinet minister, Baroness Warsi, has also long decried her party's response to the issue, accusing it of \"turning a blind eye\" and becoming \"institutionally Islamophobic\".\nDuring the 2019 race to lead the Conservative party, then-home secretary Sajid Javid challenged all of his fellow contenders - including eventual winner Mr Johnson - to hold an external investigation into the allegations."

      "text": "After years of talks, Switzerland has scrapped efforts aimed at agreeing an over-arching treaty with the EU.\nSwitzerland is not in the European Union but has signed up to many of its policies, such as freedom of movement.\nThe relationship is currently governed by more than 120 bilateral deals, and a failure to replace them with one framework deal could harm ties.\n\"We regret this decision, given the progress that has been made over the last years,\" the EU Commission said.\nThe EU-Switzerland free trade agreement dates back to 1972.\nThe Commission - the executive body for the EU's 27 member states - said that without an EU-Swiss framework agreement, modernising that relationship would not be possible. Existing deals were \"not up to speed\" and the impact of Switzerland's decision would have to be analysed, it warned.\nThe Swiss government has highlighted three issues: protection of wages, rules governing state aid, and the right of EU citizens working in Switzerland to claim Swiss welfare benefits as part of freedom of movement.\nForeign Minister Ignazio Cassis said Switzerland could not accept EU demands for equal rights for EU workers as it would have meant an unwanted \"paradigm shift\" in Switzerland's migration policy. The government also feared it could lead to higher social security costs.\nThe two sides can rely on the patchwork of bilateral agreements but those deals will eventually go out of date, so Switzerland will not have access to a potential electricity union or other areas of the single market that change. \nHowever, one bilateral deal lapsed only this week on trade in medical technology products and the Swiss MedTech organisation said it would cost the industry 114m Swiss francs (\u00a390m; \u20ac104m) and 75m every year afterwards.\nThe right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) welcomed the breakdown of talks as \"a victory for Swiss self-determination\", while trade unions were also pleased as they had been concerned about the impact on wage protection and public services.\nBut most political parties in Switzerland were critical: Socialist party president Roger Nordmann described it as \"Black Wednesday\".  \nSwiss confederation President Guy Parmelin rejected the term \"Black Wednesday\" and said he hoped for a fruitful \"reset in our relations\", adding that the Switzerland and the EU remained first-class partners. Even without a treaty, it was in their shared interests to maintain their \"proven bilateral approach\", he said.\nUnlike the UK, which left the European Union and gave up membership of the single market and customs union, Switzerland is part of the single market as well as the EU's Schengen passport-free zone.\nThe Bern government says 1.4 million EU citizens live in Switzerland and has promised to urge parliament to approve the release of CHF1.3bn (\u00a31bn; $1.4bn) to the EU's fund for poorer member states, which was frozen in 2019 and is is a key condition for Swiss membership of the single market. \n1972: Free Trade Agreement\n1992: Swiss vote narrowly against joining European Economic Area\n1992-2002: Switzerland negotiates, then signs first bilateral agreements with EU - they are interdependent, and include free movement of people - backed by a vote in 2000. An overall framework agreement is proposed in 2002\n2005: Swiss vote to join Europe's Schengen open borders treaty and extend free movement to 10 new EU states\n2014: Swiss narrowly back quotas on EU workers, angering the EU. Talks take place to formalise relations in a framework treaty"

      "text": "Two retired police officers and an ex-solicitor accused of altering police statements after the Hillsborough disaster have been acquitted. \nRetired Ch Supt Donald Denton, retired Det Ch Insp Alan Foster and former solicitor Peter Metcalf had denied perverting the course of justice.\nMr Justice William Davis ruled they had no case to answer.\nMargaret Aspinall, whose son James died in the disaster, said the ruling was \"an absolute mockery\" and a \"shambles\". \n\"We're always the losers no matter what the outcome today,\" she said.\nNinety-six Liverpool fans died as a result of the crush at the FA Cup semi-final match at Sheffield Wednesday's ground on 15 April 1989.\nMr Denton, Mr Foster and Mr Metcalf were accused of trying to minimise the blame placed on South Yorkshire Police in the aftermath of the disaster by altering statements.\nHowever, the judge said the statements had been prepared for the public inquiry chaired by Lord Taylor in 1990. \nHe said this was not a statutory inquiry and therefore not considered \"a court of law\", so it was not a \"course of public justice\" which could be perverted. \nProsecutor Sarah Whitehouse QC said they would not seek leave to appeal against the judge's decision. \nSpeaking at the Hillsborough memorial at Anfield, Ms Aspinall said: \"We've got the death certificate with 96 unlawfully killed but yet not one person has been held to account.\"\nShe said she felt there was \"a cover-up over a cover-up\" but she said the Hillsborough families \"could go no further\". \n\"They are tired, they are getting old, a lot of them have gone to their graves tormented and to me that is a disgrace,\" she said. \nMary Corrigan, whose 17-year-old son Keith McGrath died in the tragedy, said she was \"so angry\".\nShe also criticised the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for their lack of support for the families.\nLiverpool FC said the decision was a \"huge disappointment\" and victims had been \"let down yet again\".\nGreater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who campaigned with the Hillsborough families, said: \"We've all given it our all but our all was not enough to secure any accountability for the 96 unlawful deaths on British soil.\" \nHe said the scales of justice were \"weighed against ordinary people\" and called for Hillsborough Law to be introduced.\nIt would place a duty of candour on all public officials and require parity of legal funding for bereaved families and public bodies, he said.\nLiverpool City Region metro mayor Steve Rotheram said the decision was a \"stain on the judicial system\" and \"yet another kick in the teeth\" for the families.\nSue Hemming, from the CPS, said they were \"right to bring this case and for a court to hear the evidence of what happened in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster\".\nShe said what had been heard in court would have been \"surprising to many\". \n\"That a publicly funded authority can lawfully withhold information from a public inquiry charged with finding out why 96 people died at a football match, in order to ensure that it never happened again - or that a solicitor can advise such a withholding, without sanction of any sort - may be a matter which should be subject to scrutiny.\"\nClaire Bassett, from the IOPC, added: \"Serious questions must remain over the public and moral duty of police in helping authorities to understand and prevent a further disaster like Hillsborough.\"\nMr Denton, 83, of Sheffield; Mr Foster, 74, of Harrogate; and Mr Metcalf, 71, of Ilkley, had all denied two counts of perverting the course of justice.\nThe three men were on trial at the Nightingale Court at the Lowry Theatre in Salford for more than four weeks.\nBy Judith Moritz, BBC North of England correspondent\nThe collapse of this trial will anger and distress many of those who've spent 32 years campaigning for \"Justice for the 96\". \nIt's likely that it will mark the end of the legal road for them, which has been long and winding, with few ups and many downs.\nIn 2016 they celebrated the inquests verdicts which found that the 96 had been unlawfully killed, and that the fans were not to blame.\nThere were high hopes for accountability. But the match commander David Duckenfield was acquitted after two trials, and the collapse of this aftermath trial means that no one has been convicted for the alleged cover-up. \nOver the last three decades there have been four trials, two sets of inquests, a public inquiry and several other investigations and reviews. \nDespite all of those proceedings, it remains the case that the bereaved families feel let down by the system. They feel that they know the truth of what happened to their loved ones, but they haven't had justice.\nJonathan Goldberg QC, who represented Mr Metcalf, said \"there was no cover-up at Hillsborough\" and the three men had been exonerated by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in 1998.\n\"Despite this, the witch hunt has continued to resurrect the same tired accusations by prosecuting three old men,\" he said.\nMike Rainford, solicitor for Mr Denton, said the pain and suffering for the families was \"unimaginable\" but this trial \"should never have taken place at all\". \nThe ruling brought an end to the \"myth of the Hillsborough cover-up once and for all\", he said, after \"years of lies, half-truths and rumours\".  \nMr Foster's solicitor Paul Harris said the trial had been a \"shameful waste of public resources\". \n\"This narrative of an alleged cover-up, when every document was meticulously preserved and maintained, was not borne out by the evidence,\" he said.\nThe Hillsborough inquests concluded in 2016 that the 96 football fans who died as a result of the crush were unlawfully killed. \nThe original inquests in 1991 had ruled the deaths were accidental but those conclusions were quashed following the 2012 Hillsborough Independent Panel's damning report into the disaster.\nThree other men were also charged in 2017 following an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) into allegations of a cover-up by police following the tragedy.\nAll charges against Sir Norman Bettison, who was accused of trying to blame Liverpool fans, were dropped in 2018.\nSheffield Wednesday's former club secretary Graham Mackrell was found guilty of a health and safety offence in May 2019. \nThe match commander on the day, David Duckenfield, was cleared of gross negligence manslaughter in November 2019.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "Islands such as the Canary Islands and Majorca could be placed on the UK green list of destinations for holidaymakers, a government minister has said.\nThe move may happen from 7 June, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said.\nAt present, people from England can holiday in green list countries without having to quarantine on their return.\nBut travel operators and airlines have been pushing to be allowed to fly to holiday islands when the rest of the country is on the amber list.\nSo, that could mean people could holiday in popular destinations such as the Canary Islands and Majorca even if mainland Spain stays on the amber list.\nMr Shapps told the transport select committee that he has \"asked The Joint Biosecurity Centre to consider islands within their criteria and where possible they would look to include if them if facts stacked up\".\nWhen pushed on whether this was possible by the review on 7 June, Mr Shapps replied: \"technically that is possible, but I actually don't know because I don't have the data yet as to whether islands make the grade.\"\nPeople across the UK can legally take foreign holidays - although Welsh residents have been asked not to travel abroad.\nOn England's traffic light list, foreign countries are classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests in place for each.\nGovernment guidance is that you should not holiday in red or amber countries - which include Spain and most other countries.\nHolidays to countries on the green list - including Portugal - can go ahead without a need to quarantine when you return.\nThe list is reviewed every three weeks and countries can change status at short notice. There are similar rules for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nRead more here.\nMr Shapps was pushed to explain why so few countries were on the green list when UK vaccination levels were high.\nHe said: \"If you send people, even vaccinated people, to other countries, given vaccinations are not 100% reliable, then you are exposing them to risks that they don't have if they stay in the UK.\n\"'That's fine', you might say, 'That's their risk'. But not if they bring that back, then that is all of our risk, so we do have to move with the science.\"\nMr Shapps said there is scientific analysis of each destination when decisions are made to include countries on the list, including vaccination levels, virus levels and ability to track how the virus is evolving. \nAt the moment this is a waiting game, he said, and that travel would change when other countries catch up with UK levels of vaccinations. \"Part of this is having the patience to let this come through the system.\" \nHe also said deaths in Germany and France are now higher per day than in the UK and allowing UK citizens to travel there exposes them to risk.\nMr Shapps added: \"I am the Secretary of State for Transport, I want people to be able to travel, I have no other agency than [to] get people travelling, but we also recognise as a responsible government that it has to be safe.\"\nMr Shapps added that people may be able to use vaccine certificates rather than tests to travel later on in June.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the bosses of Tui, Jet2, Easyjet and Manchester Airport called on the government to expand the green list of destinations.\nThe holiday bosses didn't feel that Portugal, the only mass-market tourist destination on the green list, is enough of an offering for the summer. \nTour operators want the British holidaymakers' favourites of Majorca, Tenerife and Gran Canaria opened up, destinations they believe have good health protocols in place.\nThey want UK holidaymakers back on some of their favourite beaches. \nSteve Heapy, the chief executive of Jet2, said: \"We feel the government is overly cautious and that the list of green countries could be expanded with little increase in risk.\"\nHe said that there was currently no benefit of the vaccination programme when travelling, adding: \"People need a break, people want to get back to normal.\""

      "tags": "Royal Dutch Shell,Paris climate agreement,Climate change,Netherlands",
      "text": "A court in the Netherlands has ruled in a landmark case that the oil giant Shell must reduce its emissions.\nBy 2030, Shell must cut its CO2 emissions by 45% compared to 2019 levels, the civil court ruled.\nThe Shell group is responsible for its own CO2 emissions and those of its suppliers, the verdict said. \nIt is the first time a company has been legally obliged to align its policies with the Paris climate accords, says Friends of the Earth (FoE).\nThe environmental group brought the case to court in 2019, alongside six other bodies and more than 17,000 Dutch citizens. \nThough the decision only applies in the Netherlands, it could have wider effects elsewhere. BBC Netherlands correspondent Anna Holligan tweeted that it was a \"precedent-setting judgement\".\nA Shell spokesperson said they \"fully expect to appeal today's disappointing court decision\" and added that they are stepping up efforts to cut emissions.\n\"Urgent action is needed on climate change, which is why we have accelerated our efforts to become a net-zero emissions energy company by 2050,\" the spokesperson said, adding that Shell was investing \"billions of dollars in low-carbon energy, including electric vehicle charging, hydrogen, renewables and biofuels\".\n\"This is really great news and a gigantic victory for the earth, our children and for all of us,\" FoE director Donald Pols said in a statement. \"The judge leaves no doubt about it: Shell is causing dangerous climate change and must now stop it quickly.\" \nUnder the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate change, nearly 200 nations agreed to keep global temperatures \"well below\" 2C above pre-industrial levels. \nThe legally binding treaty came into force on 4 November 2016. The US withdrew under former President Donald Trump but has since rejoined under President Joe Biden. \nA number of groups around the world are now trying to force companies and governments to comply with the accords through the courts. \nShell has previously said it wants net zero emissions for itself and from products used by its customers by 2050. \nIn December its defence lawyers told the Dutch court the company was already taking \"serious steps\" to move away from fossil fuels, and said there was no legal basis for the case.\nOther major oil companies are also making changes amid a greater global focus on cutting emissions. \nOn Wednesday Chevron investors voted in favour of a proposal to cut its customer emissions, while shareholders at Exxon elected two climate activists to its board after months of wrangling over its business direction.\nThe Shell verdict is a massive win for environmental campaigners, and other industrial giants will be scrambling to figure out how it could affect them.\nBecause suddenly it's not good enough for firms to comply with the law on their emissions - in an extraordinary case like this, they have to comply with global climate policy too.\nThe company's defence is that if people feel progress towards cutting emissions is too slow, they should lobby governments - not Shell - to change policies and introduce financial incentives.\nThe judges have clearly decided that Shell should be taking responsibility itself for cutting emissions much faster.\nThe firm will surely appeal - and it might well win the case in a higher court. \nBut this verdict alone will be a warning to companies round the world that the battle against climate change may be spelling the end of anything resembling \"business as usual\".  \nShell - full name Royal Dutch Shell - is a British-Dutch multinational. Because its headquarters are in The Hague, FoE was able to bring a case to a Dutch court. \nEarlier this year another Dutch court ruled that Shell was responsible for damage caused by oil leaks in the Niger Delta, and ordered the company to pay compensation to farmers. \nShell, however, has said the leaks were the result of \"sabotage\".

      "text": "Thousands of people died needlessly as a result of government mistakes in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, Dominic Cummings has said.\nThe PM's former top aide said Boris Johnson was \"unfit for the job\", claiming he had ignored scientific advice and wrongly delayed lockdowns.\nHe also claimed Matt Hancock should have been fired for lying - something denied by the health secretary.\n\"Tens of thousands of people died, who didn't need to die,\" Mr Cummings added.\nAt a marathon seven-hour evidence session, the former Downing Street insider painted a picture of policy failure, dithering and a government that had no useful plan for handling a pandemic.\nHe told MPs: \"The truth is that senior ministers, senior officials, senior advisers like me fell disastrously short of the standards that the public has a right to expect of its government in a crisis like this.\"\nHe added: \"I would like to say to all the families of those who died unnecessarily how sorry I am for the mistakes that were made and for my own mistakes at that.\"\nMr Cummings - who was forced out of Number 10 at the end of last year after an internal power struggle - said those on the front line of the pandemic were like \"lions\" being \"led by donkeys\".\nBut he claimed Mr Johnson had told him he liked to be surrounded by \"chaos\" in Downing Street, because it meant everyone had to look to the PM \"to see who is in charge\".\nAsked if he thought Mr Johnson was a \"fit and proper person\" to get the UK through the pandemic, Mr Cummings replied: \"No.\"\nMr Johnson hit back at some of his former aide's allegations at Prime Minister's Questions, insisting that the government's priority had always been to \"save lives\".\nBut Mr Cummings said that despite nearly losing his own life to Covid, the PM thought the first national lockdown, on 23 March last year, had been a mistake - and he was against a so-called \"circuit breaker\" lockdown in autumn 2020 for economic reasons, despite scientific advice.\nAsked on what basis the PM had taken this decision, Mr Cummings said: \"He wasn't taking any advice, he was just taking his own decision that he was going to ignore the advice.\"\nHe added: \"The cabinet wasn't involved or asked.\"\nAsked if the prime minister had said he would rather see \"bodies pile high\" than take the country into a third lockdown, as reported by the BBC, Mr Cummings said: \"I heard that in the prime minister's study.\"\nMr Johnson has denied making these comments.\nThe former adviser reserved his most savage criticism for Matt Hancock, claiming the health secretary should have been fired for \"15 to 20\" different things - accusing him of \"criminal, disgraceful behaviour that caused serious harm\".\nHe said he had repeatedly called on Mr Johnson to sack Mr Hancock, calling him \"completely incapable of doing the job\".\nThe prime minister had been furious when he came back to work after recovering from coronavirus to find that untested patients had been discharged to care homes in England, thereby allowing the virus to spread, Mr Cummings claimed.\nBoth he and the PM had been told \"categorically in March that people will be tested before they went back to care homes\".\nSubsequent government claims about putting a \"shield\" around care homes were \"complete nonsense\", he said.\nMr Cummings also attacked Mr Hancock over PPE shortages, and accused him of \"disgraceful behaviour\" in setting a \"stupid\" target of offering 100,000 Covid tests a day, which he said had disrupted wider work to establish the test and trace system.\nCommittee chairman Greg Clark said Mr Cummings must provide written evidence to back up his claims about Mr Hancock, who will be quizzed by the MPs in two weeks' time.\nMr Hancock said he had not seen Mr Cummings' evidence in full adding \"instead I've been dealing with getting the vaccination rollout going, especially to over-30s, and saving lives\". \nHowever he added that he would have \"more to say\" when he gives a statement to the House of Commons on Thursday.\nEarlier, a spokesman for Mr Hancock said: \"We absolutely reject Mr Cummings' claims about the health secretary.\n\"The health secretary will continue to work closely with the prime minister to deliver the vaccine rollout, tackle the risks posed by variants and support the NHS and social care sector to recover from this pandemic.\"\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the \"very grave allegations\" appeared to be \"well-founded\" and the health secretary \"needs to give us an explanation\" if the country is to \"maintain confidence in him\".\nIn other explosive claims, Mr Cummings said:\nMr Cummings was questioned by the Health and Science select committees, for their inquiry into \"lessons learnt\" on the government's response to the pandemic.\nBefore the hearing began, he tweeted a picture of a whiteboard on which the government's \"plan B\" for the first wave of the virus was sketched out.\nHe told the MPs the original plan had been for limited intervention, with the hope of achieving \"herd immunity\", and he was \"completely baffled\" by Downing Street's denial of this.\nHe said the herd immunity strategy was abandoned when the scale of the death toll that would result from it became clear.\nMr Cummings was frank about some of his own failings - and admitted that his defence of a trip to County Durham during the first lockdown had \"undermined public confidence\".\nBut he said he had made the journey due to threats against his family - and he defended his claim that he had driven his family to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight, saying the story was too \"weird\" to have been made up.\nHe also gave his version of his departure from Downing Street, saying his relationship with Mr Johnson had broken down after the second national lockdown in October.\n\"The fact that his girlfriend (Carrie Symonds) also wanted rid of me was relevant but not the heart of the problem,\" he told MPs.\nHe said he regarded Mr Johnson as \"unfit for the job\" and that he had been \"trying to create a structure around him (the PM) to try and stop what I thought were extremely bad decisions and push other things through against his wishes\".\nHe also described how a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee on 12 March had been disrupted by US President Donald Trump wanting to start a \"bombing campaign\" against Iraq.\nAt the same time, he added, Mr Johnson's partner Carrie Symonds was \"going crackers\" about a \"completely trivial\" story in the Times regarding the dog she co-owned with the prime minister.\nResponding to Mr Cummings' evidence, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: \"Boris Johnson's casual disregard for the safety of the British people has had fatal consequences. \n\"From care homes to borders, repeatedly locking down too late and failing to learn from his mistakes, the PM's decisions and failures resulted in tens of thousands of avoidable deaths.\"\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson told MPs: \"The handling of this pandemic has been one of the most difficult things this country has had to do for a very long time and none of the decisions have been easy,\" he said.\n\"To go into a lockdown is a traumatic thing for a country, to deal with a pandemic on this scale has been appallingly difficult, and we have at every stage tried to minimise loss of life, to save lives, to protect the NHS and we have followed the best scientific advice that we can.\"\nHe added that he had not seen Mr Cummings' evidence to the select committee.\nConservative MP Tobias Ellwood defended the prime minister, saying that ministers should be free to speak their minds and even ask \"silly questions\" without \"fear that one day they may be quoted or misquoted back to you\".\n\"That completely diminishes the competence of the No 10 machine,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nMore than 127,000 people diagnosed with coronavirus have died in the UK since the start of the pandemic."

      "tags": "Abortion in Northern Ireland",
      "text": "Delays in implementing Northern Ireland's abortion laws have been a \"deeply troubling exercise in finger-pointing\", a court has heard.\nAbortion became legal in 2020, following a vote by MPs during the collapse of devolution.\nStormont has since been under pressure to establish a permanent, central abortion service, but this has not happened yet.\nIt is being challenged in a judicial review at the High Court in Belfast. \nThe NI Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) is taking the case against the Northern Ireland Executive, the Department of Health and the Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis.\nRepresenting the NIHRC, David Blundell QC said there had been an \"abdication of legal responsibility\" by all three parties.\nHe told Mr Justice Colton that the main factor in taking the case was the protection of women's human rights.\nMr Blundell said without a fully-funded and staffed model, Northern Ireland health trusts have only been able to operate a \"skeleton service\" for early medical abortions - up to 10 weeks of pregnancy.\nWomen seeking a termination beyond that gestation have still been required, in some circumstances, to travel to England during the coronavirus pandemic, the court was told.\n\"Much was known about the truly terrible impact on such women, but has not led to any service being provided,\" said Mr Blundell.\nHe also said the Northern Ireland secretary had a \"clear statutory obligation\" in law to ensure full abortion services were commissioned by Stormont \"expeditiously\", and that this had not happened.\nIn March, Mr Lewis took powers that would allow him to direct Stormont to set up services but he has not done so yet.\nThe government has said it wanted \"concrete progress\" from the executive by this summer.\nMr Blundell said the NIHRC is calling for the laws to be implemented fully by September, but that the Department of Health has suggested that it could take eight to 12 months to establish services.\n\"In practice, women in Northern Ireland do not have access to abortion services to which they're entitled by law - it's been 14 months without them,\" he added.\nThe court was also told the Northern Ireland Executive had \"totally failed to engage\" with the Department of Health in relation to the commissioning of services.\nNorthern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann has maintained that he cannot set it up without support from the Stormont Executive, as the matter is controversial and cross-cutting - the responsibility of more than one department.\nThe court heard that evidence from the department suggested the First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose party opposes abortion, had \"made clear\" that proposals were not going to be passed by the executive.\nMr Blundell said the executive's position was a \"driving factor\" in contributing to the delays, along with financial challenges raised by the health minister with Westminster.\nThe case is scheduled to last for two days.\nIt is expected to hear from representatives for the secretary of state, as well as lawyers for the Department of Health and the Stormont Executive.\nReserved judgement is expected to be delivered in the next few months.\nMeanwhile, in a separate development, BBC News NI understands that a paper from Mr Swann on the commissioning of abortion services was blocked from executive discussion last week.\nOne short-term option suggested exploring if Irish health authorities could provide Northern Ireland women with early medical abortion access.\nIt is believed Mr Swann had proposed whether it would be possible for Northern Ireland to quickly commission a limited early medical abortion service.\nThat would allow women in the early stages of a pregnancy - up to 10 weeks - to take abortion pills at home following a consultation with a doctor.\nThe service, known as telemedicine, has been in place in other parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. \nHowever, BBC News NI understands that Mr Swann's paper did not make it onto the executive's agenda to be considered by all ministers.\nAny paper can be blocked from discussion, if it does not have support of both the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in.\nThe DUP is staunchly opposed to abortion.\nSinn F\u00e9in has previously called for abortion services to be commissioned promptly."

      "text": "A crackdown on county lines drug dealing gangs resulted in the arrest of 1,100 people and the seizure of 292 weapons.\nForces across the UK boosted activity against county lines gangs in the week from 17 to 23 May. \nIn this week there were 33 guns and 219 knives among the weapons seized and 80 drug dealing phone lines identified.\nCounty line gangs are urban drug dealers who sell to customers in more rural areas via dedicated phone lines.\nThere are currently thought to be around 600 of these gangs operating in the UK, down from around 2,000 two years ago.\nThey are notorious for exploiting children to work as couriers and forcing vulnerable people to let them use their homes to conceal or deal drugs, as portrayed in BBC drama Line of Duty.\nDuring the week of action, 904 of these \"cuckooed\" homes were visited by law enforcement, and 1,138 vulnerable people were safeguarded, including 573 children. \nTwo boys were stopped by police in Northampton this month.  When searched, officers found one had a weapon and 80 \"rocks\" of crack cocaine.\nThey were just 16 and 17, from Birmingham and in town as part of a county line selling to the area's drug users.\nOne boy stood out. He had ligature marks on his neck and bruises in the shape of a hand on his throat. His back was covered in welts as if he had been beaten.\nAn officer with more than 20 years' service told me it sent a \"chill down my spine\".  \nHe thought the teenager had been tortured by fellow gang members, possibly to force him to sell drugs.\nDuring the pandemic, the criminal exploitation of children in so-called county lines did not go away. In fact, some charities say after lockdown things have actually got worse.\nChildren already disconnected from school and social services dropped further off the radar. Criminal gangs were ready and waiting.\nLisa, a youth worker in the South West, told me it felt like it was \"out of control\".  She described she and her team as being \"on their knees\".\nAnd in another part of the country I met a mother whose son was groomed by a gang at the age of 12.\nDuring lockdown she says he would jump out of his bedroom window and run away. \nBecause he wasn't in school she says he became \"a law unto himself\" and went \"completely undetected by anyone\".\n\"We're frightened for him, but we're also frightened for ourselves,\" she said.\nNational Police Chiefs' Council lead for county lines, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Graham McNulty, said: \"The police response to county lines has increased substantially over the past 18 months, we have been relentless in pursuing those behind the line whilst doing everything possible to rescue those being exploited.\n\"Intensification weeks like this allow us to dedicate a burst of activity and resources nationally, highlighting to the public our absolute determination to rid communities of this abhorrent crime.\n\"We will use all the powers available to us to tackle every element of the county line network because we know the effect violence and crimes associated with county lines can have in our communities.\"\nMr McNulty added that signs of a child being exploited included unexplained cash, new expensive phones or clothing and suddenly going missing.\nHaving train tickets, taxi receipts, a change in behaviour and new people suddenly appearing at a house or flat were also signs to look out for.

      "text": "The majority of new coronavirus cases in the UK are the so-called Indian variant - named the Delta variant by the World Health Organization.\nThis version - or mutation - was first spotted in India last October.\nViruses mutate all the time. Most variants are insignificant, but some can make a virus more contagious. \nUK scientists say the Delta variant - known as B.1.617.2 - is spreading more quickly than the Kent or Alpha variant, which was behind a surge in cases over the winter.\nThere have been almost 18,000 cases of the B.1.617.2 variant in England, just under 3,000 in Scotland, 189 in Wales and 37 in Northern Ireland. \nThe latest Public Health England figures up to 2 June showed the worst-hit areas were:\nHowever, just because it's the most common strain doesn't always mean there's lots of it about. \nIn West Lancashire and East Hertfordshire, for example, in the two weeks to 29 May the variant accounted for 100% of the cases analysed for variants. But this amounted to only nine individual infections each.\nNot all cases are analysed and a higher proportion are in areas with lots of the Delta variant, potentially skewing the figures. \nBut random swabbing carried out by the Office for National Statistics, which is not skewed in this way, also found a growing proportion of cases looked like they were the Delta variant. \nIt does appear to spread more easily than the Kent variant (B.1.1.7). \nTransmission rates for the Indian strain have been put at anywhere between 30 and 100% higher than for the Kent or Alpha variant. \nRoughly 12% of contacts of people with the Indian variant went on to develop coronavirus, compared with 8% of those who had the so-called Kent variant, according to Public Health England analysis - suggesting it is roughly 50% more transmissible. \nBut some of that could be the behaviour of humans, rather than the virus itself. \nWhen a variant spreads faster than others, it could be driven by the strain being more infectious, by differences in how close people get, or by different vaccination rates. \nFor instance, it's been pointed out some of the worst-affected areas have very low proportions of residents working from home.\nDespite fears over the Indian variant, most of the UK went ahead with easing restrictions on 17 May.\nHowever, the government has issued new guidance for people in eight areas of England with high numbers of cases\nPeople have been advised to minimise travelling in and out of Kirklees, Bedford, Blackburn with Darwen, Bolton, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside.\nIn addition, residents have been advised - wherever possible - to meet people outside, maintain social distancing of 2m (6ft) from people not in their household and work from home if they can. \nIt is not clear whether the next stage of easing in England will happen on 21 June, as was set out in the government's roadmap. \nThe prime minister and health secretary have indicated they will wait for another week's data before making a decision.\nMany countries already have bans on people from the UK and elsewhere entering. \nFrance has brought a ban on non-essential travel from the UK back into force in direct response to the spread of the India variant.

      "text": "George Floyd's sister has boycotted a meeting with US President Joe Biden, saying he \"broke a promise\" to enact police reform legislation by the anniversary of her brother's death.\nWhile Bridgett Floyd attended a rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota, other family members lobbied Mr Biden at the White House to help pass the bill.\nThe George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is stalled on Capitol Hill.\nOn Tuesday cities in the US and abroad marked a year since Floyd's death.\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted last month of the murder of Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, after kneeling on his neck area for more than nine minutes as he was detained on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill. He faces up to 40 years in prison when sentenced on 25 June.\nMr Biden had set Tuesday as a deadline for signing police reform legislation.\nAfter meeting the president and Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House, Floyd's brother, Philonise, told reporters: \"If you can make federal laws to protect the bird which is the bald eagle, then you can make federal laws to protect people of colour.\"\nFloyd's other brother, Terrence, said it had been \"a very productive conversation\" in the Oval Office.\nBut Bridgett Floyd - who instead held a moment of silence at a \"Celebration of Life\" event in a downtown Minneapolis park - explained why she did not go to Washington.\n\"I was going to DC for Biden to sign a bill,\" she said. \"Biden has not signed that bill. Biden has broke a promise.\"\nShe added a message for the president: \"Get your people in order.\"\nAfter meeting the Floyd family, the president issued a statement pledging to keep supporting the legislation.\n\"The battle for the soul of America has been a constant push and pull between the American ideal that we're all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart,\" the president said. \"At our best, the American ideal wins out. It must again.\"\nWhile Mr Biden, a Democrat, has led the way in publicly lobbying for passage of infrastructure and coronavirus stimulus bills, he has left much of the negotiations over police reform to lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\n\"We have been respecting the space needed for negotiators to have these discussions,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday as she declined to offer a new deadline for reaching an agreement.\nBut activists said Mr Biden needed to do more to help pass the bill.\n\"The president will need to step up to make sure we get it across the finish line,\" Judith Browne Dianis, executive director of the Advancement Project, a racial justice organisation, told AP news agency.\nSenate Democrats last June blocked a police reform bill proposed by a black Republican senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina. They argued it did not go far enough.\nNow Senate Republicans oppose a police reform bill passed in March by House of Representatives Democrats, the main stumbling block being its provision to make it easier for individual police officers to be sued and charged with crimes.\nMr Biden has also been pressed by Black Lives Matter and other activists to stop military equipment being supplied to police forces.\nOn the campaign trail last year, he called for the US to \"stop transferring weapons of war to police forces\".\nBut despite calls from House Democrats to issue an executive order to that effect, the White House has not acted.\nLegal cases surrounding Floyd's murder continue, meanwhile. \nEarlier in May a federal grand jury charged four ex-police officers - Alexander Keung, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, as well as Chauvin - with violating Floyd's civil rights. \nChauvin's defence team has requested a new trial, accusing both prosecutors and jurors of misconduct. \nIn New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio joined civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton in kneeling in silence for nine minutes and 29 seconds - the time that Chauvin knelt on Floyd.\nAcross the country, demonstrators gathered for a Black Lives Matter protest near City Hall in Los Angeles.\nAnd in Minneapolis, many gathered at the intersection where Floyd took his last breaths, which has been turned into a memorial site.\nEvents at \"George Floyd Square\" were briefly interrupted by gunfire. One person was reported injured as at least 20 rounds were fired.\nMinneapolis has been struggling with rising gun violence in the past year as nearly 200 officers in the city police department have resigned or gone on leave. A six-year-old girl was among those fatally shot in recent weeks.\nThere were also commemorative events on Tuesday for Floyd overseas. \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters his death was a \"tragedy\" and vowed to take more action in Canada to tackle racism.\nVigils and demonstrations also took place in cities across the UK, including Birmingham, Edinburgh, London, Manchester and Swansea.

      "text": "More than five years after an Italian student's body was found in Cairo, a Rome judge says four senior Egyptian security officials should face trial over his kidnap, torture and murder.\nGiulio Regeni, a Cambridge University postgraduate student, disappeared in January 2016.\nHis body was so badly disfigured his mother could barely identify him.\nThe four members of the Egyptian security forces are unlikely to travel to Rome for the 14 October trial.\nThe murder has heightened tensions between the two countries. Italian and Egyptian investigators had originally tried to work on the case together but when Rome prosecutors pushed for a trial in late 2020, their counterparts in Cairo said there was \"insufficient evidence to support the accusation in court\".\nEgypt said evidence had been found that Regeni had been robbed by a criminal gang but that the killer had not been identified.\nAt the time of his disappearance, the 28-year-old PhD student was researching Egypt's independent trade unions, a controversial subject in a country where unofficial protest movements have faced a crackdown in recent years.\nHis body was found dumped in a ditch by a road near Cairo on 3 February 2016. An Italian post-mortem examination found he had been tortured \"in stages\" between 25 January and the day of his death. \nRome prosecutors went further, detailing \"acute physical suffering\" from kicks, punches, beatings, cuts and even burns from red-hot objects.\nEgyptian officials have admitted Regeni was being monitored and Italian investigators said in 2018 that people he had met while doing his research had betrayed him.\nThe four Egyptians all deny involvement in the student's disappearance and killing. Cairo prosecutors dropped all proceedings against them and a fifth suspect last December.\nGen Tariq Sabir, Col Usham Helmi, Col Athar Kamel Mohamed Ibrahim and Maj Magdi Ibrahim Abdelal Sharif all face charges in Italy of kidnapping Regeni. Maj Sharif is also accused of conspiring to inflict aggravated injuries and murder.\nThe student's parents, Paola Deffendi and Claudio Regeni, were at Tuesday's hearing to hear Judge Pierluigi Balestrieri rule that there was sufficient evidence to indict the four men. \nTheir lawyer, Alessandra Ballerini, told reporters that all the young man's rights had been violated, \"but today we have the well-founded hope that at least the right to the truth will not be denied Giulio\". \n\"It has taken us 64 months. But it is a good goal and a good starting point,\" she said. \nEgyptian officials did not comment immediately on the decision and as the four suspects' home details have not been given to the Italians, there is little chance of contacting them or that the Cairo government will agree to them attending the trial."

It says that a number of them are in long-term decline and cannot justify future investment. \nAbout 30 stores will gradually close over the next decade, while another 80 will be moved to better locations or merged with nearby shops. \nThe group will open 17 new or expanded main stores over the next two years, including a number of former Debenhams sites. \n\"We are committed to stores and believe they can be a true source of competitive advantage,\" chief executive Steve Rowe told investors and journalists on a conference call.\n\"But they need to be the right stores, in the right location, with the right services.\"\nAfter accounting for one-off restructuring costs, the business made a profit of \u00a341.6m, but this was still down almost 90% on the previous year. \nThe M&S losses were mainly due to the performance of its clothing division, which suffered as non-essential retail was closed during lockdown.\nThe 137-year-old chain said clothing and homeware sales had fallen by 31.5%, reflecting the \"heavy impact\" of lockdowns on stores. \n\"In most of this time, our operations have been severely constrained by the change in day-to-day living, the effects of social distancing and partial or full closure of large parts of our store estate,\" M&S said.\n\"This has resulted in substantial changes to the mix of products customers have bought and a wide divergence of store formats and channels.\"\nHowever, M&S said clothing and home sales had been growing since reopening.\nThe store chain also took heart from improved figures in its food division as its tie-up with online grocer Ocado took effect.\nIt said food delivered \"strong underlying like-for-like growth\" of 6.9%, after adjusting for the closure of hospitality and the adverse impact on franchise sales. \n\"In a year like no other, we have delivered a resilient trading performance,\" said chief executive Steve Rowe.\n\"In addition, by going further and faster in our transformation through the Never the Same Again programme, we moved beyond fixing the basics to forge a reshaped M&S. \n\"With the right team in place to accelerate change in the trading businesses and build a trajectory for future growth, we now have a clear line of sight on the path to make M&S special again. The transformation has moved to the next phase.\"\nLike many other retailers, Marks & Spencer has endured a difficult 12 months thanks to the pandemic. But there are signs in these results that the ordeal may have started to forge a stronger company, one more attuned to customer tastes and the move to online shopping. \nM&S traded profitably, but posted an overall loss of \u00a3201m because of the cost of its restructuring plans. It is closing shops, laying off staff and investing heavily in the internet. \nFood sales were up 7%, clothing sales down by one third, with sales in High Street and city centre outlets sharply down. One of the new online ventures, a joint venture with Ocado, is proving a success. One quarter of every Ocado delivery is now M&S products, and the partnership contributed \u00a378m of profit. \nInvestors liked the idea of a revival plan at M&S that for once seems to have some bite: the shares were up 4% at 162p in early trading.\nM&S said it had received government support of \u00a3306.1m, which had partly offset the effect of lost trade and enabled it to keep its employees on.\n\"The figures show the catastrophic effect the pandemic has had on business with retail stores on the High Street,\" Catherine Shuttleworth, founder of retail consultancy Savvy Marketing, told the BBC's Today programme. \n\"There is some glimmer of hope as we come out of it, but it's one of those years that we can't draw too many conclusions from, because it's been so unbelievably different and something that no retailer could have reasonably planned for.\"\nBut she added that \"real benefits\" were starting to come from the M&S turnaround programme.\n\"Ocado's driven an awful lot of income and is really introducing a whole new group of shoppers to M&S and there's never a better time than to tie up with a food delivery business than during a pandemic,\" she added."

      "text": "Levi Taylor is 21. He loves watching Disney films and singing. He loved school, but he didn't get to celebrate his last day there because Covid-19 intervened.  \n\"In that year, I've watched Levi in particular regress, I really have,\" his mother Kathryn said.\n\"He finished school in March [2020], so he didn't get finishing school, there was no closure to school. And that was a major thing for him, just to be at home here.\n\"Now, he's attached to me 24/7.\"\nThe farming family-of-six live just outside Armagh. \nLike his older brother Nathan, Levi is autistic and has severe learning difficulties. \nKathryn told BBC News NI that Levi has struggled to cope in the last year.\n\"Nathan's a very different young man, he's very calm and collected,\" she said.\n\"But Levi's just a ball of frustration and always has been, but it was so well-managed, because he was active, we were always doing things.  \n\"In lockdown, you can't always do stuff.\"\nLevi began to act out his frustrations - and to self-harm.\n\"Levi went into a phase of hiding things, shredding clothes at a rapid, rapid amount, you know, he could shred things within moments,\" Kathryn said.  \n\"Because he was frustrated. We were locked away here. I don't want to do that for the rest of their days.\n\"He has major mental health issues now that he didn't have before. He has started to self-injure himself.  \n\"He wouldn't hurt you or me, but he will hurt himself, to get your attention -, 'I'm hurting here. There's something I don't understand.' \n\"He can't tell me, so he'll hurt himself.\"  \nBefore the pandemic, he and Nathan had access to some day opportunities - places and schemes where they had activities and interaction.  \nThey were all suspended as the impact of Covid began to be felt. \nAfter receiving a letter from the Southern Trust, Kathryn is now concerned that while it may not be feasible to restore these services fully, they may not be restored at all.  \nThe letter said the current infection control guidelines \"will remain in place for many months\" and that that \"undoubtedly has a significant impact on our capacity to deliver services at the same level\".\n\"Everyone is so excited about the lockdown ending, but I'm not excited because for me it's just the same,\" Kathryn said.\n\"We're not making any big major plans of how we're going to get back into the community and things like that.\"\nIn a statement, the Southern Trust appealed for families to contact their community learning disability service directly.\n\"Efforts are ongoing to rebuild learning disability day opportunities in conjunction with the community and voluntary sector, local councils and transport providers.\n\"The trust is working with the independent and third sector providers to increase availability and flexibility of short break options.\"\nKathryn said: \"This is me for the rest of my days and I want to be able to do that for the rest of my days.\n\"So what I'm asking my trust is, give me a little bit of help now.  \n\"I'm the best person to care for these young men, so let me do it, but give me a bit of help.\n\"Don't make me come out and fight because I don't want to do that. That's not my nature and I don't want the world to know how difficult my life is.\"\nBut by opening up, Kathryn is hopeful awareness will be raised of the challenges families like hers, caring for adults with learning difficulties, face.  \n\"This last year has proved to me that I can't do it all. I'm one person - I can't do it all. Both of them, the same diagnosis - autism with severe learning difficulties.  \n\"Which young person do I go to first in a meltdown? I can't choose. I can't choose who needs me more because they both need me.\"\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by the issues covered in this article the BBC Action Line has details of organisations which may be able to help.\nWestern Trust: It says there was no reduction in 24-hour services, but that \"ongoing social distancing and infection, protection and control measures does mean that in some instances how services are offered has been adjusted, including a level of reduced capacity in buildings-based services such as day-care Services and short breaks.\"\nNorthern Trust: \"Our rebuild plans focus on incremental returns to some services, while others require temporary or permanent changes. All trust community services have been restored along with family-based respite services.  Our buildings-based day care, family-based respite and residential short break services have also recommenced in line with social distancing and infection control measures.\"  \nSouth Eastern Trust: \"Efforts are ongoing to rebuild learning disability day opportunities in conjunction with the community and voluntary sector, local councils and transport provider. \n\"Professional input from members of disability and other trust teams have continued throughout the pandemic to support service users and families who have not been able to return to services at present. \n\"Community Teams have been keeping in contact with carers to identify those carers in need of respite, and using the available resources to prioritise carers in urgent and emergency need.\"\nBelfast Trust: Adult day services are \"currently open and operational.  This includes day centres, community day services, additional community based projects, outreach activities, and day opportunities commissioned by the trust for adults with a learning disability. \n\"Due to limited space within our facilities and the implementation of restrictions to allow for social distancing to help stop the spread of Covid-19, we have had to reduce the numbers of people who can attend services at any one time. \n\"In line with regional guidance, those adults living at home with family carers have been prioritised. In addition to Belfast Trust run services there are a further 500 attendances per month through services the Trust commissions in the community and voluntary sector.\""

      "tags": "China,Artificial intelligence,Uighurs",
      "text": "A camera system that uses AI and facial recognition intended to reveal states of emotion has been tested on Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the BBC has been told.\nA software engineer claimed to have installed such systems in police stations in the province.\nA human rights advocate who was shown the evidence described it as shocking.\nThe Chinese embassy in London has not responded directly to the claims but says political and social rights in all ethnic groups are guaranteed.\nXinjiang is home to 12 million ethnic minority Uyghurs, most of whom are Muslim.\nCitizens in the province are under daily surveillance. The area is also home to highly controversial \"re-education centres\", called high security detention camps by human rights groups, where it is estimated that more than a million people have been held. \nBeijing has always argued that surveillance is necessary in the region because it says separatists who want to set up their own state have killed hundreds of people in terror attacks.\nThe software engineer agreed to talk to the BBC's Panorama programme under condition of anonymity, because he fears for his safety. The company he worked for is also not being revealed. \nBut he showed Panorama five photographs of Uyghur detainees who he claimed had had the emotion recognition system tested on them.\n\"The Chinese government use Uyghurs as test subjects for various experiments just like rats are used in laboratories,\" he said.\nAnd he outlined his role in installing the cameras in police stations in the province: \"We placed the emotion detection camera 3m from the subject. It is similar to a lie detector but far more advanced technology.\"\nHe said officers used \"restraint chairs\" which are widely installed in police stations across China.\n\"Your wrists are locked in place by metal restraints, and [the] same applies to your ankles.\"\nHe provided evidence of how the AI system is trained to detect and analyse even minute changes in facial expressions and skin pores.\nAccording to his claims, the software creates a pie chart, with the red segment representing a negative or anxious state of mind.\nHe claimed the software was intended for \"pre-judgement without any credible evidence\".\nThe Chinese embassy in London did not respond to questions about the use of emotional recognition software in the province but said: \"The political, economic, and social rights and freedom of religious belief in all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are fully guaranteed.\n\"People live in harmony regardless of their ethnic backgrounds and enjoy a stable and peaceful life with no restriction to personal freedom.\"\nThe evidence was shown to Sophie Richardson, China director of Human Rights Watch.\n\"It is shocking material. It's not just that people are being reduced to a pie chart, it's people who are in highly coercive circumstances, under enormous pressure, being understandably nervous and that's taken as an indication of guilt, and I think, that's deeply problematic.\"\nAccording to Darren Byler, from the University of Colorado, Uyghurs routinely have to provide DNA samples to local officials, undergo digital scans and most have to download a government phone app, which gathers data including contact lists and text messages.\n\"Uyghur life is now about generating data,\" he said.\n\"Everyone knows that the smartphone is something you have to carry with you, and if you don't carry it you can be detained, they know that you're being tracked by it. And they feel like there's no escape,\" he said.\nMost of the data is fed into a computer system called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform, which Human Rights Watch claims flags up supposedly suspicious behaviour.\n\"The system is gathering information about dozens of different kinds of perfectly legal behaviours including things like whether people were going out the back door instead of the front door, whether they were putting gas in a car that didn't belong to them,\" said Ms Richardson.\n\"Authorities now place QR codes outside the doors of people's homes so that they can easily know who's supposed to be there and who's not.\"\nThere has long been debate about how closely tied Chinese technology firms are to the state. US-based research group IPVM claims to have uncovered evidence in patents filed by such companies that suggest facial recognition products were specifically designed to identify Uyghur people.\nA patent filed in July 2018 by Huawei and the China Academy of Sciences describes a face recognition product that is capable of identifying people on the basis of their ethnicity.\nHuawei said in response that it did \"not condone the use of technology to discriminate or oppress members of any community\" and that it was \"independent of government\" wherever it operated.\nThe group has also found a document which appears to suggest the firm was developing technology for a so-called One Person, One File system.\n\"For each person the government would store their personal information, their political activities, relationships... anything that might give you insight into how that person would behave and what kind of a threat they might pose,\" said IPVM's Conor Healy.\n\"It makes any kind of dissidence potentially impossible and creates true predictability for the government in the behaviour of their citizens. I don't think that [George] Orwell would ever have imagined that a government could be capable of this kind of analysis.\"\nHuawei did not specifically address questions about its involvement in developing technology for the One Person, One File system but said: \"Huawei opposes discrimination of all types, including the use of technology to carry out ethnic discrimination. \n\"As a privately-held company, Huawei is independent of government wherever we operate. We do not condone the use of technology to discriminate against or oppress members of any community.\"\nThe Chinese embassy in London said it had \"no knowledge\" of these programmes.\nIPVM also claimed to have found marketing material from Chinese firm Hikvision advertising a Uyghur-detecting AI camera, and a patent for software developed by Dahua, another tech giant, which could also identify Uyghurs.\nDahua said its patent referred to all 56 recognised ethnicities in China and did not deliberately target any one of them.\nIt added that it provided \"products and services that aim to help keep people safe\" and complied \"with the laws and regulations of every market\" in which it operates, including the UK.\nHikvision said the details on its website were incorrect and \"uploaded online without appropriate review\", adding that it did not sell or have in its product range \"a minority recognition function or analytics technology\".\nDr Lan Xue, chairman of China's National committee on AI governance, said he was not aware of the patents.\n\"Outside China there are a lot of those sorts of charges. Many are not accurate and not true,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I think that the Xinjiang local government had the responsibility to really protect the Xinjiang people... if technology is used in those contexts, that's quite understandable,\" he said.\nThe UK's Chinese embassy had a more robust defence, telling the BBC: \"There is no so-called facial recognition technology featuring Uyghur analytics whatsoever.\"\nChina is estimated to be home to half of the world's almost 800 million surveillance cameras.\nIt also has a large number of smart cities, such as Chongqing, where AI is built into the foundations of the urban environment.\nChongqing-based investigative journalist Hu Liu told Panorama of his own experience: \"Once you leave home and step into the lift, you are captured by a camera. There are cameras everywhere.\"\n\"When I leave home to go somewhere, I call a taxi, the taxi company uploads the data to the government. I may then go to a cafe to meet a few friends and the authorities know my location through the camera in the cafe.\n\"There have been occasions when I have met some friends and soon after someone from the government contacts me. They warned me, 'Don't see that person, don't do this and that.'\n\"With artificial intelligence we have nowhere to hide,\" he said.\nFind out more about this on Panorama's Are you Scared Yet, Human? - available on iPlayer from 26 May"

      "tags": "Poverty,Personal finance",
      "text": "More than a million households are struggling to pay their water bills, a consumer group has said.\nSome people have even had to skip meals to pay for water, the Consumer Council for Water (CCW) said.\nIt is calling for a single \"social tariff\", based on a percentage of people's incomes to lower the costs. \nThe government said it would work with industry to \"build a stronger, better and fairer water service for those who need it most\".\nAccording to the CCW, there are about 1.7 million people in \"water poverty\", which it defines as having to spend more than 5% of their income after housing costs on water bills.\nHowever, about three million households are in danger of slipping into this category.\nThese include people on Universal Credit, where any small shocks to their income could tip them over the edge, said Andy White, senior policy manager at CCW.\nHe said about 260,000 people were getting help with their bills from a patchwork of social schemes run by water companies. \nHowever, it is a \"postcode lottery\" as to how much help people can get - and the watchdog believes a social tariff would tackle this.\nThere has been significant focus in recent years on fuel poverty, and pressure placed on private companies to make sure the most vulnerable are protected. This research shifts that spotlight onto the affordability of another essential utility - water. \nWhether you are part of the 1.5 million households classed as currently in water poverty or the 3 million who are on the cusp of it, where you live can make a huge difference to the help you receive.\nSome companies ask struggling households to pay just 20% of a bill, while in other areas they still face the full charge. Some have a lowest bill guarantee, but many companies don't, and only half of the providers have a crisis fund for those most in need. \nAlthough most of these changes could be implemented immediately by companies themselves, the government would have to bring in new laws to create a social tariff which standardised that basic payment rate.\nCCW chief executive Emma Clancy said: \"We have a golden opportunity to create a simpler and fairer system and end the indignity of people skipping meals or other essentials to pay their water bill.\n\"Many people are craving certainty in these difficult times and these proposed changes would give millions of households one less thing to worry about and greater peace of mind - whatever the future holds.\"\nThe tariff would either be taxpayer funded, or taken from a single pot created by taking money from everyone's water bill in England and Wales.\nCCW has conducted independent reviews of water affordability in England and Wales. It found that five out of six customers who cannot afford their water bills are not getting the help they need, despite a significant rise in company support schemes over the past decade.\nIt also found that some of the schemes were hampered by insufficient funding and large regional variations in eligibility criteria.\nThose who are eligible get an average bill reduction of \u00a3190.\nCCW also urged the industry to do more to prevent households slipping into water poverty.\nThat could include giving customers greater choice over how they pay their water bills through technology, and providing tailored financial help.\nCompanies should also write off water charges while benefits claimants are awaiting their first Universal Credit payment, it added. \nEnvironment minister Rebecca Pow said she would consider the recommendations and work with the sector \"to build a stronger, better and fairer water service\".\nChristine McGourty, chief executive of Water UK, which represents water companies, said: \"Levels of support for customers have never been greater. \n\"Over the past year water companies have gone to unprecedented lengths to help hundreds of thousands of household customers who could least afford their bills, with support such as payment breaks and extra assistance for those most in need - but we know there's more to be done.\"\nGillian Cooper from Citizens Advice said: \"Water is essential, but sadly we know not everyone can easily afford it.\n\"As households continue to feel the impact of the pandemic, people facing financial difficulties need better support to help them pay their bills.\n\"CCW's proposal to establish a single social tariff would help make water bills affordable for all households on low incomes.\""

      "tags": "US gun violence,United States,California",
      "text": "An employee fatally shot nine people at a California train yard before turning the gun on himself as police closed in.\nThe shooting took place at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) site in San Jose.\nThe victims, named early on Thursday, include transit employees. No motive for the attack has been established.\nIt was the California Bay area's deadliest mass shooting since 1993, when eight people and a gunman died in a San Francisco skyscraper.\nAcross the US, there have been 231 mass shootings so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. A mass shooting is defined by the group as a crime in which four or more people are fatally shot.\nLaw enforcement officials told CBS News, the BBC's partner in the US, that the suspected gunman in this latest incident was 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy.\nAt a press conference on Thursday, VTA staff spoke about the victims, and the loss felt by VTA \"family\". \n\"Some of us get training on what to do when there is an active shooter event - but not about the aftermath,\" said  acting VTA CEO Evelynn Tran. \n\"I saw the immense pain of the families and I saw their faces when they got the news,\" she said. \"I felt immensely helpless.\"\nEight victims were initially reported dead on Wednesday afternoon. Mr Fritch, who had been taken to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in critical condition, died late on Wednesday bringing the total killed to nine.\nShots were first fired at around 06:30 local time (14:45 GMT) on Wednesday in the VTA light rail yard. According to a local CBS station, the attack unfolded during an employee meeting.  \nSanta Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez said that VTA employees had received active shooter training \"recently\". This training saved lives on Wednesday the sheriff's office told her. \nA spokesperson for Santa Clara County Sheriff's office told CBS said the shooter was still firing rounds when officers arrived at the scene. They added that sheriffs did not exchange gunfire with the gunman, and it is believed he took his own life as officers closed in on him.\nAmong the victims was Taptejdeep Singh, a light rail operator for the VTA. His cousin, Batta Singh, told the New York Times that Mr Singh was a gregarious man and the kindest person in his family. \nMr Singh had a wife and two young children, his cousin told the newspaper. Family members said that officials told them that Mr Singh tried to save his colleagues when the shooting began, calling out to alert his co-workers and ushering a woman into a secure room, the Times reported. \nMichael Rudometkin was a VTA union member, his family told the Washington Post. He was a \"wonderful son, brother, loving husband, uncle, cousin and friend to many\", his mother, Rose Rudometkin, said to the newspaper. \nPaul Peralez, who identified himself as a friend of \"Mikey\", posted a photo of him on Facebook, writing that he and his father had been planning a golf day with him.\n\"Now that will never happen again,\" Mr Peralez wrote. \"My family and I have lost a long time great friend and there are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family.\" \nAuthorities searched the VTA facility after a bomb-sniffing dog detected possible explosives at the site, though none were found.\nJeff Rosen, the county's district attorney, said the shooter used \"multiple guns\" - all of which had been registered.\nCassidy's ex-wife, Cecilia Nelms, told the Associated Press news agency that he told her he wanted to kill his colleagues, but she had never believed he would do it.\nDoug Suh, a neighbour of Cassidy, told the Mercury News the gunman was \"lonely\" and \"strange\".\nJust before the shooting, a fire broke out at a home belonging to Cassidy, according to local media. Authorities say they are looking into whether the suspect may have set his home on fire.\nSanta Clara is the largest county in California's Bay Area and is home to Silicon Valley, America's technology industry hub. It encompasses several cities in Northern California including Cupertino, San Jose and Mountain View. \nThe Santa Clara VTA operates three train lines, making up over 40 miles (65km) of rail. It also runs dozens of bus lines.\n\"These folks were heroes during Covid-19... The VTA never stopped running,\" said Santa Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez, according to CBS. \"They just kept at work, and now we're calling on them to be heroes a second time to survive such a terrible, terrible tragedy.\"\nSpeaking from near the crime scene, Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the \"rinse and repeat\" cycle of US mass shootings.\n\"What the hell is wrong with the United States of America?\" the Democrat said. \"When will we put down our arms?\" \nPresident Joe Biden called the attack a \"horrific tragedy\" and ordered flags to be flown at half mast as he again urged Congress to take action on gun control.\n\"Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation,\" he said. \"We can and we must do more.\""

And I'm not having the moment where I'm panicked,\" he said during the Apple TV interview.\nPage's Instagram post has already received over two million likes and a wave of supportive celebrity comments praising his new appearance.\n\"Dude I see why you crushed me on that workout!\" actor Justin Cornwell commented. \"Hot\" added singer Miley Cyrus, alongside a heart emoji. \nThe Vampire Diaries' Nina Dobrev said: \"You look amazing\u2026 and most of all happy.\" Julianne Moore, who starred with Page in the film Freeheld, wrote: \"Happy summer\" accompanied by a flame emoji.\nThe Good Place star Jameela Jamil also posted in recognition, tweeting that she was pleased to see Page \"thriving\".\nWinfrey, meanwhile, shared her support by reposting the image on the Oprah Daily Instagram account.\n\"This is what happiness looks like!\" she wrote. \"Looks like Elliot will be shining brighter than the sun this summer.\"\nPage, a prominent LGBT advocate, also used the pair's April interview to reveal how the surgery had given him a new energy in fighting for trans rights, \"because it is such a freeing, freeing experience\".\n\"Not only has it been life-changing for me, I do believe it's been life-saving and it's the case for so many people. And because there is such an attack on trans healthcare right now, when already there's such lack of access,\" he continued. \nPage was referring to laws in Arkansas and further legal fights across the US threatening to ban young transgender people from accessing certain medical treatments.\nKirrin Medcalf, Trans Community Engagement Lead at LGBT charity Stonewall, said the photo emphasised the positive impact that gender affirmation procedures can have upon a person's mental health.\n\"It's fantastic to see Elliot looking so comfortable and happy in his latest photo. Elliot's has always been a role model to a huge number of people, and it is wonderful that he can share his trans joy with the world. \n\"Seeing moments of gender euphoria also highlights how important it is for all trans people to be able to access appropriate and timely gender affirming healthcare,\" he said. \nFelix, 20 (He/Him):\n\"Looking at Elliot's image, it makes me feel proud to see another trans person - especially a celebrity in the public eye - proudly showing off their top surgery scars, as it increases a wider scope of positivity. \n\"However, as a person who has had to delay surgery due to the unbearable waiting times on the NHS, it makes me frustrated that people with more money and resources - such as celebrities - do not have to struggle in the same ways as people relying on state healthcare. \n\"In the UK, it can often up to 10 years, if not longer, to fully medically transition. We should not have to wait this long to feel comfortable in ourselves. \n\"I have been waiting to medically transition since I was 14. I am 20 now and haven't got anywhere. I am now planning to go to Poland after crowdsourcing funds to complete the surgery privately. I should not have to be at such inconvenience in order to be myself.\n\"That said, I think the wider impact of Elliot's post is good, as long as we keep having this conversation about privilege and how it plays into securing a medical transition. With each celebration of Elliot's visibility, I hope people will recognise those relying on personal crowdfunds.\"\nPage, who is Canadian-born, made his film breakthrough starring as a pregnant teenager in 2007's Juno - landing an Oscar nomination.\nOther major films include Inception and the X-Men series, before most recently starring as Vanya Hargreeves in Netflix superhero show Umbrella Academy.\nPage came out as gay in 2014, telling an audience in Las Vegas: \"I am tired of hiding and I am tired of lying by omission.\" After three years of marriage he announced his divorce from choreographer Emma Portner in February.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "A teacher who was suspended after showing children a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad can return to the classroom.\nProtests were held outside Batley Grammar School after the teacher showed an image during a religious studies lesson in March.\nAn independent investigation found the teacher did not intend to cause offence by showing the image.\nThe school said it would offer more guidance and training for staff.\nThe image was shown on more than one occasion to students during lessons earlier this year, the investigation found.\nDemonstrators gathered outside the school gates on two occasions, with some calling for the teacher to be sacked.\nIn an executive summary of the report, the trust said teaching staff \"genuinely believed that using the image had an educational purpose and benefit\".\nBut the trust said it recognised that using the image did cause \"deep offence\" to a number of students, parents and members of the school community, adding that it \"deeply regrets the distress\" caused.\nA spokeswoman for the Batley Multi Academy Trust said the school would put the recommendations from the report \"into practice immediately\".\nShe added: \"The findings are clear, that the teaching staff involved did not use the resource with the intention of causing offence, and that the topics covered by the lesson could have been effectively addressed in other ways.\n\"In the light of those conclusions, the suspensions put in place while the investigation was under way will now be lifted.\"\nThe National Education Union said it was \"pleased the correct decision has been reached\" following the lifting of the suspension.\nA Department for Education spokesperson said parents, families and the local community should \"welcome and support the trust's comprehensive plan to strengthen its oversight of the curriculum\".\nHowever, in a statement, Batley Parents and Community Partnership (BPCP), said while they \"acknowledge and welcome the lessons learnt\" they were \"disappointed at the lack of clarity, transparency and rationale behind some of the findings\".\nThe statement said \"given the background of this caricature\", the report \"fails to address how it is possible that teachers were unaware of the offence it would cause\".\nThe group also claimed representatives were supposed to have \"played an active role\" in the investigation and drafting of the report, something it said \"didn't transpire\".\nThe statement added that parents and the wider community needed to \"come together calmly\" to review the next steps.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "House of Commons,Conservative Party,Rob Roberts,UK Parliament",
      "text": "MPs suspended for sexual misconduct could in future face a recall petition too, as the UK government considers plugging a loophole in the rules.\nIt follows a recommendation that Tory Delyn MP Rob Roberts be suspended for six weeks for harassing an employee.\nThe process for handling such complaints does not include the power to trigger a recall petition.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was a decision for MPs but he felt \"this loophole does need to be closed\".\nThe former employee of Mr Roberts told BBC Wales the MP repeatedly propositioned him and asked him to be \"less alluring\".\nMr Roberts, who has had the Conservative whip withdrawn, said he apologised for a \"completely improper\" breach of trust \"in the MP-staff relationship\".\nMPs must decide whether to back the suspension recommended by an independent panel, but Labour and Plaid Cymru have urged Mr Roberts to resign.\nThey are expected to vote on the suspension on Thursday.\nCurrently the sanction of a recall petition on whether the MP should face a by-election only applies to cases assessed by the House of Commons Standards Committee.\nComplaints of bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct are investigated by a separate process, the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS).\nLabour has called this an \"absurd and unjust\" anomaly. \nShadow minister for domestic violence Jess Phillips told BBC Wales: \"Sexual harassment and abuse is not being considered at the same level as the misuse of Parliamentary paper and Parliamentary envelopes for example, or going on holidays paid for and not being declared.\"\nWhile such examples were \"very, very serious\", she said they \"in no way can compare to the safety issues even, that are presented to the thousands of people who work in and around Parliament\".\nOn whether the Delyn MP should stand down, Ms Phillips said: \"I think Rob Roberts should without question, if he had even a single bone of decency in his body, resign his position.\"\nEarlier, Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while a change in the rules would be a decision for MPs, he added: \"I rather agree that this loophole does need to be closed.\n\"I don't think there's any place for this kind of behaviour in the House, or indeed in society, so I think that's very straightforward.\n\"I really praise the individual who came forward quite bravely on this as well. \n\"I think that this should not have the exemption from recall, just because it's gone through this newly-independent process.\"\nAsked about the matter at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said that having the Conservative whip withdrawn was \"condign\", or appropriate, punishment in this particular case.\nA UK government spokesman said: \"A case of this severity highlights the need to look again at whether the process is striking the right balance between protecting the confidentiality of complainants and ensuring consistency with other types of conduct cases.\n\"The central aim of the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme is to help improve the working culture of Parliament and it will need to continue to evolve and improve over time. \n\"The Leader of the House will invite the relevant bodies to consider whether any changes could be made in future to the process to enable recall to be triggered.\" "

      "title": "How rising patient numbers threaten to overwhelm GPs",
      "tags": "Doctors,NHS,Cancer",
      "text": "Rising numbers of patients needing care and a shortage of GPs is threatening to overwhelm the system, doctors and patient groups are warning.\nIt comes after the pandemic has caused severe disruption to GP practices for more than a year.\nAnalysis of NHS England data by the Health Foundation found more than 28 million appointments were booked in March, among the highest recorded.\nDoctors' leaders say what they are being asked to achieve is \"undoable\".\nThe analysis of NHS Digital data in England carried out by the Health Foundation for the BBC also found that that between 2019-20 and 2020-21:\nThe escalating situation has prompted patient groups to call for an urgent review of access to services, amid reports that patients are struggling to get through.\nDoncaster-based GP Dr Dean Eggitt has never seen anything like this: \"We have almost a tsunami of patients coming to us - it feels like the river has flooded the banks. \n\"It just keeps coming and coming and coming in this one massive, endless wave of patients who all are ill and need help and input. \n\"They're sick, they're complex and we've got very few places to send them. I wouldn't want to be my patient right now.\"\nDr Eggitt's experience is not unique. There were 28.4 million appointments in March, once you include those made with practice nurses as well as GPs - that is one of the highest on record.\nBut he says he worries most about the \"hidden wave of patients who don't get through\".\nOne of those is Sharron, who ended up in hospital after she struggled on at home for weeks getting more and more sick. She was eventually diagnosed with colitis and had lost so much blood, she needed four emergency blood transfusions.\nShe says a combination of busy phone lines and not wanting to bother the practice meant she deteriorated at home. \"When I finally got through I knew I was really poorly, I had never felt so ill in my life.\"\nShe was immediately invited in for a consultation and sent to hospital.\nThere could be millions of people in a similar position. There were 279 million appointments made with GP practices in England from April 2020 to March 2021, compared with 310 million the year before. \nThe biggest drops were seen in the Midlands, North East, Yorkshire and East of England, according to the Health Foundation analysis.\nThe data is not collected elsewhere in the UK, but the reports surfacing suggest the problems are similar. That has, the Health Foundation warns, created a huge amount of unmet need. \nThis much can be seen from the drop in urgent referrals where GPs suspect someone has cancer. The numbers sent to hospital for check-ups have dropped by 15% since the pandemic started - that's potentially 367,000 people with symptoms who have not been sent for further investigations.\nSara Bainbridge, from Macmillan Cancer Support, says the disruption to services has had a \"devastating impact\", saying it is leading to fewer diagnoses, and reducing survival chances.\nAnd it's not just cancer patients. Dr Becks Fisher, a GP in Oxford and senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation, says there are people with other serious conditions, such as heart failure and non-Covid respiratory problems, who have stayed away too.\n\"Their health will have deteriorated as they have not been getting the help they need. The people we are seeing now are coming in with really complex problems. And it is those in deprived areas who have been affected the most.\"\nShe says this is being compounded by a significant rise in people seeking help with mental health problems, as well as those \"ricocheting\" back from hospital because their health has worsened while waiting for treatment. \nLatest figures show there are more than 400,000 people who have been waiting over a year for routine treatment, such as knee and hip replacements - up from 1,600 when the pandemic began.\n\"I think we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg at the moment - this is going to get a lot worse in the coming months\" added Dr Fisher.\nOne of the key barriers, some say, is the lack of face-to-face care that is available. Social distancing restrictions and infection control procedures mean GPs have had to rely heavily on remote consultations.\nThe number of face-to-face consultations has dropped significantly - down from 79% of total appointments in 2019-20 to 54% in 2020-21. And even now with restrictions easing, the numbers being brought in are still well short of what they were.\nOne of those who has fallen foul of this is Helen Cowley, 55, from Swindon. She had a telephone consultation for ear pain and was advised to seek private treatment for the build-up of ear wax. When she got to the clinic, they diagnosed an ear infection and she had to phone her practice back.\n\"It was nearly two months before I got the proper treatment - and to be fair I thought it was ear wax too. It was obviously not the most serious problem in the world, but not being able to be seen face-to-face is not ideal. You can see how things can be missed and for some patients that may have huge consequences.\"\nPatient watchdog Healthwatch England is particularly concerned about the lack of face-to-face appointments, and is calling for an urgent review into the situation. \nNational Director Imelda Redmond said while remote consultations suit some patients, there are many who have struggled with the arrangements that have been put in place.\n\"Those affected are often the most vulnerable in our society - older people, disabled people, those affected by homelessness and on low incomes.\"\nThe issue has already prompted action at the highest level. NHS England wrote to GPs in mid-May saying patients must be offered face-to-face appointments if that is their preference, unless there was good reason not to, such as the patient displaying Covid symptoms. Extra funding has been provided too.\nBut the move has been met with some opposition from GP leaders who have raised concerns about the lack of space in GP practice buildings, with the British Medical Association's GPs committee even passing a motion of no confidence in NHS England. \nBMA GP leader Dr Richard Vautrey says doctors were left \"angry, frustrated and disappointed\" by the letter, especially given the \"incredible contribution\" GPs have made to the vaccination programme - around three-quarters of jabs have been given in GP-led settings.\nIn many ways, this is a problem that has been building for a while. There has been a big push in recent years by the government to increase the number of GPs to keep up with rising demand, but once you exclude locums and trainees the number of permanent GPs has actually fallen by nearly 2,000 in the past few years to just under 27,000 full-time GPs.\nProf Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, says it means what is being asked of the profession now is simply \"undoable\". \n\"General practice was already facing intense workforce and workload pressures - the pandemic has only exacerbated these. We urgently need more GPs and other members of the practice team.\"\nAdditional reporting by Ruth Clegg\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick\nHave you been able to see your GP?

      "title": "Stephen Hawking's papers to be saved for the nation",
      "tags": "University of Cambridge,Stephen Hawking",
      "text": "Prof Stephen Hawking's scientific papers and personal possessions are to be saved for the nation.\nThe objects include childhood letters, scripts from his TV appearances and Prof Hawking's ground-breaking research into black holes.\nThe 10,000-page archive will be kept in perpetuity at Cambridge University library.\nHis office will be reconstructed in the Science Museum next year and selected highlights will go on display.\nProf Hawking's son, Tim, said that the family was delighted that his body of work and memories of his life were being safeguarded for future generations.\n\"Our father would be really pleased,\" he said. \"It was really important during his lifetime that science be opened up to the widest possible number of people and be democratized and not be the preserve of the elite few.\"\nThe collection encompasses Prof Hawking's personal and professional life. Particularly touching is a letter by Hawking to his father on family-headed notepaper that was written when the future professor was six years old. \nIn child-like lettering, with several crossings out, the young Stephen tells his father a story about pirates loading treasure. He signs off with hugs and kisses.\nTim Hawking saw the note for the first time only recently.\n\"I would write my dad letters along those lines,\" he reminisces fondly. \"It was quite nice to see it being passed along the generations and appreciating that he had a loving relationship with his dad, as I did when I was (that) age. It shows a tenderness in his relationship with his father which I hadn't fully understood until now.\" \nProf Hawking was a prolific letter writer. He communicated with popes, US presidents and Nobel laureates. \nThe letters, however, show his handwriting deteriorating after a diagnosis of motor neurone disease in 1963. Its progression is captured by the increasingly misshapen letters and inkblots on the page. \nProf Hawking made an immense contribution to science. But his status as the world's most famous scientist was partly because of his appearances on popular TV programmes such as Star Trek and Big Bang Theory. Among the archive is Hawking's personal script from his first appearance on the Simpsons, in 1999.\nIn the episode, Prof Hawking and Homer Simpson go to Moe's Tavern for a drink. Prof Hawking becomes intrigued by Homer's theory of a \"doughnut-shaped Universe\" and wonders if he can steal it. Homer imitates him, in an attempt to make him pay the bar bill and gets punched by a boxing glove on a spring, concealed in Prof Hawking's wheelchair.\nDr Jessica Gardner, who is Cambridge University's director of library services said the scripts reflect an important aspect of Prof Hawking's contribution to the communication of science. \n\"He had an enormous sense of humour. He was willing to be in the Simpsons, to let fun be taken, if what that did was to help communicate science and help people get excited about it,\" she explained.\nTo have these scripts shows the celebrity part of his life, but also that he was determined to break down the barriers to science.\"\nThe star attraction for historians will be Prof Hawking's research papers and correspondence with his collaborators. They are a record of how his unique mind worked, cataloguing corrections and changes in his ideas over time. \nProf Paul Shellard, who worked with him at Cambridge University, said that the collection of papers had a profound influence on our understanding of space-time and the Universe.\n\"It's a wonderful thing that historians of science can get an idea of how Stephen thought about these problems,\" Prof Shellard explained. \"He saw further than others and I hope that (his) intuition and way of thinking will come through in the archive and be remembered in perpetuity.\"\nThe collection contains a glowing letter, from Prof Hawking's PhD supervisor, to the 22-year-old budding researcher's dad, Frank. \n\"It is such a pleasure to supervise him,\" writes Prof Denis Sciama, a noted physicist at the time who is credited as a father of modern cosmology. \"Indeed, I'm at a stage... that I am learning from him\".\nAccompanying a seminal 1974 scientific paper, on how black holes are not completely black, is a cover letter to the editor of one of the world's leading scientific journals, Nature. In it we see a confident, if not downright cocky young man, in little doubt about the importance of his research paper.\nThe contents of Prof Hawking's office, including his custom-built wheelchairs, communications equipment, and office furniture, will be transferred to the Science Museum. According to the museum's director, Sir Ian Blatchford, although rooms of decorative or artistic interest are often kept for posterity, spaces relevant to scientific discovery are rarely saved. \n\"By preserving Hawking's office, future generations will be able to delve deep into the world of a leading theoretical physicist who defied the laws of medicine to rewrite the laws of physics and touch the heart of millions,\" Sir Ian said. \n\"These remarkable items might even inspire the next Hawking to wonder about the world around us.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter."
