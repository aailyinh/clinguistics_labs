      "text": "A tiger's eye has been saved in what is believed to be the first ever operation of its type in the world on a big cat.\nRatna, a 17-year-old Sumatran tiger, lives at Shepreth Wildlife Park near Cambridge.\nStaff noticed her left eye - which had previously had a cataract removed - was deteriorating and a corneal ulcer was diagnosed by a specialist eye vet.\nCorneal surgery, which is not uncommon on domestic cats and dogs, required \"a lot more anaesthetic\" on Ratna.\nSurgeon Dr David Williams, from the Queen's Veterinary School Hospital at the University of Cambridge, said after two months of careful monitoring, he was \"delighted to be able to sign Ratna off\" as fully healed.\nThe tiger had cataract surgery before she and her daughter were moved to the wildlife park in early 2019 to live out their twilight years.\nBecause she needed daily eyedrops, the health of her left eye was being closely monitored by staff.\nAn initial operation, carried out in early February to treat a discolouration, did not have the desired effect and her eye continued to deteriorate.\nDr Williams, who went to Shepreth to check on the ulcer, said: \"I think perhaps she'd managed to jab her eye on a stick of bamboo in her enclosure.\"\nThe very next day, together with Steve Philp, a vet from the International Zoo Veterinary Group, he carried out what is believed to be a world-first operation on a big cat.\nThe hood graft procedure involved \"a flap of conjunctiva - the pink of the eye - secured over the cornea, which allows the cornea to heal itself\", said Dr Williams.\n\"It's like we might do with any domestic cat - but with a lot more anaesthetic,\" he said of the 30-minute operation on the 14st 9lb (93kg) tiger.\n\"But I don't think anyone's ever done this before in this species.\"\nRatna's favourite pastime is sitting on the top platform in her enclosure, but the park's director, Rebecca Willers, said before the operation she seemed to have become a little uncertain about getting down again.\n\"Her co-ordination seems much better now, and the best thing is the operation has eradicated the need for Ratna to have her eyedrops - and she was never that keen on those,\" she added.\nDr Williams said it was unlikely Ratna could see much before with her left eye, as \"it was a horrendous mess... but the key thing is to have saved the eye itself\".\n\"I think her eyesight in that eye wasn't fantastic after her cataract surgery and is pretty poor after the injury - but she gets on fine with the good vision in her other eye - and we have stopped the problem giving her any pain,\" he said.\nHaving just given her a clean bill of health, he said Ratna had been \"fantastic\" - allowing him to look at her eye over the past weeks, and was now  \"absolutely fine - you'd never know anything had been wrong\".\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "Myanmar's military has entered a small town in western Chin state which took up arms against them three weeks ago.\nActivists from the volunteer Chinland Defence Force say they have retreated from Mindat to spare the town further bombardment. \nMindat is one of several towns where opponents of the military have armed themselves.\nNearly 800 people have died in mainly unarmed protests at February's coup which ousted the elected government.\nBBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head says the army now appears to control Mindat.\nFor three weeks they have been fighting against local people armed mainly with homemade hunting guns, and dozens of soldiers are reported to have been killed. \nThe rebels said six of their fighters had died.\nSome of the population of Mindat is believed to have fled into the surrounding forests. Others remain trapped in the town. \n \"We will not stay any more in the town... but we will come back to attack soon,\" a spokesman for the rebel group said, quoted by AFP news agency. \"We only have homemade guns. This was not enough.\" \nThe army was forced to use helicopters to bring in troop reinforcements, as at least three of its road convoys were ambushed.\nLocal residents in Mindat set up what they called a People's Administration Team, stating that they did not recognise the authority of the military government. \nEarlier this week the government declared martial law in the town. It has described those defying its authority there as terrorists, and says it will set up a military tribunal to put on trial those responsible for attacks on the security forces.\nThe US and UK have condemned the violence.\n\"The military's use of weapons of war against civilians, including this week in Mindat, is a further demonstration of the depths the regime will sink to to hold onto power,\" the US embassy said in a statement.\n\"Attacks on civilians are illegal and cannot be justified,\" the British embassy said.\nMyanmar's military has justified the February takeover by alleging there had been widespread fraud during a general election late last year which had returned elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party (NLD) to power.\nThe military promised instead that it would hold \"free and fair\" elections once the state of emergency is over.\nBut it has been met with widespread protests - which it has brutally suppressed."

      "text": "Police have arrested four men in connection with a video which appeared to show anti-Semitic abuse being shouted from a car in north London.\nBoris Johnson earlier condemned the \"shameful racism\" aimed at British Jews, which had \"no place\" in society.\nThe person who filmed the video told the BBC they cried after witnessing the scene, adding: \"I don't feel safe.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the incident was \"utterly disgusting\", adding: \"There must be consequences\".\nIt comes as Israel launched strikes on the Gaza Strip after Palestinian militants fired rockets at southern Israeli cities in the worst violence in the region since 2014.\nOn Sunday, a video was posted on social media appearing to show a convoy of cars with Palestinian flags driving down a street, with a man shouting anti-Semitic abuse from a megaphone.\nThe person who filmed the video - who wanted to remain anonymous - said they started filming when they heard \"excessive hooting\" outside their window in north London.\n\"They happened to stop at a set of traffic lights and I was able to capture what happened.\n\"I cried. How is this the world we live in today?\"\nThey added: \"I felt immediately frightened and appalled that this is happening in this country. What if I was walking alone wearing something that identified me as Jewish? What might have happened?\n\"I don't feel safe in my own home, and that's what terrifies me.\"\nIn a statement, the Metropolitan Police said it deployed one of its helicopters to help trace the vehicle and officers stopped the car at approximately 18:30 BST on Sunday.\nFour men were arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated public order offences. They have been taken into custody at a west London police station where they remain.\nThe police said the video appeared to be filmed in the St John's Wood area. St John's Wood is an area in north London which is home to a Jewish community.\nSuperintendent Jo Edwards, in charge of the policing operation, said the behaviour was \"utterly shocking\" and added that extra police patrols will be in place in St John's Wood and Golders Green on Sunday evening.\nOfficers will be sent to key venues, police said, \"to provide maximum reassurance to the local community, and deal robustly with anyone committing racially aggravated offences towards the Jewish community\".\nThe prime minister was among many politicians to condemn the video on social media. \n\"There is no place for anti-Semitism in our society,\" Mr Johnson tweeted. \"Ahead of Shavuot, I stand with Britain's Jews who should not have to endure the type of shameful racism we have seen today.\" \nShavuot is a Jewish festival beginning on Sunday that celebrates when the children of Israel received the Ten Commandments.\nSir Keir said: \"Utterly disgusting. Anti-Semitism, misogyny and hate have no place on our streets or in our society. There must be consequences.\"\nMike Freer, the local MP for Finchley and Golders Green, said: \"The scenes I've witnessed in my constituency today have left me sick to my stomach.\"\nThe Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the police had his \"full backing\" for their zero-tolerance approach, and Londoners could expect to see \"high visibility police patrols\".\n\"Hate crimes are inexcusable and have no place in our city,\" he said.\nThe Palestine Solidarity Campaign - one of the organisers of a protest in London on Saturday in support of the Palestinians - also condemned the incident.\n\"The vile anti-Semitism shouted today from a convoy of cars has no place in the Palestine solidarity movement,\" it said in a tweet. \"We condemn it and all anti-Semitism, on it's own account and also as it serves to undermine the anti-racist struggle for Palestinian rights.\"\nThousands of people attended Saturday's protest, which called on the UK government to step in and \"stop allowing Israel's brutal violence against and oppression of the Palestinian people to go unpunished\"."

      "tags": "Gaza border clashes,Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Palestinian territories,Gaza,Jerusalem",
      "text": "A ceasefire was agreed on 21 May between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. \nIt came after 11 days of fighting, which left at least 255 people dead. Most of those killed were Palestinians in the territory of Gaza.\nIsrael and Hamas both claimed victory in the latest conflict. \nThe violence in May followed a month of rising tensions in Jerusalem. But the fighting has gone on for decades.\nBritain took control of the area known as Palestine after the ruler of that part of the Middle East, the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in World War One. \nThe land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority. \nTensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave Britain the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. \nFor Jews it was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.\nBetween the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe and seeking a homeland after the Holocaust of World War Two.\nViolence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also grew.\nIn 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. \nThat plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.\nIn 1948, unable to solve the problem, British rulers left and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the state of Israel.\nMany Palestinians objected and a war followed. Troops from neighbouring Arab countries invaded.\nHundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\".\nBy the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. \nJordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. \nJerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.\nBecause there was never a peace agreement - with each side blaming the other - there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.\nIn another war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.\nMost Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\nNeither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.\nIsrael still occupies the West Bank, and although it pulled out of Gaza the UN still regards that piece of land as occupied territory. \nIsrael claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.\nIn the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in these areas, where more than 600,000 Jews now live.\nPalestinians say these are illegal under international law and are obstacles to peace, but Israel denies this.\nTensions are often high between Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank. \nGaza is ruled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has fought Israel many times. Israel and Egypt tightly control Gaza's borders to stop weapons getting to Hamas. \nPalestinians in Gaza and the West Bank say they are suffering because of Israeli actions and restrictions. Israel says it is only acting to protect itself from Palestinian violence.\nThe threatened eviction of some Palestinian families in East Jerusalem has also caused rising anger.\nThere are a number of issues which Israel and the Palestinians cannot agree on. \nThese include: what should happen to Palestinian refugees; whether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removed; whether the two sides should share Jerusalem; and - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside Israel. \nPeace talks have been taking place on and off for more than 25 years, but so far have not solved the conflict.\nIn short, the situation isn't going to be sorted out any time soon.\nThe most recent peace plan, prepared by the United States when Donald Trump was president, was called \"the deal of the century\" by Israel's then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But it was been dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.\nAny future peace deal will need both sides to agree to resolve complex issues.\nThe BBC's Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, says the latest round of violence in May was the fourth big war between Hamas and Israel since 2008.\nHe's seen previous wars end like this before: \"Similar things have been said by both sides in claiming victory and then essentially the seeds of the next conflict are sown.\n\"I can tell you one thing for certain - that if the status quo does not change favourably, there will be another round of this.\"\nCorrection 21st June 2021: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the US as recognising Israel's claim to the whole of Jerusalem and this has been amended to instead explain that the US recognises the city as Israel's capital.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "No 10 has defended its decision not to ban travel from India sooner, amid concern that the coronavirus variant first discovered there is now spreading quickly in parts of the UK.\nIndia was reporting more than 100,000 cases a day by 5 April, but was not added to the red list until 23 April. \nThe government said the UK has \"some of the toughest border measures\".\nIt comes after the British Medical Association raised concerns about Monday's relaxation of Covid rules.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that the B.1.617.2 Indian variant could pose \"serious disruption\" to the final stage of lockdown easing in England on 21 June - but insisted Monday's easing would go ahead as planned.\nScientists advising the government are confident the Indian variant spreads more easily, with cases of it nearly tripling to 1,313 in the past week in England.\nAsked why the borders were not closed sooner, a government spokesman told the BBC: \"We took precautionary action to ban travel from India on 23 April, six days before this variant was put under investigation and two weeks before it was labelled as of concern. \n\"Prior to India being placed on the red list in April anyone coming to the UK had to test negative and quarantine for 10 days.\"\nBy the time the travel ban came into force, daily Covid cases in India had risen above 330,000.\nSurge testing is now taking place in targeted areas across England where virus variants have been found, including postcodes within Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen, several London boroughs, Sefton, Worcestershire, and Nottingham.\nDespite concern about the Indian variant, coronavirus restrictions across England, Scotland and Wales are due to be relaxed from Monday.\nCurbs lifting across the devolved nations vary, but there will be a greater degree of indoor mixing allowed and more hospitality venues will be able to reopen.\nNorthern Ireland is due to review its restrictions later this month.\nOn Saturday, the British Medical Association (BMA) said it had serious concerns about the decision to continue with the easing of lockdown restrictions.\n\"It is a real worry that when further measures lift on 17 May, the majority of younger people, who are often highly socially mobile and could therefore be most at risk of a more infectious strain, are not yet vaccinated,\" said the BMA's Dr Richard Jarvis.\nMinutes from a meeting of government scientific advisers, held on Thursday, said that \"an even faster increase can be expected if measures are relaxed\" in areas where the Indian variant is already spreading.\nAnd if the variant was 40-50% more transmissible than the current dominant type, they warned proceeding to step three of England's roadmap on Monday would likely \"lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations (similar to, or larger than, previous peaks)\".\nSpeaking on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was a \"high degree of confidence\" that the current vaccines worked against the Indian variant, which meant the government could \"stay on course with our strategy of using the vaccine to deal with the pandemic and opening up carefully and cautiously\".\nHe said it was \"appropriate\" to continue with the major easing of restrictions in England on Monday, adding that a decision on whether all legal restrictions could be ended next month would be made on 14 June.\nLabour's Yvette Cooper told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the government should be \"much more cautious\" about lifting international travel restrictions, saying that the home quarantine system and surveillance system needed to be much stronger than they were.\nOn Monday in England, and on time, is step three of the government's easing of coronavirus restrictions - the reopening of indoor hospitality and entertainment venues, the reopening of our homes to friends, the lifting of most social contact rules outside, the return of hugs. \nBut the prospect of all of this collides with huge questions about the so-called Indian variant, and just how easily it is spread. \nSome of the government's scientific advisers fret that its potential transmissibility, coupled with a lot more socialising, could have grave consequences, although it's acknowledged much is still unknown; the data is partial. \nBut ministers are keen to push back on claims they acted too late in restricting travel from India, pointing out that it was six days after the country was put on the red list that the variant now causing alarm was first put under investigation and a week after that before it was labelled a \"variant of concern\". \nA spokesman said the decision to add countries to the red list was based on what they called \"extensive consideration of the type of cases that are imported, rather than the amount\".\nProf John Edmunds, who sits on the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the BBC's Andrew Marr people should be \"concerned but not panicking\" about the new variant.\n\"We are in a much, much better position than we were when the Kent variant started spreading,\" he said, pointing to hospitals having few Covid patients and the vaccine programme being in place.\nHe said he did not think that the spread of the Indian variant could have been avoided by adding the country to the red list sooner, but said \"we could have delayed things a little bit\".\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said even though rules were being eased in most parts of the UK on Monday people should be cautious about mixing.\nHe added that speeding up the delivery of second doses would help boost the immune response of more vulnerable people.\n\"We really do need to think carefully about how we use those doses most effectively to avert this problem turning in to a disaster,\" he said.\nIn Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said initial research suggested an outbreak in the south side of Glasgow was being driven by the Indian variant - as she delayed the easing of restrictions there and in Moray.\nIn England, six people or two households can meet indoors, with pubs, restaurants and cafes allowed to serve customers inside. Up to 30 people can meet outdoors. Museums, cinemas, theatres and sports stadiums can reopen, and indoor exercises resume. People can travel abroad to green list countries without needing to quarantine when they return.\nUp to six people from a maximum of three households can socialise indoors in Scotland, and entertainment venues such as cinemas, theatres and bingo halls can reopen. Alcohol can be served indoors in hospitality venues until 22:30, and international travel will be allowed in line with England's rules.\nIn Wales, pubs, cafes, bars and restaurants reopen for indoor service, with groups of up to six from six households permitted to meet. All holiday accommodation can reopen fully, as can indoor visitor attractions, such as galleries and museums. International travel can resume in line with the traffic light system.\nNorthern Ireland is reviewing its restrictions on 20 May, with the hope more restrictions will be lifted on 24 May.\nYou can read more about the changes across the UK here.\nMeanwhile, there has been a \"surge\" in vaccination bookings in England ahead of the rule changes, according to the NHS, with more than 600,000 people booking appointments in the past two days.\nThe rise in bookings comes after it was announced that those in their late 30s with no underlying health conditions can now book their jabs in England.

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

Until now they've adopted a low-key minimalist approach in this graveyard of American-led peace initiatives, quietly trying to restore some elements of US policy upended by the Trump administration's unabashedly pro-Israel stance. \nThat has meant concentrating on repairing ruptured relations with the Palestinians, and voicing rhetorical support for a viable Palestinian state as key to a lasting peace with Israel. \nBut they've calculated the prospects for a new round of negotiations as bleak, and are determined to shift the focus of American foreign policy to China. \nThe sudden shift back to the Middle East this week has seen a return to a traditional pattern. \nIn public statements the president and his Secretary of State Antony Blinken have forcefully repeated the standard American formula about Israel's right to self-defence in the face of Palestinian rocket fire.\nWhile expressing concern about the mounting number of Palestinians killed in Israeli air strikes, Mr Blinken has drawn a \"clear and absolute distinction\" between \"a terrorist organisation targeting civilians, and Israel\u2026 targeting the terrorists\".\nBiden has seen no \"significant overreaction\" in the Israeli response to the barrage of Hamas missiles, a judgment that some analysts took as an implicit green light for the operation to continue, despite US calls for calm. \nHussein Ibish of the Arab Gulf States Institute says Washington typically gives Israel an initial \"carte blanche\" to respond to rocket attacks \"until they think Israel has had enough of a chance to do what it needs to do\" to destroy militant infrastructure.\nThe Biden administration also blocked UN Security Council action this week, where the US often stands alone in defending Israel from criticism, arguing that a statement or public meeting would hinder behind-the-scenes diplomacy. It has now agreed to an emergency session on Sunday. \nBut it had to rapidly step up its game on the diplomatic front without a full team in place; there is not even a nominee yet for ambassador to Israel. \nMr Blinken and other senior officials have been working the phones with their Israeli counterparts. There have been urgent calls with Arab countries to try to help shape a regional response led by Egypt.   \nAnd the secretary of state has dispatched his top official for Israeli and Palestinian affairs, Hady Amr, to the region, although Mr Amr is a mid-level diplomat without the kind of rank held by special envoys in previous administrations.   \n\"One signal of a more resolute stance in the behind-the-scenes diplomacy would have been to send someone more senior,\" says Daniel Kurtzer, a former US ambassador to Israel.\nDevastating as it is, the Gaza air strikes are familiar territory, unlike the explosion of unrest in Jerusalem which sparked them.\nThe eastern part of the city - captured by Israel in 1967, claimed by the Palestinians and home to holy sites for both - has always been a flashpoint. Its future was set to be determined in peace negotiations. But right-wing Israeli governments together with Jewish settler groups have been squeezing out the Palestinians, and that activity became particularly brazen during the Trump administration. \nPresident Biden's team did not notice warning signs that this was becoming combustible, says Hussein Ibish. \"What it failed to do was prevent the Israeli right, both the settler movement and government, from pressing forward with really provocative moves on the ground.\"\nA campaign by the settlers to evict dozens of Palestinian families triggered a wave of protests. That was amplified by Palestinian anger over heavy-handed Israeli policing at the Al-Aqsa mosque, located on a mount revered by Muslims and Jews. There was also fury about plans for right-wing Jewish nationalists to march there through a Muslim neighbourhood, which was called off at the last minute. \nThe conflagration spread to demonstrations of solidarity by Palestinian citizens of Israel. And that has triggered a new and alarming wave of communal violence in Israeli cities with mixed Arab and Jewish populations.\nThe Biden administration must set red lines, says Daniel Kurtzer. \nIt needs to tell the Israeli government to \"Just stop it!\" when it comes to provocative steps in East Jerusalem, he says. \"They should say we support Israel's right to self-defence, but [this activity] needs to come to an end.\"  \nThe State Department did issue a statement calling for de-escalation on both sides in Jerusalem, shortly before the Hamas rocket fire changed the conversation. And Mr Blinken has declared deep concern about the \"violence in the streets of Israel\". \nBut it is \"a portent of things to come\", says Ibish. \nAnother challenge for the Biden administration is how to apply its message of a return to values-based foreign policy to the realities on the ground in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.\nIn recent statements, Mr Blinken has repeated that Palestinians and Israelis \"deserve equal measures of freedom, dignity, security and prosperity\". \nKhaled Elgindy of the Middle East Institute calls the formula \"new and significant\", but also vague and puzzling: \"Does it apply to the here and now?\" he wonders. \"Or is it aspirational in a final status arrangement? It hasn't been operationalised, so we don't know where it fits in. I think they don't know.\" \nThe left-wing of the Democratic Party has become increasingly vocal about criticizing what it sees as the glaring asymmetry in the exercise of all four values. \nIt is not clear what sort of political impact this will have: the lawmakers challenging the Democrats' traditional pro-Israel stance may not be inclined to a showdown with Biden because he has championed key causes that they cherish on the economy and climate.\nBut they are pushing to apply universal standards of human rights and international law to the treatment of Palestinians. They are calling for the administration to use the $3.8bn in annual Israeli military aid as leverage to that end. And in speeches on the House floor on Thursday, some framed it as a racial justice issue.\nAyanna Pressley, from Massachusetts, who is black, said she was \"no stranger to police brutality and state-sanctioned violence\". \nWhat the Biden administration would like, says Kurtzer, is \"to see the current round of Israel-Hamas fighting coming to an end, the situation in Jerusalem devolving into whatever you consider to be normal and then they can go back and focus on other things\". \nBut the chant \"No justice - No peace\" one of the rallying cries at anti-racist protests in the US, rang out at a Palestinian demonstration held in front of the State Department this week. \nDepending on the \"new normal\", this may serve to be a persistent way of keeping the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the Biden agenda."

      "text": "Some of the worst violence seen in years in Israel and Gaza has led to dramatic images of confrontation across the region's skies.\nMore than 3,000 rockets have been fired towards Israel by Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in the past week. \nBut about 90% of the rockets have been intercepted by its flagship Iron Dome missile defence system, according to the Israeli military.\nThe Iron Dome was specially designed to protect against a range of incoming short-range threats.\nThe system has its roots in the war Israel fought with Lebanon's militant Hezbollah movement in 2006, when thousands of rockets were launched into Israel - causing huge damage, mass evacuations and dozens of deaths.  \nAfter that Israel said a new missile defence shield would be developed.\nCreated by Israeli firms Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries with some US support, the Iron Dome became operational in 2011.\nConsidered among the most advanced defence systems in the word, the Iron Dome uses radar to identify and destroy incoming threats before they can cause damage. \nThe all-weather system was specially designed to help combat shorter-range rudimentary weapons like the rockets fired from Gaza.\nThe Iron Dome was expensive to develop but manufacturers say it is cost-effective because of technology it uses to differentiate between missiles likely to hit built-up areas and those that won't. Static and mobile units only launch interceptor missiles to shoot-down anything interpreted as dangerous. \nA decade since the Iron Dome became operational, Israel now has 10 batteries deployed across the country, each with three to four launchers that can fire 20 interceptor missiles.\n\"The number of Israelis killed and wounded would be far higher if it had not been for the Iron Dome system, which has been a life saver as it always is,\" Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said this week.\nBut some analysts say the intensity of recent barrages from Gaza suggests militant groups are attempting to overwhelm the Iron Dome - raising concerns about the system's possible limitations."

      "text": "People eligible for a vaccine in areas where the Indian virus variant is spreading are being urged to get the jab.\nHealth minister Edward Argar said there had been a \"minor increase\" in hospital presentations in Bolton, mainly among unvaccinated 35-65 year olds.\nThe Army is to be deployed in the Greater Manchester town and Blackburn with Darwen to help with mass testing.\nCases of the Indian variant have nearly tripled in the past week, data shows.\nSurge testing is taking place in targeted areas across England where virus variants have been found, including postcodes within several London boroughs, Sefton, Worcestershire, and Nottingham.\nProf Anthony Harnden, who advises the government on vaccinations, said there were still \"lots of unvaccinated people in at-risk groups in these areas\".\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The worry is that those unvaccinated vulnerable individuals, those over-50, unvaccinated, will develop Covid from this more transmissible [variant] and end up in hospital.\"\nIt comes as, according to Saturday's government figures, a further seven people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test and another 2,027 coronavirus cases have been recorded.\nMeanwhile, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said initial research suggested an outbreak in the south side of Glasgow was being driven by the Indian variant - as she delayed the easing of restrictions there and in Moray.\nProf Harnden said the Indian variant was \"clearly more transmissible\" than the current dominant virus type - but vaccines should still protect against severe disease.\n\"That's why we're imploring [local authorities] to get out there and vaccinate their unvaccinated people,\" he added.\nSecond doses will also be speeded-up for older age groups in affected areas - in a move described by Prof Harnden as providing \"better short-term protection\" in an \"urgent situation\".\nDr Helen Wall, who is leading the vaccination effort in Bolton, said the target for Saturday was to distribute 4,000 jabs.\nShe said 10,000 people eligible for jabs had yet to be vaccinated in the BL4 and BL5 postcode areas, with issues like not having phone credit to make a booking often cited as a reason for putting off taking the vaccine.\nAsked what would happen if a younger person turned up for a jab, Dr Wall said vaccinators were following the guidance but would \"look for reasons to vaccinate people, not reasons not to within those criteria of eligibility\".\nIt comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the new variant - first discovered in India - could affect the timing of the last step in England's roadmap out of lockdown from 21 June.\nMr Johnson said he did not believe that the \"present evidence\" showed a need to delay the next stage in the easing of lockdown in England on Monday.\nBut on Saturday, the British Medical Association said it had serious concerns about the decision to continue with the easing of lockdown restrictions in England on Monday.\n\"It is a real worry that when further measures lift on 17 May, the majority of younger people, who are often highly socially mobile and could therefore be most at risk of a more infectious strain, are not yet vaccinated,\" said Dr Richard Jarvis from the BMA.\nOnce again, the government is being forced to draw up an assessment of risk, with only partial epidemiological data, but where the economic and social costs of the restrictions are huge. \nIts scientists fret that if - and it's a big if - the Indian variant continues to spread much more quickly than others, the picture could soon look bleak.\nEver since the publication of the plan for easing restrictions in England in February, the prime minister's language has been peppered with references to it being \"cautious but irreversible\".\nThat allows for a slowing down, or even a halt to unlocking. But not going backwards. \nTo slam on the breaks now, postponing Monday's unlocking, would have been a big moment. \nTo go into reverse, if the data is dire in the coming weeks, would be bigger. \nOn several occasions last year, the government made promises about the return of normal life - or elements of it - which circumstances later meant it was unable to keep. \nIt has since been much more cautious, with some critics demanding it move more quickly - pressure it has resisted. \nOnly data in the coming weeks will determine conclusively if the decision to press ahead with reopening on Monday was, on balance, wise.\nMr Argar told BBC Breakfast the government was acting \"coolly\" and \"calmly\" in response to new research on the potential increased transmissibility of the Indian variant but \"keeping everything under review\".\nHe said: \"All the evidence so far suggests there is no evidence of increased severity of illness or that it evades the vaccine.\"\nMr Argar admitted some arrivals from India may have used public transport to travel home from the airport in the days before the country was placed onto the UK's travel red list on 23 April.\nHe told Today: \"I do think we have the right border controls in place to do everything we can to minimise the risk of, not just this variant, but other variants in the future.\"\nThere will be an acceleration of the vaccine rollout in Bolton, including longer opening hours at vaccination centres.\nMore doses have been delivered to the town, which has also set up a vaccine bus to increase uptake among those who are eligible under national guidelines.\nThe previous up to 12 week gap between first and second doses will be cut to just eight weeks in hotspot areas for the over-50s and people who are vulnerable.\nExtra clinics will open in Blackburn and Darwen in Lancashire from next week and the vaccination capacity of local pharmacies will also be increased.\nCurrently, England's vaccination rollout is open to healthy people over the age of 38, as well as adults with underlying conditions, and health and social care workers.\nMobile testing units have been set up in Bolton, PHE said, and door-to-door PCR testing had been offered to 22,000 residents. A PCR test is the most accurate way to check for Covid.\nA rapid response team of 100 nurses, public health advisers and environmental health officers has also been sent in.\nThe Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has said there is a \"realistic possibility\" that the Indian variant could be as much as \"50% more transmissible\" than the Kent strain.\nMinutes from a Sage meeting held on Thursday said that - if the Indian variant were to be 40-50% more transmissible - proceeding to step three of England's roadmap on Monday would likely \"lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations (similar to, or larger than, previous peaks)\".\nCases of the Indian variant found in the UK to date have nearly tripled in the past week to 1,313, Public Health England (PHE) said. \nMost of the cases - 1,255 - are in England, while there are 35 in Scotland, 12 in Northern Ireland and 11 in Wales, according to PHE.\nIt said four people have now died with the Indian variant of concern as of 12 May."

I urge everyone to get involved.\"\nThe Queen has herself planted more than 1,500 trees around the world during her reign.\nWoodland Trust chief executive, Darren Moorcroft, said the last year had \"emphasised the central role that trees and woods play in the life of the nation\".\nHe added: \"We need more projects like this, giving people access to our natural heritage, opportunities to do something positive for the environment, and helping to safeguard it for our children in the face of a combined climate and nature crisis.\""

      "text": "Thousands of British holidaymakers have begun taking advantage of the easing of lockdown rules on overseas travel.\nTravellers from England, Scotland and Wales are jetting off to some countries in what the crisis-hit tourism industry hopes is the start of a recovery.\nTravellers can now visit 12 countries on the government's green list, including Portugal and Israel, without isolating on their return.\nThe bosses of British Airways and Ryanair said confidence was returning.\nThe vast majority of tourist destinations remain on the amber and red lists, meaning travellers must quarantine when they get back.\nBookings also remain well down on pre-pandemic levels. \nHowever, BA chief executive Sean Doyle told the BBC that the airline's six flights due to depart from Heathrow on Monday to \"green\" destinations such as Lisbon, Faro and Madeira were \"very busy\".\nHe said the latest relaxation of restrictions was \"a small step in the right direction\".\nRyanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said there were definite signs of an early rebound in travel to European destinations.\nBookings are up from 500,000 a week in early April to 1.5 million a week now. \"The rate of bookings suggests there is a huge amount of confidence,\" he told BBC Breakfast. \"We are very optimistic for the next couple of months.\"\nNellie and Jill are off to Portugal on Monday - but it seemed touch and go right up to the moment they got to the airport.\nThey are \"super excited and really happy to be able to travel again\". But the past few weeks have been stressful, especially as it was only confirmed on Friday that they could definitely travel.\nNellie said it was then a real scramble to get PCR coronavirus tests over the weekend, which Jill added was quite complicated. \n\"Adding all the documentation wasn't easy but we persevered and we're glad we did,\" Jill said. Some holiday sun and a glass of wine on their balcony would make it all worth it, she added.\nGatwick Airport chief executive Stewart Wingate said welcoming holidaymakers for the first time in months was a \"big relief\".\nHe expected the number of travellers to increase significantly by the end of May - but this will still be less than 15% of the traffic seen in pre-pandemic times.\n\"It's an important day for us... we're looking forward to seeing more countries added to the green list in the weeks ahead,\" he added.\nBut there is still caution. Online travel agent Thomas Cook said the number of people booking to travel abroad was \"still small\".\nIt said 75% of its bookings were for Portugal, although Thomas Cook customers planning to jet off this week numbered only in their hundreds.\nOn Friday, Portugal announced that travellers from the UK would be allowed to enter its borders provided they could show a negative PCR test result from the previous 72 hours.\nThat led to an increase in demand for flights to the country. Tui, which has 19 flights scheduled from the UK to Portugal next week, said eight of those would now be on a Boeing Dreamliner, which can carry up to 345 people - almost twice as many people as the Boeing 737s that it had planned to use.\nMany of those who do intend to get away plan to do so in style. Thomas Cook reported that 85% of customers had booked four or five-star hotels. Before the crisis, only around half of people chose to splash out on that kind of luxury.\nHays Travel has noticed a similar trend. At present around half of its customers are booking for next year but it highlighted a \"cautious optimism\" among travellers following an almost four-fold increase in bookings for Portugal this summer.\nChief operating officer Jonathon Woodall said the average spend on a two-week holiday for a family of four had increased by \u00a3370 to \u00a34,000 as people look to \"fulfil their bucket list\". \n\"People are upgrading to better destinations and accommodation, spending more to treat themselves,\" he said. \nAfter months of keeping apart, travelling on a busy plane feels both familiar and strange. Face masks are mandatory except to allow for eating and drinking, but seats are not socially distanced. I was handed a complimentary antibacterial wipe on boarding. \nThe paperwork is far more complicated than normal. Alongside my passport and ticket, I'm carrying proof of my negative PCR test, a passenger locator form for Portugal and proof of my booked tests for my journey home. I'll have to complete another locator form to come back to the U.K. \nStill at 35,000 feet, we don't know how long the queues will be at the Portuguese border when we land or on the return journey. \nPassengers on board have said they feel a little like guinea pigs. The travel industry knows it's important to make this process smooth and safe if it's to have a good summer. \nWhile travel from England, Scotland and Wales is permitted to the 12 countries on the green list, most of the destinations are either remote islands or do not currently allow UK tourists to enter.\nAnd the government is advising people not to make non-essential trips to locations on its amber list, which covers popular destinations such as Spain, France, Italy and Greece. However, the guidance is expected to be ignored by some holidaymakers.\nEasyJet and Tui have both said that they will operate holidays to countries classified as amber, provided Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) does not advise against \"all but essential\" travel.\nThe majority of countries around the world are in the amber category, meaning that arrivals from these places to the UK are required to quarantine at home for 10 days as well as taking a Covid test before departure and two more on arrival.\nTravellers arriving back in England from an amber country have the option after five days of quarantine to pay for a private Covid test under the Test to Release scheme. If the result is negative, the quarantine can end.\nBA boss Sean Doyle said \"cautious optimism\" should be exercised when decisions are made about whether to expand the green list when it is reviewed on 7 June. \nHe said vaccination and infection rates in a number of the major aviation markets were \"trending positively\", noting that the US - an important market for both tourism and business \"now has 60% of its adult population vaccinated [and] infections are falling\". \nFrom Monday, people travelling abroad will be able to use the NHS app - which is different to the NHS Covid-19 app - to prove they have had the vaccine.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps previously said people who have had both doses will be able to use the app at border controls, although the government says people should still check countries' entry requirements as tests or quarantine might still be needed.\nAre you travelling abroad today?

      "tags": "Hospitality industry,UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Monday sees another milestone in the reopening of the economy: people in most of the UK will be able to go to a bar or restaurant and eat indoors.\nBut some favourite haunts will no longer be there: over the last year, thousands of establishments have closed, latest surveys indicate.\nAcross Britain, there are 9.7% fewer restaurants to choose from, compared with before the pandemic.\nAnd mid-market \"casual dining\" venues have fallen by 19.4%.\nThe data in the latest Market Recovery Monitor from CGA and AlixPartners suggests that while many pubs and bars have also struggled to survive the pandemic, it is restaurants that have fared worst.\nThat includes places such as Oskar Ali's in Newport in Wales. Oskar and his wife opened Falafilo Island, serving grilled meats and vegetables and falafel, in August 2018.\nThey invested thousands of pounds to set up the business, transforming the dark interior with a cheerful yellow ceiling and tree-patterned walls.\n\"We had so many lovely customers, but corona just hit us so hard, we had to close,\" Oskar told BBC Radio 4's The Food Programme.\nThey hoped a busy Christmas might save them, but Oskar's wife caught Covid and they had to isolate for two weeks.\n\"Then it was January and we thought: we should just close,\" he says. \"We couldn't survive, even with the grants they gave.\"\nOskar, a computer science graduate, now has thousands of pounds of debt and is looking for other work.\nCGA and AlixPartners measured the impact of the last 13 months on pubs and restaurants that hold a licence to serve alcohol. \nLooking at the net number of venues, once all closures and new openings were taken into account, they found pubs across Britain fared slightly better than the restaurant sector.\nThe number of pubs serving food has fallen by 4.2%. Bars and pubs that only serve drinks fell by 5.2%. \nBut on top of the near-20% fall in casual dining outlets, bar-restaurants, which make up a smaller part of the overall dining market, fell by 9.6%. \nGeneral restaurants, which are the largest dining out category, are down 10.2%.\n\"The main challenge for restaurants, in comparison to pubs, is that the restaurants all tend to be leased premises - they all have landlords and rent to pay,\" says Graeme Smith, managing director of AlixPartners. \n\"When their revenues stopped, their rental bills continued to build up, unless they managed to reach an agreement with their landlord. \n\"Unfortunately, with the burn of costs of rent and other costs of business, for a number of restaurants, that was simply too much to keep going through the period of closure.\"\nAnd while restaurants that belong to larger chains were sometimes able to fall back on the group financially, or negotiate agreements with landlords across the business, independent operators have found it harder to survive.\nThe restaurant sector was already shrinking before the pandemic, but the net losses between 2017 and 2019 were between 0.9% and 2.2% a year, according to CGA AlixPartners data.\nMany of those earlier losses were in crowded sectors such as burger bars. But losses over the past year have included businesses with otherwise promising futures.\nHendersons in Edinburgh was founded in the 1960s, and as vegetarian and vegan food became more fashionable, it had expanded to two new sites in the city.\nBefore the pandemic hit, it was trading strongly thanks to loyal customers and Edinburgh's throngs of summer visitors. But it relied completely on in-person footfall, says Janet Home, the third generation of the family to be involved in managing the business.\nWhen Covid hit, they tried to adapt, offering veg boxes and dry goods deliveries.\n\"We didn't have anything set up, the website wasn't set up for online delivery, there were so many processes we needed to go through,\" says Janet. \n\"With all the competition out there, there was no way we could cover all the running costs of the business.\"\nIn July, faced with redundancy payments for 35 staff, they reached breaking point.\n\"It was a soul-destroying decision the family had to come to, says Janet. \"We knew it was game over.\"\nLooking back she has no doubt it was the right decision. They would need to run at 60-75% capacity to cover their costs, which is difficult with social distancing rules still in place.\n\"Even if we were in a position to reopen now, the tourists are going to take time to come back, the offices are not at capacity, [some] students are working from home.\"\nThe Local Data Company, which monitors changes to property use across England, Scotland and Wales, says the biggest net losses were in American and Italian restaurants. \nBut some categories saw a net gain in the number of outlets, according to their data, including vegan and Japanese restaurants.\nGraeme Smith from AlixPartners says he expects the churn to continue in the next few months.\nThere's a \"cliff edge\" at the end of June for many restaurants, he points out, because after that point landlords can demand unpaid rents again, as the rules to support the sector are lifted. That could prompt a new wave of closures as big as the number we've seen already he warns. \nBut pent-up demand could encourage new openings too.\n\"Landlords will be keen to get new tenants into their sites,\" points out Mr Smith. \"And restaurateurs are naturally optimistic people. When you see a restaurant closed, it doesn't stay closed for long.\"\nTim Hall is one of the founders of a small sourdough pizza chain, Three Joes - one of the businesses poised to capitalise on a bounce-back in demand.\nLast year, they bought another small chain, The Stable, taking them from three to 12 sites, mostly in south-western England.\n\"We're quite nervous about what's going to happen,\" he says. \"We've taken a big risk.\"\nThe new restaurants are all either waterside or market-square sites, most with outdoor spaces, that he thinks will appeal to customers post-Covid. Crucially, none rely on \"office block\" trade.\n\"I don't think overall the trend for people to eat out more is going to be damaged in the medium term,\" he says. \"And in the short term, it will accelerate hugely.\n\"We're anticipating a summer like no other. Apart from anything else, people are trapped in England, they want to spend their savings and enjoy themselves.\"\nYou can hear more on the impact of the pandemic on Britain's restaurants on BBC Radio 4's The Food Programme on 23 May."

      "text": "A tiger that was missing for a week after being spotted roaming around a Houston neighbourhood has been found, police confirmed. \nIndia, the nine-month-old Bengal tiger, was turned in to police on Saturday and is said to be in good health. \nFootage shared on social media last week appeared to show the tiger wandering around the streets of in the west of the Texan city,\nIndia's new home is an animal sanctuary. \nThe animal was spotted out on the streets on 9 May. When officers arrived at the scene, a man put the tiger into an SUV and drove off, police said. \nHouston Police attempted to follow the vehicle but lost sight of it a short time later. \nThe alleged owner, Hugo Cuevas, was arrested several days later for evading arrest. At the time of the incident, Mr Cuevas was already on bail for a murder charge. \nMr Cuevas' lawyer has insisted that the animal was not his but told the Associated Press that he was involved \"in the caretaking of India often\".\nLate on Saturday, police said at a news conference that the animal was turned over to officers by Mr Cuevas' wife Giorgiana. \nIt is not clear where the animal has been for the past week but Houston Police Commander Ron Borza said earlier this week that he believed the animal was being passed around several safe houses.\nSpeaking at a news conference on Saturday, Mr Borza said: \"In no way, shape or form should you have an animal like that in your household. That animal is only nine months old and already weighs 175 lbs (80kgs) - full grown, that animal can get to 600 lbs. It still had its claws and it could do a lot of damage if he decided to. \n\"Luckily for us, he's very tame and he will be going to a sanctuary tomorrow where, hopefully, he'll live the rest of his life in a very safe environment.\"\nThe tiger will have its own enclosure with a wooded area and pool at the Cleveland Amory Black Beauty Ranch. \nCarole Baskin, star of Netflix documentary Tiger King, said on Facebook that she was \"grateful\" the animal will be going to the sanctuary and said it had \"excellent facilities\". \nTigers are not allowed within Houston City limits although it is permitted in many parts of the state under certain conditions. \nAccording to the World Wildlife Fund, there are an estimated 5,000 tigers in captivity in the United States. \nYou might also be interested in:"

      "text": "For many working parents in Wales, buying their own home is an \"unachievable dream,\" according to three charities.\nNearly half the homeowners helped by the Help to Buy scheme in 2020-21 earned at least \u00a340,000.\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation said evidence suggested it was \"not helping people on lower incomes\".\nThe Welsh government said a new phase of the scheme will help those \"who most need support\".\nAlys Patosit, 41, and her husband Pin, 48, live in Monmouthshire with their two children.\nMrs Patosit works part-time as an administrative assistant and as a carer for the elderly, as well as running her own online business, but said her family might never be able to afford their own home, no matter how hard they work.\n\"Since returning to work after having my children, I have found myself working three jobs and still having to claim Universal Credit to make ends meet, leaving us with nothing to save for a deposit,\" she said. \n\"We dream of being able to afford a modest home in the area I grew up in, but we feel trapped in a cycle and having housing security feels impossible, sometimes it feels completely hopeless.\" \nHelp to Buy is a scheme which allows those eligible to buy a new-build property up to the value of \u00a3250,000 with help from the Welsh government by way of a shared equity loan. \nSince January 2014, 11,959 properties have been purchased using a Help to Buy loan in Wales. \nA recent official report on the scheme found that, over the last three years, the proportion of completed purchases by those on higher incomes had increased. \n\"During 2020-21, 49% of all homes purchased under the scheme were by those with an average household income of \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000,\" said the report.\n\"In contrast, homes purchased by those with a household income of less than \u00a320,000 have been decreasing annually and in 2020-21 accounted for only 2% of all completed purchases using the scheme.\"\nCarmen Jackson, co-ordinator of Home-Start's Helping Working Families project across Monmouthshire, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly, said: \"Housing is an issue that comes up again and again with many of our families. \n\"Feelings are running high about the current housing situation. Many families feel that home ownership for their family is a completely unachievable dream.\n\"We have found in some regions, social housing stock is low, which creates demand for rentals, forcing up the prices of rentals which makes investors buying homes as buy-to-lets attractive and making home ownership unrealistic for all but the wealthiest.\"\nShe added that affordable housing seemed to be only affordable where both parents were working full-time on a good wage or have significant help from family.\n\"We are noticing the knock-on effects for families, with families either overstretching themselves to try to create better lives for their families or feeling hopeless because the dream is completely out of reach,\" she said.\nEve (who did not want her surname published), her husband and three children bought a home through the Help to Buy scheme, but were disappointed.\n\"The government's idea of affordable and most working families' incomes don't match up,\" said Eve. \n\"We ended up buying a house that's really too small for our family and needs loads of work doing, that we can't afford to do, but we were desperate. \n\"Local rents are just too high, the stress was wearing us down.\"\nDr Steffan Evans, policy and research officer at the Bevan Foundation, said: \"There have long been questions about whether Help to Buy is a scheme that helps boost the availability of genuinely affordable housing. \n\"The latest evidence adds further weight to these concerns. Investing the funds in other programmes such as the Social Housing Grant, which funds the construction of new social housing, could prove to be far more effective use of Welsh government funds.\"\nRachel Casey, policy and partnerships officer at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: \"Even before coronavirus, around 700,000 people in Wales were trapped in poverty. Together with low wages and inadequate benefit levels, high private rents lock people in Wales in poverty. \n\"So it's not right that the majority of support in the housing market is currently being directed towards people who are not in poverty and who may already own their own homes. \n\"This evidence suggests that the Help to Buy scheme in Wales is not helping people on lower incomes to access home ownership, but instead supporting people on higher incomes. \n\"Across the UK, the stamp duty holiday policy is benefiting existing homeowners but making it much harder for renters to get on the property ladder.\"\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We understand the difficulties first-time buyers face and the uncertainties in the jobs market as a result of the pandemic.  \n\"Our Help to Buy Wales scheme plays an important role in helping people get onto the property ladder with three-quarters of the 12,000 homes already delivered through the programme going to first-time buyers. \n\"Phase 3 of Help to Buy Wales was launched last month and has been designed to ensure the scheme further benefits those who most need support in securing home ownership.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Glasgow,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Glasgow may have to remain under level three Covid restrictions for longer than a week, Scotland's national clinical director has warned. \nProf Jason Leitch said the situation remained \"fragile\" as case rates continue to climb. \nThe latest seven-day average per 100,000 population in the city is 94.5 cases, well above the level two benchmark of 50 cases. \nEast Renfrewshire has seen its case rate jump to 75.4, overtaking Moray. \nGlasgow and Moray are the only local authority areas due to remain in level three on Monday, as the rest of mainland Scotland, including East Renfrewshire, go down to level two, and some islands to level one. \nThe outbreak in Moray appears to have stabilised, with the case rate falling for the fourth consecutive day to 58.4 per 100,000 population in the latest published figures.\nIn East Renfrewshire, however, the rate is climbing steeply with 72 positive cases over the past seven days.\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland infection rates in every local authority were being monitored and action would be taken to contain outbreaks, if necessary.\n\"The last thing we want to do is to have areas going in and out of restrictions like a yo-yo, that's the worst of all possible worlds. \n\"What we need to try and do is what we're doing in the overwhelming majority of the country which is get to a sustained position of suppression of the virus which then enables us to take the necessary action to relax restrictions.\"\nThere is evidence the Glasgow surge is being driven by the so-called Indian variant, unlike in Moray where it is thought to be much less of a factor. \nLast Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said all mainland areas with the possible exception of Moray were expected to move to level two rules which allow different households to meet up indoors, and pubs and restaurants to serve alcohol indoors. \nBut on Friday she announced that the move to level two would be delayed by a week for both Moray and Glasgow after cases rose rapidly, particularly in the south of the city.\nProf Leitch told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show \"it may well be\" that Glasgow would have to remain in level three for longer than an extra week. \nHe added: \"We'll give the best advice we can on this  - we've met all weekend, we'll meet next week. \n\"Glasgow are doing an enormous amount of work. The leaders of the public health response in Glasgow are testing everywhere.\n\"If you haven't had a test and you're in Glasgow, you should do it.\"\nLateral flow test kits are available free on the NHS, and everyone in Scotland - but particularly in Glasgow - is being urged to take them twice a week regardless of whether they have symptoms, Prof Leitch said. \nOn vaccination, he said text messages were going out to younger age groups in the worst-affected Glasgow postcodes, inviting them to be vaccinated. \nProf Leitch said work was ongoing to identify those who did not previously come forward for their first dose, and he also urged people to take up offers of the second dose. \nHowever, he said the success of the vaccination programme meant there was no evidence yet that the upturn in cases would lead to significant increases in deaths or pressures on the NHS. \n\"We're keeping Glasgow at three. We're not locking Glasgow down. The beer gardens can still open, you can still meet outdoors,\" he said. \nWhile a case rate of 50 cases per 100,000 population is a key benchmark for deciding if an area can move to level two, other factors such as the ability of the local health service to cope are also considered. \nOn Sunday another 292 cases of Covid-19 reported across the whole of Scotland, with 2% of tests coming back positive, the highest percentage since 19 April.\nEarlier, the Westminster health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the experience of Bolton, which has also seen a surge in the Indian variant, was that it was mainly spreading among younger people who had not had a vaccine jab. \nHe said that while this variant appeared to me more transmissible and was likely to become the dominant UK strain, he was \"confident\" that existing vaccines offered protection. \nIn Bolton, he said he was aware of five people in hospital despite having had one dose of the vaccine and one \"frail\" person who had received two doses - but he said the \"vast majority\" were people who had not received any vaccine."

      "tags": "Family,Coronavirus lockdown measures,UK government,Relationships,Friendship,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The advice on hugging is changing from Monday. It is no longer advised against for people from different households in England and Scotland - and for millions of people this will be the first time they've hugged family and friends in months.\nExperts say there are real benefits to hugging - it lowers stress and blood pressure - but the government is urging people to be cautious. So how can you give a cautious hug? We've gathered advice from coronavirus experts on how to hug safely.\n\"Personally I'm going to restrict my hugging to family members and not beyond,\" says Prof Sally Jane Cutler from the University of East London. \"I think we have to be very conserved about who we choose to hug.\"\nProf Cath Noakes - who sits on the Sage committee that advises the government - adds that the risk will depend on who you're hugging. \"It would worry me if we were advocating we could hug all of our friends every time we meet them again.\n\"Perhaps don't hug everybody you know. If you are going to hug somebody, restrict it to very small numbers of close family who perhaps you would really value a hug from.\"\nFrank Atherton, the chief medical officer in Wales - where some families and friends can already cwtch (cuddle) if they form an extended household - also urges against hugging every Tom, Dick and Harry. \n\"Prevalence rates are really quite low at the moment, and being close to a member of your family is less risk now,\" he says. \"But with strangers, I would be very cautious still.\"\nThe government's new advice suggests people should take extra care with those vulnerable to Covid, and maybe choose not to hug elderly relatives - especially if either hugger is not vaccinated.\nThe length of time you spend in close contact with someone also makes a difference. \"Don't spend too long making face-to-face contact, make it a brief hug,\" Dr Atherton says.\nProf Noakes agrees: \"Don't hug too frequently, keep it short.\"\nThe government's own updated advice on hugging also makes this point. \"Longer periods of close contact increase the risk of transmission, but remember that even brief contact can spread Covid-19 - and there is no such thing as a fully safe period of close contact,\" it says.\n\"Try and avoid being face to face, so perhaps if you turn your face away slightly, and even wearing a mask could help,\" Prof Noakes says.\n\"The reality is that when you hug someone you are very close to them and we know the virus is in people's breath and you are very close to that breath at that moment.\"\n\"The other thing - which sounds really miserly - but there is the option of wearing a face covering while hugging,\" says Prof Linda Bauld from the University of Edinburgh. \n\"If you were visiting a vulnerable person in general, you would want to do that. Hand hygiene is still really important as well. When you touch someone, you are touching things they have touched.\"\nExperts have always been clear that the risks from Covid are lower outside. The government advice on close contact also suggests hugging loved ones outside is safer.\nIf people are meeting inside - as is allowed in groups of up to six from 17 May - then make sure the space is well ventilated, it adds.\n\"Open windows and doors, or take other action to let in plenty of fresh air. The more fresh air that is brought inside, the quicker any airborne virus will be removed from the room.\" \nThe government suggests that to make close contact safer, people should test themselves regularly - even if they don't have symptoms.\nCurrently, test kits are free to order for anyone who wants one.\n\"Around one in three people with coronavirus do not show symptoms, so can spread the virus to others without knowing,\" the government says. \"Testing regularly will help to reduce risk.\"\nNot everyone may be excited for the return of hugs next week - but according to science, it's good for you.\nTouch is \"really fundamental\" for humans, says Prof Robin Dunbar, evolutionary psychologist at the University of Oxford - and going without it weakens our close relationships.\n\"The sort of more intimate touching - arm round the shoulder, a pat on the arm and these kind of things reserved for closer friendships and family members - are really important,\" he says. They make us feel happier, satisfied and trusting of others.\nTouch is our first sense to develop in the womb, and research has shown physical contact with others can reduce the effect of stress. \nProf Linda Bauld says there are scientifically-proven benefits to touch and \"particularly a warm embrace\". \"We know from studies that it lowers heart rate, blood pressure and reduces stress,\" she says.\nProf Dunbar says the reason humans need physical contact is because we evolved from primates who groom each other.\nAlthough most of our fur has gone, humans do the same movements on exactly the same neurons when they stroke, cuddle or pat each other, he says. This triggers endorphins, the feel-good chemicals in the brain.\nDo you have plans to hug a loved one on Monday?

      "tags": "DUP (Democratic Unionist Party)",
      "text": "It was a classic smash-and-grab operation.\nSmashing the previous leadership and then grabbing power before his challenger even entered the race.\nEdwin Poots boxed off the support he needed to succeed Arlene Foster as Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader as she prepared her resignation speech - and never looked back. \nHe pulled off a political masterstroke to land his dream job, leader of the party he joined as a 16-year-old, after winning an election over Sir Jeffrey Donaldson on Friday.\nBut, for others in the DUP, his rise to the top is the nightmare outcome they dreaded.\n\"We didn't see this coming,\" said one party officer, as he watched his new leader march down the Stormont hill in triumph to meet the press.\nHe waited like the rest of us to hear the new leader answer questions about his plan for the DUP.\nIt didn't happen.\nInstead we got a statement with no follow-up questions before Edwin Poots, chased by the press pack, was whisked away in a car under the shadow of Edward Carson's statue.\nIt was a chaotic start for the new leader but not surprising for a minister prone to a political solo run.\nSo here are some of the questions we would have posed to the new DUP leader and why.\nAlmost 50% of those MLAs and MPs who voted didn't want him as leader - how does he plan to win them over?\nMight he consider making room for some of the 17 supporters of Sir Jeffrey in his ministerial reshuffle?\nIt is expected Economy Minister Diane Dodds and Education Minister Peter Weir won't survive the cull.\nJunior Minister, and Arlene Foster loyalist, Gordon Lyons could also be pushed out.\nThey, along with their special advisors, may have to make way for those who backed Edwin Poots from the outset when others were holding back.\nPaul Givan, Paul Frew, Christopher Stalford and Mervyn Storey could be in line for a front bench role.\nHis key appointment will be to the role of Northern Ireland first minister, who will sit alongside the party leader around the executive table.\nCould that go to the party's new deputy leader Paula Bradley who, as one of the more socially liberal voices in the DUP, already views her role as a \"critical friend\" to the leader?\nHere is another question we didn't get to ask - will the new leader allow his predecessor to remain in post as first minister for another six weeks?\nThat is the timetable Arlene Foster set for her departure but whispers of an earlier exit have already started circulating. \nWhat about those plans to reform the party from top to bottom?\nHow nervous should some senior staff feel about that prospect is another question we didn't get to pose.\nEmployment contracts may prevent any immediate move to remove key figures behind the scenes.\nBut one member of Team Poots hinted change is on the way.\n\"Edwin is not going to waste any time reforming the party structures as promised, that will start over the weekend,\" he said.\nNext question - his critics within the party fear he will drag the DUP backwards and won't be able to grow its voter base. How does he plan to prove them wrong? \nAs one Donaldson-supporting MLA put it: \"Edwin's fundamental views are niche and the real winners today will be the Alliance Party.\"\nStemming the leaking of DUP votes to the left and right of the party will be a key challenge for the new leader.\nHe only has to look to his own backyard - Lagan Valley - where the party's vote share in the last Westminster election fell by 16% in the face of a 17% surge by Alliance.\nWe can expect the new DUP leader to reach out to other unionist parties to try to maximise their numbers in the Stormont chamber.\nEdwin Poots said he plans to galvanise unionism to fight the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is a familiar battle cry - but what will it mean in practice?\nCan we expect more DUP boycotts of north-south meetings? \nThe new leader has already snubbed two cross-border Zoom calls as agriculture minister. \nWill he be logging on for the full plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council next month? \nAnother more pressing unanswered question - is the new leader of the DUP prepared to bring down Stormont in his battle to scrap the protocol? \nCan he oppose the protocol and continue to operate it at the same time? \nThat was the question posed but not answered by former DUP leader Peter Robinson.\nAs the minister in charge of the ports operating the Irish Sea border, Mr Poots has a weak spot which his unionist opponents like to exploit. \nHowever, as minister he has moved to obstruct the protocol and may do so again. \nWe may hear more about his protocol protest plans after he meets the prime minister next week. \nOther questions which didn't get asked include:\nThe DUP effectively gagged the candidates from speaking during the election campaign.\nIn his first minutes as leader, Edwin Poots chose to gag himself.\nHe knows he can't do that for long.\nWhen he finally speaks. he needs to have answers to at least some of those pressing questions.

      "tags": "Gaza border clashes,Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Palestinian territories,Gaza",
      "text": "Thousands of people have marched through central London in support of the Palestinians amid ongoing fighting between Israel and militants in Gaza.\nThe organisers of the protest called on the UK government to stop allowing what they described as \"Israel's brutal violence against and oppression of the Palestinian people\".\nDemonstrators marched to the Israeli embassy chanting \"free Palestine\".\nIt comes after the worst week of violence in Gaza and Israel since 2014. \nAt least 139 people have been killed in Gaza and nine in Israel since the fighting began on Monday.\nIsrael says dozens of militants are among the dead in Gaza, while Palestinian health officials say nearly half are women and children.\nIt came after weeks of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas - the militant Islamist group which rules Gaza - began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes.\nOn Saturday, an Israeli air strike on a refugee camp in Gaza killed 10 people, while a Palestinian rocket killed a man in Israel.\nA separate Israeli strike destroyed a high-rise building housing media organisations, including The Associated Press and Al Jazeera, plus a number of offices and apartments. The Israeli military said the building housed military assets belonging to Hamas.\nThe demonstration in London has been organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Friends of Al-Aqsa, Palestinian Forum in Britain, Stop The War Coalition, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Muslim Association of Britain.\nA spokesperson for the organisers said: \"It is vital that the UK government takes immediate action. \n\"It must stop allowing Israel's brutal violence against and oppression of the Palestinian people to go unpunished.\"\nThey said the bombardment of Gaza \"which is killing civilians including children is a war crime\", adding: \"The UK government is complicit in these acts as long as it continues to offer Israel military, diplomatic and financial support.\"\nJames Waterhouse, BBC News reporter\nFrom the outset, it has been clear how high passions are running among the thousands who have turned out in central London. \nA river of protesters flows along Hyde Park towards the Israeli embassy in Kensington. \nEvery once in a while, a red or green smoke flare is set off, which is met with cheers and waving Palestinian flags which match the colours.\nTheir intended destination is sealed off down a private road, but that does not stop people chanting \"free Palestine\" and a minority climb scaffolding on Kensington High Street.\nThey essentially want Israel to stop air strikes and for the UK government to step in. \nBut as US negotiators call on both sides to calm things, few here think it will be resolved any time soon. \nAddressing the crowds at the rally, Husam Zumlot, Palestinian ambassador to the UK, said: \"This time is different. This time we will not be denied any more. We are united. We have had enough of oppression.\n\"Today we are saying enough, enough with the complicity. Thank you for standing with us.\"\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott also spoke to those gathered outside the embassy.\nMs Abbott said: \"We must remember we are part of an international movement. This is a worldwide movement for justice.\n\"Palestinian people are having their land seized... and they are now being killed in their homes. All of this is illegal.\"\nThe Twitter account of Israel's embassy in the UK posted a tweet that read: \"Hamas couldn't care less about the lives of Palestinians, in its desperate attempt to terrorize and kill Israelis.\"\nIn a BBC interview, the former Israeli ambassador to the UK, Mark Regev, defended Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\"I don't want to see any innocent bystanders hurt, let alone children. I don't want to see Israeli children or Palestinian children caught up in the crossfire,\" he said.\n\"But Hamas says Israel has no right to exist. So, we're only talking about deterrence, about strength, about them understanding that it's not in their interest to shoot rockets into Israel,\" he added.\n\"And we want to come out of this conflict with them understanding that clearly, and then have a sustained period of quiet. Ultimately, that's good for Israelis, and that's good for the residents of Gaza, too.\"  \nA Foreign Office spokeswoman said the ongoing violence was \"deeply concerning and must end\".\n\"There is never any justification for targeting innocent civilians. Both sides need to de-escalate and offer hope to their peoples, which can only come through political dialogue.\"\nThe Metropolitan Police said a small minority of protesters had thrown objects of police, and warned that enforcement action \"will be taken where necessary against those who breach Covid regulations\".\nThere have also been pro-Palestinian demonstrations in several other European capitals.\nIn Paris, riot police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse a rally held despite a ban by authorities."

      "text": "A universal basic income scheme is to be trialled in Wales, meaning adults, regardless of their means, will receive a regular sum of money.\nThe idea is that this would cover the basic cost of living.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the pilot would \"see whether the promises that basic income holds out are genuinely delivered\" in people's lives.\nBut the Conservatives said Wales should not become \"a petri dish for failed left-wing policies\".\nMr Drakeford said a pilot would \"need to be carefully designed to make sure that it is genuinely adding income for the group of people we are able to work with\".\nHe added: \"It'll have to be a pilot because we don't have all the powers in our own hands to do it on our own.\n\"It'll have to be carefully crafted to make sure that it is affordable and that it does it within the powers available to the Senedd. \n\"We need to make an early start on designing the pilot to make sure that we have the best chance of operating a pilot that allows us to draw the conclusions from it that we would all want to see.\"\nIt means every adult in a specific area would receive a standard, unconditional payment at regular intervals. \nSupporters of the idea have said it provides a safety net for people who are unemployed or have irregular work, allowing them time to find a new job or learn new skills. \nSome high profile celebrities, including billionaire businessman Elon Musk, have backed the idea, while the UK Labour Party said it would explore a pilot of UBI in its 2019 general election manifesto.\nVarious versions of the scheme have been trialled around the world, including in Finland, where 2,000 unemployed people were paid \u20ac560 (\u00a3480) per month for two years. \nResearchers found the scheme left those happier and less stressed, but did not aid them in finding work. \nMeanwhile, in western Kenya, a 12-year trial is taking place, where every adult is being paid $22 (\u00a316) per month to see if it can help lift people out of poverty.\nWales' future generations commissioner, who has previously called for a pilot, said she was \"delighted\" with the plan.\nSophie Howe said: \"Signalling basic income as a priority for the new government is\u00a0an incredibly significant commitment\u00a0by the first minister to\u00a0tackling Wales' poverty and health inequalities\u00a0- which cause\u00a0lasting\u00a0damage to\u00a0the\u00a0health and prospects of individuals, families and communities.\u00a0\n\"It's a huge\u00a0moment for\u00a0the\u00a0campaign, which I've been proud to be a part of, and the growing support for\u00a0a fairer way of\u00a0allowing\u00a0people to meet their basic needs.\n\"The current system isn't working\u00a0- Wales' commitment to exploring a basic income once again proves it's\u00a0often the small countries that can\u00a0be world leading and\u00a0make the biggest changes.\"\nIn its manifesto, Plaid Cymru supported a Welsh pilot for a universal basic Income in order \"to prepare for a future where work may have a different role in the economy as a result of automation and the application of AI and related technologies\".\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats also made an election commitment to support a trial because the party believes \"UBI not only reduces inequalities and increases wellbeing, but that it strengthens local economies\".\nBut the Welsh Conservatives said: \"The Joseph Rowntree Foundation is clear that UBI is not the answer to solving poverty, in fact they claim it can actually increase poverty. \n\"The first minister needs to get on with kickstarting the Welsh economy, creating long-term, well-paid jobs for people rather than using Wales as a petri dish for failed left-wing policies.\"\nIn a 2018 blog post, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's deputy director of evidence, Chris Goulden, said: \"It is not affordable, unpalatable to most of the public because of its 'money for nothing' tag and perhaps most importantly \u00ad- it increases poverty unless modified beyond recognition.\""

      "text": "Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. \nWhat are the current rules?\nYou can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unless you have to self-isolate because you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. \nAll holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. \nIf you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. \nAnyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before.\nPeople travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law.\nSome UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding. Saga and P&O have said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. \nThere is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes in England, Scotland or Wales. \nHowever people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. \nThere are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September.\nFace coverings are no longer required by law in England, although the government \"expects and recommends\" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. \nHowever, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets.\nWearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. \nMuseums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. \nHowever, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. \nYou may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. \nBusinesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. \nIndoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue to collect customer contact details. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. \nNightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.\nThe Common Travel Area (CTA) is a term which covers the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. \nTravel within the CTA is not considered international travel. \nFully vaccinated adults or under-18s travelling from the UK to other CTA destinations may not need to do any travel-related testing or quarantine on arrival, but the rules do vary, so you need to check before arranging a trip. \nAs long as you've not been outside the CTA in the previous 10 days, you do not have to complete a passenger locator form, take any Covid tests or quarantine on your return to the UK.\nForeign travel is allowed, but people must follow different rules about testing and quarantine according to the traffic light status of their destination country. \nVisitors to green-list countries do not need to isolate on their return home. Under-18s and fully vaccinated people returning to the UK from amber-list countries also no longer have to self-isolate on arrival."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,UK government,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People must continue to play their part in stopping coronavirus, Boris Johnson has said, as lockdown rules ease in England, Wales and most of Scotland.\nMillions can now socialise indoors in limited numbers, hug loved ones and visit pubs and restaurants inside.\nThe ban on foreign travel has also been lifted and replaced with new rules.\nMr Johnson said: \"We have reached another milestone in our road map out of lockdown, but we must take this next step with a heavy dose of caution.\"\nThe rule changes come as the variant first identified in India continues to spread in the UK, with mass testing rolled out to hotspots including Bolton in Greater Manchester and parts of London and Sefton.\nMr Johnson said the government was keeping the variant \"under close observation\" and \"taking swift action where infection rates are rising\".\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"very confident\" the government would be able to lift England's remaining restrictions on 21 June \"but can't guarantee that\".\nHe said: \"There is flexibility here because we have another five weeks till the reopening and we will be revisiting the data. \n\"There will be different data - the variant will spread, perhaps, in different ways, we will have more information about the efficacy of the vaccine rollout, and then... a week before the 21st, we will take the decision.\"\nMr Kwarteng said he did not want to \"stigmatise people\" over vaccine hesitancy, but added: \"We're not exactly where we want to be among certain communities but I think the take-up has been much greater in the last few months, and more and more people are convinced that this is the way to keep themselves and their families safe.\"\nMore than 6,200 people were vaccinated in Bolton at the weekend, where the Indian variant now makes up the majority of new cases. Prior to the push, about 10,000 people in the highest priority groups were yet to be vaccinated.\nScientists believe the variant does spread more easily, but early data suggests vaccines still work. However, the exact impact on vaccine efficacy - if any - is still to be firmed up.\nSir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's independent scientific advisory group Sage, said the lifting of the rules was the \"most difficult policy decision of the last 15 months or so.\"\nHe told Today: \"It is very, very finely balanced\".\nSir Jeremy said the variant \"is becoming dominant in parts of the UK, and yet vaccination across the country has been extraordinary successful\".\n\"I think we will see an increase of cases and infections over the coming weeks as some of the restrictions are lifted, but the key question is whether we have decoupled increased transmission in the number of people who do get infected from the number of people who get ill and need to go to hospital.\"\nHe added: \"A very careful lifting is reasonable, but we may have to reverse that if there is escape from the vaccines.\"\nThe British Medical Association - which represents doctors - said it was a \"real worry\" that the easing was still going ahead while the Indian variant was spreading and many younger people were not vaccinated.\nWhile lockdowns are easing across England, Scotland and Wales, the changes are different in each nation. \nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: \"This is a long awaited moment but remember that the virus still poses a big threat, so please continue to be cautious & very careful.\"\nTwo areas of Scotland - Glasgow and Moray - will not have their rules eased after a spike in cases. \nMeanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has called for young adults in five boroughs of London where there are cases of the Indian variant to be vaccinated earlier than planned.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock is due to make a statement on Covid to MPs in the House of Commons at 16:30 BST.\nThis isn't \"a throw open the doors\" moment and we won't see a photo-op of the prime minister enjoying an indoor pizza or pint today. Ministers want people to enjoy themselves, but to do it sensibly.\nBoris Johnson has always said that the road map out of the lockdown in England is irreversible but in a video on social media this morning he says it's only irreversible if \"we all follow rules\" - an added note of caution.\nAnd there's a difference in tone between ministers when they talk about the next step in England, due on 21 June.\nThe PM says the Indian variant might make it \"more difficult\" but the business secretary says he's \"hopeful\" and \"confident\" that it'll happen.\nThere are also growing tensions between national authorities and areas with higher rates of the Indian variant over vaccines. The mayor of London is the latest local leader to ask for permission to start jabbing younger people and some places are doing it anyway.\nThat goes against government policy which is to prioritise first doses for the over-38s and second doses for the over-50s.\nIn a statement issued on Sunday evening on the lifting of the rules in England, the prime minister said: \"Everyone must play their part by getting tested twice a week, coming forward for your vaccine when called, and remembering hands, face, space and fresh air.\"\nAnyone in England and Scotland can order free lateral flow tests - which give results in 30 minutes - even if they do not have symptoms. In Wales and Northern Ireland, they are available for certain people, such as those who cannot work from home.\nEngland:\nScotland (except Glasgow and Moray): \nWales: \nAnd in all three nations, foreign holidays are allowed.\nNorthern Ireland will review lockdown rules on 20 May, with the hope that some could be lifted on 24 May.\nRead more about the changes here.\nMinisters and senior advisers are concerned due to continued uncertainty about the Indian variant, including how much faster it spreads than the UK variant. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe impact on hospital numbers in communities most affected by the variant will be studied closely this week and next. \nOfficials were preparing anyway to monitor the consequences of today's easing of restrictions, the biggest step so far - with people mixing more and case numbers likely to rise.\nPreliminary laboratory data from Oxford University suggest, according to ministers, that vaccines will be effective against the Indian variant - but they stress that there's a race to keep the vaccination programme ahead of the virus.\nWithin the next few days, a first dose will be offered to all those aged 35 and over in England.\nThe latest government figures show a further 1,926 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK, while a further four people have died.\nThe number of people in the UK who have received a first dose of the vaccine has now topped 36.5 million, while the number of second doses given is at 20.1 million.\nAlso from Monday, people travelling abroad will be able to use the NHS app - which is different to the NHS Covid-19 app - to prove they have had the vaccine. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps previously said people will be able to use the app at border controls, although the government says people should still check countries' entry requirements as tests or quarantine might still be needed.\nTravellers can now visit 12 countries on the government's green list, including Portugal and Israel, without isolating on their return."

We have no words to describe how we feel and just want time to ourselves to come to terms with what has happened. \n\"Our beautiful little angel grew his wings today.\"\nAssistant chief constable Jo Edwards said at a press conference at the scene earlier that the search and rescue operation was still ongoing but \"we believe we have got everybody out\". \nLancashire Fire said a major incident was declared after it was reported that there had been an explosion at a property on Mallowdale Avenue.\nAbout 30-40 people were evacuated from their homes. Most went to stay with friends and family but the Salt Ayre Leisure Centre is welcoming anyone needing support.\nLancaster City Council leader Erica Lewis said councils would give housing support to those affected and a helpline has been opened.\nShe said it was important to understand how the incident happened and let the investigation run its course.\nOne neighbour said the explosion \"sounded like a bomb going off\".\nShe said: \"It literally shook the whole bed. We felt like we were going through the floor. \n\"We jumped out of bed and we just ran to see what was going on. It's just awful.\"\nSusan Faulkner, 74, who lives further down the avenue, said she was still shaken by the incident.\n\"I woke up with this huge bang and I thought someone was breaking into my house... I'm still quite shaken by it. I've never experienced that before.\"\nMs Faulkner said that her own property and others close by had been damaged.\n\"It was quite a blast,\" she said. \"I live quite a way down there and part of my side door was blown in and my next door neighbour's plates were smashed,\" she said.\n\"I've been very lucky. When I see what those poor souls have had happen to them, it's devastating. I'm really sad for those people. It's such a sad thing to happen to them.\"\nDan Knowles, who lives four streets away from the explosion, said he thought there had been an earthquake.\n\"We immediately checked on our kids and got back in bed. We then heard sirens and my wife checked Facebook.\n\"We stayed indoors and switched everything off at the source and then sat up all night worrying.\"\nAnother neighbour said he had been helping out \"making brews\" since being woken by the blast.\nMatt House, from North West Ambulance Service, said he had not seen an explosion like this in the UK during his 20 years of service.\nBen Norman, assistant chief fire officer, said there would be \"untold\" impact on fire officers working at the scene.\nHe said at its peak, 80 fire officers were at the scene with two engines pulled in from Cumbria and emergency service workers \"took great risks\".\nHe added: \"Some of those are staff that respond from home or a workplace. They're on-call firefighters so they go back into this community.\n\"They live within it, they work within it, their families are within it.\"\nLocal MP David Morris, who represents Morecambe and Lunesdale, thanked the emergency services on Twitter and said: \"My thoughts and prayers are with all of the families on Mallowdale Avenue\".\nPolice said they were working with gas service engineers to make the area safe and they advised people to stay away. \nElectricity North West, which supplies electricity across the north west of England, said on Twitter that engineers were removing supplies for safety.\nThe company could not confirm how many properties would be affected, or for how long.\nHeather Brandwood, who runs the Hurley Flyer pub in nearby Morecambe, said she had asked people to donate clothing and toiletries for evacuated residents.\nShe said people had been queuing in the car park to help.\n\"We are very conscious that people were evacuated from their homes with immediate effect,\" she said.\n\"We have heard from an elderly couple who left in their pyjamas. There is a woman who is in literally nothing but her nightie.\"\nLancaster City Council has also lowered flags at its town halls as a mark of respect.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "The BBC has postponed its broadcast of a Panorama investigation into reporter Martin Bashir's 1995 interview with Diana, Princess of Wales.\nPanorama was expected to examine claims that Bashir used fake bank statements to convince Diana to do the interview.\nThe film was due to air on BBC One on Monday but the broadcaster said it had been delayed due to a \"significant duty of care issue\".\nBashir left the corporation earlier this week due to ongoing health issues.\nA new date for the programme has not yet been confirmed.\nThe 58-year-old was BBC News religion editor and was seriously ill with Covid-19 when the allegations emerged late last year. He has since undergone a quadruple heart bypass and another heart operation more recently.\nThe decision to push back the Panorama episode comes shortly after a separate investigation into the interview - led by Lord Dyson - had concluded.\nThe BBC said Bashir had co-operated fully with the inquiry and would not comment publicly while that process was ongoing.\nLord Dyson, who was Master of the Rolls - the second most senior judge in England and Wales, had been tasked with looking into the steps Bashir and the corporation took to get the interview.\nHis report has been given to the BBC, which the broadcaster said would be published \"very soon\".\nNearly 23 million people tuned in to watch the Panorama interview, recorded 25 years ago.\nIn the interview, Diana famously said that \"there were three of us in this marriage\", referring to Prince Charles' relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles. At the time she was separated from Prince Charles but not yet divorced.\nThe princess also talked frankly about her difficulties with post-natal depression and bulimia.\nDiana's son, the Duke of Cambridge, welcomed the launch of the inquiry late last year and his brother, the Duke of Sussex, reportedly also supported it.\nQuestions arose late last year over the interview, which was one of the most watched BBC programmes of all time and won Bashir a Bafta TV award.\nDiana's brother, Earl Spencer, said Bashir had used forged bank statements to persuade the princess to do the interview.\nIt was reported by the Daily Mail that the statements wrongly purported to show that two senior courtiers were being paid by the security services for information on his sister.\nThe BBC has previously apologised for the use of the statements, but has insisted they played \"no part in her decision to take part in the interview\".\nIn March, police ruled out a criminal investigation into the background to the interview."

      "text": "Leisure firms say they need more support after a year of \"haemorrhaging cash\" and mounting debts due to the pandemic.\nBusinesses from wine bars to bingo halls can reopen on Monday but at reduced capacity making it harder to cover their costs.\nBusiness minister Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC he did not want rent arrears to \"cripple\" firms.\nHe said the government was looking at ways to help firms manage their debts.\nWhile leisure venues, including soft play centres, amusement arcades and concert halls, are welcoming Monday's reopening, they know some customers will take longer to return to indoor activities, especially with the spread of the new Indian variant of the virus.\nEven if customer demand is high, venues can accommodate fewer customers at a time, due to social distancing rules. \nAnd according to the trade body UKHospitality, that sector alone has \u00a32.5bn in rent arrears \"hanging around its neck\" as a result of the pandemic.\n\"Opening... will give us a certain amount of revenue, but we will still have half the number of covers we need to survive,\" says Nisha Katona, television presenter and founder of Indian restaurant chain Mowgli Street Food.\nShe says her business has been lucky to have had a bit of financial \"breathing room\" to help it cope with lockdown, but it has still suffered.\n\"Cash has been haemorrhaging out of our account all the while we have no revenue, and yet we continue to pay rents,\" says Ms Katona. \n\"There are lots of business costs that don't go away, so while there has been no cash, we really have become a business that is on its knees, waiting for the resurrection.\"\nShe says the UK's high streets are already \"littered with the gravestones\" of independent bars and restaurants that didn't have backers with deep pockets or hadn't been able to negotiate concessions from their landlords.\nUKHospitality has called for \"a fair amount\" of rent debt to be written off and for a ban on business evictions, currently due to expire at the end of June, to be extended.\nThe business minister, Mr Kwarteng, said the government was aware that businesses were facing a build-up in rent arrears after many months of not being able to trade normally.\n\"The government is working very closely together - the Treasury and [the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy] - to see if we can come up with an arrangement whereby tenants and landlords can work together to make sure this rent issue doesn't cripple business,\" he told the BBC.\nThis is a big moment for the national mood and the UK economy - particularly those sectors which have been hardest hit by the restrictions.\nNearly one million hospitality and leisure workers will go back to work today according to industry estimates. Although many have been open for outside service, 60% of hospitality venues have no outside space and have been unable to open till now. \nHowever, this is not the champagne moment many had hoped for. The real prize for businesses in hospitality and beyond was the planned removal of all restrictions on 21 June.  The recent increasing concerns and government warnings about the threat posed by the Indian variant to the reopening roadmap are casting an unwelcome cloud of uncertainty. \nEven with the restrictions being eased today, with the reintroduction of seated indoor drinking and dining, many businesses will still be unable to operate anywhere near pre-pandemic capacity and will be facing the prospect of deferred rent bills, the repayment of Covid loans and an increasingly acute staff shortage as hospitality workers who left the industry don't yet feel confident enough to return. \nA separate report from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said employers would have to improve pay and working conditions to get the staff they need.\nStephen Burns, chief executive of the Hollywood Bowl Group, which runs bowling and mini-golf sites throughout the UK, said his venues had only been able to trade for seven or eight of the past 62 weeks, costing the business \u00a3100m in lost revenue, during which time bills had mounted.\n\"Whilst we are incredibly grateful for the support that we have seen from the government, there has still been the cost of keeping our team members on furlough, as well as paying our rent, service charges and utility bills, so it has had a significant impact on our cashflows.\" He said maintaining the furlough scheme had cost the firm \u00a3100,000 a week.\nHollywood Bowl had been able to engage with its landlords, something that wasn't happening across all areas of the leisure sector, he added.\nAfter reopening, the bowling alleys would only run at half capacity, said Mr Burns, until measures to curb the pandemic end altogether, currently scheduled for 21 June, according to the government's roadmap.\nHowever that date has now been thrown into doubt. The government has said it will make a decision on 14 June about whether the final easing of restrictions can go ahead.\nMs Katona said many businesses would make little or no profit while capacity was still restricted.\n\"In order to survive, what needs to happen is that we need to trade at the levels that we were trading prior to Covid,\" she said.\n\"While social distancing is in place we cannot do that. Many places will not be able to make any kind of profit while restrictions are in place.\"\nShe fears many businesses will go bankrupt in the Autumn as landlords demand rent arrears and says the government should look at things like business rates and VAT rates as well as support with debts due to landlords.\nMr Kwarteng said he hoped the final lifting of restrictions, including ending the need to distance indoors, would go ahead in June, but that he couldn't offer any \"cast iron guarantees\"."

      "text": "For most it's just a sore arm - for others it can wipe you out - but why does the Covid vaccine act this way? \nBBC Wales journalist George Herd has a special interest as he lives with an immune system health condition.\nMore than 35 million people in the UK have now had at least their first Covid jab - including more than 62% of the population in Wales. \nA study of 600,000 people across the UK found the most common side effect of the jab was pain where the needle went in.\nBut one in four experienced other symptoms - fever, headaches and nausea - that last about a day.\nThe question I wanted to ask was: Were those who had less of a reaction still protected?\nAnd what about those - like me - who have a condition that affects how their immune system works?\nI lost my spleen following an accident as a young teen.\nA fist-sized organ that hides just under the left ribs, it has an important role to play in the immune system. It's part of our arsenal in fighting infection.\nOf course, I'm living proof that you can survive without one. I have an active and full life, often to be found on the hills above my home in north Wales - where I have even taken part in the gruelling Snowdonia marathon.\nHowever, I am at risk of potentially overwhelming infections, and have repeat vaccinations against certain illnesses, in particular pneumonia.\nI also tend to get prescribed antibiotics on a much more regular basis than most.\nBut I've been lucky - and only once ended up on a hospital drip due to an infection.\nI had my first Covid jab back in February - now I've had my second and am fully vaccinated.\nI fell squarely in the no-reaction camp to the vaccinations. Sore arm, yes - but little else to note.\nWas that, however, because my immune systems are damaged?\nWhat about those who have to take drugs to suppress their immune system, such as organ transplant patients, or those undergoing treatment for cancer?\nIs the Covid jab working for them?\nAn emphatic \"yes\" says expert immunologist Veenu Manoharan.\n\"I get emails from people who have compromised immune systems, maybe because they are taking drugs for chronic diseases, asking me the same thing,\" said the Cardiff Metropolitan University lecturer.\n\"But the studies state that even though the first dose maybe does not give them enough antibodies, the second dose will. It will give them immunity.\n\"It is not the case that those people on immunosuppressants are without hope. The second dose really does help improve their level of antibodies.\"\nGood news then for those who have been facing that worry - including myself.\nBut what about those who showed no or little reaction to the jab?\nDoes this mean it hasn't worked as well as those laid up in bed for a day or two afterwards?\nNot at all, insists Dr Manoharan.\nAnd that's because of what vaccines are and how they work.\nAll the Covid vaccines being used in the UK - Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna - work to stimulate a response from the immune system, triggering it to make antibodies.\nThese antibodies then identify specific germs or viruses, and act as a signal for the rest of the immune system to take out the unwanted invaders.\n\"Sometimes our immune response is exaggerated, especially when you are having a vaccine,\" explained Dr Manoharan.\nThe \"exaggerated\" responses are those fevers and chills or fatigue, as your body is tricked into believing it is under attack and needs to respond.\nBut whether you experience an exaggerated response or not will depend on many factors - including your own genetic make-up and medical history.\nYour sex also has a role to play.\nWomen are more likely to trigger a stronger immune response, because the hormone oestrogen is known to enhance the immune system.\nSimilarly, higher levels of the hormone testosterone in men have the opposite effect on the immune system - it suppresses the inflammatory response of the reaction.\nAge also plays its part.\nAs you get older, your immune system becomes less active. So those who got the jabs first - the oldest in our society - would be expected to have less of a reaction and that's exactly what happened.\nSimilarly, the younger you are, the more likely your immune system will react more energetically to the vaccine.\nOne review of vaccination research suggested other factors can play a role in the reaction.\nBehaviour such as smoking, alcohol consumption, body weight and exercise levels - even the time of day you get a jab - could influence how the vaccine works.\nBut Dr Manoharan's view is that none of this matters.\n\"If you don't have an exaggerated reaction, it does not mean your immune system isn't working.\n\"If you think about it, every day we are exposed to a variety of microbes and pollutants. Our immune systems are constantly detecting those.\n\"But we don't feel ill. Our immune system is protecting us every single minute of the day - we just don't notice it.\"\nSo whether you felt unwell after your Covid jab - or nothing at all - the science is telling us we should get a good level of protection."

      "text": "Thousands of Rangers supporters have marched on Glasgow city centre to celebrate their club's Scottish Premiership title win.\nThe club and the police had urged fans to disperse after they gathered at Ibrox Stadium for the final game of the season as Rangers beat Aberdeen 4-0.\nPolice Scotland said some arrests had been made for anti-social behaviour.\nGlasgow remains in level 3 of Covid lockdown restrictions, with large gatherings outdoors not permitted.\nFans clambered onto the gates outside the stadium after the final whistle. Flares and smoke bombs were also set off.\nLarge numbers of fans then marched towards Glasgow city centre and unofficial celebrations in George Square.\nPolice Scotland said it had declined a request to facilitate the march to George Square and urged the crowd to go home.\nCh Supt Mark Sutherland, divisional commander for Greater Glasgow division, said: \"Today is understandably a significant day for Rangers Football Club and its supporters. We understand the importance of football in Glasgow.\n\"We are however still in the midst of a pandemic and under Coronavirus restrictions people should not be gathering for any reason.\"\nPolice Scotland said the march was \"largely peaceful in nature\" and it would not be proportionate to disperse the crowd by force.\nCh Supt Sutherland added: \"We will continue to police these events in a proportionate manner and officers are engaging with those who have gathered and are encouraging dispersal while tackling any anti-social behaviour.\"\nAfter the match, Rangers tweeted \"We are the champions\" and repeated an earlier call for fans to celebrate \"in a safe and sensible manner\" and disperse from Ibrox.\nScotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf also called on supporters to take \"responsibility\" for their actions while level three restrictions remain in place.\nHe tweeted: \"While there is a significant Police presence at Ibrox and across City, this is ultimately about personal responsibility. If you have gathered you should disperse, particularly given yesterday's announcement about Covid in Glasgow.\nOn Friday night, Rangers supporters set off a large number of red flares and smoke bombs on the banks of the River Clyde in Glasgow.\nThe Ibrox club's first title in a decade was wrapped up in early March when thousands of fans gathered outside Ibrox and in Glasgow city centre.\nSupporters were also accused of breaking coronavirus rules in Belfast and in Corby - which is known as \"little Scotland\" - following Rangers' win.\nLast May, thousands of Liverpool fans flouted social distancing guidelines and gathered outside Anfield to celebrate the club's first Premier league title in 30 years.\nAnd in November hundreds of Celtic supporters defied the level four restrictions and converged on Celtic Park to call for the removal of the club's then manager Neil Lennon."

      "text": "Tourism bodies have urged Stormont to rethink guidance on visitors arriving from the Common Travel Area (CTA).\nPeople visiting friends and family in Northern Ireland from GB, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands or Isle of Man will be exempt from a requirement to self-isolate from 24 May.\nNew guidance states those exempt from self-isolation must take Covid-19 tests before departure and on later dates.\nThe Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance described this as \"unmanageable\".\nPreviously, Stormont ministers had only advised that people could travel from Northern Ireland to the CTA for essential reasons.\nOn Thursday, the executive announced relaxations to this rule, but introduced certain requirements for travellers arriving into Northern Ireland. \nThe new guidance sets out that anyone exempt from self-isolation will be asked to take lateral flow tests for Covid-19 pre-departure, as well as on days two and eight post-arrival into Northern Ireland.\nAll other visitors will be required to self-isolate on arrival for 10 days.\nBoth the Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance and the Travel Association (ABTA) have raised concerns over the new rules. \nNorthern Ireland Tourism Alliance chief executive Joanne Stuart said it \"remained unclear how the controls would be managed and by whom\".\nShe described the testing requirements as \"complicated and confusing\" and said they would have the potential to put off visitors from coming.\n\"What people desperately want after months of uncertainty is confidence and clarity and this latest updated guidance does nothing to provide any of that,\" Ms Stuart said. \nShe added that it would also \"shut down plans to promote Northern Ireland as a visitor destination\" for travellers in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.\nChief executive of ABTA, Mark Tanzer, believes Northern Ireland should follow England, Scotland and Wales in publishing a green list of destinations where holidaymakers can return from without having to self-isolate.\nMr Tanzer said the executive must also \"continue to provide financial support through to recovery\".\nMembers of the Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance have requested urgent meetings with representatives from the Northern Ireland Executive Office, Department for the Economy and Department of Health to press for change."

      "text": "The next Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Edwin Poots has indicated he will consult with the party about whether Arlene Foster should stand down as first minister earlier than her intended departure date.\nMrs Foster said she would stay on as first minister until the end of June.\nMr Poots said he was keen to ensure a smooth transition. \nIn an interview with the Sunday Life newspaper, he confirmed he would not take the first minister post himself.\nMr Poots added that party members could also judge whether he is the \"right man to stay\" in his current role as agriculture minister, or whether he should take on a different brief or leave ministerial office.\n\"I want our party to be a party that is healing and fit for purpose going forward. Therefore, I will deal with things as gently as I possibly can but also practically going forward,\" he told the newspaper.\n\"I will ascertain those views over the next few days.\"\nAmong those tipped as possible successors as first minister are DUP MLAs Mervyn Storey, Paul Givan, Paul Frew and the party's new deputy leader Paula Bradley.\nOn Friday, Mr Poots defeated his Lagan Valley constituency colleague Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP in the DUP's first contested leadership election in its 50-year history.\nMr Poots said advice from colleagues will be \"critical\" to determining any changes to the DUP's ministerial team.\nHe explained that by rejecting the role of first minister, which has been held by previous DUP leaders, whoever occupies it instead can focus on \"leading the country and dealing with the machinations of government\".\n\"The leader of unionism can focus on reinvigorating unionism,\" he continued.\n\"This is absolutely critical now\".\nWith an assembly election a year away in 2022, Mr Poots said he planned to speak with the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) about ways to maximise the unionist vote.\nHe described the possibility of Sinn F\u00e9in becoming Stormont's largest party and nominating a first minister as \"destabilising\" and \"something a lot of people would find hard to swallow\".\nThe potential for a Sinn F\u00e9in justice minister \"would create problems\", he added, \"given the history of Sinn F\u00e9in and where they have come from and the attitude they had during the Troubles towards IRA violence\".\nMr Poots said he wants unionist parties to cooperate to find a \"solution\" to the issues arising from the Northern Ireland Protocol, an element of the UK-EU Brexit deal which has led to disruption and additional checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland.\nThe DUP leader designate said he has requested to meet the prime minister and NI Secretary Brandon Lewis to discuss the issues and will \"certainly be ramping things\" in expressing his opposition to the protocol.\n\"I have been working with a senior UK lawyer who is advising us on what steps we can take in terms of judicial remedies,\" he said.\n\"If there isn't real significant political progress made in the coming weeks, I would imagine we would be launching judicial proceedings in the not too distant future.\"\nMr Poots re-stated that he would not be attending North-South Ministerial Council meetings until there was a resolution. \nHe accused the Irish government of having \"hugely damaged north-south relations in their conduct over the protocol, the demands they have made and the aggressive nature\".\nDUP MLA Christopher Stalford, who supported Mr Poots' leadership campaign, told Sunday Politics that all unionist parties agree \"the protocol has to go\". \n\"The provision in the law says if 45 members of the assembly vote to remove the protocol then it will go and that is where I think that we do need to see, I don't want to talk about pacts, or stuff like that, but we do need to see a degree of cooperation across the broad unionist family in order to ensure that 45 unionists are elected to Stormont in the next assembly election.\"\nHowever, Doug Beattie, currently the only candidate for the UUP leadership, accused the DUP of \"not being honest with the electorate\" on efforts to scrap the protocol.\nMr Beattie told Sunday Politics the assembly cannot vote to end the protocol if unionists return with 45 MLAs, rather, only articles five to ten can be replaced.\n\"We have to start this off by being as honest as we possibly can,\" he said.\n\"We want rid of the protocol, but we have worked really hard to try and put in alternatives and mitigations to get rid of that protocol, but what we will not be doing is telling people an untruth to garner support.\""

      "tags": "Michael Gove,Priti Patel,Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Home Secretary Priti Patel has been accused of lobbying a fellow minister on behalf of a healthcare firm trying to get a government contract.\nIn May last year, Ms Patel wrote to Michael Gove expressing disappointment the government had not bought face masks from a company that had links to someone she knew.\nLabour has called for an investigation, saying she breached ministerial rules.\nBut Ms Patel's spokesman said she acted as she should have. \n\"The home secretary rightly followed up representations made to her about the vital supply of PPE,\" the spokesman said.\n\"During a time of national crisis, failure to do so would have been a dereliction of duty.\"\nIn recent weeks there have been a series of revelations about PPE deals awarded to those with government connections.\nIn May 2020, Ms Patel wrote a letter to Mr Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, about a company called Pharmaceuticals Direct Ltd that was in talks with the government about an order for face masks.\nShe said the government's \"late stage\" decision not to use the company had caused problems for the firm. \n\"I would be most grateful if you could review this matter urgently,\" she wrote in the letter to Mr Gove.\nThe contact at Pharmaceuticals Direct Ltd was a man called Samir Jassal, a Conservative activist who Ms Patel knew. According to his LinkedIn, he worked as an adviser to Ms Patel between 2014 and 2015 and on social media describes her as a \"good friend\". \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock wrote back to Ms Patel to say the masks being offered by the firm were \"not suitable for use in the NHS\". \nBut the company was later awarded a contract in July 2020, worth just under \u00a3103m, to supply a different type of mask. \nThe letters - which were first reported in the Daily Mail and now seen by the BBC - have come to light as part of a legal challenge by the Good Law Project.\nLabour called for an investigation, saying there was \"no evidence that the Home Secretary had any interest\" in the PPE deal until contacted by Mr Jassal, suggesting she did it \"as a favour to her friend\".\n\"This would represent a glaring and flagrant breach of the ministerial code,\" the party said, referring to the set of rules for ministers' conduct.\nLabour pointed to this principle in the code: \"Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise\".\nThe Good Law Project, a campaign group which took the government to court over not publishing PPE contracts, is taking legal action over the \u00a3103m contract for masks.\nThe government has previously said ministers have no part in deciding who gets contracts. \nAfter coronavirus hit the UK, the government struck thousands of deals with private companies, spending billions of pounds of public money in the process.\nBecause it was an emergency, the government was allowed to go directly to preferred suppliers without any competition. But it has led to questions about the way the contracts were chosen.\nMr Jassal previously said the company has 20 years' experience in the healthcare sector and it asked to supply PPE via an online government portal. The company, he said, had supplied PPE to various outlets for many years.\nPharmaceuticals Direct Limited said: \"The business is proud of its successful track record of procurement and supply to various medical organisations, including supplying NHS bodies.\n\"As a business that has specialised in the procurement and delivery of healthcare supplies for more than 20 years, PDL was (and is) both equipped and well suited to find solutions to the urgent demands of the pandemic.\"\nThe company also said Mr Jassal was not employed by PDL.\nThis article was updated on 18 May after Pharmaceuticals Direct Limited responded with a comment."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "After months of good news, including falling Covid cases and a hugely successful vaccination campaign, the tone has shifted.\nEngland's full relaxation of rules in June is in jeopardy and there is the looming spectre of greater pressure on the NHS. \nThe thorn in the plans is the variant of coronavirus that emerged in India - B.1.617.2 - and has started spreading around the world.\nConcerns have been mounting over the past week and, for the first time, the scientists advising the UK government are now confident it does spread more easily. \nThe expectation is the variant will edge out the one that emerged in Kent and eventually \"dominate\" cases in the UK. \nWe are in a race between the virus and the vaccine. Easing restrictions on Monday and a more transmissible variant means the virus will move even faster. \nBut there is still huge uncertainty about exactly how much better the B.1.617.2 variant is at spreading. \n\"That's a really critical question to which we do not yet have the answer,\" said Prof Chris Whitty.\nIf it is just a smidge faster than the Kent variant, which still makes up the overwhelming majority of cases in the UK, then there's not much to worry about.  \nHowever, the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) says there is a \"realistic possibility\" it could spread 50% faster, which is a lot. \nThere are some higher estimates of 60% coming out of India, but these are based on published genetic sequences from viral samples and its not clear how representative of the overall picture they are.\nSage estimates the problems would really start with a variant that was 40% more transmissible as it \"would lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations\" and put pressure on the NHS. \nThe uncertainty is reminiscent of last year when the new variant in Kent was first detected and raised questions about the approach to controlling the virus. \nBut it is important to remember we are not in the same situation as last year. \nMore than 19 million people - a third of the adult population - have had both jabs of their vaccine. Another 17 million have had one. Vaccines are weakening, if not eliminating, the link between infection and severe disease. \nAnd overall cases are also far lower. The Office for National Statistics estimates fewer than 50,000 people currently have the virus. The figure was 1.25 million at the start of the year. Currently there are only around 1,000 people in hospital with Covid.\nThe concern is that while vaccines are great they are not perfect and not everyone who is vulnerable has had one. So if there was another wave of cases from the combination of relaxing and a new variant then a worrying number of people could still end up in hospital. \nNote these predictions are not crystal balls. Earlier mathematical models had predicted a summer wave, but suddenly became far more optimistic once it became clear vaccinated people were less likely to spread the virus. \nPlans to reopen are going ahead, but the vaccination campaign is being tweaked to give more vulnerable people more immunity more quickly. \nThe hope is if the variant is going to pose a problem then there will be time to spot any further warning signs - such as a rise in hospital admissions - and then act.\nThe prime minister, Boris Johnson, said that if the Indian variant proves to be \"significantly more transmissible\" than other strains then \"we're likely to face some hard choices\" in the UK.\nBut the problem posed by more transmissible variants is far greater in countries that haven't got successful vaccination programmes, where they could be hugely damaging.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Companies,World Health Organization (WHO),Economics,Global economy,United Arab Emirates,Aerospace,Air travel,Vaccine passports,Dubai,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The boss of the world's busiest airport for international passengers has said Covid passports are the only way to restart mass foreign travel. \nDubai Airports chief executive Paul Griffiths told the BBC: \"I don't think there is an alternative.\"\nCritics of the digital systems argue they discriminate against those who cannot get vaccinated.\nBut Mr Griffiths says he is a complete supporter of the documents, which he says are \"inevitable\". \n\"I think the problem is not the vaccine passport and its discrimination. It's the need to roll things out and have a proper globally equitable vaccine programme,\" he said.\nThe World Health Organisation and World Travel & Tourism Council are among those opposed to vaccine passports amid fears they will create a  \"two-tier society\". \nLast month, Dr Mike Ryan from the WHO repeated concerns about the ethical and fairness issues surrounding vaccine passports.  \n\"They do need to be considered, especially in a world where vaccine is distributed in such a grossly inequitable way,\" he said.\nThe aviation industry is desperately looking for ways to pick up speed after the damage wrought by government restrictions and a collapse in passenger confidence.\nAccording to the Air Transport Action Group, it was making a $3.5 trillion annual contribution to the global economy before the pandemic.\nHowever, with flights grounded, the numbers going through Dubai International Airport have collapsed in a similar way to the rest of the industry. \nEven so, 2020 was Dubai's seventh year in a row as the world's busiest airport for international passengers, having overtaken London Heathrow in 2014.\nA record 86.3 million people passed through in 2019, but as the coronavirus pandemic grounded flights, that fell 70% to 25.8 million last year. \nMr Griffiths wants that number to rise again: \"We need to get into risk management rather than risk avoidance.\"\nHe added: \"I just don't think the world can survive without that mobility for much longer, certainly socially and economically, but you can understand why countries around the world are being very conservative. The last thing any politician wants is a surge of infection on their turf.\"\nLast year, the United Arab Emirates saw its economy contract by 6.1% amid the global slowdown.\nFor Dubai, a Middle Eastern hub which plays a key role in joining East and West, air travel is key to repairing the damage. \nMr Griffiths says: \"The city's been  built as a global hub and it's enabled a tremendous commercial and tourism centre to be developed here in the UAE. \n\"So we are pretty dependent, because at least 35% of GDP is based around the enablement of travel and tourism, so it has a big dramatic effect here.\" \nTo get through the crisis, the airport has cut costs by closing entire terminals and concourses, which means a bailout from Dubai's government has been avoided.\n\"We were able to get into a position where we could cover all of our costs with about 20% of our throughput, which is where we are at the moment,\" explains Mr Griffiths.\nHe adds that 8,500 jobs have been reduced to 2,500. \"It's been a lot of pain for a lot of people. But we're well positioned to recover now.\"\nThe desire to recover and avoid new outbreaks of coronavirus has led to the emergence of several different Covid travel passes. The European Union, the G20 and International Air Transport Association are all working on schemes.\nMr Griffiths says even if multiple systems are introduced for checking passengers, his airport can avoid queues such as those seen at London Heathrow.  \n\"Whatever the system, we will adapt our processes to ensure that our passengers aren't put in huge long queues,\" he adds.\nThose passengers that are flying are being looked after by \"near-hospital theatre levels of cleanliness\" as well as physical distancing and insistence on mask wearing.\nTechnology is also helping stop the spread of germs, with the acceleration of contactless check-in and immigration arrangements.\nWhen it comes to the rules, passengers are \"adhering extremely well, because we make sure they adhere to them\", Mr Griffiths says. \n\"We've got a very, very close eye on them: 6,000 CCTV cameras watch the passenger flow, because obviously, we've got to keep everything moving, to keep everything safe and secure.\"\nIf international air travel is to get moving again, \"it's up to the countries to decide what the entry requirements are, and it's up to the airlines and the airports around the world to enforce it\", says Mr Griffiths.\n\"If this all works, and everyone comes together, vaccine passports will be a very, very simple way of us travelling without documents around the world.\"\nYou can watch Paul Griffiths' full interview on \"Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst\" this weekend on BBC World News at Saturday 23:30 GMT, Sunday 05:30 and 16:30 GMT, Monday 06:30 GMT and 10:30 GMT and Tuesday at 12:30 GMT."

      "title": "Concussion: Rugby 'should follow NFL' to reduce brain injury risk",
      "tags": "Dementia",
      "text": "Rugby union's authorities should have taken action a decade ago to reduce the amount of contact in training.\nThat is the view of the man who helped secure big changes in American football.\nThere is an \"epidemic\" of brain injuries in rugby according to the solicitor leading a legal challenge by ex-players.\nBut the Welsh Rugby Union says it will \"never sit still\" when it comes to player safety. \nElite rugby has made big changes in an attempt to address concussion, with players having to undergo a head injury assessment (HIA) if officials are concerned, and red cards shown to anyone targeting an opponent's head.\nBut former professionals have told BBC Wales Investigates the potential long-term damage from concussions and sub-concussions was not highlighted enough during their careers.\nAnd, while brain damage was discussed as far back as the mid-1970s, recent research has shown a lack of awareness about the issue, even among some professionals.\nAlix Popham has the framed jersey from his last Wales game - a win against England in 2008 - and has been shown pictures of him celebrating afterwards.\nBut he cannot remember the game. \n\"We were doing so much contact my brain was inflamed and my memories weren't storing,\" he said.\nYears after he retired, Popham had a blackout during a bike ride, leading to his wife Mel insisting he saw his GP.\nAfter various tests, his neurologist called with terrible news.\n\"Mel and I held hands and he said with everything put together, the scans, the neuropsychological testing, him interviewing myself, that he gave me the diagnosis of early onset dementia and probable CTE [chronic traumatic encephalopathy],\" said the former Wales flanker.\n\"We were crying, we were screaming,\" said his wife. \"I ran to the toilet and was physically sick. It was such an overwhelming shock.\"\nPopham said what the medical staff said left him in no doubt that repeated knocks from playing rugby for 14 years caused the issues.\n\"It was bone on bone, 15 v 15, there was contact every day,\" he said, adding he may have taken \"more than 100,000\" blows in his career.\nNot long after Popham retired, there was a landmark change in another contact sport - American football.\nIn 2011 the NFL Players Association fought successfully for better player welfare, a key change being reducing the amount of training impacts.\nContact in training camps has been halved, and only one contact training session is allowed a week during the season.\n\"It was initially resisted but is now fully embraced,\" said Thom Mayer of the association, who estimates players are now taking 70,000 fewer hits in their careers.\nAsked whether he thought rugby union had a \"problem\" for failing to introduce measures, Dr Mayer said: \"Yes, I would say yes, because they are so similar in many, many respects.\n\"I can assure you it won't change the nature of the game.\"\nSean Holley, who spent 15 years as a professional coach, admitted to being surprised rugby union had not taken similar action to the NFL.\nHe said in his coaching days, concussion was not enough of a priority.\n\"It was very much 'finger in the air'. I've been on very many coaching courses and very little was spoken about concussion.\"\nPopham also says there was \"no education\" about concussion when he was playing.\n\"I always thought it [concussion] was when you were knocked out cold, but 90% of concussions happen when you're not knocked out.\n\"So the only thing I can remember after a concussion was 'are you feeling sick?' And if you weren't, you could carry on.\"\nHe believes problems associated with concussion were known to the rugby authorities while he was playing, but the information was not filtered down to coaches and medical staff.\n\"We know now - but they knew then. But we weren't told,\" he said.\nPopham and Holley have both called for rugby to enact the same changes as the NFL.\nWorld Rugby told the BBC that contact in training was constantly reviewed, and it issued some guidance on this before the last World Cup. It also says rugby is very different to the NFL. \nIn December, Popham and a small group of former players announced they were suing World Rugby, the RFU and the Welsh Rugby Union over brain damage. \nTheir solicitor Richard Boardman believes, based on research compiled for the case, that as much as 50% of the rugby-playing community could be left with some form of neurological issue.\n\"That's not to say everyone would end up with dementia, or a disease at the extreme end of the spectrum, but it could be things like short-term post-concussion syndrome, epilepsy and so on,\" he said.\n\"We believe this is an epidemic.\"\nQuestions the court case may consider are how much the rugby authorities knew about the dangers of concussion and when they may have found that out. \nThe BBC has seen reports showing head injuries were discussed at an International Rugby Board medical conference in 1975.\nA neurosurgeon warned then that even \"apparently slight\" injuries could be life-threatening.\nIn 1992, at another rugby medical conference, two neurosurgeons said there was evidence of some permanent damage from even a single concussion, and warned three concussions should mean the end of someone's career.\nWorld Rugby says the game continues to evolve and that while opinions on the management of concussion vary, it acts on scientific research. \nWillie Stewart, a consultant neuropathologist, said concussion had an impact \"deep down in the brain\".\n\"As the head is impacted, the brain rotates inside the skull and there's some stretch and shear of some very fine fibres and blood vessels, and that causes some functional change,\" he said.\nHe admitted a direct link of causation between impacts and brain injury was \"really difficult\" to prove, but evidence was adding up.\nOne former international who wants to know more is Jamie Roberts, a qualified doctor who played alongside Popham for Wales.\n\"I've spoken to Alix and it makes you a bit worried, there's no doubt about that,\" he said.\n\"This causation is huge for the game.\n\"If you could turn round and say 'right, rugby causes this - 100%, without failure' - then we're having a different conversation.\n\"But that has not been established yet.\"\nThe rugby world may have been alerted to the dangers of concussion in the 1970s, but as recently as 2016, studies by academics at Cardiff Metropolitan University were carried out in Wales to find out much professionals and amateurs knew.\nThe results showed a worrying lack of awareness even among professionals, including the mistaken belief skull-caps could prevent concussion.\nPrav Mathema, national medical manager at the WRU, was part of that research. So was he disappointed with the level of knowledge? \nHe said since those studies, education programmes and research carried out by the union had seen concussion knowledge improve. \n\"We will never sit still when it comes to safety within the game,\" he said.\n\"That is the overriding and clear message that, as a governing body, we will support player welfare.\"\nWorld Rugby says it welcomes input from all in involved in the game, and is saddened by the accounts of former players, recognising it has not been easy for them to speak out.  \nProf Stewart says at the top level, rugby is leading the way in removing concussed players from the pitch, but he says more needs to be done.\n\"There's a brain injury in almost every professional match,\" he said. \"We can't accept that.\"\nPopham has set up a charity called Head for Change to raise awareness of the issue and support other ex-players.\n\"I don't want to be angry,\" he said.\n\"I want to try and make a positive change to the boys who are playing now, and for future generations.\"\nBBC Wales Investigates Rugby: The cost of concussion is on Monday 17 May at 20:25 BST on BBC One Wales and afterwards on BBC iPlayer."

When a tragedy happens like this, we want the family to know that,\" he said.\nThe long procession took nearly one-and-a-half hours to pass through.\nIn a tweet, Longsands JFC said their under-nine squad and and Ribbleton FC had earlier \"perfectly observed a minute's silence as a mark of respect and support\".\nJordan, a Liverpool supporter, was taken to hospital with serious injuries after the lightning strike but died a short time later.\nHis father Matt Banks described him as \"an amazing little person\" with \"the biggest heart\".\nHe said his son's organs had been donated to three children.\nThe minute's silence was observed by clubs across four adult leagues and four junior leagues.\nFormer Liverpool striker John Aldridge tweeted there was sadness \"beyond words\"  for Jordan \"at all the grassroots football here in Liverpool\".\nMr Hall said as a father he felt moved to honour Jordan.\n\"I live in Kirkham and my seven-year-old lad was also playing football on Tuesday.

      "text": "Iran's judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi and former parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani have registered to run in next month's presidential election.\nThe two conservatives, who have close ties with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, are seen as the leading contenders to succeed Hassan Rouhani.\nMr Rouhani, a moderate, is not allowed to run for a third consecutive term.\nMore than 300 other hopefuls have also applied to be candidates. They must all now be vetted by the Guardian Council.\nThe 12 theologians and jurists on the council approved only six of the more than 1,600 candidates for the last election in 2017, which Mr Rouhani won in the first round with 57% of the vote. Mr Raisi came second with 38%.\nSince then there has been rising discontent in Iran over the state of the country's economy, which has been crippled by US sanctions reinstated in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump. \nHe abandoned a nuclear deal negotiated by Mr Rouhani that saw Iran limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. Iran stopped abiding by key commitments in response to the move.\n\"I have come as an independent to the stage to make changes in the executive management of the country and to fight poverty, corruption, humiliation and discrimination,\" the 60-year-old Mr Raisi said in a statement on Saturday before registering his candidacy.\nLater, in an apparent dig at establishment figures like Mr Larijani and candidates allied to Mr Rouhani, the hard line cleric told journalists that \"those who founded and partnered with the current situation can't claim they can change it\".\nReformists and human rights activists have expressed concerns about Mr Raisi's background, particularly his role in the mass executions of several thousand political prisoners in 1988. \nMr Raisi has said the executions were justified because the late Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or religious ruling.\nMr Larijani, a 63-year-old conservative former nuclear negotiator who currently serves as an adviser to Ayatollah Khamenei, said the other presidential contenders were not capable of fixing the economy, particularly those with military or judicial backgrounds. \n\"The economy is neither a garrison nor a court that would be managed with shouts and orders,\" he told a news conference after registering. \nOther candidates in the 18 June election include Mr Rouhani's First Vice-President, Eshaq Jahangiri; former Supreme National Security Council secretary and nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili; and Expediency Council Secretary Mohsen Rezaei, a former head of the Revolutionary Guards.\nThe Guardian Council will publish a list of approved candidates on 27 May."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has \"increasing confidence\" that Covid-19 vaccines work against the Indian variant of the virus, the health secretary has said.\nScientists believe that the variant is more transmissible and cases of it nearly tripled to 1,313 in the past week in England.\nBut Matt Hancock said early lab data showed vaccines remained effective.\nHe said the majority of those in hospital in Bolton - a hotspot for the Indian variant - were unvaccinated.\nMore than 20 million people in the UK have now had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest government figures.\nMr Hancock welcomed the new milestone as \"great news\" and said the UK was making \"extraordinary strides\" as millions now have the fullest possible protection against the virus.\nThe figures also show a further four people have died within 28 days of a positive test, and another 1,926 new infections have been identified.\nSpeaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, the health secretary said that the Indian variant, known as B.1.617.2, was \"relatively widespread in small numbers\" in most of the country.\nIt comes as England is due to move to stage three of the government's roadmap for easing lockdown on Monday, with socialising in groups of six indoors as well as some international travel to be allowed.\nOn Friday Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the variant could pose \"serious disruption\" to the final stage of lockdown easing in England on 21 June.\nMr Hancock said that it was \"quite likely\" that the variant would become the dominant strain in the UK.\nHe said: \"What that reinforces is the importance of people coming forward for testing and being careful because this isn't over yet.\n\"But the good news is because we have increasing confidence that the vaccine works against the variant, the strategy is on track - it's just the virus has gained a bit of pace and we've therefore all got to be that bit more careful and cautious.\"\nMr Hancock also defended the easing of lockdown rules in England from Monday, saying the government's strategy was to \"replace the restrictions with vaccination\" as the first line of defence against the virus.\nBut Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, told the BBC that even though rules were being eased in most parts of the UK on Monday people should be \"very cautious about mixing\".\nA decision on whether all legal restrictions could be ended next month would be made on 14 June, Mr Hancock said. \nHe also confirmed over-35s in England would be able to book an appointment for their Covid-19 jabs in the coming week.\nThree things explain why the government and experts are sounding so cautious.\nFirstly, we've known for a while that the vast majority of Covid infections take place when people mix indoors, and that's exactly what will be allowed with the next phase of lockdown easing in England on Monday. \nSecondly, the vaccination programme, for all its success, is still a long way from reaching all adults with two doses. And, even when it does, it can't guarantee 100% protection for everyone.\nThirdly, the more transmissible Indian variant is casting an unsettling shadow over the roadmap out of lockdown. \nThe guidance is to be concerned rather than to panic. The variant may well be less hazardous than feared but key questions about it remain unanswered. \nIn any event, the hope is to vaccinate many more people as quickly as possible and in the meantime to highlight the risks. \nThe advice can be summed up like this: think twice about lingering for hours in a crowded room that has little fresh air. \nIn Bolton there are 18 people in hospital with coronavirus, with the majority of those not having the jab despite being eligible, the health secretary said.\nHe added that five people had ended up in hospital having had one jab, while there was one there who had received both doses but was \"frail\".\nThe Greater Manchester town, where the Indian variant is spreading, has seen a spike in infections and Mr Hancock said he could not rule out imposing local restrictions.\nSurge testing is taking place in targeted areas across England where virus variants have been found, including postcodes within several London boroughs, Sefton, Worcestershire, and Nottingham.\nThe vaccine programme is being accelerated in areas where there are rising cases from the variant, with vaccination buses being used in Bolton.\nBlackburn with Darwen public health director Dominic Harrison tweeted that an additional supply of more than 1,000 Pfizer-BioNTech jabs per day would be available for all residents over 18 in high variant spread areas for the next two weeks.\nProf John Edmunds, who sits on the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told Andrew Marr people should be \"concerned but not panicking\" about the new variant.\n\"We are in a much, much better position than we were when the Kent variant started spreading,\" he said, pointing to hospitals having few Covid patients and the vaccine programme being in place.\nOn Thursday the number of patients in hospital with Covid dropped below 1,000 for the first time in eight months, down from the peak of nearly 40,000 in January.\nDespite concerns about the Indian variant, coronavirus restrictions across England, Scotland and Wales are due to be relaxed from Monday.\nCurbs lifting across the devolved nations vary, but there will be a greater degree of indoor mixing allowed and more hospitality venues will be able to reopen.\nNorthern Ireland is due to review its restrictions later this month.\nIn England, six people or two households can meet indoors, with pubs, restaurants and cafes allowed to serve customers inside. Up to 30 people can meet outdoors. Museums, cinemas, theatres and sports stadiums can reopen, and indoor exercises resume. People can travel abroad to green list countries without needing to quarantine when they return.\nUp to six people from a maximum of three households can socialise indoors in Scotland, and entertainment venues such as cinemas, theatres and bingo halls can reopen. Alcohol can be served indoors in hospitality venues until 22:30, and international travel will be allowed in line with England's rules.\nIn Wales, pubs, cafes, bars and restaurants reopen for indoor service, with groups of up to six from six households permitted to meet. All holiday accommodation can reopen fully, as can indoor visitor attractions, such as galleries and museums. International travel can resume in line with the traffic light system.\nNorthern Ireland is reviewing its restrictions on 20 May, with the hope more restrictions will be lifted on 24 May.\nYou can read more about the changes across the UK here.\nLabour's Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said she felt worried about Monday's easing but recognised that businesses had prepared to open and that the government said vaccines were effective against the variant.\nShe said it was right to concentrate on increasing vaccinations, testing and help fill the financial \"gap\" so people can self-isolate.\nOn Saturday, the British Medical Association (BMA) said it had serious concerns about the decision to continue with the easing of lockdown restrictions.\nMeanwhile, minutes from a meeting of government scientific advisers, held on Thursday, said that \"an even faster increase can be expected if measures are relaxed\" in areas where the Indian variant is already spreading.\nAnd if the variant was 40-50% more transmissible than the current dominant type, they warned proceeding to step three of England's roadmap on Monday would likely \"lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations (similar to, or larger than, previous peaks)\"."

      "tags": "Lobbying in the United Kingdom,Lobbying,Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Health Secretary Matt Hancock has defended his role in helping a former Conservative minister to secure a PPE deal at the start of the pandemic. \nHe told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it was \"perfectly reasonable\" for him to send on an email when the country needed medical equipment.\nThe Sunday Times reported Mr Hancock \"personally intervened\" to help Brooks Newmark in getting the \u00a3180m deal. \nLabour called for greater transparency over deals made during the pandemic. \nWhen the coronavirus pandemic first hit in 2020, the NHS and social care settings faced a shortage of personal protective equipment, such as gloves, gowns and face masks, due partly to rising global demand. \nThe UK government began awarding contracts for supplies worth billions of pounds under emergency terms.\nThis meant deals were done with companies based on price and quality but without going though the usual competitive tendering process to save time. \nIn recent weeks there have been a series of revelations about PPE deals awarded to those with government connections.\nThe Sunday Times published a series of emails between Mr Hancock and Mr Newmark, the former civil society minister who resigned in 2014 after sending sexually explicit photographs of himself to an undercover journalist. \nThe paper reported that in May 2020 Mr Newmark teamed up with Zoe Ley, the owner of a dog food company who had set up a firm, Life Partners, to broker PPE deals for international supplies.\nIt said Mr Newmark first emailed the health secretary on 27 May, detailing a proposal explaining he had links to a \"well connected and powerful\" person in China but that he needed government help in accelerating deals.\nThe Sunday Times said Mr Hancock replied: \"Thanks. Definitely one for the PPE team who are firing on all cylinders now.\"\nThe newspaper said the Department of Health awarded a \u00a3178m contract for protective goggles to the firm on 1 June.\nAsked on the Andrew Marr Show if it was appropriate for Mr Newmark to lobby him for the contracts, Mr Hancock said it was \"absolutely appropriate\" for people to contact him. \nHe said the country \"desperately needed PPE\" so when the email arrived from Mr Newmark, he \"just pinged it on\" to the relevant teams because he did not have anything to do with awarding contracts.\nMarr read out a message from Mr Hancock's aide to Lord Deighton, the Government's PPE tsar, in which the proposal was labelled \"excellent\" and noted that Mr Hancock hoped it could be looked at \"urgently\".\nBut Mr Hancock denied that any special treatment was given, adding: \"We had a process in place to ensure when there were opportunities to get hold of PPE, to save lives on the frontline, they they were looked at rapidly. \n\"In this case, we ended up with 90 million goggles for people in the NHS as a result of this approach.\"\nThe process for taking up \"high quality offers\" was \"open to everybody\", he added, and \"many many people came through that process\" ensuring that the NHS did not face a \"national outage\". \n\"When somebody approaches the health secretary in the middle of a pandemic when you are desperately short of PPE, it's perfectly reasonable for the health secretary then to send on the email and say can we have a look at this.\"\nHe added: \"I'm glad that I did.\" \nThe BBC has contacted Mr Newmark for comment.\nLabour has called for ministers to publish all contacts and links they have with firms awarded government contracts during the Covid crisis.\nDeputy leader Angela Rayner said: \"It is a recurring theme of the pandemic that ministers have bent over backwards to help their donors, friends and supporters while other companies have had to beg to provide equipment that could help. \n\"Returning to normal after this crisis is over must not mean a return to Conservative cronyism, deals for mates and one rule for them and another for the rest of us,\" she added. \nThe latest development comes after an original investigation by the BBC's Panorama programme in March found Ms Ley had secured contracts worth \u00a3258m between the government and a Hong Kong firm.\nThe programme revealed Ms Ley was likely to have been paid at last \u00a31m by the firm for her work in securing the deals last spring when the UK was short of PPE.

We'll have another update for you tomorrow.\nBy 5 April, India was reporting more than 100,000 coronavirus cases a day. Yet it was not added to the UK's travel red list until 23 April. With scientists warning the India variant spreads more easily and cases in England nearly tripling in the last week, the government is defending its decision not to close the borders sooner. No 10 insists the UK has \"some of the toughest border measures in the world\" but experts have warned that lifting more lockdown restrictions on Monday is a \"real worry\" due to the number of younger people who remain unvaccinated. So, how much faster does the India variant spread?\nMonday will see a range of lockdown measures lifted for those in England, Wales and Scotland. While many people can't wait to take advantage of the new rules - meeting friends inside a pub, at the cinema or even going on holiday - others will be worried about just how safe it will be. The BBC spoke to health professionals and experts to find out what activities they will be embracing - and avoiding. Read more about exactly which rules change on Monday.\nBefore you head down to your favourite restaurant when they reopen for indoor dining, check that it's not one of thousands of establishments to have closed in the past year. Latest surveys indicate there are 9.7% fewer restaurants to choose from compared to before the pandemic. These are the rules for restaurants and pubs reopening.

We have responded appropriately and consistently to the behaviour of those gathered.\n\"This disgraceful behaviour which clearly endangered public and officer safety could not be tolerated and officers dressed in full public order equipment after appropriate warnings were given, moved in to disperse those present.\n\"Although most of those present dispersed, a number remained and confronted officers with violence and aggression. Missiles were thrown and officers came under direct attack as George Square and the surrounding area was cleared.\"\nNicola Sturgeon said she was \"angry on behalf of every law-abiding citizen\".\nThe first minister added: \"In normal times, the violence and vandalism and the vile anti-Catholic prejudice that was on display would have been utterly unacceptable. But mid-pandemic, in a city with cases on the rise, it was also selfish beyond belief.\"\nMs Sturgeon said she hoped Rangers would \"reflect on what more must be done to tackle this behaviour by fans, albeit a minority\".\nShe added: \"However, ultimate responsibility lies with those who behaved in such a thuggish, sectarian and selfish manner. And that's why we must let the police do their job.\" \nScotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said Glasgow was in a \"fragile\" place and it was \"disappointing to see people break the rules, in whatever setting and for whatever reason\".\nHe told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show: \"This virus has not gone away - we're not joking, we're not pretending - it's absolutely real.\n\"And the risk, particularly now in Glasgow, is quite high and Glasgow is fragile.\n\"You've seen us make an enormously difficult decision this week on our advice that has kept a bit of Glasgow in the same level.\n\"It feels like a tough day to watch that yesterday if you are a business owner or a family waiting for lunch or dinner.\"\nScottish Police Federation chairman David Hamilton said the people in George Square had shown a \"blatant disregard for the safety of the public and police officers\".\nHe told The Sunday Show: \"To see that number of people blatantly ignoring all the health advice, the government advice, the police advice - even the club advice to disperse - is just absolutely appalling.\n\"Policing in this country is, of course, done by consent. The whole strategy throughout the coronavirus pandemic has been about making sure people take personal responsibility and they have not done so.\n\"These people should not have been there in the first place and when they were asked to move, they should have gone.\"\nFans had been warned against gathering to celebrate due to rising Covid-19 cases in Glasgow.\nThe Union Bears fan group had earlier announced plans to walk from the stadium to George Square.\nOn Friday night, scores of Rangers fans lit red flares simultaneously along the River Clyde in the city as they marked the end of the season.\nIn an earlier statement on Saturday, Ch Supt Sutherland said: \"We understand the importance of football in Glasgow, how it connects our communities and, is for many, a culture and a way of life.\n\"We are, however, still in the midst of a pandemic and under coronavirus restrictions people should not be gathering for any reason.\"\nHe said a request for a fan procession to the city centre had been declined, but police later decided to escort large groups of supporters as they made their way to George Square in order to minimise disruption.\nSome arrests were made in the afternoon for anti-social behaviour.\nBut Ch Supt Sutherland said due to the largely peaceful nature of the crowd at that time \"it would not be proportionate for our resources to use a high level of force through public order policing to disperse those gathering\"."

      "text": "Isaac Andrews is rarely off his phone.  \nAs a community worker in the unionist and loyalist Shankill area of Belfast, he responds to calls from local residents who are often in need of help or advice. \nHis role also involves liaising with the police on a range of community policing matters. \nYet, he doesn't know anyone who has joined the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).  \n\"I'm sadly not aware of one person that I could tell you that I know from a working class background recently has joined the PSNI,\" he said.\n\"Most of the PSNI officers who I work with are from the suburbs, somewhere else in Belfast, but they're not working class.\"  \nPolice reform via the Patten Commission Report was a key part of the peace process. \nHowever, two decades after the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) was superseded by the PSNI, recruitment from some communities remains a challenge for policing in Northern Ireland. \n\"A lot of change happened in policing, like badges, uniforms, symbols, human-rights training,\" said Peter Sheridan, a former PSNI assistant chief constable. \n\"Unfortunately I think what happened is that all of those, if you like, shiny new police officers and new ideas and the new recruits went out into a society that largely hadn't changed, those deep-rooted divisions were there so that makes policing that environment still very difficult - and I think then that started to impact again more so in recent times around the politicisation of policing.\"\nPolice transformation was intended to build support for policing from all communities but attracting Catholics remains an issue for the PSNI. \nThe ongoing dissident republican threat to police officers, as witnessed in recent weeks, is seen as a major factor in Catholic under-representation.\nEmmet Doyle is the Aont\u00fa councillor for Ballyarnett on Derry City and Strabane District Council.\n\"I'm 34 and I don't know anyone, certainly from the area where I am, who has joined the PSNI,\" he said.\n\"There is a trade-off I suppose that many people from a nationalist/republican community would see when you join the police.  \n\"It's almost accepted that you won't be part of the community anymore and that's not necessarily something I agree with but that's the reality of it.\"\nThere has been a drop-off in applications from the Catholic community in recent years - the 2018 recruitment campaign had around 500 fewer applicants than the year before. \nAdd to that, the problem in trying to attract working-class Protestants, women, ethnic minorities and members of the LGBT community.\n\"The police service should reflect the society it comes from,\" said Peter Sheridan. \n\"We wanted young people from the Shankill Road, from Creggan, from the Bogside - that's what moderates policing when you have people from those communities - and if that disconnect is happening then it's not just a matter for the police and the police recruitment, it's a matter for all of society.\"\nChief Constable Simon Byrne said that in terms of recruitment, there is \"more to do\".  \n\"I think we have tried certainly in my time, in the last recruitment round which has been the first under my tenure, we did reach out into working class loyalist and Catholic communities to try and attract people from there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a recognition that there's more space to actually recruit people from all sorts of different backgrounds and it's a key commitment that I want to see fulfilled.\"\nSpotlight will be broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland on Tuesday, 18 May at 22:45 BST."

Video showed hundreds of worshippers dancing and singing just before the seating gave way.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was praying for the injured.\nThe synagogue was described as partially constructed. Police and local officials said organisers had been warned that the building was unsafe and the event had taken place despite a lack of permits.\n\"We were called again to another event where there was negligence and a lack of responsibility. There will be arrests,\" Jerusalem district police chief Doron Turgeman told television reporters.\nIsrael's government watchdog has launched an inquiry into the deadly crush at Mount Meron - one of Israel's worst civilian disasters - saying it could have been prevented.

      "text": "People have been able to spend time indoors with friends and family they don't live with since mid-May. \nBut, as the Delta variant first identified in India spreads, the government is asking whether these freedoms should be extended or not.\nCovid remains a risk, so what have we learned about how to stay safe?\nMany of us have got used to going out of our way to avoid coming too close to fellow pedestrians. \nBut it's highly unlikely such a short period of exposure outdoors could lead to an infection.\nAdmittedly, the closer you are to an infected person, the more likely you are to catch the virus - which is why we've been told to stay 2m (6ft) apart.\nBut most infections happen in places indoors where people are very near to one another. \nThere's also the question of how long you're near the infected person. \nWe don't know exactly how much virus exposure is necessary to cause illness - and it will vary by age and health - but it does have to reach a critical mass before it overwhelms the immune system. \nAnd it's worth remembering the NHS Test and Trace app only alerts contacts who have been close to a confirmed case for 15 minutes or more.\nAt the start of the pandemic, even going for a walk with a friend wasn't allowed - but scientists are confident being outdoors is much safer than being indoors. \nAt the start of the pandemic, a lot of focus was on surfaces. People washed groceries and avoided touching buttons at pedestrian crossings. Councils shut playgrounds and cordoned off park benches. \nYet it's been all but impossible to find an outbreak linked to an infected surface. \n\"It's to do with how the virus actually enters your system - it's through the airways,\" says Dr Eilir Hughes, a GP and campaigner for more protective PPE for NHS staff.\nThe virus takes hold in the body via the respiratory system - that's why testing for it involves a swab up the nose and down the back of the throat. \nIt would take an extremely unlikely chain of events for infected droplets on an object to end up in someone's nose or throat.\nHygiene is important, but washing hands and surfaces excessively, and avoiding touching objects - so-called \"hygiene theatre\" - has little impact on the spread of Covid.\nA 2m distance from other people may not always be enough to avoid infection. \nThe virus spreads in particles that come out of our nose and mouth when we breath, cough, sneeze and speak. \nLarger particles fall to the ground with gravity, like raindrops, and probably only hit people within 2m. \nBut some particles are so small they can float in the air - similar to deodorant or hairspray.  \nContrary to what was believed at the beginning of the pandemic, smaller particles can cause outbreaks. \nThat may well be how people have caught Covid from the opposite sides of buses, restaurants and even quarantine hotels.\nExperts are now putting more emphasis on ventilation. \nGood airflow dilutes and blows away droplets and disperses aerosols more effectively. \nIndoors, it's important to \"make sure you've got some means of getting fresh air in and out of a space\", says Prof Cath Noakes, a ventilation expert at the University of Leeds.\nAt home it's a good idea to keep a window or door open. And check that restaurants and pubs you visit are doing the same.\nIf there are more people in one place, there's more chance one of them is infected - and more targets for them to infect. \nCrowding also makes it more likely people will come into close contact. \nAnd the possibility of airborne transmission means even if you only interact with a handful of people, you could still catch it from someone on the other side of the room. \nCovid jabs protect you from becoming ill and go a long way to preventing you making other people ill too.\nThe chance of a vaccinated person transmitting Covid to an unvaccinated person is small. But the chances of infection spreading between two fully-vaccinated people are tiny. \nIf you're in a room with people who are all two weeks past their second dose, you have a very good level of protection before you even start to think about other measures.

      "text": "Extra Covid tests are taking place across England and Scotland in areas where new variants have been found.\nThis is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage.\nIncreased testing and enhanced contact tracing is carried out in very specific locations - local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets.\nSome of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not have Covid symptoms.\nThe testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants.\nSurge testing is currently taking place in areas of England where the new Delta variant - first identified in India - is spreading fastest.\nEast\nNorth West\nWest Midlands\nSouth East\nSurge testing is also currently being carried out in specific and targeted locations within the following local authority areas:\nLondon\nSouth East\nNorth West\nYorkshire and the Humber\nTargeted community testing is also taking place in various health board areas across Scotland. \nScientists have identified a number of \"variants of concern\" - these are  newly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. \nAlso, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines.\nThe Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). \nThe variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming system which uses Greek letters instead. \nThe PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test \nPeople tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. \nThis involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis.\nIt is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result.\nThe lateral flow test \nThis also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes.\nWherever you are in the UK, if you have symptoms you should book a free test online. You will be sent to a testing site or have a testing kit sent to your home. \nIf you have problems booking, call 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland. \nAnyone in England can now get free lateral flow tests each week - even if they do not have symptoms. These can be ordered online, by calling 119, or can be collected from test centres and pharmacies. \nAnyone in Scotland can also order free lateral flow tests online, or collect them from test centres.\nAnyone who gets a positive result test must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. NHS Test and Trace will tell their contacts to isolate if necessary.\nSelf-isolating means not leaving home for exercise or even to buy food, medicines or other essentials.\nPeople in England who fail to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to \u00a310,000.\nAnyone on a low income who has been told to self-isolate can claim a \u00a3500 payment."

We'll publish a list of these tomorrow.\"\nEarlier, the bank said it will share details on its website and social media channels from Monday about how impacted customers can make a claim.\nThe problems on Saturday left many people stuck in difficulty after they were unable to make payments.\nOne customer, Marcus Evans from Aberdare in south Wales, told the BBC he had lost a day's wages as he could not buy petrol to travel to his job as a CCTV operator.\n\"It's been an absolute nightmare,\" said the former member of the Armed Forces, who also said he could not do his weekly shop. \"It's ridiculous.\n\"I get my military pension and my wages paid into a Co-operative savings account and I transfer money on a weekly basis into my Santander account.\"\nSamantha Stewart said she had travelled all the way from her rural home in Argyll to the mainland to go shopping with her mother, when she realised she could not access her money.\n\"It wasn't until I was in the first store that I'd tried to log on,\" she said. \"I was wanting to transfer money from savings over to my account because I was planning to do quite a big shop. \n\"Essentially I was left with \u00a327 in my account. I had to decide whether to chance it with Apple Pay, knowing that it would take me into unarranged overdraft, or to go home.\"\nMeanwhile, Stephen Curtis, 58, from Gloucester, said he was \"definitely leaving the bank\" after the problems.\nHe said he was in a car showroom trying to buy a new car when his card was declined. \"It was so embarrassing,\" he said. \n\"This is unforgivable. I work in IT, I know about systems, I know about backups and upgrades. To have this happen, I would get the sack if it happened in my job.\" \nAnother customer, Jason Crossland, from Rotherham, told the BBC he became stuck in an outlet shopping centre with his children, unable to buy enough petrol to get home.\nThe head of money at consumer magazine Which? said the technical issues would have left many customers stressed.\n\"Customers can incur fines, penalties and fees when they're not able to access their finances, so the bank must offer compensation to all those who have been impacted in this way,\" said Gareth Shaw.\nOn Saturday evening, shortly before the problem was fixed, the UK's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, said it was aware of the issue and in contact with the firm.\nIt is not yet clear what caused the problem. Planned maintenance had been due to be performed on the Santander mobile banking app overnight on Friday."

      "text": "America\u2019s climate envoy John Kerry has been ridiculed for saying technologies that don\u2019t yet exist will play a huge role in stabilising the climate.\nSpeaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show, he said the US was leading the world on climate change - and rapidly phasing out coal-fired power stations.\nBut he rejected a suggestion that Americans need to change their consumption patterns by, say, eating less meat.\nHe said: \u201cYou don't have to give up quality of life to achieve some of the things we want to achieve.\n\u201cI\u2019m told by scientists that 50% of the reductions we have to make (to get to near zero emissions) by 2050 or 2045  are going to come from technologies we don\u2019t yet have.\u201d\nBut his faith in unknown technologies has left some leading engineers aghast.\nJulian Allwood, professor of engineering and the environment at the University of Cambridge, told BBC News: \"It's virtually impossible for new energy infrastructure technologies to have a significant effect on global emissions in the time we have left to act.\"\nHe warned that with every new energy-infrastructure technology so far, it's taken 30-100 years from invention to 5% penetration of existing markets.\n\"Firstly,\" he said, \"the new idea is developed from laboratory through increasing pilot scales to initial introduction to national systems.\n\u201cWe have to solve physical and operational issues, solve problems with integration, develop legal and environmental regulations, understand financing requirements and explore social consent as the first accidents occur. \n\u201cGrowth then occurs at a linear rate, as government appetite for risk is constrained, and the incumbent technology fights to avoid closure.\"\nHe said no country has ever introduced a new electricity generating technology at an average rate faster than 2% of national demand per year.\n\u201cDespite politicians' wishful thinking,\" he continued, \"the most important innovation opportunities will be not about new technologies, but new businesses in areas such as remote working.\"\nDr Jen Baxter, a spokeswoman for the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, agreed that John Kerry\u2019s timescale \u201cseems very optimistic\u201d.\nShe said some vital existing technologies such as capturing carbon from power stations and sucking CO2 directly from the air are not yet ready for mass usage.\nSo, rather than putting faith in start-up technologies, the world should focus on existing technologies. \n\u201cWe need to make use of every technology,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a massive amount of work and these time frames are going to be long.\u201d\n \u201cThere needs to be lifestyle changes, too - such as getting people on to public transport.\u201d\nThe prominent British engineer, Baroness Brown, said the climate crisis couldn\u2019t be solved without eating less meat.\nSome scientists, though, applauded Mr Kerry\u2019s techno-optimism.\nThe UK\u2019s former chief scientist, Professor Dave King, is a leading voice in Mission Innovation - a global initiative working to accelerate clean energy innovation.\nIt\u2019s spending $25bn of public money between the 25 nations in the coalition, rising to more than $40bn by 2025.  \nHe said: \"We need regulatory measures to bring the new technologies rapidly into the market place, and carbon  pricing on oil, gas and coal extraction to speed up the process.\"\nBut he, too, agreed we also need lifestyle changes - and new rules to force clean technologies on to the market.\nCraig Bennett from the UK Wildlife Trusts told BBC News Mr Kerry\u2019s remarks were \u201cfrankly ridiculous\u201d. \nHe said: \u201cOf course we will benefit from new technologies, but they are most likely to be in industries that already exist such as renewables and energy storage - rather than some widget that we can\u2019t imagine at the moment.\u201d\n\u201cWe also need some forms of behaviour change, like walking and cycling more and eating less meat. These policies deliver health benefits anyway.\u201d \nIn his interview, Mr Kerry defended the US record on combating climate change, saying President Biden was leading the charge to get to net zero. \nHe said some 58 US coal-fired power stations were slated for closure, and said it was impossible to get finance to build new ones:\n \"The marketplace has made a decision about coal. You couldn\u2019t build a new coal fired power plant in the United States because you can\u2019t finance it, nor even in Europe and other places. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing very hard for countries to begin to move away from fossil fuel and towards alternative, renewable, sustainable energy sources and I think, again, the marketplace is going to make that happen.\"\nHe said it was US policy to switch to renewable energy sources as quickly as possible: \"We are moving to alternative renewable energy. Our incentives are towards renewable alternative energy. Seventy-five percent of the electricity that\u2019s new, that came online in the last years, came online through renewables. \n\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to do what we need to do to do our fair share of this and to take a leadership role and we\u2019re doing that now.\"\nHe rejected  pessimism on climate change and said: \u201cWe\u2019ll not only get there (to Net Zero emissions), we\u2019ll get there sooner than people think.\"\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

It will take time,\" Mr Netanyahu warned.\nGaza officials said 42 people, including 16 women and 10 children, died in the latest Israeli air strikes.\nTen people, including two children, have been killed in rocket attacks on Israel since Monday, Israel said.\nThe overall death toll in Gaza now stands at 197 people, including 58 children and 34 women, with 1,235 injured, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry. Israel says dozens of militants are among the dead.\nMeanwhile, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting, with international mediators hoping to broker a ceasefire. \nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres opened the meeting by describing the violence as \"utterly appalling\" and said the fighting must stop immediately. \nSunday was the deadliest day so far\nThe Israeli air strikes hit a busy street in Gaza just after midnight on Sunday, causing at least three buildings to collapse and dozens of deaths. \nHamas launched barrage of rockets towards southern Israel overnight and during the afternoon. \nMillions of Israelis scrambled to safe rooms or shelters as sirens went off. Palestinians also tried to take precautions, but in the densely packed and poorly resourced Gaza Strip, many had nowhere to go.\nRiyad Eshkuntana told Reuters news agency he put his daughters to sleep in a room of his house that he thought was the furthest from the explosions. Only one of his daughters, Suzy, six, survived the night. His wife and three other children died.  \n\"I ran to check upon the girls,\" said Mr Eshkuntana. \"My wife jumped she hugged the girls to take them out from the room, then a second airstrike hit the room... The ceilings were destroyed and I was under the rubble.\" \nThe Israeli military later said it had been conducted a strikes on a militant tunnel system in the area. The tunnels' collapsed caused the houses above to collapse as well, leading to unintended civilian casualties, it said.\nIsrael's military says it has been targeting leaders and infrastructure linked to Hamas.\nIt said it had also struck the homes of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his brother Muhammad Sinwar, whom it described as head of logistics and manpower for the movement. \nIt was unlikely they were at home at the time of the strikes, according to the Associated Press news agency. \nGazan rescue workers spent the day trying to rescue people from under the debris from the strikes.\nThe Palestinian health ministry said a doctor was among the dead: Dr Ayman Abu Al-Ouf, head of internal medicine at Shifa hospital and part of the coronavirus team. \nIn Israel, Hamas rockets hit Ashkelon, Ashdod, Netivot and other parts of central and southern Israel. There were no reports of casualties.\nThe Israeli military said it had seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the past week. \nThe country's Iron Dome defence system has intercepted many of them. But some caused damage to cars and buildings, including the Yad Michael synagogue in Ashkelon, where a hole was blasted through the wall just before an evening service for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. No-one was reported hurt and locals moved quickly to clear up the damage so the service could go ahead, according to the Times of Israel. \nA car-ramming incident also took place in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem on Sunday evening. An Israeli police spokesman said the driver had been shot dead and four Israeli officers injured. \nThe threat to evict Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah to make way for Israeli settlers sparked the current round of violence between Israel and the Palestinians.\nThose tensions culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews, and, on Monday, Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes.\nBy Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent\nIs Israel's military operation in Gaza, dubbed \"Guardian of the Walls\", nearing its conclusion?\nNot obviously. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks are continuing with \"full force\" and will \"take time\". \nIn a news conference on Sunday, he admitted there were \"pressures\" but thanked US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. \nMr Biden's envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. \nSince the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties.\nAny messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, such as Egypt or Qatar. \nLocal reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close.\nThese episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end.\nIn Israel's estimation, we have not reached that point yet.\nWhat happened during the UN meeting? \nThe 15-member UN Security Council has been unable to agree on a public statement in recent days and none was forthcoming after the meeting. \nThe United States - a strong ally of Israel - is said to be the hold-out, believing it would be unhelpful in the diplomatic process.  \nIn Sunday's meeting, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the US was ready to offer support \"should the parties seek a ceasefire\" and had been working tirelessly to try to bring an end to the conflict.\nPalestinian Foreign Minister, Riyad al-Maliki, spoke of Saturday's attack on a refugee camp, which killed 10 members of the same family, leaving a five-month-old survivor to be pulled from the rubble. \"Israel often asks us to put ourselves in their shoes,\" he said, \"but they are not wearing shoes. They're wearing military boots.\"\nIn response, Israel's Permanent Representative, Gilad Erdan, cited the death of a 10-year-old Arab-Israeli girl, killed by a Hamas rocket. He insisted Israel was mounting what he called \"a heroic effort\" to \"dismantle terrorist infrastructure and avoid civilian casualties\". \n Mr Erdan ended by urging the Security Council to unequivocally condemn Hamas but warned that Israel would take all steps necessary to protect itself.\nAre you in Israel or Gaza and affected by the fighting?

Likewise, there's no law requiring club- and festival-goers to show their pass, if they choose not to.\nHowever, the government says it reserves the right to make showing the pass compulsory at a later date.\nYou will still have to self-isolate if you have Covid symptoms, test positive or are told to do so by NHS Test and Trace. \nIn pubs, cafes and restaurants:\nAt music venues/events:\nSome summer festivals are still planning to go ahead as planned, but others have been cancelled altogether, gone online, or been rescheduled.\nOrganisers of the Latitude (late July), Reading and Leeds (late August) festivals say they will \"sell to capacity\" and are not inclined to encourage those attending to wear masks.\nAll parts of Scotland will move to Covid-protection level zero, with a few changes:\nUnder-12s won't count towards group sizes or the number of households.\nThere will be a 400-person limit for indoor events, 1,000 for outdoor standing events and 2,000 for outdoor seated events.\nUntil 19 July, most areas of Scotland are in level 1 or 2. \nLevel two areas:\nLevel one areas:\nScotland is aiming to remove all major legal Covid restrictions by 9 August.\nRestrictions are due to be relaxed on 26 July (subject to approval on 22 July).\nIndoor gigs and concerts will be allowed without noise restrictions, as long as the audience stay in their allocated seats.\nSocial distancing rules will be removed for outdoor events and relaxed indoors.\nUnder current rules:\nAt the moment, up to six people from different households can meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants. \nPeople who do not live together, or are not in bubbles, should remain socially distanced, 2m (6ft) apart.\nBusiness owners are responsible for making their premises as safe as possible:\nThe maximum number of people allowed at outdoor \"regulated gatherings\" - such as festivals and concerts - is 4,000 standing and 10,000 seated. Capacity rules for indoor music and comedy venues have already relaxed a little.\nFrom 17 July, organised indoor events can take place for up to 1,000 seated and up to 200 standing.\nFrom 7 August, if conditions allow, there will be no legal limits on the number of people who can meet others in places like pubs and restaurants.
