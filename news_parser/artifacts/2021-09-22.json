      "tags": "Carbon capture and storage,Greenhouse gas emissions,Grangemouth,Ineos,Climate change,St Fergus,Grangemouth Refinery",
      "text": "Global chemicals firm Ineos has announced it will invest \u00a31bn in cutting greenhouse emissions at its petrochemical plant in Grangemouth.\nThe plan is to power the plant with hydrogen made from natural gas, while capturing carbon dioxide.\nThe CO2 could then be pumped via a pipeline to St Fergus in Aberdeenshire and stored beneath the North Sea. \nThe industrial site at Grangemouth is currently one of Scotland's biggest polluters.\nThe announcement is the next phase of the company's road map to deliver emissions savings of more than 60% across the site by 2030, as Scotland works towards becoming net zero by 2045.\nIneos says it has already achieved a 37% reduction in net CO2 emissions since acquiring the site in 2005.\nThe \u00a31bn investment is in addition to more than \u00a3500m spent on projects currently being implemented at Grangemouth. \nOne of those is a new energy plant due to be completed in late 2023 which will supply energy to all site operations and drive down emissions by at least 150,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.\nThe Grangemouth refinery is a joint venture formed between Ineos and PetroChina in 2011. \nAs Scotland's only crude oil refinery, Petroineos is the primary supplier of aviation fuel for Scotland's main airports and the major supplier of petrol and diesel across Scotland's central belt, as well as in Northern Ireland and Northern England.\nCarbon capture and storage has been in development in Scotland for some considerable time.  \nAfter the failed plan to attach it to Peterhead power station, the \"acorn project\" was born. It's been examining other uses to which the technology can be put.\nUsing St Fergus in north east Scotland as a base, they have been looking around for partners.\nAs one of Scotland's most polluting sites, Grangemouth has seemed one of the most obvious.\nThe National Grid is already looking at using existing pipelines which transport gas from St Fergus to the industrial heartlands of central Scotland and putting them into reverse.\nAll it has needed is money and today's announcement provides just that.\nThe announcement comes just over a month before world leaders arrive in Scotland for the COP26 climate change summit.\nSome environmental groups are sceptical about carbon capture as part of a strategy for tackling the global climate emergency. \nFriends of the Earth Scotland campaigner Alex Lee described it as \"just another distraction tactic\", adding there was an \"urgent need\" to end fossil fuel production, scale-up renewable energy and invest in green jobs. \n\"Hydrogen technology enthusiasts fail to mention that it is wildly expensive, inefficient and is not zero carbon,\" they added. \nIneos, however, says its road map highlights its commitment to supporting the goals of the Paris Accord and helping the Scottish government in its drive for a \"just transition\" to a net zero economy. \nThe Scottish government's net zero secretary, Michael Matheson, welcomed the investment.\n\"This will not only drive forward innovation and diversification to tackle emissions at Grangemouth, but will also support the decarbonisation of other sectors, sites and regions across Scotland,\" he said.\nThe UK government has promised support for four carbon capture and storage projects by the end of the decade, and Mr Matheson said he hoped the Ineos investment would secure some of this funding. \n\"Grangemouth, and Ineos itself, already holds a wealth of experience in engineering solutions and hydrogen production, and this new investment holds great potential for the future of Grangemouth, as well as the vital jobs that are located there, as part of our just transition to net zero,\" he said.\nStuart Collings, the CEO of Ineos O&P UK added: \"Hydrogen will play a very important role in the decarbonisation of our manufacturing plants. Building the infrastructure for large scale utilisation of hydrogen creates a foundation to achieve net zero by 2045 and enables wider use of hydrogen by Ineos and others in and around Grangemouth.\" \nFive Ineos sites at Grangemouth released around 3.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2019, making it the largest climate polluter in the country, according to figures from the Scottish Environment and Protection Agency (Sepa).\nThe power company SSE ranked as second-worst, with its gas power station at Peterhead emitting around 1.6 million tonnes that year.\nTerry A'Hearn, chief executive of Sepa, said: \"As Scotland's environmental watchdog, Sepa has an active and ongoing programme of engagement with Ineos.\n\"We remain focused on both addressing environmental compliance and in supporting and welcoming transformational innovation and investment wherever it occurs to help Scotland to continue its journey towards net zero.\""

      "text": "Pret A Manger says it is seeing a return of workers to the office in busy city centres.\nTuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays were now the busiest for the sandwich chain, Pret boss Pano Christou told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nPret has announced plans to hire 3,000 staff by the end of 2022 after cutting the same number of jobs last year.\nMr Christou said the chain hoped to open 200 more shops in the UK over the next two years.\nHe added that Pret hoped to expand into five markets overseas by the end of 2023, with many of the new outlets placed in train stations, bus stations and motorway services.\nThe expansion proposals come as demand from commuters and office workers - a key market for the chain - has started to pick up again after plunging during the Covid lockdowns.\nThe business is now looking to turn that around, despite having to tackle supply chain and heavy goods vehicle (HGV) lorry driver shortages, like many other businesses across the country.\n\"A couple of weeks ago, we ran out of some prepared fruit for two or three days [and] we were short of a couple of our bread lines for a couple of days,\" he said.\n\"I think we will see [the driver shortages] until the end of this year and into next year - there's a real challenge for the industry to navigate through.\" \nThe impact of the first lockdown led to Pret cutting 3,000 jobs, which represented a third of its workforce. Most of the jobs axed were from its shops, but 90 roles were also lost at its support centre.\nThe chain posted a 58% fall in revenue to \u00a3299m in 2020, compared with \u00a3708m the year before.\nMr Christou told the BBC the \"most difficult period\" over the last year was having to make people redundant.\n\"You have so many people's lives in your hands and making those decisions was the most difficult thing I had to do in my entire career,\" he said.\n\"When you have to make a call on thousands of people's jobs, that is something you spend a lot of time thinking through. But it was about how we could ensure that the business would survive and come through Covid.\"\nAs part of its recruitment drive, Pret said it had received a \u00a3100m investment from JAB and Pret founder Sinclair Beecham to accelerate the expansion.\n\"Last year we were in the eye of the storm during the height of the pandemic. Now we have the chance to build a bright new future for Pret,\" Mr Christou said. \n\"It's been an incredibly tough two years, but we have a big opportunity ahead.\"\nMr Christou said he was \"definitely seeing our Pret stores getting busier\" since coronavirus restrictions were lifted on 19 July.\nThe number of employees working across the Pret has grown 28% since the start of the year, with more than 6,000 employees in the UK. About 30% of those employed this year had worked for Pret previously.\n\"Clearly recruitment is a challenge at the moment, and we're putting everything behind ensuring that we are an employer of choice; that we pay well, that we've got the right benefits, and then we've got the right bonus available to attract new staff,\" Mr Christou said.\nLast week Pret announced that it was increasing pay by at least 5% for its cafe workers, weeks after ditching paid breaks and attempting to slash bonuses. \nThe move means that starting pay for store workers will now rise to a minimum of \u00a39.40 an hour, up from the legal minimum of \u00a38.91, but all team members, including managers will get a raise."

She opened it. I think they call that journalism.\" \nA New York Times spokeswoman, Danielle Rhoades Ha, said the newspaper's coverage of Mr Trump's taxes \"helped inform citizens through meticulous reporting on a subject of overriding public interest\", and that the lawsuit was \"an attempt to silence independent news organisations\".\nLast year, Ms Trump filed her own lawsuit accusing Mr Trump and two family members of fraud and conspiracy, alleging that the then-president, his sister Maryanne Trump Barry and brother Robert Trump - who died last August - cheated her out of an inheritance.\nThat case is still pending.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "A Covid therapy derived from a llama named Fifi has shown \"significant potential\" in early trials.\nIt is a treatment made of \"nanobodies\", small, simpler versions of antibodies, which llamas and camels produce naturally in response to infection. \nOnce the therapy has been tested in humans, scientists say, it could be given as a simple nasal spray - to treat and even prevent early infection. \nProf James Naismith described nanobodies as \"fantastically exciting\". \nProf Naismith, who is one of the lead researchers and director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxfordshire, explained that coronavirus-infected rodents treated with the new nanobody nasal spray fully recovered within six days.   \nThe treatment has, so far, been tested only in those lab animals, but Public Health England said it was among the \"most effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralising agents\" it had ever tested.\nThis apparent covid-fighting potency comes from the strength with which nanobodies bind to the virus. \nJust like our own antibodies, virus-specific nanobodies latch on to and bind to viruses and bacteria that invade our bodies. This binding essentially tags an invading virus with an immune \"red flag\", to allow the rest of the body's immune armoury to target it for destruction.\nThe nanobodies that these researchers produced - with the help of a llama's immune system - bind particularly tightly.  \n\"That's where we had some help from Fifi the 'Franklin [Institute] llama',\" explained Prof Naismith. \nBy vaccinating Fifi with a tiny, non-infectious piece of the viral protein, the scientists stimulated her immune system to make the special molecules. The scientists then carefully picked out and purified the most potent nanobodies in a sample of Fifi's blood; those that matched the viral protein most closely, like the key that best fits a specific lock. \nThe team was then able to grow large quantities of the specially selected, most potent molecules. \nProf Naismith told BBC News: \"The immune system is so marvellous that it still does better than we can - evolution is hard to beat.\" \nProfessor Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist from the University of Manchester said the new development was \"exciting but still quite early\". \n\"We need more data on efficacy and safety before we move to human trials,\" she added. \"However it's very promising nonetheless and the fact it may be cheaper and easier to administer is a plus. Covid-19 will be, unfortunately, with us for a while yet, so more treatments will be needed.\"\nProfessor Naismith and his collaborators, who published their research in the journal Nature Communications agreed that, even with the success of the Covid vaccines, having effective treatments in the future would be very important.\n\"Not all of the world is being vaccinated at the same speed,\" he said, \"and there remains a risk of new variants capable of bypassing vaccine immunity emerging.\"\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "text": "Jamie Cannon was on his way to college when he went missing in North Ayrshire 125 days ago.\nThe 19-year-old's phone was broken and he has not been in contact with his family since - something police said was \"very out of character\".\nOfficers have spent the last four months combing his home town Saltcoats, including the golf course where he was last seen.\nBut with a small number of police dogs available for the case, Jamie's family have taken up the search themselves.\nHis cousin, Leanne Graham, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime with John Beattie programme that Jamie's \"devastated\" parents and brothers are \"praying he walks through the door\".\nMeanwhile they have been out every day looking for some sign of him as well as telling his story in the local newspaper, the Ardrossan Herald.\nTheir efforts have been bolstered a specialist search team from Northern Ireland - K9 Search and Rescue.\nLeanne said: \"We've actually been fundraising to support them to come over because they're a charity. \n\"They've got more dogs than Police Scotland - they've only got one or two which they obviously can't use every single day. Whereas the team brought over five or six and they're able to cover large areas.\"\nLeanne said the charity have been able to search abandoned factory buildings in the area where the public are not permitted to go.\n\"There was one time we went in but we got asked to leave because it was dangerous,\" she said.\nJamie was last seen at on Thursday 20 May wearing grey jogging bottoms, grey trainers, a blue jacket and was carrying a camouflage backpack.\nSo far, this is what little information the family have to go on.\n\"There's been nothing since, nothing picked up on cameras,\" said Leanne. \"Down at the bottom you've got Aldi, Lidl and a garage - by the time the police went to them they had all looped over, so we'll never know if he got into a car or anything. \n\"He's not touched his bank cards, his phone was broken and his SIM card hasn't been put into another phone and been pinged.\"\nAs well as studying brick laying in college, Jamie worked at a local Italian restaurant. Leanne described him as a \"typical young man\" who loved life and relaxing with his friends.\nAs for his mother Lynn, Leanne said she is \"putting on a brave face, but she's crumbling inside\" without her son. \"He's not in any trouble, we just want him home,\" Leanne added.\nAnyone with information on his whereabouts has been urged to contact Police Scotland via their non-emergency line.\nCh Insp Alan Paterson said the force remains \"committed\" to searching for him and are using all specialist resources available.\nHe said: \"We are extremely grateful to the local community who continue to help us locate him. Officers have received a number of calls regarding Jamie since he was reported missing and all information received is investigated fully.\n\"We are in regular contact with his family and we are keeping them informed at every stage of our inquiries. \n\"This has been an incredibly difficult few months for them having to deal with not knowing where Jamie is and we are committed to following every line of inquiry available to us in order to find him.\""

      "text": "The Welsh ambulance service faces pressure like it has never seen before, the country's health minister has said.\nEluned Morgan said she was not \"ducking\" from responsibility for what her opponents say is a crisis.\nIt comes as the service asked for help from the military to drive its vehicles.\nOne frontline worker told BBC Wales crews are spending whole shifts waiting to off-load patients.\nMs Morgan told a Senedd debate calls have increased 20-30% compared to this time last year, that staff were reaching \"burnout\" and that there was a \"blockage\" in getting people out of hospitals.\nThe Conservatives, who forced the debate on Wednesday, said ministers should declare an emergency and called for action.\nFigures from July showed only 57.8% of the most serious calls, classed as red, were responded to within eight minutes, below the target of 65%.\nThe service received more calls in July than in any month since the pandemic began.\nWelsh Ambulance Services Trust said it has been under \"significant and sustained pressure\" in recent months, and it wants assistance to help cope with the winter.\nIt is the third time it has requested assistance since the Covid pandemic began - the Ministry of Defence is now considering the request.\nTrust Chief Executive Jason Killens apologised to \"all of those patients that have waited much longer for their emergency ambulance to arrive than we would like in recent weeks and months\".\nHe said the military drivers would \"help us put more ambulances on the streets, and get to see more patients more quickly\".\nBut he said that was \"not the solution\", saying the pressure on his service was a symptom \"of a broader problem across urgent and emergency care here in Wales and across the UK\".\nStewart Manning, 59, from Marshfield in Newport, has diabetic gastroparesis, a digestive condition which leads him to become very dehydrated.\nHe said he had experienced a few instances in the past four years where he waited more than three hours for an ambulance.\nIn June he was told an ambulance would not arrive for eight hours, and his wife Corrine drove him to hospital.\n\"That was horrific. Eight hours - that can't be,\" he said.\n\"It's not the fault of the ambulance crews, it's not the fault of the front line, the coal face, the nurses or anyone else like that.\n\"But there's got to be someone responsible for the way it is structured. The management, the funding even. There are so many different issues relating to this.\n\"There are people out there who are not going to be seen to for a long time\u2026 they're going to die.\"\nIn the Senedd debate on Wednesday Ms Morgan said the service was under \"unprecedented pressure\".\n\"I'm not hiding, I'm not ducking, I am absolutely taking responsibility,\" she said.\n\"Covid was bad, everybody understood Covid, but everybody in the service at the moment is telling me that this pressure at the moment is worse than anything we've seen.\"\nShe said 18% of calls are Covid-related, but handover delays to hospital have a \"significant impact\" .\nThe service has been hit by staff absence, caused by sickness which rose by 10% in June, self-isolation, shielding and delayed annual leave.\n\"We've got to accept the fact that a lot of these people are reaching burnout and they need a break,\" the minister said.\nMs Morgan added that staff were not taking up overtime as much as in the past, and there were difficulties in \"timely discharge in patients from hospital\", reducing available hospital beds.\nShe rejected the call to declare an emergency, but accepted \"there is a problem here that needs to be resolved\".\nSenedd members gave examples of problems faced by constituents with the ambulance service.\nWelsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the service is in \"crisis\" and has been \"for some months\".\nHe said a constituent of his was asked by the service to take a family member with a suspected heart attack to hospital themselves.\nMeanwhile Mabon ap Gwynfor, Plaid Cymru MS for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, said he knew of a case where a patient had to wait for 15 hours for an ambulance.\nHe said it was a \"symptom of a deep seated problem\", and feared more ambulances on the frontline would \"add to the queues of ambulances outside A&E departments\".\nLabour Swansea East MS Mike Hedges said the Welsh Ambulance Services Trust was \"not working effectively\" and should be \"split up\" and run by the individual health boards, \"so it's their fault, not somebody else's\".\nThe Trust covers the whole of Wales, while health boards are regional.\nHe said some were going to hospitals because they could not see a GP. \nMr Hedges appeared to criticise previous health ministers from his own party: \"Fortunately for the first time since I was elected, we have a health minister who I am confident will address the problems.\"\nPaul Amphlett retired as a paramedic six years ago and now works part-time as an emergency medical technician in Brecon, Powys.\n\"I have never known it as bad as it is at the moment, in the sense that morale is at rock bottom,\" he told BBC Wales.\n\"I didn't join the ambulance services to babysit patients outside hospitals for eight, 12 hours.\"\nMr Amphlett, 59, said crews from his patch in Powys were being sent across south Wales because the service is so stretched.\n\"There's no let-up. It's constant.\n\"They [patients] can't get hold of GPs. They are ringing 111 and are speaking to people telling them to ring for an ambulance because they can't get a doctor.\"\nWelsh Ambulance Services Trust declined to respond to Mr Amphlett's comments.\nThe military has assisted the NHS throughout the Covid pandemic. Soldiers helped drive ambulances in Wales on Christmas Eve, at the height of the pandemic's second wave.\nThe Welsh government said the new request, which it has processed on behalf of the trust, asks for \"drivers with a C1 driving licence to deal with increased pressures facing the service over the winter\".\nMilitary help for the service was proposed by Welsh Secretary Simon Hart in a letter to the Welsh government sent earlier in September.\nThe armed forces have assisted other ambulances services in the UK over recent months.\nSoldiers will begin driving Scottish ambulances this weekend, while the military was called in to help four trusts in England last month.\nA Ministry of Defence spokesman said it has \"received a request from Welsh government to support the Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust under the military aid to civil authorities process. The request is currently under consideration.\n\"We are working hard to identify where we can most effectively provide assistance across the whole of the United Kingdom as we continue to tackle the pandemic.\"\nAre you affected by the issues in this story?

      "text": "Boris Johnson has told the French president to \"donnez-moi un break\" and get over his anger about a new military pact between the UK, US and Australia.\nSpeaking to reporters in Washington, he said it was time for \"some of our dearest friends\" to \"prenez un grip\".\nParis is angry after Australia signed the Aukus pact to build nuclear-powered submarines, pulling out of a major contract with France in the process.\nMr Johnson insisted they were \"not trying to shoulder anybody out\".\nThe Aukus agreement, announced last week, is widely seen as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea.\nFrance has expressed anger at the pact, which ends a $37bn (\u00a327bn) deal signed by Australia in 2016 for France to build it 12 conventional submarines.\nSpeaking later on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said he and other leaders had been a \"bit taken aback by the strength of the French reaction\".\n\"We all want to reach out, everyone wants to reach out to Paris and try to sort something out,\" he told reporters on a flight to New York ahead of a speech later at the UN General Assembly. \nThe BBC has been told that the prime minister and US President Joe Biden both expressed \"astonishment\" at France's reaction during their meeting at the White House on Tuesday. \nThe pair discussed how to reassure the French side, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said, but decided not to invite France or any other country to join the pact - but to look at ways of increasing collaboration in the Indo-Pacific region. \nBoth the UK and the US believed, she added, that Australian leader Scott Morrison had warned France ahead of the announcement, but were unsure of the exact manner of those conversations.\nIn the days after the deal was announced, French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the move as a \"stab in the back\".\nFrance's defence minister then called off talks with her UK counterpart, Ben Wallace, who tried to reassure France saying that there had been no intent to \"upset or drive a wedge between us and France\".\nAnd in a rare step among allies, French President Emmanuel Macron ordered the recall of the French ambassadors to Washington and Canberra.\nHowever, France's ambassador will now return to the US following a call between Mr Macron and US President Joe Biden on Wednesday. \nDuring the call, the two leaders agreed that the situation \"would have benefitted from open consultations among allies on matters of strategic interest to France and our European partners, \" a joint statement said.\nWhite House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the half-hour call was \"friendly\", and Mr Biden hoped it was a step towards \"returning to normal\". \nOn his visit to the US this week, Mr Johnson said the deal was \"fundamentally a great step forward for global security. It's three very like-minded allies standing shoulder to shoulder creating a new partnership for the sharing of technology.\n\"It's not exclusive. It's not trying to shoulder anybody out,\" he added. \nAnalysts have described the Aukus alliance as probably the most significant security arrangement between the three nations since World War Two.\nThe pact will focus on military capability, separating it from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance which also includes New Zealand and Canada.\nWhile Australia's submarines is the big-ticket item, Aukus will also involve the sharing of cyber capabilities and other undersea technologies.\nMr Johnson is understood to have learned French while attending school in Brussels and, during his time as foreign secretary, he was known to venture into French during press conferences.\nHe has deployed the \"donnez-moi un break\" phrase previously on several other issues, including over his 2019 decision to suspend Parliament, and a 2016 warning from a French minister that Brexit could lead to border controls in Calais.

A non-broadcast pilot had been made of the show and it was very unsuccessful, it just didn't work.\n\"The executive producer of the show pulled into a lay-by one morning and called the entire creative team and said 'we're going to have to throw the entire thing out and start again from scratch because if we don't ITV are just going to turn their back on this'\".\nStrachan said he and his father were called into a meeting, and after watching the show and talking to the director, it was \"eventually decided that there needed to be 95 pieces of music... to cover every eventuality of what happens in the show\".\nHe added: \"There's a piece of music for every event, there's a piece of music for when the lights go down, then there's an underscore for the questions\u2026[it's] the idea that it should be quite subliminal.\n\"And then we came up with the bright idea - which made a rod for our own backs - of putting up the music a semi-tone every time there was a new question, to sort of raise the stakes a bit - but that increased our workload... we were working 24 hours a day to get this thing done.\"\nReflecting on why the programme was a \"particularly good piece of television\", he said: \"The format is great, it's very simple, it's very intimate and there's inherent tension in the thing which is why I think all that lighting and the music works for it.\"\nCleverly, the father and son recorded every piece of music in multiple keys - so that every time a new question was posed, the music would move up a semi-tone, subconsciously raising the stakes.\nStrachan's other works included the music for BBC Radio 4's Home Front and for some of Jasper Carrott's BBC comedy shows, including police spoof The Detectives.\nHe also created the alter-ego Klaus Harmony, \"the Mozart of Porn\", who released several albums of \"erotic masterpieces\" that had supposedly soundtracked cheap 1970s exploitation films.\nWith song titles like Cream The Oink, Kosmik Ladywave, Rempenmeister and Jesus, You Really Do Mean Diamonds, Don't You, the albums gained a cult following.\n\"He could have done anything [after Millionaire] but he did that,\" wrote his friend and fellow composer Daniel Pemberton on Twitter. \"Matthew made records called things like Wundercrotchen and Funky Sexy Shop. That's what he wanted from life. \n\"I loved it. It says a lot about being a composer that money is rarely the goal - deep down, all most of us really want to do is just make music.\"\nWriter Dirk Maggs also paid tribute, remembering Strachan on Twitter as a \"dear friend and massive talent\" who had been \"gentle, kind, talented and wickedly funny\".\nComposer Kevin Sargent added that Strachan had been \"a talented, clever, funny man whose most famous work redefined the genre of the TV game show\".\nAccording to his company biography, Strachan also wrote scores for musicals and penned two mystery novels with wife Bernadette under the pseudonym MB Vincent.\nEarlier this year he was charged with arson after setting fire to his home.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Meat,Food industry,CO\u2082 shortage",
      "text": "Pig farmers fear they may soon have to start killing their animals because of a carbon dioxide shortage at abattoirs caused by soaring gas prices.\nCO2 is widely used in the food and drinks industry, including for stunning animals at abattoirs before slaughter.\nBut some CO2 suppliers have halted production due to rising energy costs, creating a huge backlog of pigs that at some point will have to be killed.\nA food and drink trade body says the UK might need to subsidise CO2 production.\nFarmer Kate Morgan told the BBC on Monday \"thousands of pigs are backlogged on farms. If we can't kill our pigs in an abattoir, then unfortunately we will be resorting to killing them on farms\".\nCarbon dioxide used by the meat industry is a by-product of fertiliser production. The gas is also used to keep food fresh as well as in dry ice and fizzy drinks.\nCF Industries, the US-based business which produces about 60% of the UK's food grade CO2, has suspended production at two UK fertiliser plants. Norwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories. \nMs Morgan, who runs a pig farm near Driffield, east Yorkshire, told BBC 5 Live's Wake up to Money programme the situation for the industry was already \"pretty dire\" because of labour shortages. Now, meat shortages at supermarkets are a real possibility, she said.\n\"Abattoirs have about a week's supply of gas. It's a chain: We have constantly got pigs coming out of the breeding herd that need to go in homes. Those homes need to be emptied.\" \nHer farm sends about 1,500 pigs each week to abattoirs.\nKilling her own animals is not something she can bear thinking about. \"I can't even begin to think how we would do it. I don't want to put people who work for us in that situation,\" Ms Morgan said. \nOn-farm killing means the meat is not something that would be able to enter the food supply chain. \"It would be wasted,\" she said.\nIt is estimated there are about 100,000 pigs left on farms that would otherwise have been sent for slaughter, with the backlog having started building up weeks ago because of staff shortages.\nAndrew Saunders, a director at the UK's biggest pig producer, Pilgrims Pride, said there is no alternative to stunning with CO2. \"It is an essential part of the process,\" he told the BBC.\nMr Saunders, also chairman of the British Meat Processor Association, said: \"80% of pigs in the UK are slaughtered in about 10 abattoirs, and those abattoirs all use CO2 stunning systems. We already face some challenges regarding keeping those abattoirs operational - some shortage of labour in those plants.\"\nHe said pigs can be kept on farms for only \"a very short period of time. They go beyond their target slaughter weight, they're then unsuitable for size of packets we have for our customers\".\nHe added: \"We hope the government can turn around to intervene to get these CO2 plants up and running again. The particular plants in question supply about 60% of all UK needs and something's required here to get this going pretty quickly.\"\nIt is not just the pig industry facing problems, however. On Monday, the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) warned the whole sector faces disruption.\nIn a letter to Environment Secretary George Eustice, the FDF's chief executive, Ian Wright, said: \"Important parts of the food and drink supply chain - already under significant pressure from the impacts of labour shortages, particularly HGV drivers - are now seriously compromised by disruptions in the supply of CO2.\n\"Across industry, there is a united view that the situation is worsening with little prospect of additional CO2 supply unless the UK government intervenes.\"\nIf ministers are considering financial help to support the energy sector, Mr Wright said then \"any subsidies made available must also be considered for the manufacturers of fertiliser to ensure there is no further deterioration across the UK food and drink supply, and production can be restored\".\nThere are worries that food and drink shortages are starting to appear on supermarket shelves, with the problem expected to worsen in the run-up to Christmas without action.\nRichard Walker, managing director of Iceland, said his supermarket is building up stocks and while there is no immediate shortage problem, he told the BBC the CO2 situation needed to be sorted quickly.\n\"The thing that has shocked me is that 60% of [CO2] production is concentrated in two factories which are both owned by a foreign business.\n\"This is something that's clearly critical to national security - not just food but also healthcare as well. So it seems quite perplexing that it's at the whim of a private enterprise in terms of whether it's profitable or not and therefore whether they produce the stuff or not.\"\nThe British Soft Drinks Association said if manufacturers could not get hold of CO2 supplies, \"after their reserves have run out, production of certain products will have to cease\".\nTony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, has held talks with the government over production at its two fertiliser plants, but the outcome is not clear.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted that he had met Mr Will and \"discussed the pressures the business is facing and explored possible ways forward to secure vital supplies, including to our food and energy industries\".\nWholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, who is in New York for a UN General Assembly meeting, said the problem with wholesale prices was \"temporary\".\nHe added that he was \"very confident\" in the UK's supply chains and that market forces should be \"very, very swift\" in fixing the issues but that government would help where it could.\nA statement from the government said: \"We continue to monitor supplies across critical sectors and are in regular contact with industry on their CO2 supplies.\n\"The UK benefits from having a diverse range of gas supply sources and we have sufficient capacity to more than meet demand. We do not expect gas supply emergencies this winter.\""

      "text": "Harry Dunn's family said they could now \"forge ahead\" with the criminal case into his death after a civil claim with the woman alleged to have killed him was resolved.\nMr Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike was hit by a car driven by US citizen Anne Sacoolas near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, in 2019.\nAn agreement over damages was reached on Tuesday.\nHis mother, Charlotte Charles, said she was \"relieved\" that part was resolved.\nDetails of the agreement reached between the parties involved in the civil case have not been disclosed.\nIn England and Wales, civil cases are brought when one private individual or body is in dispute with another and they can relate to questions of liability and damages, whereas criminal cases are when someone is charged with breaking the law of the land, which could result in sentences such as jail or a fine.\nMrs Sacoolas's car collided with the teenager's motorbike moments after she left the US base, where her husband Jonathan worked for a US intelligence agency.\nShe later left the country, claiming diplomatic immunity.\nThe civil claim against Mrs Sacoolas was brought in the US state of Virginia.\nThe Alexandria District Court heard Mr and Mrs Sacoolas' work in intelligence was a \"factor\" in their departure from the UK, as they left for \"security reasons\".\nIn December 2020, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) authorised Northamptonshire Police to charge Mrs Sacoolas with causing death by dangerous driving.\nAn extradition request for Mrs Sacoolas to be brought to the UK was rejected by the US government.\nHowever, the UK authorities are continuing to press for her to return to the UK to face the criminal charge.\nForeign secretary Liz Truss raised the matter with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week.\nMs Charles told BBC Breakfast the civil claim agreement was \"another step in the process\".\n\"It's been a really hard slog the last couple of years, having both the civil case and the criminal case almost running parallel to one another,\" she said.\n\"It's a big relief that one part of it is done and we can now forge ahead and work with the CPS and trust the CPS to bring the criminal case to a resolution too.\"\nSpokesman Radd Seiger said the family were \"very confident\" the criminal case would be brought soon.\nAsked about the possibility of an extradition, he said: \"Whether she comes back physically or attends a trial remotely from the US we simply don't know at this stage, but it's time for this family to let the CPS do its work.\"\nMs Charles said the family was not opposed to a virtual trial.\n\"We're just very much looking forward to the day the CPS can bring this prosecution in whatever form that may be,\" she said.\n\"We need to try to move forward with our lives at some point soon. It's been extremely tough.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. If you have a story suggestion email eastofenglandnews@bbc.co.uk"

      "text": "The alliance between the US and the UK should be known as the \"indestructible relationship\", Boris Johnson has told the BBC after meeting US President Joe Biden for the first time.\nHe said he had \"terrific\" talks with Mr Biden, who has travelled to Cornwall for the G7 summit of world leaders. \nThe summit begins later, with vaccines and climate change on the agenda.\nMr Johnson insisted the US president had not rebuked him over post-Brexit tensions in Northern Ireland.\nHowever, Mr Biden is said to have \"deep concern\" over the situation.\nThe prime minister was speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, after meeting Mr Biden in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, on Thursday ahead of the G7 summit.\nThe summit will see the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK gathering in person for the first time since the pandemic.\nAhead of the meeting, Mr Johnson pledged the UK would donate more than 100 million vaccines to poorer countries in the next year, while Mr Biden promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union.\nThe G7 nations are expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine in an effort to end the pandemic in 2022.\nMr Johnson told the BBC the UK and US shared a belief in human rights, the rules-based international order and the transatlantic alliance.\nHe said he thought of the association as \"an indestructible relationship\" or the \"deep and meaningful relationship\".\n\"It's a relationship that has endured for a very long time, and has been an important part of peace and prosperity both in Europe and around the world,\" he said.\nThe PM had previously let it be known that he preferred a new term for the so-called \"special relationship\" between the UK and US after decades of use.\nThe first real-life meeting between Boris Johnson and Joe Biden clearly went well. \nMr Johnson and his team believe chemistry between leaders matters, and that the simple fact of gathering in person sends an important message. \nBut the issues the prime minister wants to confront this week can't be solved by just bonhomie at the beach.\nRead Laura's blog\nOne area which could cause friction between the two men is the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part of the Brexit deal that prevents checks along the Irish border.\nMr Biden has previously warned that the new arrangements should not jeopardise the Good Friday Agreement, a peace deal signed in 1998 that helped end decades of violence in Northern Ireland.\nAsked if Mr Biden had expressed his concerns, Mr Johnson said: \"No, the president didn't say anything of the kind.\" \nThe prime minister did suggest the way the EU was implementing the agreed arrangement was \"excessively burdensome\" and said while the UK, the US and the EU wanted to preserve the balance in Northern Ireland, a resolution to the issue was unlikely to be found in the coming days. \nHowever, he added that the different sides would be able to \"work it out\".\nThe arrangements were set down in the 2019 Brexit withdrawal deal, but the UK has since sought more flexibility.\nSpeaking on Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the protocol was the \"only solution\" and should be implemented fully.\nAnd French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"I think it's not serious to want to review in July what we finalised after years of debate and work in December.\n\"We have a trade deal - it has been painfully discussed for years... if six months later, they say: 'What we negotiated with you, we don't know how to respect it', then that means that nothing is respectable anymore.\"\nMr Johnson also defended his decision to reduce overseas aid spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income, despite a manifesto promise to maintain the higher level. \nEarlier in the week, Mr Johnson faced strong criticism from some of his own MPs, one of whom said the cuts would lead to \"hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths\".\nThe prime minister said his government's aid spending as a percentage of GDP exceeded the amount spent by the last two Labour prime ministers.\nHe argued the public understood the financial strain caused by the pandemic, adding: \"I think people in this country, in spite of the constant running down of this country's efforts are incredibly proud of what we're doing in spite of the difficulties that were facing.\" \nHe also pointed to the UK's commitment to donate 100 million surplus vaccine doses to poorer countries in the next year, as well as previous doses contributed to Covax - the scheme that distributes vaccines to the world's poorest nations.\n\"We will have a colossal sum of vaccines that we'll be distributing - the fight against Covid would not be possible without the UK's efforts on vaccines,\" he said.\nMr Johnson also said he had discussed the case of Harry Dunn with the US president and that Mr Biden was \"extremely sympathetic\" and \"actively engaged\".\nThe G7 brings together seven leading industrialised nations.\nThey will spend the day discussing issues including the pandemic before a reception attended by the Queen.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will also take part in their first G7 events.\nPrince William and Catherine will join the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at the G7 leaders' reception.\nAfterwards, Prince Charles will host a reception for the G7 leaders and heads of the world's largest companies to discuss how the private sector can work with governments to tackle the climate emergency."

      "text": "The British food industry will be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with a US company to restart production in the UK.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from \u00a3200 per tonne to \u00a31,000.\nThe government has agreed to pay out tens of millions of pounds to CF Industries to reopen a plant in the UK. \nThe closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry.\nUS-owned CF Industries recently shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies, because of a sharp rise in gas prices.\nFarms, food producers and supermarkets have warned that a shortage of carbon dioxide will lead to significant disruption to the manufacture and supply of fresh produce. \nThe Times also reported that ministers were concerned that the UK might have to close its six advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors, which also use CO2. \nThe government announced late on Tuesday night that it would meet the full operating costs to run CF Industries' Billingham plant in Teesside for three weeks. The costs are expected to be in the \"low tens of millions\" and will be below \u00a350m.\nMr Eustice said that the deal with CF Industries \"will be not a loan, it will be a payment to underwrite some of their fixed costs\".\nAt the end of the three-week period, it is hoped that the price of carbon dioxide will have risen sufficiently to make it economically viable for CF Industries to keep production running. \nMr Eustice said the food industry would have to accept \"a big, sharp rise\" carbon dioxide prices from \u00a3200 to \u00a31,000 a tonne.\n\"The critical thing was to get the production up and running expeditiously. That's why we've needed this government intervention,\" he said.\n\"But we've had meetings with the food industry. They all recognise that the price of carbon dioxide is going to increase substantially and when that price increases, then the market signal will be then for these plants to continue producing.\"\nMr Eustice insisted that the rise in cost would not have a \"significant impact\" on food prices. \nHe said that while food prices were increasing \"due to global commodity prices, oil prices and also other factors such as labour shortages\", carbon dioxide was \"a tiny proportion\" of the industry's overall costs. \nCF Industries had halted two of its fertiliser factories - which produce carbon dioxide as a by-product - because of gas prices.\nCF Industries' Billingham plant will need up to three days to start producing new CO2. \nThe company told the BBC it had \"no estimate\" on when its second UK plant at Ince in Cheshire would  resume production. \nThe British Meat Processors Association said the deal to open CF Industries' Teesside plant was a \"huge relief\" and said it was now \"focused on re-establishing supplies before Friday this week, which is when around 25% of pork production was in danger of shutting down\".\nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the decision, but said the timetable to restart CF Industries' factory and begin producing carbon dioxide \"will still be tight\".\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"Our understanding is that provided that carbon dioxide starts to get through to food producers by the end of the week, then we can avert major and significant disruption in our stores.\"\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the \"exceptional short-term arrangement\" would ensure industries that rely on a stable supply of CO2 \"have the resources they require to avoid disruption\".\nHe said: \"With regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant, it was very cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened.\" \nThe government intends to publish the letter from Mr Kwarteng to Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, which sets out the terms of the taxpayer support.\nCommenting on the three-week deal, Mr Kwarteng said: \"In a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting the arrangement.\n\"It is not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely, and that is why in the critical period we needed to have a short term arrangement I am confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period. \nMr Eustice said that the shortage of carbon dioxide had been caused by a \"perfect storm\" of circumstances where CF Industries had shut its two plants because \"an increase in gas price means they are not profitable\", while two other providers had closed their sites for maintenance.\nBut the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said the current difficulties showed how exposed the UK is, because of its reliance on such a small number of carbon dioxide producers. \n\"Over many years, we have had a major consolidation of the industry resulting in sectors like food and drink, nuclear and health being reliant on a very small number of very large suppliers,\" the BMPA said.\n\"If a market-based solution is to be found, it will likely involve longer-term higher prices for CO2, which will be sustainable for some, but not all users of the gas.\"\nIan Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, also called on the government to support other fertiliser producers and help food producers to look for alternatives to CO2.\nMr Will, who flew from the US to the UK on Sunday to meet Mr Kwarteng, said: \"We look forward to working with Secretary Kwarteng and the UK government on developing a longer-term solution, including the development of alternative suppliers of CO2 for the UK market.\"\nThe BBC understands that the deal with CF Industries has been drafted so that other companies who stop production because of high commodity prices will not be able to ask the government for similar help. \nNorwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories, including one in Hull.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson urged people not to worry about putting food on the table this winter, amid rising energy and food bills and a cut to universal credit.\nWholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms.\nMr Opie added that the government should also take action on other issues affecting food retailers in recent weeks, such as the shortage of HGV drivers, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and many drivers returning to the European Union after Brexit.\nThe government has been keen to stress that this is very much an emergency measure, time-limited, and with a cap on the amount it is prepared to pay. \nIt had to do something. Food producers were warning that shortages would become apparent within days, at a time when supply chains have already been disrupted by other issues, such as a lack of lorry drivers. \nBut the fact remains that it has agreed to give a large US-owned company tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, just to operate one of its own plants. That isn't a particularly good look - and it has cast a glaring spotlight on the vulnerability of a key part of the economy. \nNow there is a three-week window for government, supermarkets and food producers to come up with a \"sustainable market-based solution\". In practice, that's likely to mean users paying more for their CO2, a cost which will ultimately be borne by consumers. "

The injunction will greatly strengthen their hand.\"\nHome Secretary Priti Patel, who last week described protesters' actions as \"selfish\", said the injunction would mean \"people can get moving again\" on the London orbital motorway.\n\"We will not tolerate lives being put at risk,\" she said.\nMr Shapps added the government would be reviewing the powers, but it was \"unacceptable for people to be able to walk on to not just a major highway but a motorway, stop traffic, be released the next day and do the same thing again\".\n\"An injunction may just be an interim way of doing [stopping] that,\" he said.\nAssistant Chief Constable for Humberside Police, Chris Noble, who is the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for policing protests, told the Today programme police \"aren't anti-protest but we are pro-responsibility\".\n\"This is not a benign supermarket car park that this is taking place on,\" he said.\nHe said police officers were most likely to come to harm as a result of the protests because they were having to run across motorways to try to remove the campaigners.\nIn his High Court order, Mr Justice Lavender ruled it should last until 21 March, but there would be a hearing to review the situation on 5 October.\nThe order covers every part of the M25 and the Dartford Crossing, including slip roads and bridges, and states that demonstrators are banned from \"causing damage to the surface of or to any apparatus on or around the M25 including but not limited to painting, damaging by fire, or affixing any item or structure thereto\".\nThe order means that breaching it could lead to a civil court hearing.\nIn a statement, Insulate Britain said it would continue its protests and \"as soon as the government makes a meaningful statement that we can trust, we will leave the motorway\".\nDuring the recent protests, the government said it was \"investing \u00a31.3bn this year alone to support people to install energy efficiency measures, and our upcoming Heat and Buildings Strategy will set out how we decarbonise the nation's homes in a way that is fair, practical and affordable\".\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Coroner Blue's initial determination for the manner of death is homicide,\" the FBI's Denver office tweeted. \nThe couple had been travelling for several weeks before Mr Laundrie returned home to Florida alone with their white van on 1 September. He did not contact police or the Petito family on his return. \nMs Petito's family reported her missing 10 days later. \nSeveral weeks earlier, police in the Utah town of Moab were called to a possible domestic violence incident. \nBodycam footage showed Ms Petito crying and complaining about her mental health. A police report later said Mr Laundrie claimed Ms Petito had struck him during an argument. \nNo charges were filed, with officers recommending that the couple spend the night apart. What happened next is unclear. \nMr Laundrie's family reported him missing over the weekend. They claim he left for a hike on 14 September and never returned. He had refused to speak with investigators before disappearing.\nThe search for Mr Laundrie has focused on a 24,000-acre nature reserve near his home in North Port, Florida. \nPolice are using dogs, drones, and all-terrain vehicles for the search, which officers say is complicated by difficult, swampy terrain. \nAdditionally, police are investigating hundreds of reported sightings of Mr Laundrie, including more than a dozen from Alabama, which borders Florida to the west. \nOn Monday, investigators searched the Laundrie family home. Agents were then seen removing several boxes from the house and towing away a silver Ford Mustang.\nThe case has captivated the public, with each new development becoming the focus of web sleuths on platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and Twitter.\nAs of Tuesday, the hashtag #GabbyPetito had received more than 650 million views on TikTok alone, according to the Associated Press."

      "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised a strong response after one of his top aides survived an apparent assassination attempt.\nSerhiy Shefir's car was struck with a volley of bullets as he left his home south of the capital Kyiv on Wednesday morning. His driver was wounded.\nIt is not known who carried out the shooting, but Mr Zelensky said it could have been a foreign or domestic attack.\nThe Kremlin has categorically denied any Russian involvement.\nDescribing the moment that bullets struck his vehicle, Mr Shefir said \"we had to speed up a little, it was scary\". \nHe praised his driver, who he said managed to continue to drive after the \"shots rang out\".\nMr Shefir suggested he was targeted in a bid to intimidate the \"highest echelon of power\" and that such an attempt would not work.\n\"One has to understand that our president [Zelensky] is very strong-willed, he has a spine and cannot be intimidated,\" he added.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said any suggestion of a link with Moscow bore \"the signs of an excessively excited emotional state\". \n\"Unfortunately nowadays, whatever happens in Ukraine, none of the current politicians is able to rule out the Russian trace,\" he said.\nSpeaking from New York, where he is participating in the United Nations General Assembly, Mr Zelensky said: \"Saying 'hello' to me by shooting out of the forest at my friend's car is weak. The response will be strong.\"\nPolice investigating the shooting, near the village of Lisnyky, said they were exploring the possibility that Mr Shefir may have been targeted for his work, or as part of a bid to destabilise the government.\nThe attack comes a few days before Mr Zelensky's bill to rein in Ukraine's powerful oligarchs is debated in parliament.\nUkraine's oligarchs are a small group of super-rich businessmen who dominate the country's economic and political life.

      "text": "Many patients are being prescribed unnecessary and even harmful treatments, a report warns.\nThe review, in England, suggests one-tenth of items dispensed by primary care are inappropriate or could be changed. \nAround 15% of people take five or more medicines a day - some are to deal with the side-effects of the others. \nThe government is appointing a prescribing tsar to help with the issue and stop waste.\nThe more medicines a person takes, the higher the chance that one or more of them will have an unwanted or harmful effect.\nOverprescribing can happen when:\nChief pharmaceutical officer for England, Dr Keith Ridge, said: \"Medicines do people a lot of good and this report is absolutely not about taking treatment or services away from people where they are effective. But medicines can also cause harm and can be wasted.\"\nThe number of items dispensed by GPs and other primary care providers has doubled in recent years, from an average of 10 per person in 1996 to around 20 per person now, according to the report. \nRepeat prescriptions make up around three-quarters of all prescription items.\nAnd around 6.5% of hospital admissions are caused by adverse effects of medicines. This rises to up to 20% in the over-65 age group. \nImproved patient records and handovers between hospitals and GP surgeries are among the recommendations made in the report. \nClinical pharmacists working with GPs to review medication and a move to more personalised care is already helping, say experts.\nProf Martin Marshall, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: \"Prescribing is a core skill for GPs and many of our nurse and pharmacist colleagues in primary care and doing whatever we can to prescribe the most appropriate medicine for our patients, in an evidence-based way is something we strive to do on a daily basis - and in the vast majority of cases, this review shows this is happening.\n\"With our growing and ageing population, with more patients living with multiple, chronic conditions, many people are taking several medications in order to manage their various health illnesses, and the interaction between various medicines is something prescribers will take into account.\n\"In most cases, these medicines are necessary, appropriate and of benefit for the patient - but the aspiration to reduce the number of medications a patient is taking, where safe and possible, is a good one. \n\"GPs will only ever prescribe medication to patients in conversation with them,and after a frank discussion about the risks and benefits of the treatment - and when alternative options have been explored. \n\"What GPs and other members of the practice team often need, however, is better access for their patients to alternative, non-pharmacological treatments, which can be patchy across the country.\""

      "text": "The family of a primary school teacher who was killed in a south-east London park say they have been left \"devastated\" by her death.\nThe body of Sabina Nessa was found by a member of the public in Cator Park, Kidbrooke, on Saturday morning. \nMs Nessa's cousin Zubel Ahmed said the 28-year-old was a \"beautiful soul\" and appealed for help to find whoever was responsible for the \"horrific crime\".\nA vigil is due to be held in her memory on Friday evening.\nThe Met Police believe Ms Nessa was attacked and died the previous evening, at a time when the park would have been busy.\nMr Ahmed said the family understood she had been on her way home \"when she was attacked from behind.\"\nHe said her parents were \"absolutely shocked\" and \"inconsolable still, understandably so, to hear of their daughter being taken away from them by some cowardly man\".\nDescribing his cousin, Mr Ahmed said she \"was the most caring person - kindest, sweetest girl you could meet\".\n\"She's been teaching for two years. Loves teaching, loves kids, she's got a couple of cats at home. She was just a beautiful soul.\"\nThe area where she was found remains cordoned off and flowers have been left at the site.\nInformation sheets advising women on how to stay safe at night have been handed out by a community group in response to the death.\nThe handout suggests pedestrians stick to busy places with good lighting.\nAdvice on the sheet, printed from the Met Police website, also includes the suggestions that pedestrians should face oncoming traffic and conceal their jewellery.\nFriday's vigil has been organised by Reclaim the Streets who said they were \"angry and heartbroken\" by the killing and called on the government to do something about \"an epidemic of violence unfolding in front of our eyes.\"\nMiss Nessa, who was originally from Sandy in Bedfordshire, lived in Lewisham, south-east London.\nShe had been a year one teacher at Rushey Green Primary school in Catford for about a year.\nA post-mortem examination into the cause of the 28-year-old's death was inconclusive, the Met said.\nA man in his 40s who was arrested on suspicion of murder has been released under further investigation.\nOfficers have asked for any potential witnesses to contact them, and for drivers to check dash-cam footage they might have. \nThe Met believe the attack happened around 20:30 BST on 17 September at a time where the park \"was likely being used by many people.\"\nDet Supt Luke Marks said: \"This did not happen in the middle of the night - people would have been in and around the park at the time.\n\"We have extra officers in the area conducting high-visibility patrols, and anybody in London, regardless of gender, should be able to go out in an evening and not be concerned about being the victim of violent crime.\"\nMs Nessa was described by colleagues as \"kind, caring and dedicated\". The school's headteacher Lisa Williams said: \"She had so much life ahead of her and so much more to give and her loss is desperately sad.\n\"As a school we are supporting each other through this very difficult time, and we will be providing specialist support to those who need it.\"\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan also paid tribute, saying he had been left \"heartbroken\" by her death.\n\"The perpetrator of this despicable crime must be caught and brought to justice which is why I want to encourage anyone who may have been in the park around the time of the incident, and may have relevant information, to contact the police,\" he added.\nSafeguarding minister Rachel Maclean told the House of Commons: \"Every woman who loses their life is one woman too much and we are devastated to hear of the loss of the life of Sabina Nessa. Our hearts go out to the family.\nShe added that the government was \"passing legislation, setting out actions and tackling these horrific crimes and we are determined to see a reduction in them\". "

      "text": "The Taliban have asked to address world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly this week in New York City.\nA UN committee will rule on the request but it is unlikely to happen during the current session of the body.\nThe Taliban also nominated their Doha-based spokesperson, Suhail Shaheen, as Afghanistan's UN ambassador.\nThe group, which seized control of Afghanistan last month, said the envoy for the ousted government no longer represented the country.\nThe request to participate in the high-level debate is being considered by a credentials committee, whose nine members include the US, China and Russia, according to a UN spokesperson.\nBut they are unlikely to meet before the end of the General Assembly session next Monday. Until then, under UN rules, Ghulam Isaczai will remain Afghanistan's ambassador to the global body.\nHe is expected to make a speech on the final day. However the Taliban said his mission \"no longer represents Afghanistan\".\nNo government has formally recognised the Taliban as Afghanistan's new government and for the UN to agree to its nominee for ambassador would be an important step towards international acceptance.   \nThe Taliban also said that several countries no longer recognised former President Ashraf Ghani as leader. \nMr Ghani abruptly left Afghanistan as Taliban militants advanced on the capital, Kabul, on 15 August. He has since taken refuge in the United Arab Emirates.\nIn Afghanistan itself, the last minister from the deposed government, Wahid Majrooh, has left office as public health minister after hearing that he had been replaced.\nWhen the Taliban last controlled Afghanistan, between 1996 and 2001, the ambassador of the government they overthrew stayed on as a UN representative, after the credentials committee deferred its decision on competing claims for the position.\nAt the UN meeting on Tuesday, Qatar urged world leaders to stay engaged with the Taliban.\n\"Boycotting them would only lead to polarisation and reactions, whereas dialogue could be fruitful,\" said Qatar's ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.\nQatar has become a key broker in Afghanistan. It hosted talks between the Taliban and US which culminated in a 2020 agreement to withdraw US-led Nato forces.\nThe country has helped Afghans and foreign nationals to evacuate the country since the Taliban takeover, and has facilitated recent intra-Afghan peace talks."

It's hoping to increase its workforce by 3,000 by the end of 2022 with plans to open more shops and expand abroad over the next couple of years.\nAs the Welsh Ambulance Service ask for military help due to an increased pressure from the latest Covid wave, one medical technician says morale is at \"rock-bottom\". Many crews are spending whole shifts waiting to off-load patients, according to front-line worker Paul Amphlett. The Welsh Ambulance Services Trust says it's been under \"significant and sustained pressure\" in recent months, and Conservatives say they will call on ministers to declare an emergency in the service in a Senedd debate later.\nJust over half of the world is yet to receive one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, US President Joe Biden wants more vaccine equality and, according to research, rich countries are holding surpluses of vaccine.

BBC population correspondent Stephanie Hegarty has taken a look.\nIn March, India's federal government promised 5m rupees (\u00a350,000) to the family of every health worker who died fighting Covid. But many families are still waiting for compensation. This includes the family of Shanti Devi, a government community health worker who died in May. Her daughter Malti Gangwar said that in the days following her death, the family received several calls from the health department offering condolences. Her late mother's colleagues even urged her to apply for the same job. \"There was talk about insurance money and they all seemed very co-operative. They asked me to fill in a form to apply for the job, which I did,\" she says. She is still waiting. Read more on this story.\nWhat did you do with your old face masks?

      "text": "The Rolling Stones have played their first concert since the death of their drummer Charlie Watts last month.\nThe small warm-up show took place in Massachusetts Gillette Stadium, to an audience of about 300 people.\nSinger Sir Mick Jagger dedicated the show to Watts, who died of an unspecified illness at the age of 80.\n\"It's a bit of a poignant night for us because its the first tour in 59 years that we've done without our lovely Charlie Watts,\" he said.\n\"We all miss Charlie so much. We miss him as a band, we miss him as friends - on and off the stage. \n\"We've got so many memories of Charlie, and I'm sure some of you that have seen us before have got memories of Charlie as well. And I hope you remember him like we do.\"\nThe star led the crowd in a chant of Watts' name before taking a celebratory swig of beer.  Guitarist Ronnie Wood then took the microphone and declared: \"Charlie, we're praying for you and playing for you.\"\nThe Stones were joined on drums by Steve Jordan, a session musician who has worked with the band since the 1980s. He had been announced as a stand-in for Watts for their forthcoming US tour before his death, as the drummer recovered from a medical procedure.\nMonday's invitation-only show featured 15 songs, opening with Let's Spend the Night Together before running through hits like Tumbling Dice, 19th Nervous Breakdown and (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.\nThey also covered the Chi-Lites' Troubles A-Comin' and played their 2020 single Living In A Ghost Town live for the first time.\nThe show was held in a tent-like structure set up on the stadium field, which is normally home to The New England Patriots.\nIt was organised by Patriots' owner Robert Kraft, and the guest list included Governor of Massachusetts Charlie Baker, J Geils Band singer Peter Wolf and Moderna chairman Noubar Afeyan - all of whom had to show proof of vaccination to attend.\nThe Stones had been rehearsing in Boston over the summer and, due to pandemic-related travel restrictions, were unable to attend Watts' funeral in England, The Sun reported earlier this month.\nThey paid tribute to the musician online, with guitarist Keith Richards calling him \"the coolest guy I know\". Mick Jagger simply shared a photograph of Watts smiling while seated behind his drum kit.\nWatts had been a member of the Stones since 1963, and helped them become one of rock's biggest bands, scoring hits like Jumpin' Jack Flash, Get Off My Cloud and Sympathy for the Devil.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Department for Work & Pensions,Money,Personal finance,Pensions,National Audit Office",
      "text": "Repeated human errors made for years were to blame for a scandal which led to more than \u00a31bn of state pensions not being paid, a report has concluded.\nThe National Audit Office (NAO) said 134,000 pensioners, mostly women, were underpaid pensions because outdated computer systems led to mistakes.\nAmong them was 74-year-old Irene Wise, who said women like her were \"short-changed\" for years.\nThe government said everyone would receive what they were owed.\nHowever, the report raises huge questions for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) over the way the state pension system functions and the mistakes that led to such a massive shortfall in payments.\nReacting to the report, Meg Hillier, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said: \"This is not the first widespread error we have seen in the DWP in recent years. Correcting these errors comes at great cost to the taxpayer.\n\"The DWP must provide urgent redress to those affected and take real action to prevent similar errors in future.\"\nThe problem relates to the \"old\" state pension system where married women who had a poor pension in their own right could claim a 60% basic state pension based on their husband's record of contributions.\nA review is taking place to trace those affected by systemic failures to award these pension rises, stretching back to 1985. But only some women are being fully paid. Others will only be able to claim for 12 months of missed payments.\nThe DWP is expecting to pay the affected pensioners it can trace a total of \u00a31.05bn, at an average of \u00a38,900 per pensioner affected. That exercise will cost the taxpayer \u00a325m in staff costs and will not be completed until the end of 2023. An estimated 40,000 affected women have already died.\nGrandmother-of-four Mrs Wise, from Worcestershire, spent two years battling for her money.  The NAO report said that some pensioners who contacted the DWP may have been falsely reassured that their payments were correct.\nThe 74-year-old eventually received \u00a37,334 in back payments for eight years of missed pensions.\n\"When you think you have been short-changed for that many years, what a difference [the money] could have made in certain circumstances,\" she said.\nJan Tiernan, from Fife, is one of those affected by the wider problems caused by the errors. She too was initially told she was not owed any money.\n\"I told the DWP I should be getting another \u00a330 a week based on my husband's contributions. But they fobbed me off and said no. I didn't believe them due to the media coverage, so I started writing to them,\" she said.\nAfter nearly 100 pages of correspondence with the department, she received \u00a31,280. However, she believes she is still owed more than \u00a317,000 in missed payments.\n\"It makes me sad and angry. I've been on this campaign for two years now. It is not just for me but for all of these people who have been done out of this money. They should have got it,\" she said.\n\"At 81 years old, you get fed up with it. It is very wearing and it takes up all your energy.\"\nThe NAO report found that errors occurred because state pension rules were complex, computer systems outdated and many tasks still needed to be done manually.\n\"This makes some level of error in the processing of state pension claims almost inevitable,\" it said.\nIt also found the DWP did not have a means of reviewing individual complaints or errors, such as how many people were complaining about the same issues, to assess whether the errors had a systemic cause.\nAs a result, it concluded that it missed opportunities to detect, prevent or correct the errors.\nSir Steve Webb, partner at consultancy LCP and a former pensions minister, unearthed the problems.\nHe said the department had \"let down a generation of women\". He said officials should have been more curious about issues over many years.\nA DWP spokesperson said: \"We are fully committed to ensuring the historical errors that have been made by successive governments are corrected, and as this report acknowledges, we are dedicating significant resource to doing so. Anyone impacted will be contacted by us to ensure they receive all that they are owed. \n\"Since we became aware of this issue, we have introduced new quality control processes and improved training to help ensure this does not happen again.\"\nThe department is facing a heavy workload, with increased benefits claims during the pandemic, as well as a backlog in state pension applications which has meant thousands of newly-retired people have yet to receive their first state pension payments."

      "text": "A spike in rates of Covid-19 in the under-16s is driving the latest overall rise in cases in Wales, figures from Public Health Wales (PHW) suggest.\nCase rates among the under-25s have risen in all but two of Wales' 22 local authority areas over the last week, the figures also show.\nNeath Port Talbot, with an overall case rate of 863.1 cases per 100,000 people, is the highest in the UK.\nIt also has the highest case rate among the under-25s in Wales.\nWhen the case rates are broken down further, the PHW figures show the case rate in the 17 to 24 age group is now falling across Wales, but has rocketed in the last week for the under-16s.\nSpecific Covid figures linked to schools are not expected to be published this academic year but other recent figures - including a record number of positive lateral flow tests, boosted by school testing - suggest these are behind the high numbers.\nThe figures covering Covid among younger age groups show:\nCase rates among under-25s were highest in Neath Port Talbot (1,597.7 cases per 100,000 people) - 55% of all positive tests - and the area also saw the highest proportional rise over the week.\nThe second biggest rise came in Rhondda Cynon Taf, while Merthyr Tydfil also had higher than average positive tests among the over 60s.\nOther areas with high case rates among the under-25s include Carmarthenshire (1,175.9 cases per 100,000, which is 52% of all positive tests).\nThese all underpin the overall case rate rises we've seen in these areas.\nWales' case rate has risen to 551 cases per 100,000 in the last seven days.\nThe number of cases seen each day are at an average of 2,482 - up from 2,257 the week before. The \"doubling time\" is 31 days.\nThere are growing numbers of community hotspots - 24 have case rates above 1,000 cases per 100,000. These are topped by Tylorstown in Rhondda Cynon Taf and Pontardawe in Neath Port Talbot.\nThe lowest local authority-level case rate is in Monmouthshire, where the local community of Raglan & Llantilio Crossenny has seen only five positive tests over the past week.\nWe have just seen a record number of tests in Wales, driven in part by record numbers of positive lateral flow tests, which include school tests.\nThese eventually feed into the main testing figures, after follow-up PCR results. \nAt the second wave peak last winter, we saw 21,300 PCR tests a day in Wales, but the average is now above that at about 24,900 tests a day.\nFor the second week running we have had a record number of tests processed, and 15 September saw the highest number of tests authorised in a single day at 27,836.\nThe daily average number of confirmed hospital admissions is 501, up slightly on Tuesday.\nBut the number of those in hospital is a third of what it was at the same point during the second wave\nThere were 50 Covid patients in critical care on Tuesday - up from 47 a week ago.\nThe daily average of Covid admissions is 37 across Wales, a slight reduction on last week (41). \nTen deaths with Covid-19 were reported by PHW on Wednesday. Four of these were reported in the Hywel Dda health board area, three in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and one in each of the Aneurin Bevan, Betsi Cadwaladr and Swansea Bay areas.\nThere was one death which occurred on Sunday, two last Saturday, four last Friday, two last Thursday and one more than a week ago. \nFourteen deaths occurred a week ago, on Wednesday15 September, which is the highest daily figure under the PHW measure since 21 February.\nThere have been 43 deaths occurring in the last seven days - an average of six deaths a day.\nThe number of deaths are still well below the same point during the second wave."

      "text": "Sharon Graham was elected Unite leader on a promise to take the union \"back to the workplace\" and spend less time on Westminster politics.\nShe insisted that \"wasn't just an electoral chant\", and has argued that she was \"all about action\".\nBut one of her earliest decisions is about not doing something.\nShe is the first leader of Unite - Labour's biggest trade union funder - to decide not to attend the party's annual conference this weekend.\nIt is in stark contrast to her predecessor Len McCluskey, who was an influential and ever-present figure in Labour circles.\nBut she has told the BBC that her time can be better spent elsewhere.\nMs Graham said: \"We shouldn't always do what we have always done just because we have always done it.\n\"I am days into my leadership - we currently have 16 industrial disputes going on, from Tesco drivers to  Weetabix to locksmiths in Scunthorpe and Wolverhampton. \n\"What I need to do is be with those workers in dispute and personally take leadership.\"\nShe denied she was snubbing Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, adding: \"We are in a crisis - workers are going to have a really rough ride.\n\"I am showing I am with them, and the Labour Party needs to do the same, and show it is with workers and communities too\".\n\"It's definitely not a snub - I have made a priority decision.\"\nIn fact, she met Sir Keir on Monday for an hour, describing the meeting as \"cordial\". \nBut Ms Graham said he hadn't raised his proposed changes to Labour's leadership rules with her.\nThe Labour leader is meeting representatives of key unions on Wednesday to discuss that controversial move.\nShe said the row over rule changes is like \"white noise\" to her members. \nAnd she gave the Labour leader the following advice: \"I made it really clear that I really want Labour to focus on the issues workers have - it has to be a continuous programme.\"\nThe union gave Labour \u00a33m in the run up to the last election, but party funding wasn't on the meeting's agenda.\nMs Graham told me the union will continue to pay an affiliation fee to Labour, but she would want a lot more in return for optional donations. \n\"For those additional payments, it'd be wrong of us to say there is a blank cheque,\" she said. \n\"I have to be able to say, head held high, 'this money has gone into [opposing] fire and rehire' or 'this was put in to research and development'. It's about workers' issues.\n\"If Labour doesn't talk about that agenda, people are quite rightly going to question why we are giving those additional funds.\"\nMs Graham also confirmed her union delegates would vote to oust Labour's most senior official, general secretary David Evans if - as expected - Labour conference votes on whether to endorse him this weekend.\nHe is carrying out a programme of voluntary redundancies at Labour's head office.\nShe said: \"David Evans engaged in all essence in a fire and rehire practice - any CEO who did that would not get our support.\"\nBut a Labour spokesperson rejected the criticism, saying the party was undertaking a \"voluntary severance scheme\", which was \"nothing like fire and rehire\".\nLegal and general\nUnite under Len McCluskey financed a range of legal challenges against Labour when the party tried to discipline or expel left-wing members.\nIf Ms Graham wanted to be involved in less intra-party wrangling, would that continue?\nShe said: \"I am doing a review of every single area of the union, including legal. The most important thing about our legal services is whether they support the members.\n\"I will make decisions with the [union] executive. I don't know all the details [of the legal actions].\n\"But on a broader level, my focus is jobs, pay and conditions of workers - therefore the resources of the union are going to be on that.\"\nMore generally, she would be reorganising the country's second largest union - bringing together members in each sector of industry.\nShe intended to go through the books of big companies \"forensically\" if they attempted to cut pay and conditions, to find out if they were genuinely struggling or if they were using the Covid crisis to reduce her members' rights.\nAnd she will draw up a \"workers' manifesto\" that she will push with whoever is in power.\nMs Graham said she resisted pressure on her to stand aside in the contest for her union's top job to give another left-winger a clear run.\nShe described some of that pressure as \"toxic\" and \"vile\".\nShe added: \"I have a 12-year-old son and I didn't think it was a good moral for him to capitulate. It made me more determined.\"\nAnd now that she has succeeded, she is clearly just as determined to do things differently."

      "text": "The US is to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to developing nations from next year.\nPresident Joe Biden made the pledge at a virtual Covid-19 summit on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, promising an \"arsenal of vaccines\".\nThe additional jabs will see the total US commitment on vaccine sharing exceed one billion jabs.\nExperts say some 11 billion doses are required to vaccinate at least 70% of the global population.\nThe World Health Organisation has set a minimum target of 40% vaccine coverage in every country by the end of 2021.\nBut the goal is unlikely to be met. \nWhile many high-income countries have now given at least one shot to more than half their populations, only 2% of people in low-income countries have had their first dose, according to data from the University of Oxford.\nAnalysis by Stephanie Hegarty, BBC population correspondent\nIt's a big pledge but it'll be met with a fair share of scepticism from countries still waiting to vaccinate even 2% of their population.\nThe US had already pledged 580m doses but delivered only 160m of those so far.\nSo what's different now? Well, global production has picked up in the past few months and there are doses available.\nRich countries could have 1.2bn spare doses by the end of the year, even if they run booster campaigns, according to science analytics firm Airfinity. 241m of those could go to waste if they're not donated. But these need to be sent very soon.\nCovax, the WHO-backed scheme to help distribute vaccines fairly, has told the BBC that too many of the donations it's receiving have come in small quantities, at the last minute and with little time left before they expire.\nThat makes their job of getting them to where they are needed very hard. If Biden want to meet this ambitious goal of vaccinating the world by this time next year, that will have to change.\nThe White House's Covid summit comes as research shows rich countries are still holding surpluses of vaccines, many of which could soon be thrown out.\nIn June, members of the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - pledged to donate one billion doses to poor countries over the next year.\nPresident Biden pledged 580m at the time, of which the US has delivered only 160m so far.\nThe donated vaccines are routed through Covax, the global scheme supported by the WHO to get doses where they're needed most. \nCovax purchases and then sells vaccines at low-cost to middle income countries and donates to poor countries.\nIn the US - where more than 76% of adults have received at least one dose - criticism that the country is doing too little to help the rest of the world has grown.\nOn Friday, a panel advising the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended booster shots - third doses - of the Pfizer vaccine for people 65 and over.\nThe WHO has previously called on wealthier nations to hold off on providing boosters until vaccination rates go up in lesser developed countries.\nLast week, in a letter to Mr Biden, eight lawmakers of his own party wrote: \"Clearly, there is an inequitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccine doses, and it is getting worse.\""

      "tags": "Agriculture,Brexit",
      "text": "Food industry bodies have warned of panic-buying this Christmas unless action is taken to address labour shortages.\nThe National Farmers' Union (NFU) called for an emergency visa to allow firms to recruit from outside the UK.\nUK farmers, hauliers and shops have been struggling with shortages that have been made worse by Covid and Brexit.\nThe government said that the UK has a \"highly resilient food supply chain\".\nThe head of the NFU, Minette Batters, wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday warning that the food and farming sector is on a \"knife edge\" due to a shortage of workers across the entire supply chain.\nThe letter, signed on behalf of a number of food and drink trade bodies, urged the government to introduce a Covid-19 recovery visa to open up new recruitment opportunities as a matter of urgency.\n\"Without it, more shelves will go empty and consumers will panic buy to try to get through the winter,\" Ms Batters wrote.\n\"That is why we must have an urgent commitment from you to enable the industry to recruit from outside the UK over the next 12 months to get us through the winter and to help us save Christmas.\"\nShe said it is \"a travesty that this is happening in parallel with UK food producers disposing of perfectly edible food as it either cannot be picked, packed, processed or transported to the end customer\".\n\"Every day there are new examples of food waste across the industry, from chicken to pork, fruit and vegetables, dairy and many other products. The food is there, but it needs people to get it to the consumers,\" Ms Batters said.\nThe letter was signed on behalf of other groups such as the British Frozen Food Federation, the British Meat Processors Association, Dairy UK and the Food and Drink Federation.\nThere was a report in The Grocer that Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket chain, had warned the government that panic-buying this Christmas could be worse than during lockdown.\nHowever, Tesco later said: \"We have good availability, with deliveries arriving at our stores and distribution centres across the UK every day.\n\"While the industry-wide shortage of HGV drivers has led to some distribution challenges, we're working hard to address these and to plan for the months ahead, so that customers can get everything they need.\"\nSome farmers have resorted to giving fruit and vegetables away rather than let it rot in their fields.\nThe NFU has said that only 11% of seasonal workers in the 2020 season were UK residents.\nRobert Newbery from NFU East Midlands said earlier this month: \"Brexit is certainly having an impact. The people that could move freely within Europe before now can't.\"\nIn response to the NFU's call for support, the government increased the number of visas available under the Seasonal Worker Pilot (SWP) from 10,000 in 2020 to 30,000 this year.\nThere are also labour shortages in meat production, with a shortfall of abattoir workers and butchers.\nThe Association of Independent Meat Suppliers told the BBC in August the industry had about 14,000 job vacancies.\nIt said Covid, the UK's exit from the European Union (EU) and perceptions over career paths had caused a looming \"recruitment crisis\".\nHauliers and food firms have also been warning of a chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which they also ascribe to the pandemic and Brexit.\nA government spokesperson said that the UK's supply chain is \"highly resilient\" and has coped well when faced with recent pressures.\nThey pointed out that the government earlier this year expanded its Seasonal Workers Pilot to 30,000 visas for workers to come to the UK for up to six months. \n\"We continue to work closely with industry to understand labour demand and supply, including both permanent and seasonal workforce requirements,\" they said.\nSeparately, the government has said it has taken action to prevent supermarket shortages with a deal to restart production at CF Industries, the UK's biggest producer of carbon dioxide.\nThe gas is widely used by the food industry to prolong shelf life.\nRestarting production at the carbon dioxide plants is set to cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds, after the government agreed to meet the full operating costs for three weeks."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "A Covid therapy derived from a llama named Fifi has shown \"significant potential\" in early trials.\nIt is a treatment made of \"nanobodies\", small, simpler versions of antibodies, which llamas and camels produce naturally in response to infection. \nOnce the therapy has been tested in humans, scientists say, it could be given as a simple nasal spray - to treat and even prevent early infection. \nProf James Naismith described nanobodies as \"fantastically exciting\". \nProf Naismith, who is one of the lead researchers and director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxfordshire, explained that coronavirus-infected rodents treated with the new nanobody nasal spray fully recovered within six days.   \nThe treatment has, so far, been tested only in those lab animals, but Public Health England said it was among the \"most effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralising agents\" it had ever tested.\nThis apparent covid-fighting potency comes from the strength with which nanobodies bind to the virus. \nJust like our own antibodies, virus-specific nanobodies latch on to and bind to viruses and bacteria that invade our bodies. This binding essentially tags an invading virus with an immune \"red flag\", to allow the rest of the body's immune armoury to target it for destruction.\nThe nanobodies that these researchers produced - with the help of a llama's immune system - bind particularly tightly.  \n\"That's where we had some help from Fifi the 'Franklin [Institute] llama',\" explained Prof Naismith. \nBy vaccinating Fifi with a tiny, non-infectious piece of the viral protein, the scientists stimulated her immune system to make the special molecules. The scientists then carefully picked out and purified the most potent nanobodies in a sample of Fifi's blood; those that matched the viral protein most closely, like the key that best fits a specific lock. \nThe team was then able to grow large quantities of the specially selected, most potent molecules. \nProf Naismith told BBC News: \"The immune system is so marvellous that it still does better than we can - evolution is hard to beat.\" \nProfessor Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist from the University of Manchester said the new development was \"exciting but still quite early\". \n\"We need more data on efficacy and safety before we move to human trials,\" she added. \"However it's very promising nonetheless and the fact it may be cheaper and easier to administer is a plus. Covid-19 will be, unfortunately, with us for a while yet, so more treatments will be needed.\"\nProfessor Naismith and his collaborators, who published their research in the journal Nature Communications agreed that, even with the success of the Covid vaccines, having effective treatments in the future would be very important.\n\"Not all of the world is being vaccinated at the same speed,\" he said, \"and there remains a risk of new variants capable of bypassing vaccine immunity emerging.\"\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "tags": "Queen Elizabeth University Hospital,Edinburgh,NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde",
      "text": "A mother whose daughter died at a children's cancer ward after contracting an infection has described her child's death as \"murder\".\nKimberly Darroch told the Scottish Hospitals Inquiry she wants the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus in Glasgow to close.\nHer daughter, Milly Main, was 10 when she died at the hospital in 2017. \nA review later found an infection which contributed to her death was probably caused by the hospital environment. \nThe child's death is one of two which has been linked to the QEUH campus. \nThe inquiry is investigating the construction of the QEUH and Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow, and the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh.\nOn the third day of evidence, a statement from Ms Darroch was read out to the inquiry. \nShe said she believed NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board should be punished.\n\"My view is that the hospital should be closed. I don't think it's safe,\" Ms Darroch said.\n\"I feel like the health board need to be punished for all of this. In my eyes, what happened to my daughter is murder.\n\"She should still be here and I am trying to come to terms with that, after coming to terms with losing her initially.\n\"I don't know that I'll ever be able to. I would never go back to the hospital, never.\"\nIn her statement she claimed staff covered up the true cause of Milly's death and she only found out what happened about two years later in the media.\nShe also claimed hospital reports about her meeting with doctors to discuss the infection were false.\nMilly was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 2012, and she died in 2017 after contracting stenotrophomonas - an infection found in water, the inquiry heard.\nMs Darroch and her family claim they were unaware of this infection which contributed to her daughter's death until after she died.\nChristine Horne, Ms Darroch's mother, also had her statement read out at the inquiry.\nShe said: \"We were never told what it (the infection) was and there was never any indication that it was related to the water in the hospital.\n\"Nobody said anything about what had caused the infection.\"\nEarlier, Lynn Kearns told the inquiry her son was unable to shower for about two weeks while being treated for a rare disease.\nShe said this was despite vomiting on his own face during \"harrowing\" treatment.\nMrs Kearns said she understood the water supply was cut off due to a certain type of bacteria being found in the system.\nHer son was 11 when he was diagnosed with a rare and life-threatening blood disorder.\nHe was treated in the Glasgow children's hospital between December 2017 and March 2018.\nMrs Kearns told the inquiry her son was treated in his room in Ward 2A, where there were issues with running water. Children had to wash and drink using bottled water.\nShe described the hospital ward as a \"prison\" with no working entertainment facilities and \"horrendous and unhealthy\" food.\nMrs Kearns told of a moment on 10 March where staff had to remove a medical tube from her son's throat which resulted in him vomiting and there being no hot water to wash him for days after.\nShe said: \"This was a harrowing event and also left him with vomit on his face. The first thing he wanted to do was have a proper wash or shower and freshen up.\n\"This was impossible due to the lack of hot water and showering facilities being out of bounds.\n\"The whole experience was so unpleasant for him. Even months after, he was having panic attacks and flashbacks to his time in hospital.\"\nMrs Kearns said that after pressing staff for better washing facilities, she was given a basin the size of a dinner plate and some warm water two days after her son had vomited on his face.\nShe said: \"My 11-year-old son, just hitting puberty, had to stand in the bathroom on a towel and I had to use a plastic cup to try and wash him.\n\"It was a case of me scooping up the water and pouring it over him. He was at the age where changes were happening and he was becoming more conscious about his body, so standing naked while his mum washed him was humiliating for him.\"\nMrs Kearns said she could not fault staff at the unit, as they too were \"kept in the dark\" about the water supply issues, but was concerned about ward hygiene levels.\nShe said: \"The staff were great and it was clear that the problems were out of their control.\"\nDespite sharing her concerns with the media at the time, Mrs Kearns said water supply issues at the hospital remained a problem today.\nAfter taking her son into the same hospital on Monday, she said she spoke to two maintenance workers who are still changing filters on the sink taps every two months, the inquiry heard.\nEarlier this year, an independent review found the deaths of two children at the QEUH campus were at least in part the result of infections linked to the hospital environment.\nThe review investigated 118 episodes of serious bacterial infection in 84 children and young people who received treatment for blood disease, cancer or related conditions at the Royal Hospital for Children at the campus.\nIt found a third of these infections were \"most likely\" to have been linked to the hospital environment.\nTwo of 22 deaths were \"at least in part\" the result of their infection, it said.\nThe inquiry in Edinburgh, chaired by Lord Brodie, continues."

Eight hours - that can't be,\" he said.\n\"It's not the fault of the ambulance crews, it's not the fault of the front line, the coal face, the nurses or anyone else like that.\n\"But there's got to be someone responsible for the way it is structured. The management, the funding even. There are so many different issues relating to this.\n\"There are people out there who are not going to be seen to for a long time\u2026 they're going to die.\"\nIn the Senedd debate on Wednesday Ms Morgan said the service was under \"unprecedented pressure\".\n\"I'm not hiding, I'm not ducking, I am absolutely taking responsibility,\" she said.\n\"Covid was bad, everybody understood Covid, but everybody in the service at the moment is telling me that this pressure at the moment is worse than anything we've seen.\"\nShe said 18% of calls are Covid-related, but handover delays to hospital have a \"significant impact\" .\nThe service has been hit by staff absence, caused by sickness which rose by 10% in June, self-isolation, shielding and delayed annual leave.\n\"We've got to accept the fact that a lot of these people are reaching burnout and they need a break,\" the minister said.\nMs Morgan added that staff were not taking up overtime as much as in the past, and there were difficulties in \"timely discharge in patients from hospital\", reducing available hospital beds.\nShe rejected the call to declare an emergency, but accepted \"there is a problem here that needs to be resolved\".\nSenedd members gave examples of problems faced by constituents with the ambulance service.\nWelsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the service is in \"crisis\" and has been \"for some months\".\nHe said a constituent of his was asked by the service to take a family member with a suspected heart attack to hospital themselves.\nMeanwhile Mabon ap Gwynfor, Plaid Cymru MS for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, said he knew of a case where a patient had to wait for 15 hours for an ambulance.\nHe said it was a \"symptom of a deep seated problem\", and feared more ambulances on the frontline would \"add to the queues of ambulances outside A&E departments\".\nLabour Swansea East MS Mike Hedges said the Welsh Ambulance Services Trust was \"not working effectively\" and should be \"split up\" and run by the individual health boards, \"so it's their fault, not somebody else's\".\nThe Trust covers the whole of Wales, while health boards are regional.\nHe said some were going to hospitals because they could not see a GP. \nMr Hedges appeared to criticise previous health ministers from his own party: \"Fortunately for the first time since I was elected, we have a health minister who I am confident will address the problems.\"\nPaul Amphlett retired as a paramedic six years ago and now works part-time as an emergency medical technician in Brecon, Powys.\n\"I have never known it as bad as it is at the moment, in the sense that morale is at rock bottom,\" he told BBC Wales.\n\"I didn't join the ambulance services to babysit patients outside hospitals for eight, 12 hours.\"\nMr Amphlett, 59, said crews from his patch in Powys were being sent across south Wales because the service is so stretched.\n\"There's no let-up. It's constant.\n\"They [patients] can't get hold of GPs. They are ringing 111 and are speaking to people telling them to ring for an ambulance because they can't get a doctor.\"\nWelsh Ambulance Services Trust declined to respond to Mr Amphlett's comments.\nThe military has assisted the NHS throughout the Covid pandemic. Soldiers helped drive ambulances in Wales on Christmas Eve, at the height of the pandemic's second wave.\nThe Welsh government said the new request, which it has processed on behalf of the trust, asks for \"drivers with a C1 driving licence to deal with increased pressures facing the service over the winter\".\nMilitary help for the service was proposed by Welsh Secretary Simon Hart in a letter to the Welsh government sent earlier in September.\nThe armed forces have assisted other ambulances services in the UK over recent months.\nSoldiers will begin driving Scottish ambulances this weekend, while the military was called in to help four trusts in England last month.\nA Ministry of Defence spokesman said it has \"received a request from Welsh government to support the Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust under the military aid to civil authorities process.

      "text": "The British food industry will be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with a US company to restart production in the UK.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from \u00a3200 per tonne to \u00a31,000.\nThe government has agreed to pay out tens of millions of pounds to CF Industries to reopen a plant in the UK. \nThe closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry.\nUS-owned CF Industries recently shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies, because of a sharp rise in gas prices.\nFarms, food producers and supermarkets have warned that a shortage of carbon dioxide will lead to significant disruption to the manufacture and supply of fresh produce. \nThe Times also reported that ministers were concerned that the UK might have to close its six advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors, which also use CO2. \nThe government announced late on Tuesday night that it would meet the full operating costs to run CF Industries' Billingham plant in Teesside for three weeks. The costs are expected to be in the \"low tens of millions\" and will be below \u00a350m.\nMr Eustice said that the deal with CF Industries \"will be not a loan, it will be a payment to underwrite some of their fixed costs\".\nAt the end of the three-week period, it is hoped that the price of carbon dioxide will have risen sufficiently to make it economically viable for CF Industries to keep production running. \nMr Eustice said the food industry would have to accept \"a big, sharp rise\" carbon dioxide prices from \u00a3200 to \u00a31,000 a tonne.\n\"The critical thing was to get the production up and running expeditiously. That's why we've needed this government intervention,\" he said.\n\"But we've had meetings with the food industry. They all recognise that the price of carbon dioxide is going to increase substantially and when that price increases, then the market signal will be then for these plants to continue producing.\"\nMr Eustice insisted that the rise in cost would not have a \"significant impact\" on food prices. \nHe said that while food prices were increasing \"due to global commodity prices, oil prices and also other factors such as labour shortages\", carbon dioxide was \"a tiny proportion\" of the industry's overall costs. \nCF Industries had halted two of its fertiliser factories - which produce carbon dioxide as a by-product - because of gas prices.\nCF Industries' Billingham plant will need up to three days to start producing new CO2. \nThe company told the BBC it had \"no estimate\" on when its second UK plant at Ince in Cheshire would  resume production. \nThe British Meat Processors Association said the deal to open CF Industries' Teesside plant was a \"huge relief\" and said it was now \"focused on re-establishing supplies before Friday this week, which is when around 25% of pork production was in danger of shutting down\".\nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the decision, but said the timetable to restart CF Industries' factory and begin producing carbon dioxide \"will still be tight\".\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"Our understanding is that provided that carbon dioxide starts to get through to food producers by the end of the week, then we can avert major and significant disruption in our stores.\"\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the \"exceptional short-term arrangement\" would ensure industries that rely on a stable supply of CO2 \"have the resources they require to avoid disruption\".\nHe said: \"With regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant, it was very cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened.\" \nThe government intends to publish the letter from Mr Kwarteng to Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, which sets out the terms of the taxpayer support.\nCommenting on the three-week deal, Mr Kwarteng said: \"In a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting the arrangement.\n\"It is not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely, and that is why in the critical period we needed to have a short term arrangement I am confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period. \nMr Eustice said that the shortage of carbon dioxide had been caused by a \"perfect storm\" of circumstances where CF Industries had shut its two plants because \"an increase in gas price means they are not profitable\", while two other providers had closed their sites for maintenance.\nBut the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said the current difficulties showed how exposed the UK is, because of its reliance on such a small number of carbon dioxide producers. \n\"Over many years, we have had a major consolidation of the industry resulting in sectors like food and drink, nuclear and health being reliant on a very small number of very large suppliers,\" the BMPA said.\n\"If a market-based solution is to be found, it will likely involve longer-term higher prices for CO2, which will be sustainable for some, but not all users of the gas.\"\nIan Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, also called on the government to support other fertiliser producers and help food producers to look for alternatives to CO2.\nMr Will, who flew from the US to the UK on Sunday to meet Mr Kwarteng, said: \"We look forward to working with Secretary Kwarteng and the UK government on developing a longer-term solution, including the development of alternative suppliers of CO2 for the UK market.\"\nThe BBC understands that the deal with CF Industries has been drafted so that other companies who stop production because of high commodity prices will not be able to ask the government for similar help. \nNorwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories, including one in Hull.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson urged people not to worry about putting food on the table this winter, amid rising energy and food bills and a cut to universal credit.\nWholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms.\nMr Opie added that the government should also take action on other issues affecting food retailers in recent weeks, such as the shortage of HGV drivers, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and many drivers returning to the European Union after Brexit.\nThe government has been keen to stress that this is very much an emergency measure, time-limited, and with a cap on the amount it is prepared to pay. \nIt had to do something. Food producers were warning that shortages would become apparent within days, at a time when supply chains have already been disrupted by other issues, such as a lack of lorry drivers. \nBut the fact remains that it has agreed to give a large US-owned company tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, just to operate one of its own plants. That isn't a particularly good look - and it has cast a glaring spotlight on the vulnerability of a key part of the economy. \nNow there is a three-week window for government, supermarkets and food producers to come up with a \"sustainable market-based solution\". In practice, that's likely to mean users paying more for their CO2, a cost which will ultimately be borne by consumers. "

      "text": "With Joe Biden and the Democrats back in charge in Washington, the US was expected to strengthen ties with Europe and put the UK, to paraphrase Barack Obama, toward the back of the queue.\nDonald Trump's focus on transactional diplomacy and penchant for one-on-one deals was out; multilateralism was again in vogue.\nThat's not exactly how things have played out, however.\nOn Tuesday morning, Biden gave a speech at the United Nations emphasising the need for collective action by the community of nations.\nBut by the evening, he was back at the White House for a one-on-one meeting with Boris Johnson, talking up a US-UK relationship that has taken on greater relevance for the Biden administration in the past few weeks.\nThe location conveyed as much about the importance of the meeting for the Americans as the brief opening statements and two quickly answered questions (both from British reporters chosen by Johnson, much to the consternation of US journalists).\nThis sit-down could have been held in a New York conference room; instead it was in the Oval Office, surrounded by the trappings of US power. That sends a message.\nAlthough Johnson earlier spoke of US-UK relations that are \"as good as they have been in decades\", there are still a few bumps in the road.\nThe US seems uninterested in prioritising a new trade deal. Biden's \"we'll have to work that through\" comment on Tuesday wasn't exactly an enthusiastic response.\nThe president, who regularly boasts of his Irish heritage, has also warned of what he sees as the danger Brexit poses to stability in Northern Ireland - a point he again alluded to on Tuesday.\nShared priorities, however, seem to have prevailed. With Johnson, Biden has found a welcome partner in tackling climate change.\nAnd the two nations appear headed toward an even closer security relationship following the US-UK-Australia pledge to share military and intelligence assets - a development Johnson said \"has great potential\" to benefit the world.\nThat Aukus triumvirate is almost Trumpian in its nature; an Anglophone alliance that sidelines continental Europe and positions itself to face off against Chinese territorial ambitions.\nChina scoffs at a \"cold war mentality\". The French fume at a diplomatic snub that cost them billions in their nixed Australian submarine deal. But Biden has a plan for his foreign policy, and it appears the UK has a prominent part in it.\nTuesday's Oval Office meeting was further evidence of that."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The United States is lifting its decades-old ban on imports of British lamb, Boris Johnson has announced. \nThe PM, who is in the US for talks with UN leaders and President Joe Biden, said the ban was \"unjustified\".\nBut he admitted the UK was now focused on making \"incremental steps\" on US trade access, rather than aiming for a full agreement. \nMr Biden appeared to play down the chances of a wider deal during a meeting with Mr Johnson on Tuesday.\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said the Biden administration \"is not doing free trade deals around the world right now\".\nBut he added he had \"every confidence that a great deal is there to be done\".\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner mocked the lack of movement, saying the PM had made \"absolutely zero progress\" on a trade deal during his US trip.\nThe United States has banned British lamb imports since 1989, following the first outbreaks of BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease. \nA similar ban on British beef imports, imposed in 1996, was lifted in September last year. \nThere is no indication yet of when the US will start accepting lamb and lamb products from the UK, and an official announcement has not been made.\nThe US Department for Agriculture has been consulting on lifting the ban since 2016 - and there were originally hopes it would be lifted the following year.\nAt the time, the UK government estimated the change would be worth an extra \u00a335m a year to the UK economy. \nAnalysis by Damian Grammaticas , BBC political correspondent \nWhen it comes to trade, the big deal that's emerged from Boris Johnson's visit to Washington is that there's to be no deal happening any time soon. \nThat's significant, and a setback for Boris Johnson's government. \nIn March 2020, just a few weeks after the UK had left the EU, the then-Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the day marked a \"crucial step in beginning the formal negotiations for a free-trade agreement with our largest bilateral trading partner, the United States.\" \nToday it all looks different. The United States, Boris Johnson told us, is not doing deals. \nSo whilst Ms Truss predicted a \"\u00a33.4 billion lift to the economy\" from a US-UK deal, today we had an \"incremental step\" but a tiny one by comparison - a possible opening for lamb exports. \nA US deal was by far the biggest prize when it came to the promise of post-Brexit trade deals. But under this US administration, it's not happening any time soon.\nMr Johnson said the ban was \"totally unjustified\" and \"discriminating on British farmers and British lamb\".\nThe National Sheep Association industry group welcomed the news, adding it had always seen the US as a \"potentially important market\".\nIts chief executive Phil Stocker cautioned, however, that \"we shouldn't expect to see any sudden surge in volumes going to the US\".\nHe added that Brexit had made it more difficult to sell into the EU - the UK's lamb largest export market - and it was \"important to work on any market that gives us future potential\".\nMr Johnson cited the lifting of the ban as an example of \"practical steps to help our exports\" the UK was taking, pending progress on wider trade talks. \nDowning Street has pointed to the resolution of the Airbus-Boeing trade dispute, as well as the lowering of whisky tariffs and the decision to lift the ban on British beef.\nSecuring a trade deal with the United States has been a priority for many Brexit-backing politicians, following the UK's departure from the EU. \nBut on Tuesday, Mr Biden appeared to downplay the chances of an agreement soon, adding he would discuss the issue \"a little bit\" with Mr Johnson during his trip to the White House. \n\"We're going to have to work that through,\" the US president added. \nThe US is already a significant UK trading partner, accounting for \u00a31 in every \u00a36 of British trade.\nThe BBC understands the government is considering whether to join an existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - known as the USMCA. \nHowever, Downing Street denies this and says it focus remains on a UK-US trade deal.\nIf a USMCA arrangement was pursued, it would limit the UK's ability to sell services. \nEconomists say the overall gains from joining it could be less than 0.1% of the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - a measurement of the size of the economy."

      "text": "Avro Energy and Green have collapsed, becoming the latest firms to be brought down by the sharp rise in gas prices.\nCombined with other recent failures, it means 1.5 million people are now facing a switch to a new, more expensive firm.\nAll affected customers will continue to receive energy while a new supplier is appointed by regulator Ofgem. Its price cap limits how much firms can charge.\nOfgem's boss earlier warned the rise in gas prices was \"unprecedented\" and meant more firms would go bust,\nAvro Energy, the biggest supplier to exit the market so far, has 580,000 customers, while Green has 250,000.\nGreen, which employs 180 people, blamed \"unprecedented market conditions and regulatory failings\" for its collapse.\nSince the sharp rise in wholesale gas prices - which firms complain they are unable to pass on to customers because of the price cap on energy bills - a number of small companies have collapsed.\nThey include People's Energy, Utility Point, PfP Energy and MoneyPlus Energy. Together, the recently failed companies account for more than 5% of the market, about 1.5 million customers.\nMeanwhile Bulb, the UK's sixth largest energy company with 1.7 million customers, is seeking financing. And another firm, Igloo, has said it is working with restructuring consultants Alvarez & Marsal. But Igloo told the BBC it had not appointed administrators. \nIf an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a payment plan agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust.\nCustomers are advised to not try and switch to a new supplier until they are contacted by whoever Ofgem appoints to take over their account.\nOfgem boss Jonathan Brearley, warned earlier more customers would be affected.\n\"We've already seen hundreds of thousands of customers affected, that may well go well above that. It's very hard for me to put a figure on it.\"\nAppearing before the cross-party Business Committee on Wednesday, he declined to say if the number of customers that would eventually need new suppliers could run into \"millions\".\nMr Brearley insisted that Ofgem had plans in place to cope as the crisis developed. He told MPs that Ofgem \"war-gamed\" various scenarios.\nA six-fold rise in wholesale gas prices since last year meant if was likely more firms would go under, Mr Brearley said, although he said commercial talks with the firms prevented him from speculating how many.\n\"It's not unusual for suppliers to go out of the market,\" he said. \"I think what is different this time is that dramatic change in the costs that those suppliers are facing.\n\"We do expect more (suppliers) not to be able to face the circumstances we're in, but it's genuinely hard to say more than that, partly because that means predicting what may happen to the gas price.\"\nHundreds of thousands of savvy switchers who followed advice to shop around for a cheap energy deal will be left frustrated at the demise of suppliers of many of the most competitive tariffs.\nAs they are automatically shifted from a bust supplier to a surviving one, they will need to put that tendency to keep switching to one side.\nCitizens Advice, the official consumer advocate for energy, says it is best to do nothing while that transfer is made. Any credit they have built up will be honoured.\nWhile the continuation of their energy supply is guaranteed, their old contract is not.\nThey, and anyone else whose fixed rate is coming to an end, will find they are potentially paying hundreds of pounds more per year for their energy - although the damage is limited by Ofgem's price cap. \nThe problem is, if they look around for anything better, right now they are likely to draw a blank.\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation charity has warned that millions of low-income households will face a squeeze on their finances from October, when energy companies will be allowed to lift the maximum amount they charge for gas and electricity by as much as 12%. \nAnd from next month, Universal Credit claimants face losing \u00a320 a week.\nBusiness and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng admitted the cut to Universal Credit could make it \"a very difficult winter\" for low-income families, and said he was speaking to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey \"a great deal\" on the subject.\nRead more about the next best steps to take here.\nThe head of trade body Energy UK Emma Pinchbeck said earlier that the sector had been fragile for a couple of years and the current gas crisis had exposed fault-lines in the market.\nShe said: \"There's a short-term crisis here, which is in some ways out of our control - it's to do with the gas prices - but it's been exacerbated and arguably caused by our regulatory design.\"\nWholesale gas prices have spiked as economies reopened from Covid-19 lockdowns and high demand for liquefied natural gas in Asia pushed down supplies to Europe.\nThe surge in demand has sent shockwaves through industries reliant on natural gas. \nOn Tuesday, the government agreed to pay out tens of millions of pounds to US fertiliser firm CF Industries to restart carbon dioxide production. Its shutdown, due to high energy costs, had sparked concerns over food shortages.\nCarbon dioxide, a by-product of fertiliser manufacturing, is used to stun animals, in fizzy drinks, and in food packaging.\nIn the energy market, small providers that had launched in recent years had been hit by the jump in costs even before the recent spike.

      "text": "The White House meeting is, for any British prime minister, the big ticket.\nAnd because of Covid, Boris Johnson has had to wait for his - the two years since he moved in to Downing Street means a new president here too. Imagine how different today could have been if Donald Trump was still in charge.\nThe two leaders are intensely different, but when the big moment came, both appeared to be content. \nMr Johnson and President Joe Biden met for 90 minutes after smiles for the cameras in the Oval Office. \nTheir talks ranged from security, to climate change, Russia and China, and the possibility of closer trade ties. \nBut on the trade deal issue, the president said they needed to \"work through\" it and \"talk a little\" - confirming Downing Street's assumption that the prospect of a major pact is a long way off. \nNumber 10 didn't deny the UK could join an existing agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada - which the BBC understands has been considered - but said the priority was still pursuing a deal with America alone.  \nIt's really clear from both sides that there is no rapid path to a trade deal - the opportunity that used to be lauded by Brexiteers and by President Trump. \nMr Johnson hinted at that realism in his curtain raiser conversations on his way over here. And the president pretty much confirmed that here in their meeting in the Oval Office. \nThe UK seems no longer to want to believe, or pretend, that doing business in a major deal is top of their list. \nInstead, while the government is still officially pursuing a standalone deal with the US there's a twin track with a more incremental approach - there have already been changes to whisky tariffs and British beef. But Number 10 is now hopeful that the Americans are seriously considering changing tack on British lamb. \nA Downing Street source said the relationship between the two countries had made \"great strides forward\", hailing the ending of the US travel ban and especially President Biden's extra promises of cash to tackle climate change. \nMr Johnson will call for other countries to do the same back in New York, before returning home later today. \nThere aren't perfect outcomes to any relationship as crucial, or as complicated, as the pairing of the US and the UK. \nThere's plenty more that could yet unfold between the two sides before wheels-up late tomorrow. But Mr Johnson's team is pleased and relieved to chalk up their first Oval Office meeting more than unscathed."

      "tags": "Renting,Eviction,Landlords,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Tenants are being evicted due to rent arrears built up during the Covid pandemic, despite the government saying no-one should lose their home as a result of the crisis. \nOne-third of hearings monitored in England and Wales over the summer explicitly cited the pandemic as the reason for the arrears, an investigation has found. The average hearing lasted just 10 minutes. \n\"We had a few safety nets, but they weren't enough for Covid,\" says Marshall Kinder-Maiss, 27. \nThree weeks before the UK went into lockdown in March 2020, he and his partner Joanne thought their dreams had come true. After 18 months of trying to conceive a child, Joanne had just given birth to a baby boy, Roman. To support his growing family, Marshall, a chef, decided to leave his job at a Nando's restaurant in Liverpool to take a better-paid role with a city-centre cafe. \nMarshall had a week off between his old job and his new one. And that was the week when Covid restrictions were introduced. Marshall's new job offer was withdrawn. And as he had left his former employer, he wasn't eligible for the government's furlough scheme.\nThe couple's income plummeted. Until their claim for Universal Credit was processed, their only money was Joanne's maternity pay of \u00a3150 a week. When the couple were both working full-time, they used to take home around \u00a32,000 a month. Their \u00a3450-a-month rent quickly became unaffordable as overdrafts were maximised to pay for living expenses. They've struggled to pay rent ever since. \n\"It was not how it was supposed to be,\" says Joanne, 24. \"It makes me feel a bit sick. We both grew up coming from poverty so we tried our best to get out of that. We've always been working people, and now I just feel like our son has been born into the exact same situation.\n\"All of our peers - they're not in this position. So it's a bit humiliating to be honest.\" \nThey are now \u00a34,000 in rent arrears and have been served with an eviction notice. They must leave the house by 11 October. \nIn March 2020, former Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick tweeted that \"no-one should lose their home as a result of the coronavirus epidemic\". A ban on bailiff evictions was introduced in England and Wales. This ended in England in May this year, and in Wales the following month. \nTo investigate the impact of this, The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) sent reporters to 30 county courts in England and Wales throughout July and August. \nOf the 555 cases involving either private or social housing landlords, 270 ended in a possession order. A third of those, 88 cases, explicitly mentioned the impact that Covid had had on their finances.   \nCourt bailiffs were \"swamped\" following the end of the eviction ban, lawyers told the BBC.\nMarshall and Joanne have decided not to go to Liverpool County Court to challenge their landlord's legal action. They have been advised by their legal representative that it would be \"pointless\". \nThey have been served with a Section Eight order, used when a tenant breaks the terms of the rental agreement. This acts as a mandatory ground for repossession if the landlord can prove that the tenant has arrears of at least two months. \nLast year, MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee recommended changes in the law to give judges discretion in deciding each individual case. The government chose to ignore the recommendation. \nOn Monday, the BBC visited Wandsworth County Court - a crumbling three-storey building in south London - to witness possession orders being rapidly handed down, some within just five minutes. \nThe individuals or families in question will be forced out of their homes in just two weeks' time. \nOnly one tenant appeared in person during the session. She told the court she had been unable, during the pandemic, to find her usual agency work as an executive PA. This left her unable to afford the \u00a31,600 a month rent on her one-bedroom flat in Hammersmith, west London. \nShe had racked up \u00a324,000 in rent arrears. The court ordered her to leave her property by 4 October. In addition to her rent arrears, she must pay \u00a3604 in interest, and the landlord's \u00a33,000 legal costs. \nThe woman, who did not want to be named, told the BBC she would stay with a friend for the first two weeks. She has no idea where she will live after that. \n\"I don't know what to do. I've found a job, but my credit history is so bad, I doubt I'll find a place,\" she said.\nMarshall and Joanne say they have the same problem.\nMarshall found a new job three months ago, working for a food delivery firm, and is now looking for a second job to supplement his wage. But they don't have any savings to pay a deposit, and their credit rating is now poor.   \nAnd they face fierce competition for a new home, says Joanne. \n\"They're really sought after because there are a lot of evictions, so people are desperate to get a house.\"\nMarshall says he phones the council an average of once a week to enquire about social housing, but has been told there are others whose need is greater. \nThe couple say they definitely plan to pay back their arrears once they are able to. \nThe average tenant in the cases analysed by the TBIJ had \u00a36,500 worth of rent arrears. But a judge at another London court told the BBC he had come across one set of tenants with arrears of \u00a3190,000 in recent weeks. Some tenants had \"undoubtedly taken advantage\" of the evictions ban, he said, in effect to live rent-free.\nLandlady Michelle Dighton, 41, believes this is the case with a tenant in one of her rental properties. \nShe is owed more than \u00a325,000 in rent arrears as she says her tenant -  in Croydon, south London - hasn't paid rent since October 2019. She says that she delayed serving an eviction notice, hoping to resolve the situation amicably. \nBut when the government introduced the eviction ban, Michelle found herself stuck. Legal delays have further prevented the mother-of-two from sending round the bailiffs. \n\"I have to pay a mortgage and service fee for the flat, but I'm not getting any income from it.\"\nAdvice for tenants from the Citizen's Advice Bureau:\nMichelle says, as a tenant herself, she understands why the government introduced the eviction ban, \"but the courts can't distinguish between those who can't pay and those who won't pay\". \n\"My tenant's arrears have nothing to do with Covid,\" she thinks.\nAlthough the majority of tenants whose cases were monitored by TBIJ were served a Section Eight eviction notice, a fifth were served a Section 21 notice. Section 21 is a controversial part of the 1988 Housing Act which allows landlords to evict people without giving a specific reason.  Often called \"no fault\" or \"revenge\" evictions, the Conservatives promised to scrap them in their 2019 manifesto. \nMinisters said they will outline their proposals \"in due course\".\nIn a statement, the new Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: \"Our \u00a3352bn support package has helped renters throughout the pandemic, and prevented a build-up of rent arrears. We also took unprecedented action to help keep people in their homes by extending notice periods and pausing evictions at the height of the pandemic.\n\"As the economy re-opens, it is right that these measures are now being lifted and we are delivering a fairer and more effective private rental sector that works for both landlords and tenants.\"\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"Here in Wales, we have made significant additional help available for tenants, including additional funding for Discretionary Housing Payments and grants to clear Covid-related rent arrears. This support goes far beyond any support UK government have provided.\""

      "text": "Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says he is \"working urgently\" to free up bed space in Scotland's NHS.\nThe Scottish government has enlisted the help of the Army, fire service, British Red Cross and taxi firms to ease pressure on the ambulance service.\nMr Yousaf told BBC Scotland that efforts are also under way to move more people into social care.\nNursing and social care groups say more help is needed - and that reintroducing some restrictions should be considered.\nDonald Macaskill, the chief executive of Scottish Care, which represents care homes in Scotland, claimed his sector was in \"dire straits\" and needed an \"emergency intervention\". \nHe added: \"With all the focus on the NHS the crisis in the care system has gone largely unnoticed.\n\"This is an ecosystem. To free up capacity in hospitals, you have to attend to social care. The NHS will collapse next week if social care collapses today.\n\"We need an immediate injection of cash into the sector. If we can increase the salary of lorry drivers we should be able to do it for frontline social care workers who fought their way through this pandemic.\"\nThe warning comes as the Royal College of Nursing Scotland said ministers need to consider reintroducing Covid restrictions in order to alleviate the pressure on the NHS. \nNorman Provan, the trade union's associate director, said: \"The government have to consider whether further restrictions have to be put back in place. \n\"I know that that is really unpopular with the general public, who are just beginning to think that things are getting back to normal, but it's not for people who work providing care. \n\"It is absolutely desperate out there and if their relatives were seeking care just now they would approach that quite differently.\" \nSoldiers will be drafted in to drive ambulances from this weekend following reports that some patients have faced very long waits for emergency help to arrive. \nThey include a pensioner who died in Glasgow after having to wait 40 hours for an ambulance, and an 86-year-old woman who had to lie on her kitchen for eight hours after falling and breaking her hip.\nIn some cases the problem is caused by ambulances queuing for hours before being are able to hand over their patients to accident and emergency, due to the volume of patients in the hospital. \nThe health secretary told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland he was aware a \"whole systems approach\" was required address the current problems.\nHe said: \"I can give absolute assurance that we are working urgently, and hopefully I can give some detail of this very imminently, in terms of a winter plan to free up beds back into social care.\n\"We know that there's about 1,500 people who are delayed discharge - they're clinically safe to discharge from hospital - but a portion of them don't have a care package in their local communities and we're working really hard to quickly try to resolve that to free up bed space.\"\nMr Yousaf described the situation as \"the biggest crisis that anybody has ever faced in our lifetime and certainly in the NHS' existence\".\nHe refused to rule out setting up field hospitals to cope with patient numbers but stressed they would present challenges.\n\"The difficulty is you could easily set up beds - we have beds and equipment to do that - what we don't have is the workforce,\" the health secretary added. \n\"And the Army don't have a huge pool of doctors that are just sitting there not doing anything. In fact the full-time doctors are very much based in the NHS and then if they have to go to deployment in armed service they get permission from the NHS to go and join army personnel overseas.\"\nMr Yousaf added: \"I definitely wouldn't rule it out entirely but we have to look at whether or not we would end up pulling people out of acute sites at the moment to staff those beds.\"\nThe Scottish government also said it was continuing to work with health and social care partnerships to provide support around the current challenges facing the sector.\nDr Daniel Beckett, of the Society for Acute Medicine, said many patients could not leave hospital as they do not have a package of care in place. \nThe acute care consultant said the main challenge was not Covid patients, who are generally younger and unvaccinated, but those suffering from conditions such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes.\n\"The numbers of patients that are coming through the front door and being admitted into acute medical units are high, certainly high even for winter, and much higher than we would expect at this time of year,\" Dr Beckett said. \n\"And those patients are sicker and more complex than normal and that's as a result of chronic disease management being different over the past 18 months.\"\nDr Beckett added patients are spending longer in hospital as a result and when they are medically fit for discharge, staff are struggling to access packages of care."

      "text": "People caught with Class A drugs in Scotland could be given a police warning instead of facing prosecution.\nOfficers can already issue a formal warning for possession of lower category drugs.\nLord Advocate Dorothy Bain told MSPs this would now include Class A drugs in a bid to address the underlying causes of Scotland's drugs death crisis.\nThe Conservatives said the move amounts to \"de facto decriminalisation\" of deadly substances.\nMs Bain insisted this was not the case, adding that there is \"no one size fits all\" response to drug addiction and that every case should be judged individually.\nShe stressed that the scheme would not extend to drug dealing and that officers would still have the ability to report certain cases to prosecutors.\nScotland logged a record 1,339 drug-related deaths in 2020 - by far the highest rate in Europe - with the Scottish government pledging to make it a \"national mission\" to cut fatalities.\nMs Bain told MSPs that the mounting death toll represented a \"public health emergency\", and that steps could be taken via the prosecution system to help.\nAt present, police officers are able to issue a Recorded Police Warning to people who commit low-level offences, rather than refer them to the prosecution service.\nWhich offences are covered by this scheme is kept confidential, but Ms Bain told MSPs that it had  applied to Class B and Class C drugs.\nThe Lord Advocate said she had decided that it should be expanded to include possession offences for Class A drugs, meaning \"officers may choose to issue a warning for simple possession offences for all classes of drugs\".\nProsecutors can also refer people accused of drugs offences for \"diversion\", where they are dealt with by social work teams or other agencies rather than the criminal justice system.\nMs Bain said: \"There is no one size fits all response to an individual found in possession of a controlled substance, or an individual dependent on drugs.\n\"The most appropriate response, the smartest response in any drugs case must be tailored to the facts and circumstances of both the alleged offence and the offender.\n\"Scotland's police and prosecutors are using the powers available to them to both uphold the law and help tackle the drug death emergency.\"\nPolice Scotland said it took a health-led approach to addressing drug deaths, saying the change \"gives officers another tool to support those at risk of becoming vulnerable in our communities\".\nAssistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie - the force's head of drug strategy - said formal warnings would still appear on criminal records, and that persistent and serious offenders would still be reported to prosecutors.\nAnd he said the force was \"steadfastly committed to tackling those who bring misery to our communities by dealing drugs and taking advantage of those who are at their most vulnerable\".\nAddiction charity Faces and Voices of Recovery UK said the move was welcome, but would not be a \"silver bullet\" for the country's drug deaths crisis.\nChief executive Annemarie Ward said: \"Diversion from prosecution will prevent many people who really need help and support from being forced through our criminal justice system. \n\"It should allow people who are caught in addiction to get into treatment, instead of being sent to jail.\"\nHowever the Scottish Conservatives hit out at the plan, calling for the policy to be debated and voted on at Holyrood.\nMSP Jamie Greene said: \"Scotland's drug death crisis is our national shame. But surely the way to tackle is by improving access to treatment and rehab not to dilute how seriously we treat the possession of deadly drugs like heroin, crystal meth and crack cocaine, the scourges of our streets and of our society.\n\"The answer to our drug death crisis is treatment, not de facto decriminalisation by the back door.\"\nHowever other parties backed the move, with Labour's Claire Baker saying the statement was \"very welcome\".\nShe added: \"Scotland's drugs death crisis is a scandal of national proportions and it is only right that a public health approach is taken to tackle it.\""

      "tags": "Department for Work & Pensions,Money,Personal finance,Pensions,National Audit Office",
      "text": "Repeated human errors made for years were to blame for a scandal which led to more than \u00a31bn of state pensions not being paid, a report has concluded.\nThe National Audit Office (NAO) said 134,000 pensioners, mostly women, were underpaid pensions because outdated computer systems led to mistakes.\nAmong them was 74-year-old Irene Wise, who said women like her were \"short-changed\" for years.\nThe government said everyone would receive what they were owed.\nHowever, the report raises huge questions for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) over the way the state pension system functions and the mistakes that led to such a massive shortfall in payments.\nReacting to the report, Meg Hillier, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said: \"This is not the first widespread error we have seen in the DWP in recent years. Correcting these errors comes at great cost to the taxpayer.\n\"The DWP must provide urgent redress to those affected and take real action to prevent similar errors in future.\"\nThe problem relates to the \"old\" state pension system where married women who had a poor pension in their own right could claim a 60% basic state pension based on their husband's record of contributions.\nA review is taking place to trace those affected by systemic failures to award these pension rises, stretching back to 1985. But only some women are being fully paid. Others will only be able to claim for 12 months of missed payments.\nThe DWP is expecting to pay the affected pensioners it can trace a total of \u00a31.05bn, at an average of \u00a38,900 per pensioner affected. That exercise will cost the taxpayer \u00a325m in staff costs and will not be completed until the end of 2023. An estimated 40,000 affected women have already died.\nGrandmother-of-four Mrs Wise, from Worcestershire, spent two years battling for her money.  The NAO report said that some pensioners who contacted the DWP may have been falsely reassured that their payments were correct.\nThe 74-year-old eventually received \u00a37,334 in back payments for eight years of missed pensions.\n\"When you think you have been short-changed for that many years, what a difference [the money] could have made in certain circumstances,\" she said.\nJan Tiernan, from Fife, is one of those affected by the wider problems caused by the errors. She too was initially told she was not owed any money.\n\"I told the DWP I should be getting another \u00a330 a week based on my husband's contributions. But they fobbed me off and said no. I didn't believe them due to the media coverage, so I started writing to them,\" she said.\nAfter nearly 100 pages of correspondence with the department, she received \u00a31,280. However, she believes she is still owed more than \u00a317,000 in missed payments.\n\"It makes me sad and angry. I've been on this campaign for two years now. It is not just for me but for all of these people who have been done out of this money. They should have got it,\" she said.\n\"At 81 years old, you get fed up with it. It is very wearing and it takes up all your energy.\"\nThe NAO report found that errors occurred because state pension rules were complex, computer systems outdated and many tasks still needed to be done manually.\n\"This makes some level of error in the processing of state pension claims almost inevitable,\" it said.\nIt also found the DWP did not have a means of reviewing individual complaints or errors, such as how many people were complaining about the same issues, to assess whether the errors had a systemic cause.\nAs a result, it concluded that it missed opportunities to detect, prevent or correct the errors.\nSir Steve Webb, partner at consultancy LCP and a former pensions minister, unearthed the problems.\nHe said the department had \"let down a generation of women\". He said officials should have been more curious about issues over many years.\nA DWP spokesperson said: \"We are fully committed to ensuring the historical errors that have been made by successive governments are corrected, and as this report acknowledges, we are dedicating significant resource to doing so. Anyone impacted will be contacted by us to ensure they receive all that they are owed. \n\"Since we became aware of this issue, we have introduced new quality control processes and improved training to help ensure this does not happen again.\"\nThe department is facing a heavy workload, with increased benefits claims during the pandemic, as well as a backlog in state pension applications which has meant thousands of newly-retired people have yet to receive their first state pension payments."

      "title": "'Surrogacy is absolutely what I want to do'",
      "tags": "Surrogacy,Parenting",
      "text": "The number of parents having a baby using a surrogate in England and Wales has almost quadrupled in the last 10 years, new figures show.\nParental orders, which transfer legal parentage from the surrogate, rose from 117 in 2011 to 413 in 2020. \nTwo-thirds of applicants are now mixed-sex couples often in their 30s or 40s.\nThe report is by the University of Kent and My Surrogacy Journey, a non-profit organisation which supports surrogates and intended parents. \nSurrogacy is when a woman carries a pregnancy for another couple or individual. In most cases it is because someone cannot carry a pregnancy themselves for health reasons or because they are men in a same-sex relationship. \nAs it becomes more common, experts say the UK law on surrogacy - in place since 1985 - is outdated and leaves both surrogates and intended parents vulnerable.\nThe law states a surrogate is deemed the legal mother when the baby is born - irrespective of genetics or any agreements that have been made. \nA parental order must be made to transfer legal parentage to the intended or biological parents. \nAnd it is illegal to advertise for a surrogate - meaning unless family or friends offer, intended parents can struggle to find a match.\nNon-profit organisations and social media sites say they are seeing more people using their services to help match surrogates and would-be parents. \nTwo women who met on a Facebook group were Fran and her surrogate Gina. \nFran, 39, from Stockton-on-Tees, needed a surrogate to carry her two daughters, Evelyn and Grace, after cervical cancer treatment meant she could not carry a pregnancy herself.\n\"My consultant told me about a woman like me who was now a mum and she was my goal,\" said Fran. \"I want to put my story out there to show others that normal real-life women get through this and take their own baby home.\n\"I can't think of a better way of women empowering women.\"\nShe said those using surrogates in order to have a family are \"just normal people, teachers, people who re-mortgage their houses to do this\".\n\"When you're given a cancer diagnosis your whole life changes in a second and you fall into this hole, and the fog just descends,\" Fran told the BBC. \n\"And then when Evelyn was born it felt like for the first time since that diagnosis this weight had been lifted and I could start to think about life again.\"\nGina, 45, Fran's surrogate, runs one of the many Facebook groups where surrogates and intended parents match. \nShe believes more people are considering surrogacy, in part down to celebrities such as Robbie Williams and Kim Kardashian talking so openly about their own experiences. \n\"We have over 1,000 members currently,\" she said. \"Across independent groups there have been over 40 babies born in 2019 alone.\" \nGina backs changing the law so that those who have a baby with a surrogate become the legal parents \"from the minute that baby is born\". \n\"I don't want the parental rights to someone else's child. I never went into this to have another baby of my own. I've got three beautiful children of my own. It was all about creating a family for someone else. I don't want to be a mum to someone else's child,\" she said.\nNatalie is mum to two children and is now 30 weeks pregnant with her first surrogate baby. \nThe 34-year-old, from Bath, said: \"We struggled starting our own family - we had a miscarriage and a still birth.\n\"My daughter Sophie was born at 37 weeks but tragically she died. A friend had had breast cancer and I'd offered to be a surrogate for her if she needed. She didn't, but it was always in the back of my mind.\"\nShe added she was driven to help others who wanted to have a child but could not.\n\"I was watching The Nest [a TV drama featuring surrogacy] during lockdown and I felt so sorry for them,\" she said. \"I spoke to my husband and we talked about if I could deal with being a surrogate after losing our daughter, so I spoke to my GP and a bereavement nurse who were supportive.\n\"I met my intended parents on the Facebook groups and we chatted for a year before matching.\"\nDepartment of Health guidance said it does not generally recommend that those considering surrogacy do so independently on sites like Facebook, instead pointing to one of the four UK non-profit organisations.\nThe trouble is those organisations have long waiting lists. \nNatalie Gamble is director of Brilliant Beginnings - another non-profit organisation in the UK which matches surrogates and intended parents.  \n\"We get around 100 enquiries a month from women who want to be surrogates and that's risen considerably in the past few years,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, there are still more intended parents looking for a match than we can help.\" \nMegan, 25, from Ipswich looked into becoming a surrogate when she was furloughed during lockdown. She is currently getting to know two sets of intended parents she met through a surrogacy organisation.  \n\"Me and my fianc\u00e9 Ed are childless by choice - we've always known we don't want children,\" she said. \"But if I have the ability why wouldn't I help someone else? \n\"My best friends totally get it - my parents and older family members not so much. My mum's main concern was she wanted me to have my own kids but they're both really supportive. I've donated eggs twice and this is absolutely what I want to do.\"\nThe legislation relating to surrogacy is UK-wide, but there are different judicial systems in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Department of Health guidance only applies to England and Wales.\nIn the US where surrogacy is more common and highly regulated, intended parents can go on to the birth certificate as soon as the baby is born - and payments of tens of thousands of pounds to surrogates are common.  \nCommercial surrogacy is illegal in the UK, so a third party cannot profit from matching people. But it is not illegal for a surrogate to be paid expenses - non-profit organisations say between \u00a312,000 and \u00a320,000 is the average for such expenses, but there is no limit.\nThe government agrees the surrogacy law in the UK needs to change and has asked the Law Commission of England and Wales along with the Scottish Law Commission to review it. \nProfessor Nick Hopkins is the Law Commissioner for family law, and is one of the proponents leading the consultation. \n\"When we asked whether surrogacy law needed review we received one of our largest volume of responses. The law does need updating.\n\"We're looking at the idea that legal parentage would start not with a parental order but at birth. But it is fundamental to our review that the surrogate must retain her bodily autonomy throughout and a surrogacy agreement would not be enforceable if a surrogate withdrew her consent - which is extremely rare.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We know surrogacy is an important option for families and we remain committed to reforming legislation to ensure more certainty for surrogates and intended parents.\"\nThe Law Commission will publish its recommendations for reform of the law and a draft bill towards the end of 2022."

      "text": "A 5.9 magnitude earthquake has rattled southeast Australia, damaging buildings in the city of Melbourne. \nThe earthquake happened about 09:15 local time (23:15 GMT) on Wednesday at Mansfield, not far from the Victorian state capital.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said \"we have had no reports of serious injuries and that is very good news\".\nThe earthquake was also felt in neighbouring South Australia and New South Wales (NSW).\nIt was followed by two aftershocks of 4.0 and 3.1 magnitude.\nWhile this is one of Australia's largest earthquakes in recent years, it has not caused significant damage.\nSpeaking from the US, Mr Morrison noted earthquakes were uncommon in Australia and they \"can be a very, very disturbing event\".\nVictoria's State Emergency Service warned residents to be alert for possible aftershocks.\n\"If you are located in Victoria, you are in danger. Expect aftershocks, stay away from damaged buildings and other hazards. Avoid driving, except for emergencies,\" the authority said.\nSurgeon Sameer Thakur said he had been performing a heart bypass operation in Geelong, near Melbourne, when the quake hit.\n\"We're sort of in the crux of the operation and we just felt the whole operating table move,\" he told BBC Newsday. \n\"Looking around the room, all the IV poles were moving and some of the clamps that we have, they were all shaking.\" \nHe said \"fortunately we were at a stage where we could come to a halt\" until the shaking stopped, allowing them to complete the surgery.\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation shared a clip of its breakfast TV presenters reacting in the studio as the earthquake hit.\n\"Is it an earthquake or a structural thing?\" presenter Michael Rowland was later shown asking producers. \"Let's go\u2026 that was a big one.\"\nSeveral high-rise towers and a city hospital were also briefly evacuated, residents reported. Some city tram lines had been suspended due to damage.\nSouth Australia Premier Stephen Marshall said his state had felt aftershocks. \nOne federal MP, Michael McCormack, said the \"ground [was] shaking violently\" in Wagga Wagga, NSW.\nLarge earthquakes are uncommon in Australia because the continent lies centrally on a tectonic plate.\nThis quake struck at a shallow depth of 10km (6.5 miles), according to Geosciences Australia. It was initially measured at 6.0 magnitude before being revised to 5.9.\nThe geoscience agency says Australia experiences a potentially damaging earthquake - defined as above 6.0 magnitude - about every 10 years. \nMelbourne, the country's second largest city, is home to about five million people.\nThe city is currently in lockdown due to a recent wave of coronavirus cases."

      "tags": "Companies,Ofgem,Energy industry,Kwasi Kwarteng,CO\u2082 shortage",
      "text": "The cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has told the BBC.\nIt comes as energy firm Green said it was on the brink of collapse due to soaring wholesale gas prices.\n\"As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up\", Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem chief executive said.\nThe government has said it is looking at lending money to bigger firms to help them take on stranded customers.\nIf an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a tariff agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust.\nMr Brearley said protecting customers of failed energy firms was the regulator's \"number one priority\".\nHowever, he said it was too early to predict how expensive it would be to ensure that they were transferred to other suppliers in an orderly way.\nPeter McGirr, founder and chief executive of Green, told the BBC it had appointed a restructuring firm in an attempt to survive the current crisis.\nMr McGirr said the firm was in \"deep, deep trouble and our heads are unlikely to bob back to the surface\".\nGreen has 180 staff based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has 250,000 UK customers.\nMr McGirr said the appointment of Alvarez and Marsal was currently on an \"advisory and restructuring\" basis, but admitted Green could fall into administration within weeks.\n\"We need to try to hold on long enough to get some support\", he added.\nThe company has been in discussions with the government and energy regulator Ofgem, but has not been offered any support.\nMr McGirr said he believed the larger energy suppliers had too much influence in the crisis talks being held with government and said the big companies had an interest in more of the smaller suppliers going to the wall.\nAsked whether these costs would be met by the taxpayer, or spread across all energy customers' bills, he said: \"We have to first of all make sure that customers are transferred and looked after and then as we see the market evolve we will understand better the cost implications.\"\nCustomers on some tariffs are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas.\nThe price cap covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland.\nMr Brearley said it was too early to predict how much the energy price cap would rise next year.\nSo far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, including People's Energy and Utility Point, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days.\nIndustry sources fear there may be as few as 10 energy suppliers left by the end of the year, down from 70 in January.\nBut Mr Brearley predicted that a number of small suppliers would survive the current crisis, as well as larger ones, maintaining a diverse market with plenty of choice for consumers. \nWhen asked if Ofgem was \"asleep at the wheel\" and should have prevented suppliers from making promises to customers which they wouldn't be able to keep if prices rose, Mr Brearley replied: \"No - we have always protected customers interests and we work very closely with the companies.  \n\"We work closely with all companies to assess their financial position. And if they need to exit the market we have well-rehearsed systems and processes to manage that.\" \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng earlier denied that failed energy companies would get government bailouts, saying: \"I do not think it's the right thing for taxpayers' money to be injected into companies that have been badly run.\"\nHowever, he said the government was exploring the possibility of lending money to bigger energy firms to help them absorb the cost of taking on new customers from companies that had gone bust.\n\"If we do have this policy, they will be expected to pay back the loans,\" he added.\nMr Kwarteng also warned many UK households could face a \"very difficult winter\", with fuel prices surging and the \u00a320-a-week temporary uplift in universal credit due to end in October.  \nThe government and Ofgem have both dismissed suggestions that the cap on energy prices would be lifted ahead of an agreed 12% rise in October, saying that keeping it was the \"clear and agreed position\". \nThe price cap is reviewed twice a year. It applies only to standard variable or default tariffs. These types of tariff are typically the most expensive plan that a supplier offers. \nWhen fixed energy deals expire, as they generally do after one or two years, customers are likely to be put on these tariffs.\nRead more about the next best steps to take here.\nMr Brearley said the industry had seen \"an unprecedented rise in gas prices\".\n\"They are almost four times what they normally are and that would put any industry under strain,\" he added.\nThe government and Ofgem say the UK does not have gas supply problems because of a diverse range of sources \"that can more than meet demand\".\nHowever, energy bills are facing particular pressures in Great Britain because of a dip in renewable energy supplies due to low wind, as well as the outage of a power cable supplying electricity from France.\nThe International Energy Agency has called on Russia to supply more gas to Europe, saying \"it could do more to increase gas availability to Europe and ensure storage is filled to adequate levels\", in preparation for the winter.\nIt added: \"Based on the available information, Russia is fulfilling its long-term contracts with European counterparts - but its exports to Europe are down from their 2019 level.\n\"This is also an opportunity for Russia to underscore its credentials as a reliable supplier to the European market.\"\nStacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity.\nShe saved \u00a3300 - or so she thought. \nHer new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year.\n\"It is just like watching the meter go up and up,\" she says. \"I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record.\""

      "text": "Stars from Sex and the City have paid tribute to the late Willie Garson, who appeared with them in the HBO series as talent agent Stanford Blatch.\nKim Cattrall said the actor's death at the age of 57 was \"a terribly sad loss to the SATC family\".\nCattrall's former co-star Cynthia Nixon also paid tribute, remembering him on Twitter as \"a source of light, friendship and show business lore\".\n\"We are bereft without him,\" added Kristin Davis, who played Charlotte.\n\"He was smarter and funnier than you ever would have imagined,\" continued the actress.\nBen Stiller, Jason Alexander and other actors have also posted messages.\nStiller said Garson had been \"strong and respected in his community of fellow actors\", while Seinfeld star Alexander remembered him as \"a dear, funny, kind man and delightful actor\".\nIn Sex and the City, Garson played a close friend and confidante of Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw, a role he had recently been reprising in the spin-off series And Just Like That.\nHe also appeared in the show's two feature films, while his other roles included the conman Mozzie in the TV series White Collar.\nNixon - Miranda Hobbes in Sex and the City - said she was \"deeply, deeply sad\" to have lost such \"a consummate professional\".\n\"We all loved him and adored working with him,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"He was endlessly funny on-screen and in real life.\"\nCattrall, who appeared in the Sex and the City series and films as Samantha Jones, posted a photo of herself with \"dear Willie\" in her Twitter tribute.\nThe actor was described as \"a gift from the gods\" by Mario Cantone, who played Garson's on-screen partner Anthony Marentino in the show.\nHe was also remembered by Evan Handler, aka Harry Goldenblatt, as \"a prince, the Mayor of every group he existed within [and] a consummate funny man.\"\nBorn William Garson Paszamant in New Jersey in 1964, Garson studied theatre and received a masters of fine arts from Yale School of Drama.\nHe then took on small roles in several popular television series in the 1980s, including Cheers, Family Ties and LA Law.\nGarson went on to appear in such 1990s shows as The X-Files, Boy Meets World and Friends before making his Sex and the City debut in 1998.\nHis film credits include Groundhog Day, There's Something About Mary and Fever Pitch, the 2005 US adaptation of Nick Hornby's football-based novel.\nThe cause of his death has not been disclosed.\nMichael Patrick King, the executive producer of Sex and the City and its spin-off, said Garson had been working \"even while he was sick\".\n\"His spirit and his dedication to his craft was present every day,\" he said in a statement. \"His multitude of gifts as an actor and person will be missed by everyone.\"\nActor Matt Bomer, who appeared with Garson in White Collar, said he would love his former co-star forever, adding: \"Rest in peace my friend.\"\nWriter and producer Bryan Fuller also paid tribute, saying it had been \"a delight\" to work with the actor on his 2000s TV series Pushing Daisies.\nGarson was a strong advocate for adoption. His son Nathen, whom he adopted in 2009, said he had been \"so proud\" of his father on Instagram. \n\"I'm so glad you got to share all your adventures with me and were able to accomplish so much,\" he said. \"I will always love you, but I think it's time for you to go on an adventure of your own.\"\nIn her tribute, Davis said she first met Garson in 1995 \"on the spooky night-time set of The X-Files\" and remembered how he had \"immediately\" made her laugh.\n\"But I really want to pay tribute to his fearless commitment to single fatherhood,\" she continued. \"We spoke about being single parents through adoption often. And nothing gave him more joy and pride than his son Nathen.\n\"I am thankful for all of the time we had and grateful that so much of your bright light is on film forever.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Covid-19: US to donate 500 million more jabs and Covid passport legal challenge in Scotland",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nUS President Joe Biden has promised to donate an extra 500 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine to developing countries from next year. It brings the total commitment from the US to more than a billion jabs. Experts say about 11 billion doses are needed to vaccinate at least 70% of the world's population, however. And a World Health Organization target for 40% of the population in every country to be vaccinated by the end of the year is unlikely to be met. Only two per cent of people in low income countries have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, according to data from the University of Oxford.\nWarning of \"serious flaws\" in the plans for vaccine passports, an organisation representing nightclubs said it has instructed lawyers to challenge the Scottish government. The Night Time Industries Association Scotland says requiring proof that someone has had two vaccine doses to enter a nightclub from October was likely to be unlawful because the measure was disproportionate and lower levels of intervention could have achieved the same result. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was a \"reasonable thing to do\" that would stop the spread of the virus and keep venues open.\nWhen the UK published a list of recognised vaccines for travel to the UK -omitting Covishield, the Indian-made version of the Oxford-AstraZenenca vaccine - it triggered a firestorm of protest. One opposition MP said the decision was \"bizarre\" as the vaccine was developed in the UK and the Indian-made version has been administered in Britain. Now the UK government has amended its guidance to clarify that Covishield is an approved jab. But although the vaccine given to hundreds of millions of Indians is recognised, the UK has not included India on the list of countries whose fully vaccinated travellers no longer need to quarantine on arrival.\nThe Yorkshire Ripper, one of the UK's most notorious serial killers, refused measures to shield him from Covid before he died with the disease in prison, an inquest heard. Peter Sutcliffe was more vulnerable to the virus due to his diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease. The 74-year-old was advised to shield by staff at HMP Frankland, where he was serving a life sentence for the murder of 13 women, but declined measures such as eating apart at mealtimes. Concluding that Sutcliffe's death in November last year was from natural causes, coroner Crispin Oliver said he hoped his victims \"may better rest in peace\" now.\nA new Covid therapy made with the help of a llama named Fifi shows \"significant potential\", scientists say. It's made of nanobodies - smaller, simpler versions of antibodies which llamas and camels produce in response to infection. The llama was injected with a vaccine which starts the nanobody production. Scientists at the University of Reading then picked out and purified the most potent ones from a sample of Fifi's blood and grew them in large quantities. Lab tests on animals suggested it was among the most potent coronavirus-fighting agents Public Health England had ever tested. Scientists hope it could eventually be given as a nasal spray to treat early infection - or even prevent it. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nWith vaccination of 12- to 15-year-olds beginning this week, here's what you need to know about jabs and younger people.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Spotify,Streaming,Music",
      "text": "Abba star Bjorn Ulvaeus has launched a campaign to ensure musicians don't miss out on millions of pounds in royalties.\nCalled Credits Due, the scheme aims to ensure all songwriters and musicians are correctly identified when a song is recorded.\nAt present, missing and incomplete data means that about \u00a3500m is unallocated or misallocated globally every year.\n\"It happens frequently,\" Ulvaeus told the BBC. \"Which means that streaming services don't know who to pay.\"\nThe scheme will also ensure fans see the correct credits for songs - from the writers and producers to the session musicians and engineers.\n\"We want to get back to that experience we had when we opened a double-sleeved LP and listened to the songs while reading the liner notes,\" Ulvaeus explained. \"I think that's a very valuable experience that young listeners today are missing.\"\nThe scheme will ensure that every person who is involved in the creation of a song will be \"clickable in the digital liner notes\", allowing you to look up every other record they have worked on.\n\"Every new person that walks into the recording studio will be registered,\" Ulvaeus said. \"So, even in a symphony orchestra, every member will be clickable.\"\nThe Abba star launched the scheme at Tuesday's Ivor Novello Awards in London - which recognise the contribution of songwriters. Among the attendees, there was widespread support for the idea.\n\"I think it's really important because there's lots of people behind the scenes that don't get the credit they deserve,\" said singer Emeli Sande.\n\"You've got musicians that have practised and refined their art for their whole lives - so yeah, I'm very happy to support Bjorn.\"\nSongwriter MNEK, who has penned hits for Little Mix and Beyonc\u00e9 and scored his own number one single last year with Head and Heart, said: \"I think it highlights that more that goes into making music, than just being a pop star.\"\nThe Credits Due campaign tackles one of the most boring, broken, complex and crucial problems facing the music industry: metadata. \nWhen a song is released, either on CD and vinyl or on a streaming service like Spotify, it includes a huge amount of underlying information, including titles, alternative titles, featured artists, songwriter and producer names, publishers, and much more. \nThat information needs to be synchronised with databases around the world to make sure the right people get paid when a song is streamed, bought or played.\nOften, that doesn't happen - and with 60,000 new songs uploaded to Spotify every day, the problem is growing. \"Can you imagine what a mess it is?\" asked Ulvaeus.\nThe new scheme is backed by The Ivors Academy for songwriters and The Music Rights Awareness Foundation, which Ulvaeus founded with songwriters Max Martin and Niclas Molinder in 2016.\nTogether they are launching an app to help songwriters, producers and record labels gather all the necessary data before a song is released.\n\"It's in the interest of all these people to get it right,\" said Ulvaeus. \"Today, in 2021, there's really no excuse.\"\nThe star was speaking three weeks after Abba unveiled their comeback - with a new album and a virtual tour that will launch in the UK next May.\nTheir return, after a 39-year break, was met with a rapturous reception around the world. Two new singles, Don't Shut Me Down and I Still Have Faith In You, entered the UK top 20, while the Abba Voyage album broke pre-sale records.\n\"I didn't anticipate it being so global,\" said Ulvaeus. \"How that happened, I don't know. But I'm very grateful.\"\nHe explained that the concert will feature a mixture of live music and pre-recorded elements, with a live band augmenting the \"Abba avatars\" on stage.\nSome of the songs may sound different - singers Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad now sing \"one tone lower than they used to\" - but he said the group \"laughed all the time\" during rehearsals.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Ashford,Prisons,UK prisons",
      "text": "An 18-year-old inmate who lost her baby at Europe's largest women's prison should never have given birth alone in her cell, according to a critical report from inspectors.\nThe baby died in September 2019 at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey.\nThe Prisons and Probation Ombudsman report found a series of failings in the teenager's treatment.\nThe prison said it was \"deeply sorry\" and that it would implement recommendations from the report.\nThe investigation, which was commissioned by the Justice Secretary, found the mother, known as Ms A, pressed her cell bell twice and asked for a nurse, but nobody came.\nAn hour later, at 21:30 BST, a prison officer shone a torch in her cell and said she did not see anything out of the ordinary.\nMs A told investigators she was on all fours at the time.\nShe described being in constant pain and unable to reach the cell bell. \nThe teenager then passed out and said when she awoke her daughter had been born but she was not breathing. \nA pathologist was unable to determine whether her baby girl was born alive or was stillborn, the report said.\n\"Ms A gave birth alone in her cell overnight without medical assistance,\" said the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, Sue McAllister.\n\"Overall the healthcare offered to her was not equivalent to that she could have expected in the community.\"\nThe report found staff working on her block weren't aware that Ms A was due to give birth imminently, and information sharing between Bronzefield and health agencies was poor.\nNo-one had a full history of Ms A's pregnancy.\nThe ombudsman set out a raft of recommendations for all the agencies involved, including the prison and Ashford and St. Peter's Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which dealt with Ms A during her pregnancy.\nMs A, who was in prison for the first time on a robbery charge, had a troubled childhood, the report stated.\nShe had refused to engage with most ante-natal care and feared her baby would be taken away.\nMs McAllister said: \"We consider that all pregnancies in prison should be treated as high risk.\n\"There is likely to be a higher percentage of 'avoidant' mothers who have experienced trauma and who are fearful of engaging with maternity care.\"\nVicky Robinson, the director of the prison, which is operated by Sodexo Justice Services, said: \"This was tragic and extremely sad. We are deeply sorry that this has happened and our thoughts throughout have been with the family. \n\"A number of recommendations have been made and we have been absolutely dedicated to working closely with all agencies to collectively address these and ensure the actions needed to be taken have been taken.\"\nFollowing the baby's death, The Ministry of Justice said additional welfare observations for women in their third trimester have been implemented, along with free phone access to NHS pregnancy advice services.\nThe Deputy Prime Minister and the newly appointed Justice Secretary, Dominic Raab, said improvements had been put in place to ensure that women in custody received the same level of support.\n\"These events are harrowing, unacceptable and should never happen to any woman or child. My deepest condolences remain with those affected,\" he said.\nSuzanne Rankin, the chief executive of Ashford and St. Peter's Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, apologised and said further action would be taken following the report.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "title": "Major record labels could face competition inquiry",
      "text": "The UK's major record labels could face an inquiry into whether their practices are distorting the music market.\nThe government has written to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) asking it to consider an investigation into Sony, Warner and Universal Music.\nIt has also asked the watchdog to consider YouTube's dominance over the streaming market.\nThe move comes after MPs demanded a \"complete reset\" of the music industry, amid \"pitiful returns\" for artists.\nThe Culture Select Committee issued the call in a damning report this summer, after hearing evidence from musicians such as Nile Rodgers, Elbow and Radiohead in a six-month inquiry into music streaming.\nJulian Knight, who chairs the committee, said while streaming had \"brought significant profits to the recorded-music industry, the talent behind it - performers, songwriters and composers - are losing out\".\nHe called for the CMA to investigate the commercial power wielded by major record labels, expressing concern they receive beneficial placement on playlists and storefronts at the expense of independent labels and self-releasing artists.\nIn an official response, the government said there \"may be value\" in such a market study but it was up to the CMA to decide whether to pursue it. \nA spokesperson for the watchdog told the BBC that \"initial proposals\" for an investigation would be considered at its board meeting next month. \nThe British Phonographic Industry (BPI), which represents the UK's recorded-music industry, said it would comply with any resulting inquiry. \n\"Should the CMA conduct a study, we look forward to detailing labels' role in supercharging the careers of British talent within a complex and dynamic ecosystem,\" it said.\nThe culture committee's report, issued in July, was ultimately critical of the UK music industry. \nWhile streaming had helped save the music industry, after two decades of illegal downloads, record labels and streaming companies had subsequently \"leveraged structural advantages to achieve seemingly unassailable positions\" in their markets, it said.\nIn its response, the government said the select committee's inquiry had provided \"invaluable insights\" into music streaming but \"there is still work to be done to understand the problems musicians are facing\".\nIt called for more research into the way musicians were paid and royalties shared, saying it would \"assess different models\" to see how they would affect the industry, including \"equitable remuneration\" - where labels and artists receive an equal share of streaming royalties, in contrast to the current arrangement, where artists receive about 16%.\nThe government also said it wanted to \"explore ways in which new and upcoming songwriters [and] composers\" could be paid more fairly. \nThe MPs' report noted writers received particularly poor revenues from streaming services, after pop composer Fiona Bevan revealed she had earned just \u00a3100 for a track on Kylie Minogue's number-one album Disco. \n\"Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers,\" she told the inquiry. \"It's quite shameful\"\nIn its response, the government said it would work with Credit's Due - an initiative launched by Abba's Bjorn Ulvaeus - to ensure writers receive proper credit and remuneration for songs they worked on.\nIt also agreed that the role of curators who make playlists on services such as Spotify and Apple Music warranted further investigation. \nWhile the select committee recommended intro using a \"code of conduct\" to avoid bribes and favouritism, the government said it would gather more evidence to decide \"the case for further intervention\". \nMr Knight welcomed the government's response, saying: \"Our inquiry into music streaming exposed fundamental problems within the structure of the music industry itself. \n\"It is testimony to all those who gave evidence to our inquiry that the government has acknowledged our report as a 'key moment' for the music industry.\n\"Within days we expect to see the government's own research published into the pitiful earning of creators in this digital age and hope it will corroborate what artists and musicians told us. \n\"We will be monitoring the outcome and what tangible steps the government pledges to take to redress this unfairness and reward the talent behind the music.\" \nThe BPI said: \"We welcome government's recognition of the need for a better understanding of the complexity of the music-streaming market\".\nWorking together to address areas of concern was  \"preferable to legislative intervention\", it said, warning new regulations could jeopardise the industry's \"hard won return to growth after years of decline\".\nFollow us on Facebook or Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

An investigation is under way. \nThe MoD has apologised and said extra support was being offered to them.\nIn the latest data breach to be uncovered, defence officials sent an email that had the email addresses and some names of 55 people which could be seen by everyone who was sent the message.\nThe recipients - at least one of whom is from the Afghan National Army - were told UK relocation officials had been unable to contact them and they were asked to update their details.\nAn MoD spokeswoman said: \"We have been made aware of a data breach that occurred earlier this month by the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (Arap) team. \n\"This week, the defence secretary instigated an investigation into data handling within that team.\n\"Steps have now been taken to ensure this does not happen in the future.\" \nIt comes just a day after the defence secretary apologised for a separate breach involving the email addresses of dozens of Afghan interpreters who worked for British forces.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said it had been \"an unacceptable level of service\" that had let down thousands of members of the armed forces and veterans.\nMore than 250 people seeking relocation to the UK - many of whom are in hiding - were mistakenly copied into the email.\nTheir email addresses could be seen by all recipients, showing people's names and some associated profile pictures.\nMr Wallace said an investigation had been launched and one official suspended. \nDefence sources told the BBC that Mr Wallace did not know about this second breach when he spoke in the Commons on Tuesday.\nFormer Conservative defence minister Johnny Mercer, who served in Afghanistan, said he feared there may be more to come.\n\"I've been concerned from the start as to how these individuals have been treated - the whole thing was such a rush to the door when Kabul fell that these mistakes were inevitable,\" he said. \n\"I personally think we've taken out people we really shouldn't have, and failed to bring out the majority of those we should - I think we are only beginning to learn the scale of what has gone on here.\"\nOn Tuesday, Labour shadow defence secretary John Healey welcomed the defence secretary's apology but told the Commons that action now mattered most.\nAdditional reporting by Marie Jackson."

      "tags": "China,Climate change,United States",
      "text": "China will not build new coal-fire projects abroad, a move that could be pivotal in tackling global emissions.\nPresident Xi Jinping made the announcement in his address at the United Nations General Assembly.\nChina has been funding coal projects in countries like Indonesia and Vietnam under a massive infrastructure project known as the Belt and Road initiative.\nBut it has been under pressure to end the financing, as the world tries to meet Paris climate agreement targets.\n\"China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad,\" Mr Xi said in a video recording at the annual summit.\nNo further details were provided, but the move could limit the expansion of coal plants in many developing countries under China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). \nThe BRI has seen China fund trains, roads, ports and coal plants in numerous countries, many of them developing nations. For the first time in several years however, it did not fund any coal projects in the first half of 2021. \nChina is also the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter and is heavily reliant on coal for domestic energy needs.\nMr Xi mentioned promises made last year about China achieving peak emissions before 2030 and then transitioning to carbon neutrality by 2060.\nThe US Climate Envoy John Kerry welcomed the announcement, saying in a statement that he was \"absolutely delighted to hear that President Xi has made this important decision\". \nThe head of the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference due to be held in Scotland next month also applauded the news.\n\"It is clear the writing is on the wall for coal power. I welcome President Xi's commitment to stop building new coal projects abroad - a key topic of my discussions during my visit to China,\" Alok Sharma said on Twitter.\nThis is the announcement that China has increasingly been expected to make. \nFor nearly a decade now coal fired power stations have been a key feature of Xi Jinping's awkwardly named Belt and Road Initiative of foreign investment.  \nHowever, the reality is that the number of these projects has fallen significantly. \nCrucial details will need to be cleared up; when will this take effect? Will it cover new power plants approved but not yet built? Will China also stop financing new coal fired power stations abroad? \nThis is progress, but it's the low hanging fruit in terms of China's addiction to coal. \nHalf the coal burned in the world is burned in China. It is still adding numerous new coal power plants at home, with a lifespan of 40 to 50 years. \nThe biggest question remains: When will this country start to cut the overall number within its borders and substantially reduce its dependency on the most polluting form of power generation?\nMr Xi's address came after US President Joe Biden gave his maiden speech at the United Nations during which he urged countries to work together as never before to tackle global problems such as climate change and the pandemic.\nMr Biden also said that democracy would not be defeated by authoritarianism, but refrained from mentioning China by name.\n\"The future will belong to those who give their people the ability to breathe free, not those who seek to suffocate their people with an iron hand,\" Mr Biden said.\n\"We all must call out and condemn the targeting and oppression of racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, whether it occurs in Xinjiang or northern Ethiopia, or anywhere in the world,\" he added, referring to the western Chinese region where China is accused of using forced labour.\nRelations between the US and China are at an all time low over issues including trade, human rights and the origins of Covid-19.\nIn his address, Mr Xi said that China had peaceful intentions in international relations.\nBut he also seemed to address the tensions and the formation of alliances in the region like the \"Quad\" grouping, made up of Australia, the US, India and Japan, saying there was a need to \"reject the practice of forming small circles or zero-sum games\".

      "tags": "Russian spy poisoning,Amesbury Novichok poisoning,Salisbury",
      "text": "Police say they have identified another suspect in the Salisbury Novichok attacks, which left three people critically ill and one dead.\nFormer Russian agent Sergei Skripal, his daughter Yulia and a police officer, Nick Bailey, were exposed to the substance in 2018. \nDawn Sturgess died after finding a perfume bottle with it in months later.\nSecurity sources now believe a senior Russian agent, Denis Sergeev, was the on-the-ground commander.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said that all three suspects \"should be handed over for justice\".\nDetectives had previously named two Russian intelligence officers as suspects.\nAnatoliy Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin have long been alleged to have smeared the military-grade nerve agent Novichok on the handle of former GRU officer Sergei Skripal's front door.\nThey believe the group belonged to a team from the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service. Sergeev has also been linked to other covert activity across Europe. \nBut Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the UK was using the case as \"a tool to put pressure on our country\", adding: \"We decisively reject all of London's attempt to blame Moscow for what happened in Salisbury.\"\nThe Crown Prosecution Service has now authorised charges, but the suspects cannot be formally charged unless they are arrested.\nAll three are thought to be in Russia.\nNick Price, head of the special crime and counter terrorism division at the CPS, said there was \"sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction\" and that it was in the public interest to charge Sergeev.\nProsecutors were working with police to bring the attackers to justice \"where possible\" but Russia has made clear it does not extradite its citizens, he said.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel told the House of Commons that if any of the suspects travelled outside Russia, the UK would \"take every possible step to detain and extradite them\" and would be \"relentless in the pursuit of justice\".\nShe said the poisoning was \"an appalling event that shook the entire country and united our allies in condemnation\", but said it was not the first time Russia had committed \"a brazen attack in the UK\" - referring to the European Court of Human Rights' judgement on the killing of Alexander Litvinenko.\nNone of the three suspects in Salisbury are likely to ever face a British court. Russia has consistently denied any involvement and says it does not extradite its citizens. \nThis was the same problem UK authorities faced after the killing of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. \nBut there are other reasons these investigations matter. The UK's government response after Litvinenko was seen as weak and falling to do enough to respond and deter Russia. \nIt now hopes public accusations backed by evidence will help build international pressure on Moscow and encourage other states to also carry out their own investigations. \nThis year, the revelations about the GRU's alleged role in a Czech explosion led to the expulsion of diplomats, who were thought to be undercover spies. \nThe UK and its allies also responded with expulsions after Salisbury and it hopes that exposure and retaliation will disrupt and deter Russia's ability to carry out such operations overseas.\nOn 2 March 2018, the alleged GRU hit team came to the UK. \nTwo men, using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, arrived in the afternoon at Gatwick airport. Police have now for the first time confirmed their real names as Anatoliy Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin. \nThe third man, Denis Sergeev, using the name Sergey Fedotov, had arrived at Heathrow airport earlier that day at 11:00 GMT. \nChepiga and Mishkin travelled to Salisbury on Sunday 4 March. \nSergei Skripal and his daughter fell seriously ill later that day, as did Nick Bailey, then a police officer.\nSergeev remained in London the whole time before leaving on a flight to Moscow at 13:45, having made a late change to his plans. The other two left on a later flight at 22:30.\nPolice say they now have evidence the men were operating as a team and that all three met on a number of occasions in London over that weekend. \nOn some occasions, this was indoors, on others it was in the open air - although the police will not specify exactly where.\nDawn Sturgess died in nearby Amesbury in July 2018. Her partner Charlie Rowley had found what he believed was a discarded bottle of perfume, and given it to her. But it contained Novichok.\nPre-inquest hearings into her death, presided over by former High Court judge Baroness Hallett, are due to resume this week. Charlie Rowley became seriously ill, but survived.\nThe role and identity of Sergeev had been previously disclosed by the investigative site Bellingcat in February 2019 and some of his movements and phone contacts were detailed in a joint investigation with the BBC, including his proximity to Paddington, Oxford Circus and Embankment. \nBut the police have been working on building up evidence of his role, a process described as \"challenging\" but which has eventually led to today's announcement.\n\"We remain as determined as ever to bring those responsible to justice,\" said Dean Haydon, assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan Police and senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing. \nThe charges authorised against the three men are conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, causing grievous bodily harm and use and possession of a chemical weapon.\nChepiga and Mishkin appeared on Russian TV after being identified in 2018 and said they had been to the city simply as tourists to see the cathedral. Russia has always denied any involvement.\nTraces of Novichok were found in Chepiga and Mishkin's hotel room, although none were found in that used by Sergeev. \nThe Novichok in the perfume bottle could potentially have killed thousands of people, police say. \nBut there remain significant gaps in the investigation, including how the Novichok came into the UK and where it was between its use in March and its discovery in the perfume bottle in June. \nThe police are asking the public to get in touch if they have any more details of Sergeev's movements in London or that of the perfume bottle. \nIf Sergeev and the other two suspects leave Russia, UK authorities will inform Interpol to seek their arrest.\n\"We now have the evidence that links them to the GRU,\" Mr Haydon said. \"All three are dangerous individuals.\"\nIntelligence also links Sergeev and the team to a trail of covert activities across Europe.\nSergeev is alleged to be a major general and senior member of Unit 29155 of the GRU, a team tasked with sabotage, subversion and assassination. He joined the team after serving in Russian special forces. \nBulgarian authorities say Sergeev and two other men from Unit 29155 checked into hotels in the capital Sofia in April 2015, insisting on rooms with a view of the underground car park. \nSurveillance of that car park released by a Bulgarian prosecutor shows one man approaching the cars of a Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev, as well as his son and business partner. \nA toxic substance is believed to have been smeared on the handles - similar to the way Novichok was placed on the handle of Sergei Skripal's house. They would fall ill but survive.\nAlthough he had a return flight booked two days later, Sergeev left the country on 28 April - the day of the poisoning. He may be the man caught on CCTV in the car park.\nChepiga and Mishkin, meanwhile, have been linked to a blast that tore apart an ammunition storage depot used by Emilian Gebrev in a forest in the Czech Republic on 16 October 2014, killing two.\nOn 11 October 2014, the men used the same cover identities they used in Salisbury - Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov - to arrive at Prague airport before staying near the depot and then leaving on the day of the explosion.\nThe accusation by Czech authorities this summer led to a major diplomatic row with Russia and the expulsion of diplomats from a number of countries.\nIt followed investigative work by European security services who, since Salisbury, have tracked the travel of the three suspects as well as others from the unit to see if they can link it with covert activity. \nFor Sergeev, this includes visits to Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria as well as other countries. \nHe is also believed to have been in touch with members of the GRU unit involved in a planned coup in Montenegro in 2016.\nUK police also say they believe the three all travelled to the UK before March 2018. They say they continue to investigate other suspects.\nAdditional reporting by Joseph Lee."

      "text": "Netflix has bought the rights to Roald Dahl's classic children's books from the author's family.\nThe deal means the streaming giant will own creations like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The BFG.\nNetflix will control what happens to them in publishing as well as TV and film - and receive the royalties.\nIt will also create numerous spin-off games, stage shows and other live experiences. Neither side would reveal how much the deal is worth.\nThe takeover means The Roald Dahl Story Company - which is run by Dahl's grandson Luke Kelly and was previously owned by the family and other employees - will now become a division of Netflix.\nIt earned \u00a326m revenue from the author's work in 2019, according to its latest accounts.\nIn a joint statement, Mr Kelly and Netflix boss Ted Sarandos said they were \"joining forces to bring some of the world's most loved stories to current and future fans in creative new ways\".\nThe move builds on a deal between the streaming giant and the estate in 2018, allowing it to make animated series based on his books.\nUnder that agreement, Oscar winner Taika Waititi is currently working on a series based on the world of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Sony and Working Title are making an adaptation of Matilda The Musical.\nIn total, 19 TV shows, films, stage shows and live experiences are already in the works. \n\"These projects opened our eyes to a much more ambitious venture - the creation of a unique universe across animated and live action films and TV, publishing, games, immersive experiences, live theatre, consumer products and more,\" Mr Kelly and Mr Sarandos said.\nNetflix made the announcement by revealing its name on golden ticket hidden inside a Willy Wonka chocolate bar wrapper.\nThe back of the ticket had the words \"There is no knowing what we shall see\" - a line from James and the Giant Peach.\n\"As we bring these timeless tales to more audiences in new formats, we're committed to maintaining their unique spirit and their universal themes of surprise and kindness, while also sprinkling some fresh magic into the mix,\" Mr Kelly and Mr Sarandos added.\nAfter working as a fighter pilot in the Second World War and then as a diplomat, the Welshman turned his hand to writing novels, short stories, poems and film scripts.\nThroughout the 1960s, 70s and 80s he became known for best-selling children's books - many of which were later turned into films.\nThe writer, who died at the age of 74 in 1990, has sold 300 million books around the world, printed in 65 languages.\nThe Dahl catalogue also includes the likes of Fantastic Mr Fox, James and the Giant Peach, The Witches and The Twits.\nMr Sarandos and Mr Kelly said his stories contain \"messages of the power and possibility of young people\" and have \"never felt more pertinent\".\nA \"significant part\" of the proceeds from the sale of the company will go towards setting up a new charity involved with children's health, anti-hate and anti-racism, they said.\nIn December, Dahl's family apologised for anti-Semitic comments made by the author in interviews in 1983 and 1990.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Personal finance,Energy industry,Inflation,Oil & Gas industry,Natural gas",
      "text": "High energy prices are already causing problems for households in the UK and across Europe, but geopolitical tensions threaten to make matters even worse.\nWith an estimated 100,000 Russian troops massed on the border with Ukraine, there are fears that Vladimir Putin is poised to order an invasion.\nSurging gas prices have already caused a number of UK energy suppliers to go bust - and supply shortages are the last thing anyone needs.\nNot directly. The UK sources very little of its gas from Russia - less than 5%, in fact.\nHowever, that is not the case for the EU, which gets about half of its gas from there. \nAny Russian attempt to seize Ukrainian territory is likely to prompt economic sanctions by Western powers.\nIn response, Russia would be expected to \"weaponise\" its natural resources by cutting supplies of gas to Europe.\nThe wholesale cost of gas would then rocket, sending prices higher everywhere.\nAmong possible sanctions, there is talk of excluding Russia from cross-border payment systems, which would mean that European countries would have trouble even buying Russian gas in the first place.\nAbout half of UK gas supplies are of domestic origin, from the North Sea. The UK has been a big producer of gas since the mid-1960s, but output has fallen since 2000 and usage continues to rise.  \nAnother one-third of the UK's gas comes through pipelines from Norway. \nThe rest consists almost entirely of imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which arrive in Britain by sea from countries such as Qatar, the US and even Trinidad and Tobago.\nThe small amount of Russian gas that does reach the UK comes in LNG form.\nLNG supplies are particularly sensitive to global market prices and are sold to whoever pays the most, with China one of the keenest bidders.\nThe government says the UK's energy bill crisis is due to high global gas prices, not security of supply.\nIt says the UK has a \"diverse and secure\" range of suppliers. \nHowever, that could change quite rapidly if Russian gas becomes scarce, causing a knock-on effect as other countries scrabble for alternative supplies.\nDemand for gas is rising across Europe and some fear the UK could be physically - and perhaps politically - at the back of the queue. \nWhat's more, the UK has scant storage facilities. It's been increasingly operating a \"just-in-time model\", which means it's more affected by short-term price fluctuations in the wholesale gas market. \nThe government stresses it's \"not complacent\". \nAnd if needed, it does have the power to impose emergency measures, such as ordering big industrial customers to temporarily stop using gas.\nBut the biggest factor - the weather - is beyond its control. Our best hope for avoiding problems is if the rest of the winter turns out to be mild, breezy and wind power-friendly.\nA perfect energy storm was brewing during 2021. \nA cold winter around the world sent gas demand rising, depleting stores. \nThose reserves would normally have been replenished over the summer. But output dropped because many major producers were catching up with maintenance postponed during lockdowns. \nMeanwhile, calm weather reduced the amount of electricity generated by wind power. \nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have more than quadrupled over the past year.\nThe UK has been badly hit because it's one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas - 85% of homes use gas central heating, while gas also generates a third of our electricity. \nEven without a big freeze or a Russian supply squeeze, bills are heading up. \nHouseholds have seen their energy bills kept in check by the government's price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge, but this is due to be revised on 1 April.\nAs a result, fuel bills could increase by another 50% in the next few months, the energy industry has said.\nWhatever happens, economists say wholesale gas prices are unlikely to drop before storage facilities fill up again - and that's not likely until spring. \nRising energy prices have already contributed to a big surge in the UK's cost of living, which is increasing at rates not seen for 30 years.\nThe energy bill crisis, along with soaring food costs, drove inflation to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, up from 5.1% the month before, in another blow to struggling families.\nThe last time inflation was higher was in March 1992, when it was 7.1%.\nBusinesses too have been feeling the strain, with five business groups writing to Chancellor Rishi Sunak asking for support for firms on energy costs.\nThe rise in global wholesale gas prices has been felt across Europe.\nSome suggest Brexit has meant the UK is at a disadvantage when it comes to getting the best deal. \nWhen it was in the EU, the UK was part of the Internal Energy Market which can enable countries to access electricity more smoothly and at lower cost. \nHowever, the way gas is traded has been largely unaffected, which means leaving the EU has not had a significant impact. \nCountries that rely heavily on imported gas, such as Italy and Spain, have been particularly hard hit. Their governments have directly cut prices and raised taxes on energy company profits respectively.\nThe price cap has meant the UK's gas bills have until now been typically lower than the EU average.\nBut the rise in prices comes on top of other economic problems such as labour shortages and increasing food prices, adding up to an unwelcome rise in the cost of living."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has held talks with President Biden at the White House - but the American administration has played down the chances of brokering a separate post-Brexit free trade deal with the UK.\nBBC editors and correspondents look at the prospects of securing a stand-alone agreement with the US and ask if joining an existing North American trade pact instead is a more realistic option. \nBrexit gave the UK the freedom to strike its own trade deals - and accounting for \u00a31 in every \u00a36 of British trade, a pact with the US was the ultimate prize.\nBut Whitehall officials have for months been scrabbling for an alternative after the Biden administration indicated it was in no hurry to resume talks.\nJoining USMCA - the existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - could give the UK deeper benefits on some goods and digital trade with North American economies.\nBut it has limited coverage of what is the U.K.'s biggest strength when it comes to selling to America, namely services. \nEconomists say the overall gains from joining USMCA may be very limited, perhaps less than 0.1% of GDP\nAnd what would the price be? \nThe UK already has deals with Canada and Mexico, it would have to rely heavily on American cooperation to join this trade club - and one where the rules have already been set, and hasn't allowed for new members.\nAmerica's price of admission may include a hurdle already encountered: standards surrounding food and agricultural goods\nFor President Biden is explicit that his priority is US workers, not least its farmers.\nHe is also clear that domestic issues take precedence.\n Even if the UK does want to sign up to USMCA, it may still be at the back of a queue - simply to get its application considered.\nThe government highlights the fact that it has signed trade deals with more than 60 countries since it left the European Union. \nBut the vast majority of them are rollover deals, copying the terms of agreements it already had when it was part of the EU.  \nIt has been an achievement to have concluded these deals so quickly, but it has not added to the sum of British trade around the world. \nThe UK's deal with Japan is marginally different than the EU's, so is an updated agreement it signed in June with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. \nThe UK has also agreed a deal in principle with Australia, which the EU has not. But that agreement has yet to come into effect, and will comprise only a tiny part of overall UK trade. \nSo, that leaves the world's three largest economies.  \nTrade with China will always be fraught with difficulty for political reasons. \nPresident Biden has now confirmed what has been obvious for some time - that a free trade deal with the United States is not going to happen any time soon. \nAnd Britain chose to leave the EU and its single market, and sign a new deal which limits the access it had before.  \nAs a result, according to the EU's statistics office Eurostat, British exports to the EU in the first seven months of this year fell by more than 17% compared to the same period in 2020. \nThe coronavirus pandemic may have been an inhibiting factor for trade, but exports from all other major economies to the EU have risen. \nBetter trading opportunities and a long-term focus on fast-growing markets in Asia were arguments put forward by supporters of Brexit.\nBut leaving the EU is going to mean the UK does less trade around the world in the next few years, not more. \nWith Joe Biden and the Democrats back in charge in Washington, the US was expected to strengthen ties with Europe and put the UK, to paraphrase Barack Obama, toward the back of the queue.\nDonald Trump's focus on transactional diplomacy and penchant for one-on-one deals was out; multilateralism was again in vogue.\nThat's not exactly how things have played out, however.\nOn Tuesday morning, Biden gave a speech at the United Nations emphasising the need for collective action by the community of nations.\nBut by the evening, he was back at the White House for a one-on-one meeting with Boris Johnson, talking up a US-UK relationship that has taken on greater relevance for the Biden administration in the past few weeks.\nAlthough Johnson earlier spoke of US-UK relations that are \"as good as they have been in decades\", there are still a few bumps in the road.\nThe US seems uninterested in prioritising a new trade deal. Biden's \"we'll have to work that through\" comment on Tuesday wasn't exactly an enthusiastic response.\nThe president, who regularly boasts of his Irish heritage, has also warned of what he sees as the danger Brexit poses to stability in Northern Ireland - a point he again alluded to on Tuesday."

      "text": "More than \u00a34m on average was stolen by fraudsters every day in the UK during the first half of the year as losses skyrocketed during the pandemic.\nFraud committed when individuals are tricked into handing over money and personal details surged by 71% compared with the first six months of last year.\nLess than half of the money lost in these cases was refunded by banks.\nBanking trade body UK Finance said teenage criminals buying fraud kits online were among the con-artists.\nIn total, \u00a3754m was stolen through fraud in the first half of the year, an increase of 30% compared with the same period last year.\nWithin this total, so-called authorised push payment (APP) fraud - when victims think they are paying a genuine organisation - rose by 71% to \u00a3355m.\nThose scams can range from fake delivery texts asking for payment, which were common during the pandemic, to higher-value losses when fraudsters pretend to be solicitors during a house purchase.\nAPP fraud losses have now outstripped fraud losses on bank and credit cards for the first time. Impersonation scams more than doubled (up 123%), investment scams rose by 95% and romance scams were up 62%.\nNegotiations between banks to create a permanent, central pot of money to refund these scam victims collapsed earlier this year.\nKaty Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, said: \"We are calling for coordinated action and increased efforts from government and other sectors to tackle what is now a national security threat.\"\nRudy D'Souza, aged 18, lost the \u00a3700 left over from his government-backed Child Trust Fund to fraudsters.\n\"This money was the most important money I could have had,\" he said.\n\"I'd just moved out and got a new job. But my pay is due after my rent, so I felt really tense and like an idiot for falling for this scam.\n\"I never even heard of push payment fraud until I became a victim.\"\nBanks and police have discovered that fraudsters range from organised criminals to teenage thieves without any previous convictions operating in their bedrooms.\nChildren as young as 14 have been hired as money mules to launder stolen funds. Cryptocurrency wallets have also been used to shift money out of sight of the authorities, UK Finance said.\nIt estimated that 70% of fraud originated via online platforms, including social media, and technology bosses are being questioned by MPs on the Treasury Committee later about their efforts to prevent economic crime.\nMs Worobec said that co-ordination was needed between banks and a range of technology providers to tackle the issue, as well as raising awareness among consumers.\nHowever, the banks' and police's own efforts in stopping the rising tide of fraud will also come under the microscope, with ministers promising an overhaul in the fight against fraud."

      "tags": "Companies,Ofgem,UK economy,Energy service companies",
      "text": "Nearly 1.5 million customers have been hit in just two weeks by energy firms collapsing under soaring gas prices.\nAvro Energy and Green ceased trading on Wednesday and their 830,000 combined customers face being switched to a new, potentially more expensive, provider.\nGreen's boss, Peter McGirr, told the BBC he had done nothing wrong and said bigger firms would soon face problems.\nHowever, the government has cooled on the idea of loans to the industry, says BBC business editor Simon Jack.\nMr McGirr predicted: \"You will see larger suppliers feeling the pain as well and they will come cap in hand for a bailout.\"\nHe criticised the government for supporting US fertiliser firm CF Industries to restart its fertiliser factory, which produced carbon dioxide used in the food industry as a by-product, while allowing energy firms to fail.\nIts closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry.\n\"Why do they need a bailout and we don't?\" he asked.\nHe apologised to staff and customers, but said: \"I don't think we did anything wrong as a supplier.\"\nSmall business minister Paul Scully told the BBC that the government had not treated CF Industries and Green in the same way because there were \"different solutions to different problems\".\nHe said there was \"a mature system\" in place to deal with the collapse of energy firms, \"protecting customers both in continuity of supply and prices\".\nMr McGirr's comments came amid signs of a change of direction in government policy on the energy crisis.\nThe BBC's Simon Jack says that while the government had been talking of state-backed loans for larger energy firms, that idea is now \"very much on the back burner\" and its intention is to \"tough this one out\".\nThe BBC has been told that ministers believe the current system for managing the failure of energy companies, which allows companies to recoup losses through an industry-wide levy, is working satisfactorily, even though it will add costs to millions of customers' bills.\nOur business editor says ministers do accept that the existing system of reallocating customers would not work if one of the bigger challenger firms went bust. \nIn that case, the government has the power to appoint a special administrator, in what would be a quasi-temporary nationalisation.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is having daily calls with the chief executive of Ofgem to monitor which firm might be next, a government spokesperson said.\nIt is not yet clear which supplier will take on the 580,000 customers from Avro Energy, the biggest firm to fail so far. Regulator Ofgem has also not yet appointed a new provider for Green customers either.\nAll affected customers will still receive energy while a new supplier is appointed by Ofgem.\nNeil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem, said its \"number one priority is to protect customers\".\nThe regulator's price cap, which covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland, protects customers on some tariffs by limiting how much firms can charge per unit of gas.\nBut providers have complained that they are unable to pass on rising costs to customers because of the cap on energy bills.\nThe plight of Avro customers is a good illustration of what may befall hundreds of thousands of people in the coming weeks.\nAn Avro customer in a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity, who got a fixed rate deal in August, would have been paying \u00a31,087 a year, according to price comparison site Uswitch. In March, they could have got a deal costing \u00a3920 a year.\nNow Avro has collapsed, they are likely to be paying \u00a31,277 a year at their new supplier from 1 October, in line with Ofgem's price cap.\nThe price cap does not mean it is impossible to pay more than \u00a31,277 a year. It is a cap on the price, not the final bill.\nThat figure is an illustration of the cap's effect on a gas and electricity customer's annual bill, assuming they have an average level of energy consumption. So, a household with heavy energy use will have a higher annual bill.\nPrice comparison site Uswitch has acknowledged there is currently no point in energy customers shopping around.\nJustina Miltienyte, the site's energy policy expert, said: \"Rising wholesale costs are putting a big strain on suppliers, which has had a knock-on effect on the value of the deals available in the market.\n\"What we're able to offer is constantly changing and will vary by customer. \n\"If you are coming to the end of your fixed deal, our advice is to hold tight, stay put and be rolled over on to your supplier's standard variable rate. Your supplier may try to offer you a new fixed deal, but this is unlikely to be the best option right now. \n\"However, people can leave their contact details so we could contact them once the situation improves. They can still head to Uswitch.com to compare deals across the whole of the energy market.\"\nOne Green customer, 52-year-old Sara Pilgrim of North Lincolnshire, switched to the firm just a week ago.\n\"My contract switched on the 16 September. I went from E.On. I was with Npower, who transferred to E.On,\" she told the BBC. \n\"When my contract was due to renew a couple of weeks ago, E.On had really hiked their prices up.\n\"I went around and looked at different companies. Green weren't the lowest, but I decided to go with them.\n\"How can they have been allowed to take on new contracts that close to them going bust? They must have known something was going on six days ago.\n\"I'm just angry really that they've been allowed to do that. You know if you have to cease trading. That's my gripe really, that they've been allowed to take on new contracts so close to them ceasing trading.\"\nSince wholesale gas prices have started to spike, a number of firms have collapsed.\nPeople's Energy, Utility Point, PfP Energy and MoneyPlus Energy ceased trading in September.\nThese smaller companies, including Avro Energy and Green Supplier Limited, account for more than 5% of the UK energy market - about 1.5 million customers. \nRead more about the next best steps to take here.\nOther small companies could fold in the coming days and weeks.\nIgloo, for example, has said it is working with restructuring consultants Alvarez & Marsal, although it told the BBC it had not appointed administrators. Bulb, the UK's sixth largest energy company with 1.7 million customers, is also seeking additional financing.\nDame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, told the BBC there had been a big increase in people seeking their help.\n\"We're seeing people come to us because they're seeing family finances being really squeezed,\" she added.\nSmaller providers launched in recent years have been overwhelmed by a spike in the cost of wholesale gas prices as economies have reopened from lockdowns and high demand from Asia pushed down supplies to Europe.\nGas prices are rising all across Europe, but Britain has also been affected by lower winds than usual - denting renewable energy supplies - as well as a recent fire at a National Grid site in Kent.\nIn the UK, firms had already been hit by a jump in costs even before the recent spike. From more than 70 suppliers in 2018, there are just over 30 now.\nIndustry sources fear there may be as few as 10 suppliers left by the end of the year."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has said people should not worry about putting food on the table this winter, amid surging energy prices and a cut to universal credit.\nThe prime minister told BBC News: \"I don't believe people will be short of food - and wages are actually rising.\"\nIt comes after Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng warned some households face a \"very difficult winter\".\nEnergy and food bills are rising due to a spike in global gas prices - and many families face a \u00a320-a-week benefit cut.\nThe cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has warned.\nSpeaking to the BBC in New York, where he has been meeting world leaders at the United Nations, Mr Johnson said the surge in energy prices was a \"short-term\" problem caused by \"the global economy coming back to life\" after the coronavirus pandemic. \n\"We are talking to the energy companies - doing what we can to keep prices low, to make sure that the supermarket shelves aren't empty,\" he said.\nHouseholds across England, Scotland and Wales are set to see their energy bills rise by an average of \u00a3139 a year in October.\nWorkers also face a rise in National Insurance payments from next April, to help fund higher costs for the NHS and social care.\nIn his BBC interview, Mr Johnson insisted the gas price increase was an \"interim\" issue and the global energy markets would \"rectify themselves\".\nIt showed that the UK was right to be moving to renewable energy, he added.\nThe government is hoping to limit further energy bill rises by keeping a price cap in place, and also plans to help bigger firms take on customers from small suppliers that have gone bust. \nSeparately, the government says it has taken action to prevent supermarket shortages with a deal to restart production at CF Industries, the UK's biggest producer of carbon dioxide.\nThe gas is widely used by the food industry to prolong shelf life.\nRestarting production at the carbon dioxide plants is set to cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds, after the government agreed to meet the full operating costs for three weeks.\nEnergy price rises have been as dizzying as New York's skyscrapers - but Boris Johnson was reluctant to acknowledge the squeeze on supply was anything more than a short-term problem. \nThe government has managed to broker a deal on CO2, but the pressure points this autumn go beyond that. \nThere are real fears at home about household bills, food supplies, and rising prices. \nBut Mr Johnson blamed the pressures on the pandemic, saying the issues were just in the \"interim\".\nWhile he said the government would help where it could, he did not provide details of any further actions the government might take, placing his faith in the market to resolve the crunch and pointing to his energy \"ten-point plan\". \nA long-term Whitehall plan may not be that much comfort to those worrying about paying higher bills right here and now. \nRead more from Laura here.\nMr Johnson has again rejected calls from Labour and many Tory MPs to scrap the cut to the \u00a320 a week top-up to universal credit, which some MPs have warned will push many working families into poverty.\nInstead of keeping the top-up, which was brought in to help people through the pandemic, Mr Johnson said:  \"We think the best thing we can do is help people into high-skilled, high wage jobs, that is what is happening,\n\"Unemployment is falling very rapidly, jobs are being created, wages are rising.\n\"And rather than raising people's taxes to put more money into benefits, we want to see companies paying their workers more.\"\nLabour held a debate in the Commons, calling on the government to halt the proposed cut to the universal credit top-up.\nThe party's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said working families faced a squeeze on living standards this winter \"on a scale not seen for a generation\" - and it was down to government decisions, not an \"unforeseeable series of unhappy accidents\".\n\"Incomes are coming down, prices are going up - especially energy prices - taxes are going up, rents are going up, childcare costs are going up, fuel costs are going up, rail fares are going up.\n\"And with empty shelves in too many shops, restaurants closing because of meat shortages, and now refrigerant shortages putting Christmas at risk, it isn't just that people can afford less, there is also less to afford,\" she told MPs.\nSpeaking on BBC Two's Newsnight programme on Monday, the Conservative former Brexit Secretary, David Davis, warned there was a risk of a \"cost of living crisis\" for new Tory voters such as \"the plumber, the bricklayer, the lorry driver\".\nHe said his advice to Chancellor Rishi Sunak would be: \"You think hard about the ordinary family's take-home pay and what they have to buy with it, because that will be a dictator of how people feel going in to the new year.\""

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Labour Party",
      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has published an 11,500 word essay on what he stands for and how he wants to change the UK, ahead of his party's conference.\nThe Labour leader says the country is at a crossroads after the pandemic and is \"crying out for change\".\nIf elected prime minister, he says he would create \"a society built on everyone's contribution\".  \nSir Keir has faced criticism from some in Labour that he lacks vision and voters don't know what his values are.\nHe is due to deliver his first in-person conference speech to party members since becoming leader last year, in Brighton next week.\nIn his essay The Road Ahead, published by the Fabian Society think tank, he sketches out many of the themes that are likely to feature in his speech, saying he wants Labour to be \"Britain's bricks and mortar\".\n\"People want to emerge from lockdown into something better,\" writes the Labour leader.\n\"They want to see a contribution society: one where people who work hard and play by the rules can expect to get something back.\n\"Where you can expect fair pay for fair work, where we capture the spirit that saw us through the worst ravages of the pandemic and celebrate the idea of community and society; where we understand that we are stronger together.\"\nSpeaking about his own background, as the son of parents who \"worked with their hands\" who was able to go to university and reach the top of the legal profession, Sir Keir writes: \"There are two fundamental things we need to fix in this country: insecurity and inequality of opportunity.\n\"Does a working-class child in Britain today have the same opportunities my generation did? It is hard to think they do.\"\nSir Keir's essay has multiple objectives.\nHe wants to silence critics who accuse him of lacking vision or direction, to create dividing lines with his political opponents - and to suggest that his values are in touch with those of the majority of voters.\nHe sets out 10 \"simple key principles\" for a future Labour government, which would \"always put hard-working families and their priorities first\".\nThe pamphlet is peppered with the phrase \"security and opportunity\".\nThis is, in part, to convince voters that a future Labour government would tackle the insecurity many people feel at work.\nBut it is also designed to play to his perceived strengths and his life story.\nLabour's target voters are unlikely to devour the entire tract.\nBut the forthcoming conference will provide Sir Keir with both the opportunity - and the challenge - of distilling his message.\nIn the pamphlet, Sir Keir attacks Prime Minister Boris Johnson as \"utterly unserious and completely unprepared for the great challenges of our time\".\nAnd he accuses both the Conservatives and the SNP of being in thrall to nationalism.\nBy contrast, he argues, Labour should be \"proudly patriotic\" but \"reject the divisiveness of nationalism\".\nHe repeats his call for the party to embrace the achievements of the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments - but says Labour has to change to stand a chance of returning to power. \n\"The Labour Party at its best does not wait around for the public to decide we are right. Instead, it adapts and updates. It does not look backwards - it marches forwards,\" he writes.\nConservative party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: \"If this is Starmer's 'big vision' then he should have gone to Specsavers. \n\"Labour are talking to themselves about themselves. They're all essays and no action.\"\nSpeaking to ITV's Robert Peston, former Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the document \"looks like the sermon on the mount written by a focus group\".\n\"I can't see anything in this document that is going to inspire,\" he added.\nLabour MP Liam Byrne - who failed to unseat Conservative Andy Street as West Midlands mayor in May's elections - has set out his own plan to return his party to power.\nIn an article for Prospect magazine, the former minister says Sir Keir needs to target Tory voters with \"an evocative tale of how we build our future with pride in our past, fed by roots in industry and community\"."

      "tags": "UN General Assembly,United Nations,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "In his first address to the United Nations, US President Joe Biden has urged global cooperation through \"a decisive decade for our world\".\nHis calls for unity come amid tensions with allies over the US' Afghanistan withdrawal and a major diplomatic row with France over a submarine deal.\nThe US also announced it was doubling its climate finance pledge by 2024.\nReaffirming his support for democracy and diplomacy, Mr Biden said: \"We must work together like never before.\"\nThe 76th General Assembly in New York City takes place against the backdrop of a climate crisis and a once-in-a-century pandemic, both of which have sharpened global divides.\nMr Biden pushed for cooperation on these fronts, saying: \"Whether we choose to fight for our shared future or not will reverberate for generations to come. Simply put, we stand, in my view, at an inflection point in history.\"\nMr Biden on Tuesday stressed that the US is \"not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs\". \nThe US, he said, \"is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreements in other areas\".\nThe remark appeared to be a response to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who this weekend warned the US and China were headed for \"a Cold War that would be different from the past one, and probably more dangerous and more difficult to manage\". \nThe president also touted the pullout from Afghanistan, which has been criticised by allies at home and abroad, saying the US was ending a \"period of relentless war\" for a \"new era of relentless diplomacy\".\nMr Biden offered a key pledge on climate finance as well, saying the US will increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (\u00a38.3bn) by 2024. This means the US will offer just over half of the European Union's pledge to help poorer nations cope with climate change.\nThe developed world had pledged to provide these countries $100bn a year by 2020 but this has still not been achieved. \nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who is meeting with Mr Biden later on Tuesday - praised the \"massive contribution\" and said the US had \"stepped up to the plate\".\nAt the end of his first address, Mr Biden promised that the US would lead \"with our allies\".\n\"We will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time, from Covid to climate, human dignity and human rights, but we will not go it alone,\" he said.\nWorld leaders at odds with former President Donald Trump had hoped for a more stable and reliable America under his successor's leadership - but Mr Biden's most recent foreign policy moves have made some uneasy.\nThe US' lack of coordination during the Afghanistan exit after two decades of war rankled allies and led to an international scramble to evacuate. The Nato mission at the time of the withdrawal comprised troops from 36 countries, three-quarters of whom were non-American.\nLast week, a trilateral US-UK deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines infuriated the French, who had their own five-year-old contract to build conventional submarines for the Australians. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the agreement as \"a stab in the back\", and the top French diplomats in both countries were recalled.\nThe Biden administration has also seen international criticism over alleged US hoarding of Covid-19 vaccines and non-reciprocal travel restrictions, as well as frugality with climate aid.\nAfter four years of America First and Donald Trump's isolationist nationalism, this was a speech the leaders of the liberal democracies wanted to cheer. But Joe Biden's first appearance before the UN General Assembly will be treated with a good deal of scepticism after America's shambolic departure from Afghanistan. \nThat said, the US president was determined to push his more outward looking view of the world. And turning a page, he was able to say this was the first time in 20 years that America wasn't at war.\nBritish diplomats will have cheered his pledge to double to $11.4bn the money to tackle climate change by 2024 - something they have been lobbying the White House relentlessly on. \nOne issue that enjoys bipartisan support in Washington is the threat posed by China - the driving force behind the new security partnership with Britain and Australia. He didn't mention the world's other superpower by name, but it's clear who he was talking about.\nThe US president has had a torrid, horrid summer. This speech was an attempt to reassure America's international allies - and to put flesh on the bones of his claim that \"America is back\"."

      "text": "Many patients are being prescribed unnecessary and even harmful treatments, a report warns.\nThe review, in England, suggests one-tenth of items dispensed by primary care are inappropriate or could be changed. \nAround 15% of people take five or more medicines a day - some are to deal with the side-effects of the others. \nThe government is appointing a prescribing tsar to help with the issue and stop waste.\nThe more medicines a person takes, the higher the chance that one or more of them will have an unwanted or harmful effect.\nOverprescribing can happen when:\nChief pharmaceutical officer for England, Dr Keith Ridge, said: \"Medicines do people a lot of good and this report is absolutely not about taking treatment or services away from people where they are effective. But medicines can also cause harm and can be wasted.\"\nThe number of items dispensed by GPs and other primary care providers has doubled in recent years, from an average of 10 per person in 1996 to around 20 per person now, according to the report. \nRepeat prescriptions make up around three-quarters of all prescription items.\nAnd around 6.5% of hospital admissions are caused by adverse effects of medicines. This rises to up to 20% in the over-65 age group. \nImproved patient records and handovers between hospitals and GP surgeries are among the recommendations made in the report. \nClinical pharmacists working with GPs to review medication and a move to more personalised care is already helping, say experts.\nProf Martin Marshall, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: \"Prescribing is a core skill for GPs and many of our nurse and pharmacist colleagues in primary care and doing whatever we can to prescribe the most appropriate medicine for our patients, in an evidence-based way is something we strive to do on a daily basis - and in the vast majority of cases, this review shows this is happening.\n\"With our growing and ageing population, with more patients living with multiple, chronic conditions, many people are taking several medications in order to manage their various health illnesses, and the interaction between various medicines is something prescribers will take into account.\n\"In most cases, these medicines are necessary, appropriate and of benefit for the patient - but the aspiration to reduce the number of medications a patient is taking, where safe and possible, is a good one. \n\"GPs will only ever prescribe medication to patients in conversation with them,and after a frank discussion about the risks and benefits of the treatment - and when alternative options have been explored. \n\"What GPs and other members of the practice team often need, however, is better access for their patients to alternative, non-pharmacological treatments, which can be patchy across the country.\""

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The United States is lifting its decades-old ban on imports of British lamb, Boris Johnson has announced. \nThe PM, who is in the US for talks with UN leaders and President Joe Biden, said the ban was \"unjustified\".\nBut he admitted the UK was now focused on making \"incremental steps\" on US trade access, rather than aiming for a full agreement. \nMr Biden appeared to play down the chances of a wider deal during a meeting with Mr Johnson on Tuesday.\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said the Biden administration \"is not doing free trade deals around the world right now\".\nBut he added he had \"every confidence that a great deal is there to be done\".\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner mocked the lack of movement, saying the PM had made \"absolutely zero progress\" on a trade deal during his US trip.\nThe United States has banned British lamb imports since 1989, following the first outbreaks of BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease. \nA similar ban on British beef imports, imposed in 1996, was lifted in September last year. \nThere is no indication yet of when the US will start accepting lamb and lamb products from the UK, and an official announcement has not been made.\nThe US Department for Agriculture has been consulting on lifting the ban since 2016 - and there were originally hopes it would be lifted the following year.\nAt the time, the UK government estimated the change would be worth an extra \u00a335m a year to the UK economy. \nAnalysis by Damian Grammaticas , BBC political correspondent \nWhen it comes to trade, the big deal that's emerged from Boris Johnson's visit to Washington is that there's to be no deal happening any time soon. \nThat's significant, and a setback for Boris Johnson's government. \nIn March 2020, just a few weeks after the UK had left the EU, the then-Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the day marked a \"crucial step in beginning the formal negotiations for a free-trade agreement with our largest bilateral trading partner, the United States.\" \nToday it all looks different. The United States, Boris Johnson told us, is not doing deals. \nSo whilst Ms Truss predicted a \"\u00a33.4 billion lift to the economy\" from a US-UK deal, today we had an \"incremental step\" but a tiny one by comparison - a possible opening for lamb exports. \nA US deal was by far the biggest prize when it came to the promise of post-Brexit trade deals. But under this US administration, it's not happening any time soon.\nMr Johnson said the ban was \"totally unjustified\" and \"discriminating on British farmers and British lamb\".\nThe National Sheep Association industry group welcomed the news, adding it had always seen the US as a \"potentially important market\".\nIts chief executive Phil Stocker cautioned, however, that \"we shouldn't expect to see any sudden surge in volumes going to the US\".\nHe added that Brexit had made it more difficult to sell into the EU - the UK's lamb largest export market - and it was \"important to work on any market that gives us future potential\".\nMr Johnson cited the lifting of the ban as an example of \"practical steps to help our exports\" the UK was taking, pending progress on wider trade talks. \nDowning Street has pointed to the resolution of the Airbus-Boeing trade dispute, as well as the lowering of whisky tariffs and the decision to lift the ban on British beef.\nSecuring a trade deal with the United States has been a priority for many Brexit-backing politicians, following the UK's departure from the EU. \nBut on Tuesday, Mr Biden appeared to downplay the chances of an agreement soon, adding he would discuss the issue \"a little bit\" with Mr Johnson during his trip to the White House. \n\"We're going to have to work that through,\" the US president added. \nThe US is already a significant UK trading partner, accounting for \u00a31 in every \u00a36 of British trade.\nThe BBC understands the government is considering whether to join an existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - known as the USMCA. \nHowever, Downing Street denies this and says it focus remains on a UK-US trade deal.\nIf a USMCA arrangement was pursued, it would limit the UK's ability to sell services. \nEconomists say the overall gains from joining it could be less than 0.1% of the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - a measurement of the size of the economy."

      "text": "Global chemicals firm Ineos has announced it will invest \u00a31bn in cutting greenhouse emissions at its petrochemical plant in Grangemouth.\nThe plan is to power the plant with hydrogen made from natural gas, while capturing carbon dioxide.\nThe CO2 could then be pumped via a pipeline to St Fergus in Aberdeenshire and stored beneath the North Sea. \nThe industrial site at Grangemouth is currently one of Scotland's biggest polluters.\nThe announcement is the next phase of the company's road map to deliver emissions savings of more than 60% across the site by 2030, as Scotland works towards becoming net zero by 2045.\nIneos says it has already achieved a 37% reduction in net CO2 emissions since acquiring the site in 2005.\nThe \u00a31bn investment is in addition to more than \u00a3500m spent on projects currently being implemented at Grangemouth. \nOne of those is a new energy plant due to be completed in late 2023 which will supply energy to all site operations and drive down emissions by at least 150,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.\nThe Grangemouth refinery is a joint venture formed between Ineos and PetroChina in 2011. \nAs Scotland's only crude oil refinery, Petroineos is the primary supplier of aviation fuel for Scotland's main airports and the major supplier of petrol and diesel across Scotland's central belt, as well as in Northern Ireland and Northern England.\nCarbon capture and storage has been in development in Scotland for some considerable time.  \nAfter the failed plan to attach it to Peterhead power station, the \"acorn project\" was born. It's been examining other uses to which the technology can be put.\nUsing St Fergus in north east Scotland as a base, they have been looking around for partners.\nAs one of Scotland's most polluting sites, Grangemouth has seemed one of the most obvious.\nThe National Grid is already looking at using existing pipelines which transport gas from St Fergus to the industrial heartlands of central Scotland and putting them into reverse.\nAll it has needed is money and today's announcement provides just that.\nThe announcement comes just over a month before world leaders arrive in Scotland for the COP26 climate change summit.\nSome environmental groups are sceptical about carbon capture as part of a strategy for tackling the global climate emergency. \nFriends of the Earth Scotland campaigner Alex Lee described it as \"just another distraction tactic\", adding there was an \"urgent need\" to end fossil fuel production, scale-up renewable energy and invest in green jobs. \n\"Hydrogen technology enthusiasts fail to mention that it is wildly expensive, inefficient and is not zero carbon,\" they added. \nIneos, however, says its road map highlights its commitment to supporting the goals of the Paris Accord and helping the Scottish government in its drive for a \"just transition\" to a net zero economy. \nThe Scottish government's net zero secretary, Michael Matheson, welcomed the investment.\n\"This will not only drive forward innovation and diversification to tackle emissions at Grangemouth, but will also support the decarbonisation of other sectors, sites and regions across Scotland,\" he said.\nThe UK government has promised support for four carbon capture and storage projects by the end of the decade, and Mr Matheson said he hoped the Ineos investment would secure some of this funding. \n\"Grangemouth, and Ineos itself, already holds a wealth of experience in engineering solutions and hydrogen production, and this new investment holds great potential for the future of Grangemouth, as well as the vital jobs that are located there, as part of our just transition to net zero,\" he said.\nStuart Collings, the CEO of Ineos O&P UK added: \"Hydrogen will play a very important role in the decarbonisation of our manufacturing plants. Building the infrastructure for large scale utilisation of hydrogen creates a foundation to achieve net zero by 2045 and enables wider use of hydrogen by Ineos and others in and around Grangemouth.\" \nFive Ineos sites at Grangemouth released around 3.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2019, making it the largest climate polluter in the country, according to figures from the Scottish Environment and Protection Agency (Sepa).\nThe power company SSE ranked as second-worst, with its gas power station at Peterhead emitting around 1.6 million tonnes that year.\nTerry A'Hearn, chief executive of Sepa, said: \"As Scotland's environmental watchdog, Sepa has an active and ongoing programme of engagement with Ineos.\n\"We remain focused on both addressing environmental compliance and in supporting and welcoming transformational innovation and investment wherever it occurs to help Scotland to continue its journey towards net zero.\""

Sometimes looking for that place might not be on paper the best university, but it's the best university for you. \n\"I know that's not good or fair, but it's what I've done to have the best university experience.\"\nShiraz, 17, wants to study medicine at Oxford and said the diversity of a university's student population is something he considers.\n\"Going to a university that's diverse can make me feel confident in my culture and my skin colour,\" he said.\n\"I didn't want to apply to university beforehand. But now I'm determined and I have that drive and motivation to prove that someone like me can get a place in one of the most competitive degrees in the whole of the UK.\"\nPoppy, 17, wants to study humanities at Cambridge University or in the US.\nShe said: \"It's a shame that as a state school student that I have to rely on social mobility programmes to help me with that university application.\n\"It should be down to the institutions to make sure that that barrier doesn't exist and that they're also accessible for students who might not even have access to the social mobility programmes.\"\nThe most recent data shows all Welsh institutions had a higher offer rate for white applicants than black applicants.\nStudents from an Asian or mixed background or an ethnicity classed as \"other\" were also less likely to be offered a place at the majority of universities. \nHowever, across Wales and the UK, black and ethnic minority pupils are more likely to apply to and attend university.\nOut of the 132 universities listed by Ucas, just nine had a higher offer rate for black applicants. \nA total of 55 universities had a higher offer rate for Asian applicants compared to white students according to UCAS data, including only one in Wales - Wrexham Glyndwr University.\nThe data also found a gap in Wales and across the UK between the rate of offers given to those from neighbourhoods with greater participation in higher education and those from more deprived backgrounds.\nDr Jason Arday, an associate professor of sociology at Durham University, said the figures highlight that higher education is \"systematically disadvantaging particular minority groups\" through unconscious bias of admissions teams and programme leaders.\n\"Black and ethnic minority students have the grades but are not getting on these courses,\" he said.\n\"There isn't a fairness in that process.\"\nHe said quotas could help close the gap and after the murder of George Floyd, universities in the UK are beginning to address issues of racism within their institutions.\n\"There is a small groundswell of hope where people are forcing change.\" \nUCAS' chief executive Clare Marchant said applicants from ethnic minority backgrounds are more likely to apply for more competitive courses but teachers, local government, higher education institutions and UCAS can \"all be doing more\" to close the offer rate gap.\nShe said: \"It's about how we promote diversity and how we raise aspirations and say actually, 'The world is your oyster, you can achieve anything if you put your mind to it'.\n\"That's how we'll get aspiration across everybody, not just an elite.\"\nAcross the UK, just 37 universities had a greater offer rate for women than for men, including Oxford and Cambridge. \nDespite lower offer rates at university, women make up 56 percent of the student population at Welsh universities. \nMs Marchant said this could be explained by women tending to apply for more oversubscribed courses.\nShe said: \"The attainment gap for males and females starts really early on. So back in early years, all the way through primary and secondary, females are achieving just that little bit more.\n\"When we look at progression to higher education, we potentially see more women that are looking at highly selective institutions and highly selective courses and so therefore you'd expect to see some difference in terms of offers coming back.\"\nAmanda Wilkinson, Director of Universities Wales said universities \"have a responsibility to ensure we are doing all we can to tackle inequality and support people of all backgrounds\".\n\"All universities in Wales are actively working towards progressing race equality through Advance HE's project on race access and success. They're also on an active path to working to achieve the Race Equality Charter,\" she said."

She then visited a number of locations in the north of the state over the weekend. \nITV Studios, which makes the programme, told the news outlet that the crew member was \"fully vaccinated and was wearing PPE while at work\". It added that all of her close contacts were now in isolation. \nIt said it was \"disappointed and sympathetic\" to the impact this has had on the region. \nBut police said that by attending several businesses and venues in Byron Bay and Kingscliff she had breached the conditions of her work-related travel exemption. \nAccording to the rules, people who have travelled from Sydney, which is still in lockdown, must stay at home when they are not working. \nThe positive result forced some 135,000 people into a seven-day lockdown which came into effect on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Queensland has closed its border to the affected areas. \nAustralia has strict border restrictions, even between states, with many people cut-off from seeing loved ones. \nThe positive Covid-19 case prompted widespread criticism on social media.\n\"I can't see my parents but 'essential' workers can travel to a region to film,\" one person wrote on Twitter. \nCatherine Cusack, a member of the NSW legislative council, said on the social media site that she was \"devastated\" by the lockdown and called on the state's health minister to resign. \nAnd the Mayor of Byron Shire, Michael Lyon, said he was looking into rescinding permission for the reality TV show Love Island to be filmed in the area. The show is also produced by ITV Studios. \nAccording to local media, northern NSW has relatively low vaccine rates when compared with other regions. Bryon Shire's vaccine rate in people over 16 has just passed 60%, compared to other Sydney councils that have recorded rates of more than 95%. \nThe Australian version of I'm a Celebrity is being filmed in the country for the first time due to coronavirus travel restrictions. It is usually filmed in South Africa.\nThe UK version, meanwhile, is to be filmed in Wales for the second successive series."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has said people should not worry about putting food on the table this winter, amid surging energy prices and a cut to universal credit.\nThe prime minister told BBC News: \"I don't believe people will be short of food - and wages are actually rising.\"\nIt comes after Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng warned some households face a \"very difficult winter\".\nEnergy and food bills are rising due to a spike in global gas prices - and many families face a \u00a320-a-week benefit cut.\nThe cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has warned.\nSpeaking to the BBC in New York, where he has been meeting world leaders at the United Nations, Mr Johnson said the surge in energy prices was a \"short-term\" problem caused by \"the global economy coming back to life\" after the coronavirus pandemic. \n\"We are talking to the energy companies - doing what we can to keep prices low, to make sure that the supermarket shelves aren't empty,\" he said.\nHouseholds across England, Scotland and Wales are set to see their energy bills rise by an average of \u00a3139 a year in October.\nWorkers also face a rise in National Insurance payments from next April, to help fund higher costs for the NHS and social care.\nIn his BBC interview, Mr Johnson insisted the gas price increase was an \"interim\" issue and the global energy markets would \"rectify themselves\".\nIt showed that the UK was right to be moving to renewable energy, he added.\nThe government is hoping to limit further energy bill rises by keeping a price cap in place, and also plans to help bigger firms take on customers from small suppliers that have gone bust. \nSeparately, the government says it has taken action to prevent supermarket shortages with a deal to restart production at CF Industries, the UK's biggest producer of carbon dioxide.\nThe gas is widely used by the food industry to prolong shelf life.\nRestarting production at the carbon dioxide plants is set to cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds, after the government agreed to meet the full operating costs for three weeks.\nEnergy price rises have been as dizzying as New York's skyscrapers - but Boris Johnson was reluctant to acknowledge the squeeze on supply was anything more than a short-term problem. \nThe government has managed to broker a deal on CO2, but the pressure points this autumn go beyond that. \nThere are real fears at home about household bills, food supplies, and rising prices. \nBut Mr Johnson blamed the pressures on the pandemic, saying the issues were just in the \"interim\".\nWhile he said the government would help where it could, he did not provide details of any further actions the government might take, placing his faith in the market to resolve the crunch and pointing to his energy \"ten-point plan\". \nA long-term Whitehall plan may not be that much comfort to those worrying about paying higher bills right here and now. \nRead more from Laura here.\nMr Johnson has again rejected calls from Labour and many Tory MPs to scrap the cut to the \u00a320 a week top-up to universal credit, which some MPs have warned will push many working families into poverty.\nInstead of keeping the top-up, which was brought in to help people through the pandemic, Mr Johnson said:  \"We think the best thing we can do is help people into high-skilled, high wage jobs, that is what is happening,\n\"Unemployment is falling very rapidly, jobs are being created, wages are rising.\n\"And rather than raising people's taxes to put more money into benefits, we want to see companies paying their workers more.\"\nLabour held a debate in the Commons, calling on the government to halt the proposed cut to the universal credit top-up.\nThe party's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said working families faced a squeeze on living standards this winter \"on a scale not seen for a generation\" - and it was down to government decisions, not an \"unforeseeable series of unhappy accidents\".\n\"Incomes are coming down, prices are going up - especially energy prices - taxes are going up, rents are going up, childcare costs are going up, fuel costs are going up, rail fares are going up.\n\"And with empty shelves in too many shops, restaurants closing because of meat shortages, and now refrigerant shortages putting Christmas at risk, it isn't just that people can afford less, there is also less to afford,\" she told MPs.\nSpeaking on BBC Two's Newsnight programme on Monday, the Conservative former Brexit Secretary, David Davis, warned there was a risk of a \"cost of living crisis\" for new Tory voters such as \"the plumber, the bricklayer, the lorry driver\".\nHe said his advice to Chancellor Rishi Sunak would be: \"You think hard about the ordinary family's take-home pay and what they have to buy with it, because that will be a dictator of how people feel going in to the new year.\""

      "text": "A former Marine's mission to bring rescue animals back to the UK as the Taliban took over Afghanistan is being examined by the Charity Commission.\nThe regulator has told the BBC it is looking into the funding arrangements of Operation Ark, which raised more than \u00a3200,000 from supporters in days.  \nOperation Ark was launched by Pen Farthing's charity Nowzad to evacuate staff members and their immediate families, plus the animals in its care.\nThe charity says it acted correctly.\nNowzad, which reported income of close to \u00a31m last year, told the BBC: \"The trustees are wholly confident that Nowzad's life-saving work in incredibly difficult circumstances was both the right and only thing to do and was absolutely in furtherance of the charity's purpose.\"\nThe Charity Commission has contacted Nowzad for further information after receiving reports around the governance and financial arrangements of Operation Ark.\nIt is examining the use of charity funds for the evacuation and whether it is in line with the charity's purpose. \n\"We will assess the information provided by the trustees to determine whether or not there is a role for the Commission,\" it said in a statement provided to the BBC. \nLeading charities lawyer Edwina Turner at Anthony Collins solicitors says this can be \"a crisis point\" in the life of a charity. \n\"It's very serious if the regulator gathers information from you. The charity will want to clear up any concerns,\" Mrs Turner said. \n\"One question they [Nowzad] would need an answer to is have they spent money raised in furtherance of their objects? Secondly, have they spent the money in the best way possible to achieve their charitable purposes. Thirdly, has the money raised through Operation Ark been spent in accordance with the terms of the fundraising campaign?\"\nNowzad operated an animal clinic, dog and cat shelter and donkey sanctuary in Afghanistan. It trained and employed local Afghans - including women - as vets. \nAs the Taliban takeover progressed last month it said its staff were in danger due to their work with foreign organisations, such as embassies, and \"the animals were at risk because the Taliban considers companion animals, particularly dogs, unclean.\"\nThe former Royal Marine and his supporters led a vociferous evacuation campaign which garnered a lot of public attention. It received huge public support but also came in for criticism, including from Defence Secretary Ben Wallace who complained it distracted from focusing on evacuating the most vulnerable.\nThe charity says an \"extremely fraught but ultimately successful\" evacuation ensued. \nIt says \"all staff and their families, including young children and two newborns, and 162 dogs and cats have been delivered to safety.\"\nNowzad confirmed the Charity Commission is asking for their trustees' comments on Operation Ark including, specifically, how it furthered the charity's purpose. \n\"The trustees of course recognise that it is entirely proper for the Commission to gather more information regarding this high-profile and unprecedented operation and are very happy to provide the information requested,\" it added.\nNowzad is a registered charity in England and Wales and is regulated by the Charity Commission.\nAt this stage, the Charity Commission has made clear they are gathering information and no findings have so far been made. \nAccording to Mrs Turner, the Charity Commission has a range of powers, including \"removing trustees, putting in an interim manager to run a charity or certain aspects of a charity\" or, in extreme circumstances, \"they can bring a charity to a close.\"\nMr Farthing, the founder of the animal shelter, who is originally from Dovercourt in Essex, is now working to find new homes in the UK for both his airlifted staff and rescued animals.\nHe is also considering expanding his charity's work abroad, in countries he deems safer than Afghanistan, though he does not rule out a return to Kabul if conditions one day improve."

They are physically and mentally exhausted,\" she said.\nMr Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said the Northern Ireland Executive would take a \"measured approach\" when ministers meet on Thursday to discuss future Covid-19 plans.\nHe said ministers would take into consideration the current transmission rates and hospitalisation.\nHe said politicians needed to be honest with people \"about the realities in what we're facing\".\nHe added that he was concerned about other issues linked to lockdowns, saying: \"People are presenting with severe mental health issues as a result of the lockdown and delayed treatments and some couldn't access services.\"\nMr Givan said healthcare staff were working \"more hours than they've worked before\" and there was \"a need for us all to take the personal responsibility very seriously, whether that's through regulation or through guidance\".\nMs O'Neill said she \"would not rule out anything\" and would \"keep everything on the table - it's the prudent and honest way to proceed\".\n\"We need a very cautious approach in the time ahead.\"\nShe added that Health Minister Robin Swann would bring forward a winter surge plan for the health service in due course and that further details for how the executive would respond to winter pressures should be announced on Thursday afternoon.\nFrom the 11 of November, anyone working or volunteering in a care home in England will need to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus, unless they are exempt. \nThere is also a consultation on whether it should be made mandatory for all frontline workers in health and care settings.\nVisiting professor of public health at Bristol University, Gabriel Scally, said while he did not like the thought of compulsory vaccinations there was a \"particular duty of care\" in health care settings.\n\"People in hospitals or care homes are already ill and the burden of infectious disease really can be avoided largely by vaccination so I think I am in favour of it,\" he told BBC News NI's Talkback programme.\nBut professor of social policy at Ulster University, Deirdre Heenan, told the programme she was opposed to vaccines becoming compulsory for health and social care staff in Northern Ireland.\n\"We have to take account of the needs of health care workers and it's important to see both sides,\" she told Talkback.\n\"When we are talking about social care workers I'm not comfortable with forcing people to have vaccinations, in fact scapegoating the lowest paid part of the social care workforce, often young women who have real issue about vaccination,\" she said.\n\"I would rather we have a programme of talking to people and understanding why people are vaccine hesitant.\"\nFive more deaths and 1,020 cases of coronavirus were reported on Northern Ireland on Monday.\nThere were 379 patients with Covid-19 in hospitals on Monday, compared to 419 on Friday.\nThere were 33 patients with Covid-19 in hospital intensive care units on Monday, down from 38 on Friday."

      "text": "Joe Biden has played down the chances of a post-Brexit free trade deal between the US and UK, as he held talks with Boris Johnson at the White House.\nThe US president said he would discuss the issue \"a little bit\" with the UK prime minister, adding: \"We're going to have to work that through.\"\nDowning Street said a direct deal with the US remained the \"priority\".\nBut UK ministers are pondering joining an existing North American trade pact instead, the BBC understands.\nMr Biden and Mr Johnson also discussed Northern Ireland, climate change and Afghanistan during the 90-minute meeting.\nThe UK is keen to strike free trade deals around the world in the wake of leaving the European Union's single market - including with the US, with which annual trade was worth an estimated $273bn (\u00a3200bn) in 2019.\nA deal would encourage more business between the two countries by making it cheaper, usually by reducing or eliminating taxes called tariffs.\nBut Mr Johnson, echoing Mr Biden, downplayed chances of securing agreement with the US before the next general election, saying: \"The Americans do negotiate very hard.\"\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News: \"We still very much hope to be able to put together an agreement with the United States. We are not putting timescales on it.\"\n\"It's just not a priority for the US administration,\" he added.\nMr Johnson highlighted the decision to lift the ban on British beef, and Downing Street is increasingly confident that there could soon be a favourable decision lifting the export ban on lamb.\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office before the talks, Mr Biden said: \"We're going to talk a little bit about trade today and we're going to have to work that through.\"\nHe did not counter the assertion from his predecessor Barack Obama that the UK would have to join \"the back of the queue\" in seeking a trade deal after Brexit.\nIt's really clear from both sides that there is no rapid path to a trade deal - the opportunity that used to be lauded by Brexiteers and by President Trump. \nMr Johnson hinted at that realism in his curtain-raiser conversations on his way over here. \nAnd the president pretty much confirmed that in the meeting in the Oval Office. \nThe UK seems no longer to want to believe, or pretend, that doing business in a major deal is top of their list. \nInstead, while the government is still officially pursuing a stand-alone deal with the US there's a twin track with a more incremental approach - there have already been changes to whisky tariffs and British beef. But No 10 is now hopeful that the Americans are seriously considering changing tack on British lamb. \nRead more from Laura here.\nA source familiar with the government's thinking told the BBC the UK could negotiate entry into an existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - the USMCA - set up after former US President Donald Trump tore up its predecessor, NAFTA.\n\"There are a variety of different ways to do this,\" the source said. \"The question is whether the US administration is ready. The ball is in the US's court. It takes two to tango.\"\nElsewhere, Downing Street said Mr Johnson and Mr Biden agreed all diplomatic and humanitarian methods must be used to stop conditions getting worse in Afghanistan.\nThe leaders said any international recognition of the Taliban must be contingent on the group respecting human rights.\nThis followed a request by the Taliban to address world leaders at the United Nations summit in New York this week.\nBrexit gave the UK the freedom to strike its own trade deals - and accounting for \u00a31 in every \u00a36 of British trade, a pact with the US was the ultimate prize.\nBut Whitehall officials have for months been scrabbling for an alternative after the Biden administration indicated it was in no hurry to resume talks.\nJoining the USMCA arrangement already agreed by the US, Canada and Mexico could give the UK deeper benefits on some goods and digital trade with North American economies. \nBut it has limited coverage of the UK's biggest strength when it comes to selling to America, namely services. Economists say the overall gains from joining USMCA may be very limited, perhaps less than 0.1% of GDP\nAmerica's price of admission may include a hurdle already encountered: standards surrounding food and agricultural goods. For President Biden is explicit that his priority is US workers, not least its farmers.\nHe is also clear that domestic issues take precedence. Even if the UK does want to sign up to USMCA, it may still be at the back of a queue - simply to get its application considered. \nBefore the meeting, Mr Biden also issued a fresh warning to the UK that peace in Northern Ireland must not be jeopardised as a result of complications caused by Brexit.\nHe made it clear he had concerns about the Irish border, amid continuing issues with Northern Ireland Protocol - the arrangement which helps prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nThe pair also discussed the new UK, US and Australia security pact in the Asia-Pacific region, with No 10 describing it as an example of \"shared values and approach to the world\". \nThe meeting, taking place on the sidelines of the UN summit, involved the traditional exchange of gifts.\nMr Biden gave the prime minister a framed photo of their first meeting in Cornwall at the G7 summit in June, and a White House-branded watch.\nMr Johnson presented the president with a signed copy of a book written by British astronaut Tim Peake, with an inscription expressing hopes that it \"provides a reminder of what we're fighting to save as our countries tackle climate change together\".\nThe prime minister's gift comes weeks ahead of the COP26 summit in Glasgow, which is seen as a crucial moment to bring climate change under control. \nEarlier, Mr Biden announced the US would double its climate finance pledge and increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (\u00a38.3bn) by 2024.\nMr Johnson said the US had \"stepped up to the plate\" with what he called a \"massive contribution\" towards the $100bn (\u00a373bn) goal for countries to raise."

      "text": "Householders in the UK will find out in the next few weeks how much their gas bills are likely to increase in the coming year.\nThe energy regulator is due to announce the new energy price cap - the maximum amount that suppliers can charge in Great Britain.\nIt's expected to rise steeply, because global wholesale prices have gone up so much.\nEvery six months, Ofgem, the energy regulator, reviews the maximum price that suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThis is called the energy price cap. \nAbout 15 million households saw their energy bills increase by 12% when it was last updated in October. \nThe next review is due at the beginning of February, and the new cap will come into effect in April. Industry predictions suggest gas prices could go up by as much as 50%.\nThere is a separate energy market in Northern Ireland, with two gas suppliers, and prices have risen sharply for consumers there too.\nThere's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies over the past year.\nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. At the end of December, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about \u00a32,000 next year.\nReasons for the increase include:\nThere are a number of technical and geopolitical issues at play as well, which mean many countries across Europe are grappling with the same problems.\nHowever, the UK is hit relatively hard-hit because it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas. Around 85% of homes have gas central heating, and it also generates a third of the country's electricity. \nStorage capacity in the UK is also lower than in some other European countries.\nSince wholesale gas prices started to spike, more than 20 retail energy suppliers have collapsed in the UK. \nThis is largely because the energy price cap prevented retailers from passing on higher wholesale prices to their customers.\nSeveral smaller companies, with fewer reserves, could not weather this.\nFailed firms include Bulb Energy, with 1.7 million customers. Because of its size, it was put into \"special administration\", and is now run by the government, through Ofgem.\nNearly four million customers have been affected. Many households saw their energy prices rise when their supplier went bust, and they were switched over to a more expensive deal with another supplier.\nThe government faces calls from energy companies, the opposition, and even some of its own MPs, to do more to prevent prices from rising too much.\nSuggestions include:\nIn the past, consumers have been encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise.\nBut at the moment better offers - including fixed deals - are simply not available.\nPeople already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, householders are being encouraged to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.\nThe Energy Saving Trust says that simple changes to our homes and habits could offset the current price rises.\nMany companies face a considerable rise in their bills. That could mean they have to: \nEnergy-intensive industries are particularly exposed, but the problem affects every company that has to pay energy bills - even if it is just to heat an office or shop."

      "text": "Some 250,000 school pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in a BBC scheme to improve their well-being and story-telling skills.\nThe BBC 100 Share Your Story project will see BBC stars and staff visiting secondary schools across the UK, targeting recovery from the pandemic.\nIt aims to build pupils' confidence and resilience and improve learning as well as relationships within schools.\nDirector general Tim Davie said the BBC had a history of supporting education.\n\"The BBC has played a vital role in education throughout the last century - from Children's Hour broadcasts in 1922, introducing the BBC Micro computer to schools in the 1980s, to supporting an entire nation of home learners during the coronavirus pandemic,\" he said.\n\"In 2022 - our centenary year - we will harness the unique power of the BBC to provide educational support to inspire millions of children and students across the UK. \n\"Hundreds of thousands of school children will be visited by BBC stars and staff, and all educators and students will gain access to cultural treasures in our digitised archive to aid their studies.\"  \nBBC Radio 1's Breakfast programme host Greg James said: \"Telling stories is what humans are best at.\n\"Whether it's brilliant novels, hilarious comedies or just a good old gossip, stories make the world go round. \n\"I'm looking forward to sharing my own story with young people and helping them develop the skills and confidence to tell their own, because storytelling is one of the most enjoyable things you can do with your brain.\"\nThe BBC has teamed up with the National Literacy Trust, oracy charity Voice 21 and the British Film Institute's Into Film programme.\nPupils will be supported to tell their own stories in class, in the form of a poem, a rap, a film or a speech.\nThen BBC hosts will conduct a series of interactive assemblies in which BBC stars and staff reveal how they have overcome challenges.\nAnd some of pupil's stories will be showcased at BBC Share Your Story events, to inspire other young people.\nOne teacher involved in a pilot at a school in Runcorn, Cheshire, Sarah Reardon, said: \"It's just been such a great way to build relationships between the students and the teachers.\n\"A student has shared their story with you, and you've built a completely different type of relationship with them, and suddenly they're working very hard in their lessons.\"\nEmily Kasriel, who is leading the initiative, said: \"Stories help us make meaning of the world around us, our past and where we might go in the future. \n\"Sharing stories helps us to build connections and fosters trust between us - and allows us to discover ways we are similar and different from others, as well as helping us all develop greater resilience.  \n\"Plus, of course, storytelling is at the heart of the BBC.  \n\"So it feels exciting and fitting to be rolling out the project to schools across all four nations to mark the BBC's centenary.\" \nThroughout 2022 more than 100 student stories will be featured across the BBC via BBC Young Reporter.\nAs part of the centenary celebrations, the entire digitised BBC broadcast archive is being made available to students in formal education in the UK.\nThe millions of TV and radio programmes - from Planet Earth and Tomorrow's World to BBC Radio 4's The History of the World in 100 Objects - include interviews and features with almost every major cultural, artistic, political and sporting figure of the last century, as well as influential dramas and landmark comedy programmes."

      "text": "There is \"no clear end in sight\" to HS2 costs and delays, MPs on the Public Accounts Committee have said.\nThe committee is \"increasingly alarmed\" about key parts of the project, including a lack of progress at Euston Station.\nWithout a government decision on the station, the project \"will literally run out of time\", the committee fears.\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) said it was making significant progress delivering HS2.\nEuston Station is an important part of the first phase of the rail project, both as a London terminus and as a link to other infrastructure such as the London Underground.\nBut the DfT \"is yet to make key decisions on the design and approach to construction there\" despite having the necessary planning consents.\nThis could \"lead to yet more costs, delays and uncertainty over the promised benefits of the programme\", the committee said.\nDame Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: \"HS2 is already one of the single most expensive taxpayer-funded programmes in the UK but there's actually no clear end in sight in terms of the final cost, or even the final route.\n\"The project was plagued by a lack of planning and transparency from the start and there are many difficulties ahead.  \n\"This project cannot simply keep sinking more taxpayer funds without greater clarity on the later phases. The development of Euston is a real challenge that must be resolved swiftly now.\"\nThe current estimated cost of completing HS2 is between \u00a372bn and \u00a398bn at 2019 prices, compared with an original budget of \u00a355.7bn in 2015 at 2015 prices.\nThe DfT said: \"We are making significant progress delivering HS2, a key part of our promise to build back better from Covid-19.\n\"We will continue to rigorously control pressures, and as our latest update to Parliament confirmed, Phase One remains within budget and schedule.\"\nThe Integrated Rail Plan would soon outline how major rail projects, including HS2 Phase 2b, would work together to \"deliver the reliable train services that passengers across the North and Midlands need and deserve\", it added.\nHS2 Ltd, the firm behind the project, said: \"HS2 Phases One and 2a have received parliamentary approval and have very clear cost ranges.\n\"Although there have been challenges - particularly relating to the pandemic - the project remains on budget.\"\nThe company said the HS2 was supporting more than 20,000 jobs.\nThe Public Accounts Committee has been critical of the rail project in the past, and in May 2020 said HS2 was \"badly off course\" and that bosses had been \"blindsided by contact with reality\".\nThe committee accused HS2 Ltd and the DfT of lacking transparency and undermining public confidence.\nFollowing this criticism, the government was now providing \"a clearer explanation of costs than we have previously seen in its reporting to Parliament\", the MPs said on Wednesday.\nAs tunnelling machines bore into the earth below the Chilterns, intense scrutiny of HS2 continues above ground.  \nHS2's huge budget, environmental impact and community disruption are making lots of MPs and their constituents angry. But last week the government's high speed minister recommitted to the project \"going full steam ahead\". \nBut there is still a major political issue for the government on HS2 - will it all get built? \nThe prime minister still hasn't confirmed if the Eastern leg from the West Midlands to Leeds will happen, and Northern politicians are starting to express their frustration. \nConservative and Labour MPs in Yorkshire see it as crucial for \"levelling-up\" the region, alongside other major rail investment they want too. \nBut the government's cheque book is under pressure after a huge year of Covid spending. And with inflation rising and costs growing, we wait to see if the chancellor and prime minister push the button for it in full - or if HS2 will be slimmed down."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,COP26,United Nations,Climate change",
      "text": "A climate summit of world leaders in 40 days' time will be the \"turning point for humanity\", PM Boris Johnson has said in a speech to the United Nations.\nHe warned that global temperature rises were already inevitable, but called on his fellow leaders to commit to major changes to curb further warming.\nFour areas needed tackling - \"coal, cars, cash and trees\", he said.\nCountries must take responsibility for \"the destruction we are inflicting, not just upon our planet but ourselves\".\n\"It's time for humanity to grow up,\" he added ahead of the UK hosting the COP26 summit in Glasgow.\nThe prime minister also said it was time to listen to the warnings of scientists. \"Look at Covid if you want an example of gloomy scientists being proved right.\"\nSetting the tone for November's meeting, he said countries must make \"substantial changes\" by the end of the decade if the world is to stave off further temperature rises.\n\"I passionately believe that we can do it by making commitments in four areas - coal, cars, cash and trees,\" he said.\nMr Johnson praised China's President Xi Jinping for his recent pledge to stop building new coal-fire energy plants abroad.\nBut he called on the country - which produces 28% of global greenhouse gas emissions - to go further and end its domestic use of coal, saying the UK was proof that it could be done.\nThe UK used coal to generate 25% of its electricity five years ago - but that is now down to 2%. Mr Johnson said it would be \"gone altogether\" by 2024.\nBut Labour's shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband accused the UK government of \"facing both ways\" on climate change, urging other nations to take action while it considered plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria and cut money for improving home insulation.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's World at One that a UK trade deal had also allowed Australia to renege on their climate commitments.\n\"It undermines our moral standing as the host. I want the prime minister to succeed, but I'm afraid he's left it very late and he's not handled this presidency well,\" he said.\nIn his speech, the prime minister also said he did not see a conflict between the green movement and capitalism, saying: \"The whole experience of the Covid pandemic is that the way to fix the problem is through science and innovation, the breakthroughs and the investment that are made possible by capitalism and by free markets.\"\n\"We have the tools for a green industrial revolution but time is desperately short,\" he added.\nElsewhere, the prime minister made a series of calls for action to his fellow leaders, including:\nAmid the serious warnings, Mr Johnson also attempted to strike a humorous note at points, including saying Kermit the Frog had been wrong when he sang It's Not Easy Bein' Green.\nThe prime minister reiterated that the world must curb the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5C - the stricter of the two targets set by the UN in the 2015 Paris agreement.\nHowever, the world is already 1C hotter compared with pre-industrial levels.\n\"If we keep on the current track then the temperatures will go up by 2.7 degrees or more by the end of the century,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"And never mind what that will do to the ice floes... we will see desertification, drought, crop failure, and mass movements of humanity on a scale not seen before, not because of some unforeseen natural event or disaster but because of us, because of what we are doing now.\n\"And our grandchildren will know that we are the culprits and... that we were warned and they will know that it was this generation that came centre stage to speak and act on behalf of posterity and that we missed our cue and they will ask themselves what kind of people we were to be so selfish and so short sighted.\"\nBoris Johnson is fashioning himself as a leader on climate change.\nHe has set a benchmark by phasing out sales of most new conventional vehicles by 2030. \nThe international alliance he's formed to get rid of coal power is gathering support - though not yet enough.\nAnd by setting aggressive targets to cut carbon emissions overall (78% by 2035) he is encouraging others to follow.\nYet, in his own backyard, the prime minister is stumbling.\nHe previously pledged \"never to be lagging on lagging\". But his plan for insulating homes is badly delayed - along with other vital initiatives on issues including aviation, farming and financing the low carbon revolution.\nRecent research showed his government had imposed less than a quarter of the policies needed to clean up the economy.   \nAnd some policies - like not opposing a coal mine in Cumbria,cutting taxes on flying and building HS2 - will send emissions up when they are supposed to be going down.\nAt COP26, leaders from 196 countries will be asked to agree action to limit climate change and its effects, like rising sea levels and extreme weather.\nA recent report from UN scientists warned that global temperatures have risen faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2,000 years."

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban",
      "text": "UK nationals and former interpreters stranded after British forces pulled out of Afghanistan have told the BBC they feel abandoned. Now hundreds are fearing for their safety following a UK government data breach. \nAhmad, not his real name, is in hiding in Afghanistan. He is one of more than 250 Afghan interpreters and local staff whose names and some profile pictures were mistakenly shared in a Ministry of Defence data breach.\nHe is eligible for relocation under the UK government's Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (Arap) but he is still in the country. \nWhen Ahmad received the MoD email he says he initially \"felt good\". \"I thought, they're still chasing our cases.\"\nThen he realised the error. The email addresses and names of all the recipients could be seen by everyone on the email. Many of those who got the email, like Ahmad, remain in hiding, fearful their lives could be in danger. \nThe government has apologised to those affected and an investigation has been launched. But Ahmad says the error could put him in danger.\n\"I'm sure that it will have a negative impact on our safety\", he says. \"We are already displaced from our home town.\"\nAhmad was shot by the Taliban while on patrol as an interpreter with British troops in Helmand, in 2011. \nBefore the airport in Kabul closed last month, officials told him to take his family there to be evacuated. But the crush to get on flights was too much for his baby daughter. \nLeft behind in Kabul, he now lives apart from his wife and child to try to keep them from danger. \"I feel betrayed and we feel left behind,\" he says. \"We were the people deserving to be relocated.\"\n\"I am living from place-to-place, going door-to-door. It is very difficult for me financially and from the security perspective - and also mentally.\"\n\"Just when you think it can't get worse than this, along comes [the email],\" he told the BBC.\nSince mid-August, when the Afghan government fell, the UK says more than 15,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan. \nThe BBC understands this includes more than 8,000 UK nationals, while a few hundred more have made it out under their own steam. Two flights out of Kabul to Doha in the past week have carried a further 26 British nationals and four Afghan spouses. \nOfficials will not say how many British citizens have still to make it out of the country but chat among the community left behind in Afghanistan gives a sense of the scale of the problem facing Liz Truss, the UK's new foreign secretary.\n\"There are loads of people waiting,\" says Ziad, who travelled from Newport to Afghanistan in July to visit his sick mother. His name has been changed to protect his identity. \n\"My cousin is also a British citizen, he's also waiting. Lots of my school mates are here as well. My driving instructor, he's stuck here as well. So imagine how many more would be here.\"\nThe government says it has advised against travel to Afghanistan for many years. But those who did make the trip and are now stuck feel abandoned.\n\"They are not serious about their citizens,\" Ziad says. \"Until now, I did not receive any help.\" He is not alone. \nEarlier this month, BBC News reported on a seven-month-old baby left behind in Afghanistan because of a delay in processing her passport.\nThree weeks later, her family in London say they are still waiting for news about what can be done to help them. \nZahra, not her real name, told the BBC about her fears for her family in Afghanistan whose details she had registered with the UK government for assistance. She says they still have not had any good news. Her family is now making plans to travel to a third country.\nSayyid, also not his real name, said he was worried about his brother who had previously worked for a British charity in Afghanistan because he had been threatened by the Taliban.\nThis week he updated the BBC to say that his brother remained in hiding.\nMujeeb Ashraf, a former interpreter for UK forces, might appear to be one of the lucky ones.\nAfter getting confirmation he was eligible for relocation under Arap, he managed to get himself on a commercial flight out of Kabul before the airport closed. He took the flight rather than wait for the UK to evacuate him. \nNow in Dubai, Mujeeb has sent repeated pleas to officials about what to do next but says he has so far not had any information about relocation to the UK.\n\"It seems they have no plan for third countries,\" he says. \"Every day I'm checking my email to have some good news from the UK government. I don't know what to do next and I have no idea where to go.\" \nWith only handouts from voluntary groups to get by, and having to pay around \u00a3300 a month in rent to share a small house with 21 people, Mujeeb fears for what will happen after his visa expires. \nHe pleaded with the UK government to \"help those people who helped you in your operations\".\nThe BBC asked the government how it intended to help evacuate people like Mujeeb who are stranded in third countries.\nA spokesperson said they could not comment on individual cases but work was under way to support the logistics of relocation of those accepted as eligible who are already in third countries. \nWhere possible, the government would contact those identified for relocation who are not yet in the UK, the spokesperson added.\nA government spokesperson said: \"The UK's evacuation operation helped over 15,000 people to safety including British nationals, Afghan interpreters, and other vulnerable people.\n\"Whilst the success of that operation exceeded our assumptions, we know that there are many left in difficult circumstances.\"\nThe spokesperson said the government's \"utmost priority is to continue to work with allies and partners in the region to ensure safe passage for those who want to leave Afghanistan\".  \nAdditional reporting by Chris Bell \nAre you a UK national in Afghanistan or eligible for relocation to the UK and unable to leave?

      "text": "Northern Ireland's health service is \"about to topple over\" if immediate action is not taken, the deputy first minister has said.\nMichelle O'Neill said staff were \"facing into a very difficult winter\" under current pressures.\nShe met staff at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast on Tuesday along with First Minister Paul Givan.\nThey both said they wanted to avoid any further lockdowns or \"circuit breakers\".\nSinn F\u00e9in vice-president Ms O'Neill said the healthcare system was facing increased staff absences with workers feeling \"burnt out\".\n\"They're begging for our support. They are physically and mentally exhausted,\" she said.\nMr Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said the Northern Ireland Executive would take a \"measured approach\" when ministers meet on Thursday to discuss future Covid-19 plans.\nHe said ministers would take into consideration the current transmission rates and hospitalisation.\nHe said politicians needed to be honest with people \"about the realities in what we're facing\".\nHe added that he was concerned about other issues linked to lockdowns, saying: \"People are presenting with severe mental health issues as a result of the lockdown and delayed treatments and some couldn't access services.\"\nMr Givan said healthcare staff were working \"more hours than they've worked before\" and there was \"a need for us all to take the personal responsibility very seriously, whether that's through regulation or through guidance\".\nMs O'Neill said she \"would not rule out anything\" and would \"keep everything on the table - it's the prudent and honest way to proceed\".\n\"We need a very cautious approach in the time ahead.\"\nShe added that Health Minister Robin Swann would bring forward a winter surge plan for the health service in due course and that further details for how the executive would respond to winter pressures should be announced on Thursday afternoon.\nFrom the 11 of November, anyone working or volunteering in a care home in England will need to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus, unless they are exempt. \nThere is also a consultation on whether it should be made mandatory for all frontline workers in health and care settings.\nVisiting professor of public health at Bristol University, Gabriel Scally, said while he did not like the thought of compulsory vaccinations there was a \"particular duty of care\" in health care settings.\n\"People in hospitals or care homes are already ill and the burden of infectious disease really can be avoided largely by vaccination so I think I am in favour of it,\" he told BBC News NI's Talkback programme.\nBut professor of social policy at Ulster University, Deirdre Heenan, told the programme she was opposed to vaccines becoming compulsory for health and social care staff in Northern Ireland.\n\"We have to take account of the needs of health care workers and it's important to see both sides,\" she told Talkback.\n\"When we are talking about social care workers I'm not comfortable with forcing people to have vaccinations, in fact scapegoating the lowest paid part of the social care workforce, often young women who have real issue about vaccination,\" she said.\n\"I would rather we have a programme of talking to people and understanding why people are vaccine hesitant.\"\nFive more deaths and 1,020 cases of coronavirus were reported on Northern Ireland on Monday.\nThere were 379 patients with Covid-19 in hospitals on Monday, compared to 419 on Friday.\nThere were 33 patients with Covid-19 in hospital intensive care units on Monday, down from 38 on Friday."

      "text": "Pupils starting media studies GCSEs this year will study Marcus Rashford's role as an influencer.\nThe footballer and food campaigner's media impact will be included in the syllabus of the AQA exam board.\nIt will focus on his use of social media to speak out on issues such as free school meals and racism in sport.\nThe Manchester United and England player was awarded an MBE last year for services to vulnerable children during the pandemic.\nRashford has used his public profile to reduce the stigma surrounding free school meals.\nHe talked frankly of his own experience of relying on free lunches at school.\nIn an open letter to MPs last year, he wrote: \"My mum worked full time, earning the minimum wage, to make sure we always had a good evening meal on the table - but it was not enough.\n\"The system was not built for families like mine to succeed, regardless of how hard my mum worked.\"\nThe footballer's high-profile interventions, often on social media, put pressure on ministers to extend food support through school holidays.\nBut as well as allowing him to campaign, his celebrity profile has also exposed him to racist abuse, such as after missing a penalty during the Euro 2020 shootout at Wembley. \nRashford was widely praised for dealing with the pressure, however.\nAnd after a mural was defaced in his hometown, of Withington, Greater Manchester, there was an outpouring of support. \nFans of his social campaigning made a pilgrimage to what became a shrine of tributes, shared one photo at a time on social media.\nAnd Rashford responded on Twitter \"At one of my lowest points, the outpouring of support around this mural really lifted me and I am truly grateful for that.\"\nWhen the former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson recently muddled meeting him with the rugby player Maro Itoje, Rashford commented with restrained irony, tweeting: \"Accent could have been a giveaway.\" \nNow, his media presence could form the basis of questions in GCSE exams in 2023. \nAQA head of curriculum for creative arts Sandra Allen said students would learn how social media could make an impact.\n\"It's not just an opportunity for them to learn about social media - it's also a great way to learn about important social and race issues as part of our commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion in the curriculum,\" she added.\nGCSE media studies courses are often a barometer of social trends.\nAnd AQA has chosen Rashford to replace the influencer and businesswoman Zoe Sugg, know to millions as Zoella.\nShe was among the first influencers to break through from posting from her teenage bedroom to a large and lucrative following.\nBut now, at the age of 31, she appeals more to young mothers than teenagers studying for GCSE exams. \nSteff Hutchinson, assistant head teacher at Caludon Castle School, in Coventry, said her pupils were very excited to hear they were going to be studying Rashford's use of the media.\n\"He is very, very relevant to all of my students, particularly those who are of colour themselves and the lads who are into football seeing someone who is a massive role model,\" she said.\n\"It will make sense to them, as they're also using social media to brand themselves and I think they'll understand how they could possibly be more careful and more accurate about what they do.\"\nAlso included in the updated syllabus is the BBC TV adaptation of Philip Pullman's novels, His Dark Materials,  as well as commercial radio shows and magazines."
