      "tags": "Companies,Unilever,Retailing,Inflation",
      "text": "The company behind brands such as PG Tips, Cornetto and Dove has said it will raise prices to cope with \"elevated levels\" of cost inflation which it expects to continue next year.\nConsumer goods giant Unilever said that it had already lifted its pricing. \nUnilever said this would continue across its global operations and within each of its product divisions.\nThe company reported a 2.5% rise in sales for the third quarter to 30 September.\nGrowth was supported by a 4.1% increase in prices while the volume of goods sold fell by 1.5%.\nOn Wednesday, the Office for National Statistics said that the UK consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation slowed to 3.1% in the year to September. \nHowever, inflation is expected to accelerate in the coming months due to a rise in energy costs as well as continuing disruption to UK and global supply chains.\nUnilever's chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, said: \"We expect inflation to be higher next year than this year.\"\nIt is not yet clear how Unilever's price rises will affect consumers. The company sells to businesses such as retailers, supermarkets and wholesalers who may or may not pass on higher costs to shoppers. \nBut Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said Unilever was facing a \"balancing act of not increasing prices so much that its products are no longer competitive\".\n\"It is a real test of the strength of the company's brands,\" she said. \"After all, will we really stick with branded soap at a materially higher price when there's an unbranded alternative sitting next to it on the shelf which is an order of magnitude cheaper?\n\"If enough consumers decide they can put up with a cheaper alternative then it would become a big problem for Unilever.\"\nUnilever's brands include Simple skin care, Sure deodorant and Vaseline. It also produces Marmite, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr stocks among many others.\nUnilever said it expected its full-year sales to grow between 3% and 5%, but that its profit margin would be unchanged.\nEarlier this week, the boss of the Food & Drink Federation warned that the hospitality industry, which includes restaurants and pubs, was seeing \"terrifying\" price inflation of between 14% and 18%. \nMark Derry, executive chairman of Brasserie Bar Co, which owns the Brasserie Blanc chain of restaurants and whose chef patron is Raymond Blanc, told the BBC that while trading was holding up well, costs were rising which means it would have to raise prices for diners.\n\"There is an inevitable effect of all of this inflation and that is that we will have to try and put prices up,\" he said \n\"At the moment, we've tried very hard to hold them because obviously we've come out of a very, very serious problem over the last year and a half and doing our best to control it, but I cannot see how it is possible not to put prices up, frankly.\" \nKraft Heinz, known for its tomato ketchup and baked beans, recently warned that people will have to get used to higher food prices.\nOn Wednesday, food giant Nestle revealed that it had also increased prices, which rose by 2.1% in the third quarter.\nThe maker of Kit-Kats, Nescaf\u00e9 and Purina pet products, said prices had risen on the back of higher energy and raw materials costs as well as transport.\nThe Financial Times reported that Nestle's chief executive, Mark Schneider, said \"inflation costs are rising faster than we can roll forward through pricing. The situation has not improved. If anything we are seeing further downsides compared to what we told you in the summer\"."

      "text": "An \"unacceptable\" level of Covid cases means ministers should trigger their Plan B for the pandemic in England, doctors say.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) accused the government of being \"wilfully negligent\" for not reimposing rules such as mandatory face masks.\nDaily UK infections have been above 40,000 for eight days in a row.\nNo 10 said ministers are \"monitoring the usual metrics\" on coronavirus and \"won't hesitate to act if need be\".\nBoris Johnson's official spokesman said that, while the government listened to a variety of voices, including doctors, \"we don't always agree\".\nHe said reports that a harsher so-called Plan C for England was in the works were \"not accurate\". \"Neither ministers nor officials are working on those proposals,\" he added.\nHealth Minister Edward Argar earlier said the NHS was not under \"unsustainable pressure\" which would justify further restrictions.\nHe told BBC Breakfast there were about 95,000 beds in NHS hospitals, with 7,000 occupied by Covid patients and 6,000 currently empty.\nUnder the government's plan for tackling Covid in England over the winter, the strategy currently in operation is Plan A.\nIt involves offering booster jabs to about 30 million people and offering a single vaccine dose to healthy 12 to 15-year-olds, as well as encouraging ventilation for indoor gatherings, hand-washing and face masks in crowded places.\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA's chairman, said doctors can \"categorically\" say that the \"time is now\" for starting Plan B.\nHe stressed that case numbers were comparable to March, when England was in lockdown, and were \"unheard of in similar European nations\".\n\"It is therefore incredibly concerning that [Mr Javid] is not willing to take immediate action to save lives and to protect the NHS,\" he said.\nBut Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Wednesday that \"at this point\" the government would not introduce its Plan B measures.\nThese include compulsory face coverings in certain places and Covid passports for entry to nightclubs and large events, as well as recommending working from home.\nMr Argar said Tory MPs should make their own minds up as to whether to wear a face covering while in the crowded Commons, after Mr Javid urged people in England to cover their faces in crowded places.\nBehavioural expert, Prof Robert West, who advises the government, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme politicians should lead the public when it comes to mask wearing.\nHe said it gave those who are undecided \"a kind of excuse if you like to say, 'If they're not doing it why should I do it?'\"\nMr Javid also warned insufficient vaccine uptake would make restrictions in England more likely.\nOver the last seven days, the number of Covid patients admitted to hospital has risen by 11% and the number of deaths has increased by 21%, compared with the previous week, although the number remains far below the peak in January.\nPlan B would bring England effectively in line with restrictions still in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIn Scotland, face coverings are still compulsory on public transport and in places such as shops; people are asked to continue working from home where possible; and people attending nightlife venues and large events must prove their vaccination status.\nSimilar rules apply in Wales' current winter planning scenario, dubbed Covid Stable.\nAs well as an existing requirement for face masks indoors and a focus on working from home, Northern Ireland has plans to introduce Covid passports and mandatory social distancing if hospital pressures become unsustainable.\nThe UK reported another 49,139 cases on Wednesday, and a further 179 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nAround 14% of people in the UK aged 12 and over remain unvaccinated.\nHow have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?  Have you experienced problems getting a booster jab?"

He managed to pull them out of these choppy waters... but in his bid to actually reach these rocks along the beach, he simply got exhausted and it was impossible for him to get out.\"\nMs Carassava said that locals, including two waiters, had also jumped into the water to help Mr Smith and his grandsons.\nShe added that the boys had been taken to hospital where they were treated for minor injuries.\n\"They saw their grandfather - a hero - effectively saving them but losing his life,\" she said.\nThe Cretapost website said life-saving aids were thrown out to Mr Smith and the boys.\nA local worker told the website: \"We tried to pull him ashore but the currents were very strong and we could not.\"\nDes Murray, chief executive of North Lanarkshire Council, said: \"The news about Jonathan has been a terrible shock to everyone who knew and worked with him at the council and beyond over many years.\n\"Jonathan was held in the highest regard, and the work he did to forge long-lasting links and friendships with communities and partners across North Lanarkshire is testament to the passion and tireless dedication he gave to everything he did.\"\nHe said Mr Smith was central in developing the council's Syrian Resettlement Programme in 2015, which has assisted a number of families who have fled conflict and provided them with a safe and secure future.\n\"He was also pivotal in community engagement and participation, maintaining relationships with many of our local community groups and addressing local needs,\" Mr Murray added.\n\"He was a wonderful, kind and considerate family man, who will be deeply missed and all our thoughts are with his family at this time.\"\nMeghan Gallagher MSP formerly worked with Mr Smith at North Lanarkshire Council.\nShe said: \"This is really sad news. He was a lovely man and always did his best to help communities across North Lanarkshire.\n\"Thoughts are with his family friends and colleagues.\"\nThe UK Foreign Office said it was supporting the family of a British man who had died in Crete and was in contact with the Greek authorities."

May the injured recover soon.\"\nWhile attributing the heavy rains to the climate crisis, experts have also cited hydro-power projects in the higher reaches of the Himalayas, and excessive and often unchecked construction on steep slopes which cause damage to the region's fragile ecology. \nExperts also say higher temperatures have meant lesser snow in the Himalayas - and this, coupled with heavy rains, is pushing large volumes of water downstream, triggering flash floods.\nThe southern coastal state of Kerala has also seen heavy rain since Friday.\nThousands of people have been moved to safety, with more than 1,600 homes destroyed or damaged."

      "text": "A British-built robot that uses cameras and a robotic arm to create abstract art has been released after Egyptian authorities detained it at customs.\nAi-Da, named after mathematician Ada Lovelace, was seized by border agents last week who feared her robotics may have been hiding covert spy tools.\nOfficials held the robot for 10 days, imperilling plans to show her work at the Great Pyramid of Giza on Thursday. \nThe UK's Embassy in Cairo told the BBC that it is \"glad\" the case is resolved. \n\"The Embassy is glad to see that Ai-Da the artist robot has now been cleared through customs,\" the embassy said in a statement. \"Customs clearance procedures can be lengthy, and are required before importation of any artworks or IT equipment.\"\nAccording to creator Aidan Meller, border guards seized Ai-Da because they had been suspicious of her modem, before then raising issues with her camera.\nMr Meller offered to remove the modem, but said that he could not remove the cameras, which are essential to Ai-Da's ability to paint. The robot uses AI algorithms to turn what is recorded through its camera into works of art. \n\"I can ditch the modems, but I can't really gouge her eyes out,\" he told the Guardian.\nHe praised the work of the UK ambassador, who Mr Meller said had \"been working through the night to get Ai-Da released,\" but pointed out that her late release meant it would be difficult to get her ready for the display on Thursday. \"We're right up to the wire now,\" he said. \nThe work was due to be part of the first contemporary art exhibition at the Pyramids in Egypt for 4,500 years.\nBoth Ai-Da and her sculpture had been sent in specialised flight cases by air cargo to Cairo before the \"Forever Is Now\" exhibition, which will run until 7 November. \nHer clay sculpture is an interpretation of the Greek riddle of the sphinx: what goes on four feet in the morning, two feet at noon and three feet in the evening? A human going through the stages of being a baby, an adult and finally old age using a walking stick. \nHer interpretation of the famous Greek riddle is a sculpture of Ai-Da with three legs.\nAi-Da was completed in 2019 and her artwork, which includes the first \"self-portrait with no self\" has been displayed at the Design Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Her family repeatedly appealed for her fianc\u00e9 and his family to cooperate with investigators, but he then went missing himself. \nHis parents told police they last saw him on 13 September - when he went hiking alone and never returned.\nMs Petito's body was eventually discovered in Wyoming on 19 September. A coroner ruled last week that she had been strangled to death and left for weeks before her body was found. \nMr Laundrie has not been charged with crimes relating to Ms Petito's killing, however, the FBI has issued a federal arrest warrant and charged him with fraudulently using her debit card after her death.\nA lawyer for Mr Laundrie's parents confirmed they were in the area where the items were discovered on Wednesday. \n\"Chris and Roberta Laundrie were at the reserve earlier today when human remains and some of Brian's possessions were located in an area where they had initially advised law enforcement that Brian may be,\" Steve Bertolino said.\nHe added the couple would \"wait for forensic identification of the remains\" before commenting further.\nMr Bertolino earlier told reporters that \"some articles\" had been discovered on a trail frequented by Mr Laundrie within a park where a car driven by him was earlier discovered. \nThe FBI's Tampa field office tweeted after the discovery that the nature reserve was closed to the public.\nFBI special agent Michael McPherson said that officers would likely be processing the scene for several days. \n\"I know you have a lot of questions, but we don't have all the answers yet,\" he told the media.\nThe plight of Gabby Petito has captured global attention and triggered a debate over the amount of attention accorded to missing white women compared with other missing persons.

      "tags": "Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "Former US President Donald Trump has announced plans to launch a new social media network, called TRUTH Social.\nHe said the platform would \"stand up to the tyranny of big tech\", accusing them of silencing opposing voices in the US.\nSocial media played a pivotal role in Mr Trump's bid for the White House and was his favourite means of communication as president.\nBut Mr Trump was banned from Twitter and suspended from Facebook after his supporters stormed the US Capitol.\nSocial media firms were under pressure throughout Mr Trump's presidency to ban him, with his posts criticised as insulting, inflammatory or peddling outright falsehoods.\nLast year Twitter and Facebook began deleting some of his posts or labelling them as misleading, such as one in which he said Covid was \"less lethal\" than the flu. \nThey took the decision to ban or suspend Mr Trump after the January riots, which followed a speech in which he made baseless claims of electoral fraud.\nResponding to the riots, Mr Trump called those at the Capitol \"patriots\" and showed no sign of accepting the result of the election, prompting Twitter and Facebook to rule that it was too risky to allow him to continue to use their sites. \nSince then he and his advisers have hinted that they were planning to create a rival social media site.\nEarlier this year, he launched From the Desk of Donald J Trump, which was often referred to as a blog.\nThe website was permanently shut down less than a month after it launched after attracting only a fraction of the audience he would have expected through established sites. \nHis senior aide Jason Miller said it was \"just auxiliary to the broader efforts we have and are working on\".\nAn early version of his latest venture, TRUTH Social, will be open to invited guests next month, and will have a \"nationwide rollout\" within the first three months of 2022, according to a statement by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG).\n\"We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favourite American President has been silenced,\" wrote Mr Trump.\n\"Everyone asks me why doesn't someone stand up to Big Tech? Well, we will be soon!\" he added.\nDonald Trump's team is making a big deal of this.  Yet there's no indication that the new company has a working platform yet. The new site is just a registration page. \nHe wants to create a platform that rivals Twitter or Facebook, but that simply won't happen.\nBy its very nature the platform is overtly politicised. It is not going to be a talking shop of ideas like Twitter, or a place the whole family is on like Facebook. \nWhat it could be is a more successful version of other 'free speech' social media platforms like Parler or Gab. \nDonald Trump clearly wants his megaphone back. He thinks this might be his ticket. But if he's really going to be heard, he needs the Big Tech platforms to let him back on - and that's not going to happen anytime soon. \nTMTG, which he chairs, also intends to launch a subscription video-on-demand service.\nTMTG said its video-on-demand service would \"feature 'non-woke' entertainment programming, news, podcasts, and more\".\nMr Trump's announcement comes months after his former aide Jason Miller launched another social media company called GETTR.\nHis criticism, that social media silences conservative voices, is shared by many Republicans, although Facebook data shows that figures such as Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino, as well as outlets like Fox News and The Daily Caller, consistently appear among the site's top performing posts. \nMr Trump retains a strong hold over the the Republican party. He has hinted that he will run again in 2024 but has made no formal announcement. He has also kept his profile up with public rallies. "

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Agriculture,Department for International Trade,Economic effects of Brexit,Jacinda Ardern,Brexit,New Zealand,Trade",
      "text": "The UK has agreed a free trade deal with New Zealand which it says will benefit consumers and businesses.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the deal will cut costs for exporters and open up New Zealand's job market to UK professionals.\nThe government hopes it is a step towards joining a trade club with the likes of Canada and Japan.\nThe New Zealand deal itself is unlikely to boost UK growth, according to the government's own estimates.\nOverall, only a tiny proportion of UK trade is done with New Zealand, less than 0.2%.\nLabour and the National Farmers Union (NFU) said the deal could hurt UK farmers and lower food standards.\nBut International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said it \"affords opportunities in both directions for great sharing of produce\" and British farmers should not be worried.\nMr Johnson and New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, agreed the pact in a video call on Wednesday after 16 months of negotiations.\nTariffs will be removed on UK goods including clothing, ships and bulldozers, and on New Zealand goods including wine, honey and kiwi fruits.\nProfessionals such as lawyers and architects will be able to work in New Zealand more easily, the government said.\nHowever, the deal is not likely to increase UK economic growth - or GDP - according to the UK government's own assessments. New Zealand will fare slightly better as it may be able to sell more lamb to the UK.\nBut, like the trade deal recently struck with Australia, the UK hopes this is a step towards joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) - a trade bloc that includes Australasia, Canada, Mexico and Japan among others.\nThe UK already has deals with many of the members, rolled over from when it was in the EU. But CPTPP membership would give it more access in terms of services and digital trade.\nIn a video of the deal being struck, Mr Johnson said: \"We've scrummed down, we've packed tight, and together we've got the ball over the line and we have a deal. And I think it's a great deal.\"\nMs Ardern said: \"I loved your use of rugby metaphors, but if we were going to continue that on, then naturally it would conclude with the All Blacks winning.\n\"And I know that New Zealand feels that way with this free trade agreement, but actually, it's good for both of us, as it happens.\"\nThe NFU said the deal, like the one with Australia, could have a \"huge downside\", especially for UK dairy and meat farmers.\nIts president, Minette Batters, said the Australia and New Zealand deals mean \"we will be opening our doors to significant extra volumes of imported food - whether or not produced to our own high standards - while securing almost nothing in return for UK farmers\".\n\"The fact is that UK farm businesses face significantly higher costs of production than farmers in New Zealand and Australia, and it's worth remembering that margins are already tight here due to ongoing labour shortages and rising costs on farm,\" she said. \n\"The government is now asking British farmers to go toe-to-toe with some of the most export-orientated farmers in the world, without the serious, long-term and properly funded investment in UK agriculture that can enable us to do so.\nEmily Thornberry, shadow trade secretary, said the government's own figures showed the deal would \"cut employment in our farming communities, produce zero additional growth, and generate just \u00a3112m in additional exports for UK firms compared to pre-pandemic levels\".\nShe added that the only winners were \"the mega-corporations who run New Zealand's meat and dairy farms\".\n\"As our economy recovers from the pandemic, we need trade deals that will boost jobs and growth, open up big new markets for UK exporters, and support our objectives to buy, make and sell more in Britain. This trade deal with New Zealand fails on every count,\" she said.\nThe international trade secretary said British farmers should not be concerned about increased lamb imports because the lambing seasons were different in the UK and New Zealand.\nAnne-Marie Trevelyan said: \"I'm very comfortable it's a complimentary - because of the seasons\u2026 consumers will have more choice.\" \nShe said trade with New Zealand was currently worth \u00a32.3bn a year but had the potential to increase by up to 30% by 2030.\nAnalysis: Ramzan Karmali, BBC Business reporter\nA bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc could cost 20p less as a result of this trade deal and other products like Manuka honey and kiwi fruits could also cost less.\nIn terms of overall trade, even by the UK government's own analysis a tariff free trade deal will make no difference at all to the country's GDP - the total value of the goods and services the UK produces. \nOverall the trade between the two countries is less than 0.2% of the UK total and in fact in 2018 New Zealand ranked as only our 53rd biggest trading partner.\nSo why does this deal matter?\nThe UK signed its first big post-Brexit deal with Japan last year and in June it also signed a draft agreement for a trade deal with Australia.\nBoth countries, as well as New Zealand, are members of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership or CPTPP. \nThe combined GDP for the 11 nations that form the CPTPP in 2020 was \u00a38.4trn - one of the key reasons given by the UK government when it formally applied earlier this year. \nThis deal is the first agreed during the tenure of Britain's new Secretary of State for International Trade, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who took over from Liz Truss last month.\nShe believes that by getting this deal done the UK's application to the CPTPP will be looked upon more favourably.\nThat being said, the trade deal the UK really wants is with the US.\nBut with the recent change in administration in the White House that seems further away."

      "text": "Government borrowing fell in September compared with a year earlier as the economy continued to recover from coronavirus lockdowns.\nBorrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - stood at \u00a321.8bn, which was \u00a37bn less than in September 2020.\nBut the figure was still the second-highest for September since monthly records began in 1993. \nBorrowing hit record levels during the pandemic.\nThe government spent billions of pounds on emergency measures to protect wages, such as the furlough scheme, which wrapped up last month.\nAs a result, government debt has been pushed up to more than \u00a32.2 trillion at the end of September this year - about 95.5% of the UK's gross domestic product (GDP), and the highest level recorded since the early 1960s.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that the government has borrowed a total of \u00a3108.1bn so far in the current financial year (April to September), although this is \u00a3101.2bn less than in the same period last year.\nAs well as higher spending on Covid measures, the government has collected less in tax receipts during the pandemic, having given some badly-affected firms tax holidays from VAT, for example. \nAs a result of a lower income from taxes and higher spending, the ONS now estimates that in the 2020-21 financial year the government borrowed \u00a3319.9bn. That amounted to 14.9% of GDP, the highest rate seen since the end of World War Two.\nSome government sources of income have started to recover more recently. In September, the amount it collected through Value Added Tax (VAT) rose by 4.5% in comparison with the same month a year earlier. \nFuel duty payments were also up by 6%, although alcohol and tobacco tax takes fell by 12.7% and 7% respectively.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak is due to deliver a new Budget and growth forecasts on 27 October, as well as new multi-year spending limits for individual government departments.\nThe monthly borrowing figure for September was lower than economists had expected. However, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that while the picture had improved for the government ahead of next week's Budget, he did not expect a \"major fiscal giveaway\".\n\"Borrowing has fallen much more quickly than almost everyone expected,\" he said.\n\"That said, the rumours are that the chancellor will still keep a very tight grip on the public finances in next Wednesday's Budget to try and bring down borrowing even quicker and build a fiscal war chest to deploy ahead of the 2024 election.\"\nIn response to the latest official figures, the chancellor said that although debt levels have risen, \"our recovery is well underway - with more employees on payrolls than ever before and the fastest forecast growth in the G7 this year\".\n\"At the Budget and Spending Review next week, I will set out how we will continue to support public services, businesses and jobs while keeping our public finances fit for the future.\"\nProf David Miles, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee and professor of financial economics at Imperial College, warned that there could be \"a long struggle ahead\" for the chancellor.\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"The debt came down very rapidly after the end of the Napoleonic wars, the First World War, the Second World War. \n\"All those people who had been in the army and the other armed forces came back into employment, tax revenue went up, the government was spending less on armaments - that's not going to happen now, so I think it is considerably more difficult to bring down the stock of debt to GDP than it was in the aftermath of those earlier wars.\"\nIn recent years, the government has been able to borrow easily at very low interest rates, which makes its debt more affordable.\nBut rising inflation means that the Bank of England may increase interest rates soon, in an attempt to ensure the cost of living does not increase too quickly.\nThe Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, warned on Sunday that it \"will have to act\" over rising inflation soon.\nAlthough he did not give any indication as to when it might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%, investors are expecting rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022.\nWhat's striking in the public sector finance figures is not how big the borrowing or debt is in the financial year to date. That's the same story we've known for months: the second-highest borrowing in peacetime, second only to last year's even more extraordinary amounts. \nWhat's newer, and more eyebrow-raising, is what the figures show about how rapidly borrowing can fall, before any spending cuts or tax rises have taken effect, simply because the economy is growing. \nWith expected growth this year of 7% or more, tax money is flowing into the Exchequer far faster than was anticipated at the last Budget. And much of the emergency spending required in the more severe lockdown last year no longer has to be spent because the economy has, mostly, reopened. Public sector borrowing (the amount government has to borrow to plug the gap between its income and its spending) has nearly halved, dropping by more than \u00a3100bn.  \nNot only that: all the borrowing accumulated over the years, also known as net debt, is also falling, down two percentage points, from 97.6% of gross domestic product in August to 95.5% in September. \nBoth borrowing and debt are falling, not because of any economic hairshirt the chancellor is requiring us all to wear, but because a successful vaccination programme has helped the economy to recover.

      "tags": "Florida",
      "text": "Human remains found in a Florida park on Wednesday are those of Brian Laundrie, the fianc\u00e9 of murdered blogger Gabby Petito, the FBI says.\nThe body of Mr Laundrie, who had been missing for over a month, was identified using dental records. \nMr Laundrie, who was a person of interest in Gabby Petito's death, returned to Florida last month from a joint road trip without his partner. \nHer body was later found in Wyoming, where the couple had been travelling. \n\"On October 21, 2021, a comparison of dental records confirmed that the human remains found at the T Mabry Carlton Jr Memorial Reserve and Myakkahatchee Creed Environmental Park are those of Brian Laundrie,\" the FBI said in a statement on Thursday.\nA lawyer representing Mr Laundrie's parents released a statement, saying: \"Chris and Roberta Laundrie have been informed that the remains found yesterday in the reserve are indeed Brian's. \n\"We have no further comment at this time and we ask that you respect the Laundries' privacy at this time.\"\u00a0\nOn Wednesday, officials said that the remains had been discovered in a part of the park that until recently had been underwater. Other items, including a backpack and notebook belonging to Brian, were also found during the search. \nAccording to NBC News, bones and a skull were discovered during the search. \nIn a short news conference on Thursday, Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno praised officials for working under \"treacherous conditions\" in the park. \nHe described the chest-deep water as being filled with rattlesnakes and alligators. \n\"It's not like you're searching a house or a car. These areas are huge and they are covered by water,\" he told reporters gathered outside the closed park. \nThe case of Ms Petito, 22, and Mr Laundrie, 23, sparked nationwide media attention.\nThe couple had spent their summer on a road trip through national parks, documenting their nomadic \"van life\" trip on social media.\nMs Petito's parents reported her missing on 11 September after they were unable to contact her since the end of August.\nIt eventually emerged that Mr Laundrie had returned to Florida without Ms Petito on 1 September. Her family repeatedly appealed for her fianc\u00e9 and his family to co-operate with investigators, but he then went missing himself.\nHis parents told police they last saw him on 13 September - when he went hiking alone and never returned.\nThe parents, who have been condemned by the Petito family for not doing more to aid investigators, joined the search party on Wednesday. Chris Laundrie, the father, was the person who discovered a bag belonging to his son, the family lawyer told US media.\nThe rapid discovery of Mr Laundrie's remains and other evidence following the participation of his parents in the search has led some to speculate that they may have planted his remains or evidence. \nHowever, Steve Bertolino, the couple's attorney, told CNN that any suspicion that his clients planted evidence at the scene was \"hogwash\".\nHe added that Chris Laundrie had made a chance discovery.\u00a0\nMs Petito's body was eventually discovered in Wyoming on 19 September. A coroner ruled last week that she had been strangled to death and left for weeks before her body was found.\nMr Laundrie was not charged with crimes relating to Ms Petito's killing. However, the FBI issued a federal arrest warrant and charged him with fraudulently using her debit card after her death."

      "tags": "Global economy,Tax avoidance",
      "text": "Major tax evasion and avoidance schemes have cost governments an estimated \u20ac150bn (\u00a3127bn) in lost revenues, research shows.\nSo-called cum-cum and cum-ex schemes are designed to exploit weaknesses in national tax laws.\nThey apply to the payments, or dividends, firms make to shareholders.\nThe new figures have been calculated by a team of experts at the University of Mannheim, in partnership with the German not-for-profit group Correctiv.\nEvidence from leaked documents and people involved in the schemes suggests UK taxpayers have also lost out, potentially to the tune of billions of pounds.\nThe research forms part of a joint investigation carried out by newsrooms worldwide, co-ordinated by Correctiv, known as the CumEx Files 2.0. It casts new light on a growing scandal which first came to public attention in 2018.\nSo-called cum-ex trades were transactions where shares were sold from one investor to another immediately before the payment of a dividend (cum, or with, dividend) but delivered afterwards (ex-dividend). \nThis tactic effectively created confusion over who owned the shares at the moment when the dividend was paid. It allowed both parties to claim rebates on withholding tax - a levy which had only been paid once, when the dividend was issued.\nThis practice became popular in Germany in the early years of the century and continued until 2012, when the law was changed. It also spread to other countries, notably Denmark, but also France, Belgium, Italy and Austria. \nIn Germany, prosecutors have launched a wave of criminal inquiries.\nSeveral individuals have already been found guilty of tax evasion. Some 1,000 people are currently under investigation, including junior and senior banking staff, lawyers and brokers. \nA list acquired by German broadcaster ARD's investigative programme Panorama contains the names of more than 700 of those under scrutiny, of whom 134 are known to be UK citizens.\nAlthough London has been widely identified as the place where many cum-ex trading strategies were conceived, the UK exchequer was not a target - because dividends here are not subject to withholding tax.\nBut documents show that bankers were able to carry out related trades to \"recycle\" otherwise unusable German tax credits and generate profits at UK taxpayers' expense.\nThe complex system relied on so-called \"manufactured overseas dividends\" (MODs), payments made between parties involved in so-called short sales of borrowed shares in foreign companies.\nIt allowed investors to generate liabilities which could be offset against German tax credits and at the same time, generate a credit against UK tax. \nEstimates vary as to how much this scheme actually cost the UK taxpayer. One individual who was involved in these kinds of trades in the past suggested it would have been several hundred million pounds a year until 2005 - and more than \u00a3100m per year thereafter. \nAnother whistleblower told the BBC that \"these were not small trades\", and that the practice \"must have been used on a significant scale\".\nIn 2014, HMRC changed the rules on taxation of MODs. It says this was done for a variety of reason, including to \"reduce the potential for tax avoidance\".\nWhile the fallout from the cum-ex affair has dominated media attention and prosecutor interest so far, the latest findings from Correctiv's investigation suggest an even bigger scandal may be brewing.\nCum-ex is understood to have cost governments nearly \u20ac10bn. But according to researchers at the University of Mannheim, that figure is dwarfed by losses stemming from another long-standing form of dividend arbitrage, known as cum-cum.\nThis strategy comes into play in countries where domestic and foreign investors are treated differently for tax purposes. A foreign investor will sell or loan shares just ahead of the dividend payment to a second investor resident in the country where the company is listed.\nThe second party is able to claim a dividend tax credit that would not have been available to the foreign investor. The shares can then be passed back to the original owner, and the benefits shared. \nThe Mannheim team has calculated that between 2000 and 2020, this practice cost 10 governments, including those of Germany, Spain, France and the US, a total of \u20ac141bn. It describes this estimate as \"very conservative\". \nWhether these losses will lead to prosecutions is less clear, however. \nWhile cum-ex involved generating multiple claims for withholding tax that had only been paid once, and its use has been described as a \"criminal act of tax fraud\" by Germany's Federal Court of Justice, experts say cum-cum sits in a legally grey area. \n\"It's not against the law,\" explains Christoph Spengel, a professor of international taxation and the leader of the Mannheim team.\n\"But in individual cases, in Germany it is against the law if the sole purpose of buying and repurchasing shares is to have a tax benefit.\""

We want to see this as a platform for development for a career. We don't know yet if they'll be a new artist but if they are we want to make sure this is going to be a really positive experience.\"\nSpeaking to The Sun, Dua Lipa said: \"I'm a proud Brit whilst also being a proud Kosovan. I'm happy to lend my manager to the cause. I'll be cheering them on!\"\nDespite the lack of success in recent years the appetite for Eurovision is clearly still strong for viewers in Britain.\nThis year's Eurovision Song Contest was won by Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin, whose song Zitti E Buoni became a top 20 UK hit. Their victory was watched by an average audience of 7.8 million on BBC One, making it the most watched final since 2014.\nSpeaking of the hook-up with Tap, BBC entertainment boss Kate Phillips said that the corporation has \"grand ambitions\" for the 2022 contest, and was \"really excited to announce this collaboration that will enable us to tap into some great music talent.\"\nThe competition will take place at Turin's PalaOlimpico Arena on May 10, 12 and 14, with the final landing on the latter date.\nThe European Broadcasting Union announced on Wednesday that all 39 countries that took part last time out are set to return next year, plus two additional ones - Montenegro and Armenia.\nItaly has previously hosted the contest in Naples and Rome.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "The government has laid out its plans to reduce emissions sharply by 2035 and take the UK towards being a zero carbon economy by 2050. These including more electric cars, planting trees and moving away from gas-powered central heating.\nBut what potential hazards are there ahead for ministers?\nSome in the prime minister's own party doubt the economic arguments in favour of moving towards what they consider an over-reliance on renewable energy sources.\nConservative MP John Redwood asked in the House of Commons what would happen when the sun stopped shining and the wind stopped blowing. Another, Steve Baker, said a lot of \"assumptions\" were involved and asked that ministers carry out a \"comprehensive audit\" of their plans. \nOthers are concerned about the cost to the general public, particularly those on lower incomes, and the impact that, in turn, may have on their chances at the next election. \nCraig Mackinlay said it could become \"electorally difficult\" once people realised the plans \"cost them money\" or mean \"a lifestyle that's not as convenient\".\nGiven that the Conservatives have an 80-seat majority, this is unlikely to stop any plans becoming law, but if some of Mr Johnson's backbenchers are not persuaded, there could be some political turbulence.\nShadow business secretary Ed Miliband was scathing in his response to the government's announcement, saying there was nothing like \"the commitment we believe is required\", in terms of investment, to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nLabour's commitment to borrow and invest \u00a328bn per year in tackling climate change is a markedly different approach to the Conservatives. The Treasury has said borrowing heavily to cut greenhouse gases goes against the \"polluter pays\" principle and passes the costs on to future taxpayers. \nIt's not certain how this will play out in Parliament or whether this could become an important dividing line between the parties - and how it would play with voters.\nThe Treasury accepts there will be an overall cost to achieving net zero emissions in the short term, but sources stress the cost of inaction would also be significant. \nNo overall figure is given but officials admit new taxes will be needed to recoup the revenue lost from the move away from petrol and diesel fuelled cars, for example.  \nThe government raised \u00a337bn from fuel duty and vehicle excise duty in the 2019-20 financial year, or about 1.7% of GDP.\nA carbon tax could plug some of this, but the takings would dwindle as emissions fall, leaving a big shortfall.\nIn an assessment to go with the government's carbon-cutting plans, the Treasury said that \"as with all economic transitions, ultimately the costs and benefits of the transition will pass through to households through the labour market, prices and asset values\".\nThere is evidence of public support for stronger measures to tackle climate change, but if households end up having to spend a lot more money to go greener, there could be increased unease among voters that the government will not want ahead of a likely general election in the next couple of years.\nIn particular, it is feared this could go down badly in some of the former industrial areas of the the Midlands and northern England where the Conservatives made large gains from Labour in 2019.\n\"Any policies we bring in will be designed to be fair across the board,\" the PM's spokesman said.\nOne thing most governments agree on is that any effort to reduce emissions must be international if it is to succeed in limiting temperature rises.\nWith the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow fast approaching, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hope his plan prompts other countries to make similar commitments and boost the chances of the UK brokering a renewed global effort to cut greenhouse gases. \nIf the world's biggest CO2 producers - including the US, China and India - reach an agreement it could ease domestic political pressures and allow him to claim more of an environmental \"legacy\".\nUS President Jo Biden and Indian PM Narendra Modi are attending COP26, but China's Xi Jinping is not thought likely to do the same."

I rang Exeter and then Guernsey and that's when they told me they had lost contact.\n\"I was very concerned and distressed. I feared the worst.\"\nThe single-engine Piper Malibu aircraft was carrying the 28-year-old striker and Mr Ibbotson when it went down 22 nautical miles north-west of Guernsey on the evening of 21 January 2019.\nAsked how he felt at the time, Mr Henderson said: \"The whole scenario - to lose an aeroplane and a person I know and a passenger - I was very badly affected by the news.\"\nHe added he had been suffering from \"anxiety\" since, and \"barely an hour goes by without it being in my mind\".\nFay Keely, who owned the plane, told the court on she had informed Mr Henderson that Mr Ibbotson should not fly the aircraft again after she was notified by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of two infringements that had happened while he was in the air.\nMs Keely said: \"As far as I was concerned, I had made my feelings clear that he shouldn't be flying the aircraft.\"\nHowever, Mr Henderson said he phoned Ms Keely after receiving the order from her by email to explain the situation, and that he had changed her mind about Mr Ibbotson.\nHe told the court: \"I said he's [Mr Ibbotson] mortified by it and admitted his mistake and that it won't happen again.\"\nHe added: \"I believe I'd brought her around about David Ibbotson.\"\nStephen Spence, defending, asked Mr Henderson: \"If you thought there was a problem, would you have used him to fly her sister a month later?\"\nHe replied: \"No.\"\nThe court heard how Henderson had got his private pilot's licence in 1983 after serving in the RAF for two years, later getting a commercial licence to fly in the UK and America. \nHe said he used this to co-pilot and travelled \"literally all over the world\".\nEarlier, as the prosecution drew its case to a close, the court heard more about Mr Henderson's version of how the flight came about by means of a letter sent to the CAA in April 2020.\nThe letter was read to the jury by Stephen Hunt, from the CAA.\nIn the document, Mr Henderson said he had received a phone call from football agent Willie McKay asking for an aircraft between 18 and 21 January, 2019.\nMr Henderson was in France at the time but said Mr McKay was \"very persistent, so I offered to see if there were any other pilots who were available\".\nHe said he sent Mr Ibbotson a text message saying: \"Do you fancy a weekend in Nantes?\" Mr Ibbotson replied: \"Yes.\"\nMr Henderson said there was no discussion about payment at the time, and he had \"previously made it clear to Mr McKay that the flights were private\".\nThe letter also outlined his relationship with Ms Keely, the owner of the plane.  \nHe said: \"I was never paid a fee by Miss Keely - she offered me the use of the aircraft on a fuel-only basis.\n\"She was happy for me to allow hire of the aircraft to suitable parties.\"\nThe letter also said Mr Ibbotson had called Mr Henderson when he arrived in Nantes, and highlighted \"a soft pedal issue and an oil leak\", adding: \"He thought he had heard a bang on the descent into Nantes.\"\nMr Ibbotson said he \"was obviously concerned about the issue\", but the court heard he had spoken to engineer David Smith who \"was satisfied the aircraft remained air worthy\".\nResponding to a question asking whether he accepted being the organiser of the flight, Mr Henderson said: \"While I accept that I looked after the aircraft, at the relevant time the person who had control of the aircraft was Mr Ibbotson.\"\nHe added: \"At no time was there any reason for me to believe Mr Ibbotson was not qualified to fly the aircraft.\"\nThe court has previously heard Mr Ibbotson did not hold a commercial pilot's licence, was not allowed to fly at night and that his rating to fly the Piper Malibu had expired.\nThe trial continues.

      "text": "A woman who said she had her drink spiked in a pub felt \"gaslighted\" by police officers after trying to find a way to verify it.\nRobyn, 26, blacked out after just a few drinks with friends in Caerphilly county and said she was \"sent round in circles\" trying to be taken seriously.\nIt comes as a boycott of clubs in some cities will take place, including Cardiff, on 29 October.\nGwent Police said anyone dissatisfied with their service could contact them.\nCh Supt Mark Hobrough added: \"Across the organisation, officers and staff are committed to providing a high quality of service to all those they come into contact with.\"\nRobyn was out when she said she \"just blacked out\" after only having a few drinks.\nShe has no recollection of her fianc\u00e9e picking her up and was told the next morning she was \"a mess\", having collapsed on the floor.\nShe said she knew she had been spiked and called 101 and 111.\nShe was sent to A&E, where she was told they could not perform the test.\nShe then contacted the police again and said she was \"treated like a criminal\" and described the experience as \"just awful\".\nShe felt officers were \"accusatory\" towards her for drinking and said the \"mental gymnastics\" she went through \"took its toll\".\nGaslighting is defined as manipulating someone into thinking they are wrong even when they are right. \nPolice closed the case as \"no offences were identified\".\nTests can be done to see if drugs are in a person's system, but it needs to be within 12 to 72 hours.\nRobyn said the processes were not there to allow this and even though she \"pushed hard\", she would be put off reporting again as she does not think it is taken seriously.\nShe said: \"It happened in a place I really did not expect it to happen and that is what scared me.\n\"It isn't about me, it is about other people and I feel really worried for women who have got to go through the same thing.\n\"They don't seem to take it seriously unless something really bad has happened, but people getting spiked against their will is bad in itself.\n\"There needs to be intervention to stop something worse happening.\"\nA campaign in Cardiff called Girls' Night In  is encouraging people to boycott clubs in order to have drink spiking taken more seriously.\nSimilar events are also happening in Leeds, Edinburgh and Nottingham.\nOrganiser Sophie - not her real name -  said the Instagram page got daily messages of people's experiences being spiked and the support was \"overwhelming\".\nThe stories vary from being safely taken home by friends to being injected with needles or sexually assaulted, she said.\n\"It's all well and good telling people it's not good enough but actually doing something to make clubs change is something else.\n\"As victims I don't think you should be expected to protect yourselves.\"\nShe added that training needs to implemented in bars \"so it can be spotted\", as well as tests and bottle caps being available in every bar as a temporary measure.\nKatie Snaith, 20, is a second year history student at Cardiff University.\nWhen she had her drink spiked, she \"blacked out\" for the whole night and lost control of her body, becoming \"violently ill\".\nShe reported it to the police and students' union the next day but said she was told not much could come of it as she did not take a test.\nKatie takes anti-depressants and said people on medication could be given something that could kill them.\nShe said: \"I'm always very careful, so I think my friends were a bit confused as to why I was behaving in a way they've never seen me like before.\n\"It's not my fault I'm on medication and it's not my fault that I got spiked but you then kind of internalise it and feel like it was your mistake and think 'I should have done more, this, that or the other'.\n\"I think it's quite scary. You're always taught to be safe but even within your own union, with students who study at same place as you, you're not safe with them.\n\"It's hard to feel safe anywhere.\"\nFigures obtained by the BBC in 2019 revealed a rise in recorded cases of drink spiking, with more than 2,600 reported incidents in England and Wales since 2015.\nHelena Conibear, CEO of the Alcohol Education Trust, said the reported numbers were not reflective as many people did not report it or even know they have been spiked.\nShe said spiking happened at festivals or house parties, which meant it was not always strangers that people need to be wary of.\nLat week, the charity opened a survey and had almost 800 responses in five days.\nOut of the respondents, 16% of women, 8% of men and 17% of people identifying as other said they had been spiked.\nOf these, 91% did not report it to police, which Ms Conibear said could be down to embarrassment or fear of not being believed.\nMs Conibear said: \"This is not something that is not funny or a joke. It can be life changing for the person who's been spiked.\"\nShe said it was important to report it as quickly as possible to prevent it happening to others."

      "tags": "Obesity,Eating disorders",
      "text": "A Conservative ex-minister has urged the government to \"tell people they must not eat so much\" in an effort to stop them getting \"grossly overweight\".\nLord Robathan said the current anti-obesity strategy for England was not working and there had to be more emphasis on personal responsibility.\nIt should not be \"socially acceptable\" to be very overweight, he added.\nBut the government said it was important not to create more anxiety for people with eating disorders.\nAccording to official figures, 28% of adults in England are obese - meaning fat accounts for more than 30% of body weight - with the rate almost doubling from 15% since 1993.\nAnd during the pandemic more than 40% of adults in England gained weight, according to a survey by Public Health England.\nBut the charity Beat estimates about 1.25 million adults in the UK have an eating disorder, such as anorexia, bulimia or binge eating disorder.\nThe government's anti-obesity strategy for England, published last year, says losing weight is \"not just about an individual's effort\", and calls for healthy food options, and better nutritional advice, to be made more widely available.\nSpeaking in the House of Lords, Lord Robathan, a former Conservative MP, responded: \"I'm glad the government recognises the huge problem this is and the dangers that being overweight bring, especially during Covid. But... the strategy, as good as it might be, is not actually working.\n\"Is it not time, perhaps, to revert to the situation when I was young, when it was not socially acceptable to be grossly overweight and push individual responsibility?\n\"The government's policy should tell people they must not eat so much.\"\nHealth minister Lord Kamall replied: \"One of the things we always have to be careful about with any strategy or programme is the unintended consequences.\" \nHe added that the government was also focusing on \"not creating more problems and concerns and anxiety for those who suffer from eating disorders\".\nLord Kamall said health officials had been looking in detail at policy on obesity and that \"further details will be made available\" at a later date."

      "text": "Home Secretary Priti Patel has asked police forces for an update following a number of cases of women reporting being spiked by needles in nightclubs.\nPolice chiefs have also been tasked by the Commons Home Affairs Committee to urgently assess the scale of the problem around the country.\nOne student, who believes she was injected in a Nottingham club, said she felt \"vulnerable\" and \"violated\".\nLabour said the reports were \"vile\" and \"terrifying\", and called for action.\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds urged Ms Patel to \"deliver action without delay\" and ensure \"those responsible\u2026 face the full force of the law\".\nMore than 100,000 people have signed a petition calling for compulsory searches at nightclubs after a number of reported spikings by needle.\nGroups from more than 30 universities around the UK have joined an online campaign calling for the boycott of nightclubs.\nCampaigners say they are seeking \"tangible\" changes to make night-time venues safer, such as covers or stoppers for drinks and better training for staff.\nSarah Buckle, who is studying at the University of Nottingham, was on a night out in Nottingham on 28 September when she suddenly became ill.\nShe described how one moment she was fine, the next she couldn't get her words out or stay standing.\nShe woke up the next morning in hospital with a small pinprick on her hand, which later bruised and throbbed, she said.\n\"I've had too much to drink before and this was completely different,\" she said.\n\"To be in hospital for 10 hours, and to have no recollection of anything for that long, is absolutely crazy.\n\"I'm confused by why this is going on, it's terrifying. You can cover your drinks but how are you going to stop someone stabbing you?\"\nNottinghamshire Police confirmed it was looking into reports of people being \"spiked physically\".\nThe University of Nottingham said it was \"extremely concerned\" by the reports and was working with police and venues to \"monitor, review and learn from incidents and experiences in the city centre\".\nOther police forces have confirmed there have been reports of injection spiking happening on nights out.\nPolice Scotland said its officers were investigating a \"small number of reports\" from Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow, which did not appear to be linked.\nAnd West Yorkshire Police said inquiries were ongoing into one report of spiking by injection in Leeds last week.\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said it was difficult to assess whether spiking by needle was becoming a national trend as only a handful of reports had been made to police.\nSarah Crew, the NPCC's lead officer for rape and adult sexual offences, said she has asked all police forces to look into the matter and offer support.\nShe added that it was a \"fair assumption\" that perpetrators of injection spiking have a \"sexual motive\", adding that general drink spiking was \"a problem\".\nMichael Kill, CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, said the organisation was \"very concerned\" about the reported increase in incidents and the industry would work with the Home Office to tackle the problem.\n\"It goes without saying that everyone should be able to enjoy a night out without fearing for their own safety, and we are saddened to hear that some don't feel this way,\" he said.\nThe call for a boycott against nightclubs across the UK comes under the name Girls' Night In and encourages people to stay away from clubs and do alternative activities instead.\nGirls' Night In Southampton's night of action is next Wednesday, one of the most popular student nights.\n\"We're calling for clubs and bars and all venues like that, to put more measures in place to protect people against spiking,\" one of the organisers, who wanted to stay anonymous, told BBC's Newsbeat.\nThey want to see covers handed out for cups, unattended drinks to be thrown out, increased surveillance and safe zones for people who may have been spiked.\nThe University of Southampton student said one of her group was spiked on a sports social last week, and taken outside by club security who thought she was drunk.\nShe was spotted by a friend who then alerted the rest of the group so they could go and look after her. She went to the hospital but did not tell the police about the incident, the student said."

      "text": "A Texas nurse has been found guilty of the murder of four patients who died after he injected them with air following heart surgeries. \nWilliam Davis, 37, was convicted of capital murder by a jury on Tuesday and could now face the death penalty. \nProsecutors said he targeted seven people from June 2017 to January 2018. \nChristus Mother Frances Hospital, where the attacks took place, said it hoped that the \"jury's verdict helps bring some closure to those harmed\".\nThe men, aged between 47 and 74, experienced \"seizure-like symptoms\" and died from fatal brain damage after the air was injected into their arterial lines. \nThe court heard that the four men killed by Mr Davis had initially been recovering well from their operations and that doctors had been at a loss as to how their conditions had deteriorated so rapidly. \nAuthorities said it was only once doctors saw CT scans that showed air in the patients' brains that they realised something was amiss. \nDr William Yarbrough, a Dallas based pulmonologist, told the jury that he had never observed such a case in his decades in medicine.\nDuring the trial, security footage was played of Davis entering the room of one of the patients, whose heart monitor alarm sounded just three minutes later. He later died from the injection. \nDavis' lawyer, Philip Hayes, claimed during the trial that there was no evidence that the men had died from foul play and suggested that Davis was being made a scapegoat for a hospital with serious procedural issues. \nSpeaking during the trial, Jacob Putman, the district attorney for Smith County in Texas, said that \"it turns out a hospital is the perfect place for a serial killer to hide\". \nProsecutors will now seek the death penalty for Davis, who they claim \"enjoyed\" carrying out the murders and \"liked to kill people\". \nDavis will remain in custody at the Smith County Jail on an $8.75 million bail bond.

      "title": "Covid: Why are UK cases so high?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines",
      "text": "Health leaders in England have called for Covid restrictions to be re-introduced ahead of winter, as cases rise.\nThanks to the vaccine, getting infected is now much less likely to land you in hospital. But soaring cases - which are outstripping some European nations - are still proving a cause for concern.\nThe more virus there is about, the more chances there are for it to break through the defences of vaccines, reach vulnerable people and put pressure on health services. \nThe number of people testing positive for Covid in the UK has been rising in recent days to more than 50,000 cases in one day.\nOver the past three months there have been roughly as many cases as there were over three months last winter, which allows us to compare the two time periods.\nBetween July and October this year, there were just over three million cases, with 79,000 people ending up in hospital. \nBetween October and January last year, there were just over 2.7 million cases, but more than 185,000 people needed hospital treatment. This was before vaccines were widely available.\nThese two charts show us the effect of the removal of restrictions and the rise of the Delta variant on the one hand in driving up cases, and the vaccination programme on the other in pushing down admissions.\nIn England, unvaccinated people were at least three times as likely to need hospital care as vaccinated people, according to the most recent Public Health England figures for the previous three weeks. \nIn the oldest group - the over-80s - 141 people in every 100,000 unvaccinated people ended up in hospital with Covid compared with 54 in every 100,000 vaccinated people. In the youngest - the under-18s - four unvaccinated people in every 100,000 needed overnight hospital treatment compared with zero in the vaccinated group. \nDeaths are also being kept at a much lower level than when cases were previously this high. \nSo what do we know about what's driving the rise in cases?\nUK residents were significantly more likely than people in Germany, France, Spain and Italy to say they no longer wear a face mask or covering.\nCovid cases are higher in the UK than in any of those countries - but we can't necessarily say that one is causing the other.\nStudy after study has shown face masks can help stop the virus from being passed between people. When it comes to measuring how much mask wearing reduces an outbreak, though, it's a lot more difficult to pin down. \nThat's because it's hard to untangle it from all the other things going on at the same time, like how much people choose to mix with each other. \nPeople in Sweden and the Netherlands were more likely than the UK to say they never wore a mask, according to a survey by Imperial College London. But these countries have fewer confirmed Covid cases than the UK.  \nWithin the UK, Scottish rules still require masks in most indoors places, while English ones don't. And people in Scotland - asked by the Office for National Statistics - were a bit more likely to say they had worn a face covering in the previous seven days. Yet the nation also saw a spike in hospital admissions in recent weeks. \nThe UK relaxed many restrictions sooner than most of the rest of Western Europe. People in England, Wales and Scotland have been able to go to nightclubs and attend gatherings of unlimited numbers of people since the summer, unlike in many other countries.\nImperial College survey data suggests people in the UK are slightly more likely than some of their nearest European neighbours to take public transport, and less likely to avoid going out.\nThe latest survey of contacts and mixing in the UK found that there had been relatively little change in recent weeks, with contact rates for children similar to those at the start of term. \nThere has been a gradual increase in the number of employees going to work in person, although it's still quite low, with only about half of employees going into their workplace if it was open. \nThe UK surged ahead in its rollout of the vaccine. That's undoubtedly saved many lives by preventing severe cases of Covid, but this early progress could give a clue as to why the country is facing higher cases now. \nA study - of Covid test results of vaccinated people who logged their symptoms in an app - suggested the vaccine's protection against catching the virus wanes significantly after five or six months. \nIn Israel, which originally led the world in terms of population vaccinated, scientists analysing their data said a spike in cases was down to falling protection from the jab. And cases levelled off once enough older people had been given a booster dose. \nWhat Israel tells us about the way out of Covid\nBoosters are now being given to older people in the UK - 3.7 million doses had been administered in England by 17 October.\nImportantly, protection against severe disease seems to remain high six months after vaccination. \nIt's true that the more infections are circulating, the higher the risk some people will end up seriously ill, even when most have been vaccinated. That's probably why hospital admissions in the UK are higher now than they were early in the summer when cases were lower. \nBut when you look at the overall numbers, we are seeing far fewer hospital admissions now than when cases were last this high and most people weren't vaccinated. \nThe UK's quick start in its vaccination rollout has stalled in recent months. Its rate of fully-vaccinated people no longer ranks in the top 10 countries with a population of at least one million.\nIn the first two weeks of October, the proportion of the British public aged 12 and over who had received at least one dose of the vaccine barely moved.  \nA government spokesperson said: \"The vaccination programme has significantly weakened the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths, and will continue to be our first line of defence against Covid-19.\n\"We encourage those who are eligible for a booster jab to come forward to ensure they have this vital extra protection as we approach winter.\"\nVaccinating children - how the UK compares \nThe UK's vaccination rate is slightly skewed by the low uptake of doses by children. Vaccines for 12-15-year-olds in the UK started on 20 September. So far, 15% of 12-15-year-olds in England have received one shot. This is compared to Israel, where more than half of 12-15-year-olds have had at least one shot. \nMost other European countries are now vaccinating over-12s, including France, which started rolling it out in June.

The drivers' announcements mimic those of pilots mentioning the weather conditions at your destination. \nBut it is the cheap prices that are most likely to appeal.\nLumo was granted permission to operate because it successfully argued that it would attract new passengers and not just steal them from existing rail services. \nIt's aiming to entice air passengers away principally from Edinburgh Airport, but from Newcastle and Luton airports too. \nThe first barrier for business travellers might be the fact that at launch none of Lumo's services gets into London until after 13:00, but the company says it's planning to introduce earlier services next year.\nLast month, Lumo's managing director Helen Wylde said travelling \"should not cost a fortune\", particularly in the current environmental climate.\n\"We are empowering people to make green travel choices that are genuinely affordable without compromising on comfort,\" she said.\nLumo said up until 1 December each trip \"will cost less than \u00a319.90 as long as it is booked at least one day before travel\".\nHowever, tweets since posted from Lumo's Twitter account outline \"up to 60% of tickets per service are under \u00a330\" and prices will vary depending on capacity.\nAnother tweet to a commuter said \"due to the popularity of our \u00a319.90 tickets, we have now reached capacity on most journeys\".\nSpeaking at the launch, Ms Wylde said tickets were \"selling beyond expectations\".\nLumo also announced Katie Price's son, Harvey Price, will be its diversity and inclusion brand ambassador."

For that reason, our Net Zero Strategy published yesterday contained no such plans,\" it said.\nThe Behavioural Insights Unit, also known as the Nudge Unit, wrote the document.\nThe unit is most known for its role in the design of the sugar levy and early comments on the pandemic \"herd immunity\" strategy.\nThe document was swiftly deleted and has been replaced with a note saying it was published in error, but BBC News obtained a copy.\nIt was also later put online by Alex Chapman, a researcher at the New Economics Foundation.\nThe Behavioural Insights Unit made a recommendation, following the example of the sugar levy, with a tax on producers or retailers of \"high-carbon foods\" to incentivise plant-based and local food diets.\nIt suggests \"building support for a bold policy\", such as a tax on producers of sheep and cattle meat.\nHowever, it states that an \"unsophisticated meat tax would be highly regressive\".\nThe research paper also says the government can begin to get people used to the idea of plant-based food through its spending at hospitals, schools, prisons, courts and military facilities.\nIt also states a \"timely moment to intervene\" in changing diets could be to target people attending university or first-time renters.\nThe document recognises that \"asking people to directly eat less meat and dairy is a major political challenge\", although a positive portrayal and \"smaller asks\" may be possible - for example, people learning one new recipe.\nWhen talking about flights, the paper suggests \"much stronger carbon taxes\".\nOne possibility discussed in the paper is trying to \"shift social norms\" to make in-person business meetings needing international flights a sign of \"immoral indulgence or embarrassment\" rather than a sign of \"importance\". \nMeanwhile, it says domestic tourism should be promoted to lessen consumer demand for international flights."

      "text": "The company behind brands such as PG Tips, Cornetto and Dove has said it will raise prices to cope with \"elevated levels\" of cost inflation which it expects to continue next year.\nConsumer goods giant Unilever said that it had already lifted its pricing. \nUnilever said this would continue across its global operations and within each of its product divisions.\nThe company reported a 2.5% rise in sales for the third quarter to 30 September.\nGrowth was supported by a 4.1% increase in prices while the volume of goods sold fell by 1.5%.\nOn Wednesday, the Office for National Statistics said that the UK consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation slowed to 3.1% in the year to September. \nHowever, inflation is expected to accelerate in the coming months due to a rise in energy costs as well as continuing disruption to UK and global supply chains.\nUnilever's chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, said: \"We expect inflation to be higher next year than this year.\"\nIt is not yet clear how Unilever's price rises will affect consumers. The company sells to businesses such as retailers, supermarkets and wholesalers who may or may not pass on higher costs to shoppers. \nBut Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said Unilever was facing a \"balancing act of not increasing prices so much that its products are no longer competitive\".\n\"It is a real test of the strength of the company's brands,\" she said. \"After all, will we really stick with branded soap at a materially higher price when there's an unbranded alternative sitting next to it on the shelf which is an order of magnitude cheaper?\n\"If enough consumers decide they can put up with a cheaper alternative then it would become a big problem for Unilever.\"\nUnilever's brands include Simple skin care, Sure deodorant and Vaseline. It also produces Marmite, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr stocks among many others.\nUnilever said it expected its full-year sales to grow between 3% and 5%, but that its profit margin would be unchanged.\nEarlier this week, the boss of the Food & Drink Federation warned that the hospitality industry, which includes restaurants and pubs, was seeing \"terrifying\" price inflation of between 14% and 18%. \nMark Derry, executive chairman of Brasserie Bar Co, which owns the Brasserie Blanc chain of restaurants and whose chef patron is Raymond Blanc, told the BBC that while trading was holding up well, costs were rising which means it would have to raise prices for diners.\n\"There is an inevitable effect of all of this inflation and that is that we will have to try and put prices up,\" he said \n\"At the moment, we've tried very hard to hold them because obviously we've come out of a very, very serious problem over the last year and a half and doing our best to control it, but I cannot see how it is possible not to put prices up, frankly.\" \nKraft Heinz, known for its tomato ketchup and baked beans, recently warned that people will have to get used to higher food prices.\nOn Wednesday, food giant Nestle revealed that it had also increased prices, which rose by 2.1% in the third quarter.\nThe maker of Kit-Kats, Nescaf\u00e9 and Purina pet products, said prices had risen on the back of higher energy and raw materials costs as well as transport.\nThe Financial Times reported that Nestle's chief executive, Mark Schneider, said \"inflation costs are rising faster than we can roll forward through pricing. The situation has not improved. If anything we are seeing further downsides compared to what we told you in the summer\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Sajid Javid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 50,000 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK for the first time since 17 July.\nAmid calls for more restrictions, Boris Johnson urged people to come forward for booster jabs when their time comes.\nThe prime minister said those who become eligible for a third dose of vaccine should organise an appointment straight away.\nThe UK recorded 52,009 new Covid cases on Thursday - alongside 115 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMr Johnson said, despite high cases, the government was \"continuing with its plan\" and that things were much better now than a year ago.\nHe said that was in large part thanks to the rollout of the vaccine, which has weakened the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths.\nReported cases on 17 July were 54,674 and came several weeks after more households could mix together and indoor hospitality resumed. \nDoctors are demanding ministers trigger England's \"Plan B\" - which would reimpose rules such as mandatory face masks and working from home advice.\nSpeaking in Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson said that the numbers of infections and deaths being seen were \"within the parameters of what the predictions were... given the steps we've taken\". \nIt was also because the country was in an \"incomparably better position than last year because of vaccines\" that there was more confidence around the current plan in place,\" he said.\nHe also insisted that the \"most important thing people can do is get that booster jab\" and that \"when you get the call, get the jab\".\nThe PM appealed for 12 to 15-years-old to get their first vaccination because there was \"no shortage of supply\" and there were \"huge quantities\" of vaccine available.\nAn estimated 4.7 million booster doses - which come at least six months after second jabs - have now been delivered in the UK.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ministers were letting the \"security wall against the virus... crumble\" and the booster programme was \"stalling\".\nBut Prof Jeremy Brown, an adviser to the government on vaccines, said Sir Keir's criticism was \"not an accurate description of what's going on\".\n\"The problem at the moment [is] the people coming to hospital with severe Covid and ending up in intensive care and dying are those who've not had any vaccines,\" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme.\nUnder the government's plan for tackling Covid in England over the winter, the strategy currently in operation is Plan A.\nIt involves offering booster jabs to about 30 million people and offering a single vaccine dose to healthy 12 to 15-year-olds, as well as encouraging ventilation for indoor gatherings, hand-washing and face masks in crowded places.\nDaily UK infections have been above 40,000 for nine days in a row.\nAnalysis by BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby\nDaily cases of coronavirus in the UK continue to rise - now going past 50,000 - and hospital admissions are rising closer to 1,000 a day, but daily deaths have fallen slightly.\nCases last went above 50,000 in mid-July and then fell steeply without any further restrictions being introduced.\nIt's possible that could happen again now, but that's reliant on several things happening.\nThe current strategy is to speed up vaccinations - in the form of boosters to the most vulnerable, and first doses to young teens and the five million unvaccinated - to increase protection among the population.\nFree testing is also part of that plan, and one reason why the UK has one of the highest Covid rates in Europe.\nIn 10-19 year olds, these have reached a record high and there are concerns that infections could leak into other age groups.\nA change in people's behaviour now could bring cases down and reduce growing pressure on the NHS ahead of winter.\nScientists say it's difficult to predict what could happen over the next few weeks - but the UK is in a very different place to last autumn, when the Covid vaccination programme hadn't even started yet.\nCase rates are rising in all but one region of England, the UK Health Security Agency said, with the lowest rates in London.\nRates of Covid were highest in those aged 10 to 19-years-old, with the lowest seen in those over 80.\nThere were 8,142 patients with Covid in hospital as of Wednesday, the latest data showed, with 872 patients with Covid in beds equipped with ventilators.\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the doctors' union the British Medical Association, said it can \"categorically\" say that the \"time is now\" for starting Plan B.\nHe stressed that case numbers were comparable to March, when England was in lockdown, and were \"unheard of in similar European nations\".\n\"It is therefore incredibly concerning that [Mr Javid] is not willing to take immediate action to save lives and to protect the NHS,\" he said.\nAcross the UK, booster jabs are being offered to:\nThe dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination, and will typically be either Pfizer or Moderna.\nBut Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Wednesday that \"at this point\" the government would not introduce its Plan B measures.\nHowever, he also warned insufficient vaccine uptake would make restrictions in England more likely.\nAnd he said infections could soon rise to around 100,000 per day.\nIn other developments:"

Of course, it's still very early days and the devastation caused by this tragic event will take considerable time to rectify.\n\"We are committed to working alongside our communities and partners to support them through the aftermath of this terrible event.\"\nEarlier, the deputy leader of South Ayrshire Council, Brian McGinley, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that some residents were back in their homes, some were staying with family and friends and others were in hotels.\n\"We need to realise that this has been a very major incident, it's a very demanding and technical situation,\" he said. \n\"Clearly we're working as fast and as hard as we can to make sure everybody is safe, that everyone's needs are met. But it's going to take a long time for this community to recover.\"\nMr McGinley added: \"Volunteers are providing rest and food for local people and emergency services - they have clothes, drinks and foodstuffs available. Some people have been a bit traumatised by it so they can come down, have a cup of tea and chat to people about it.\"\nThe council also said it had been overwhelmed by donations from the public and offers of help from local businesses.\nA hub for residents affected by the incident and emergency service workers has been set up at Kincaidston Community Pavilion.\nOne community worker told the BBC that about 120 residents were initially unable to return to their homes following the explosion.\n\"[They] had to register to say what location they were in approximate to the explosion and then they could get let back in their houses,\" he said. \"We had kids in getting their evening meals.\n\"As far as I'm led to believe one of the local hotels has put some of the residents up, that was [Tuesday] afternoon - I don't know what the situation is now.\"\nHe said the centre had received donations from local businesses, including takeaways, supermarkets, bakers and butchers to support displaced people.\n\"It's been quite hectic but the emergency services are very appreciative of what we've done for them - the community has rallied round.\"\nScottish Fire and Rescue Service area commander Ian McMeekin described the aftermath of the explosion as \"extremely challenging\".\nAt its height, nine appliances responded to the explosion, which happened shortly after 19:00 on Monday, as well as urban search and rescue teams.\nMr McMeekin said: \"There is significant damage to the properties and the surrounding area.\" \nHe also thanked the local community for their \"support and understanding\".\nResidents needing support following the blast have been urged to contact 0300 123 0900.\nThe gas distribution company SGN said it would continue to work with \"expert parties\" in the coming days to establish the cause of the explosion.\nA temporary, above-ground gas pipeline has been installed for homes in Kincaidston.\nThe company said: \"We'd like to reiterate our reassurance to the local community that the gas network across the area remains safe and secure to use.\n\"Our engineers have carried out full safety checks in the area to ensure the safety of all the homes close to the damaged properties.\n\"We're aware some residents may have turned off their gas supply at the meter as a result of the incident.\n\"If this applies to you, then our engineers are available to visit your property and safely turn your gas supply back on.\""

      "text": "Vaccination is 90% effective at preventing deaths from the Delta variant of Covid-19, researchers say.\nThe data, released by the University of Edinburgh, was gathered using a Scotland-wide Covid surveillance tool.\nFigures suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 90% effective and the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab 91% effective at preventing deaths. \nIt looked at people who have been double-vaccinated but who have tested positive for Covid in the community.\nThe study is the first to show across an entire country how effective vaccines are at preventing death from the Delta variant, which is the most dominant form of Covid in the UK.\nResearchers defined death from Covid as anyone who died within 28 days of a positive PCR test, or with Covid recorded as a cause of death on their death certificate.\nThe study analysed data from 5.4 million people in Scotland between 1 April and 27 September this year.\nDuring this period, 115,000 people tested positive for Covid using a PCR test in the community, rather than in hospital, and there were 201 Covid-related deaths recorded.\nNo deaths have been recorded in those who have been double-vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine in Scotland, according to the data.  \nResearchers said it is therefore not possible to estimate this particular vaccine's effectiveness in preventing Covid-related deaths.\nThe research team from the University of Edinburgh, University of Strathclyde and Public Health Scotland analysed the dataset as part of the EAVE II project - Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of Covid-19.\nIt uses anonymised, linked-patient data to track the pandemic and the vaccine rollout in real time.\nSo far, 87.1% of adults in Scotland have taken a second dose of the Covid vaccine. \nThird \"booster\" doses are being offered to everyone over 50, along with frontline medical staff and younger adults with some underlying health conditions.\nProf Aziz Sheikh, director of the University of Edinburgh's Usher Institute and EAVE II study lead, said: \"With the Delta variant now the dominant strain in many places worldwide, and posing a higher risk of hospitalisation than previous variants seen in the UK, it is reassuring to see that vaccination offers such high protection from death very shortly after the second dose.\n\"If you still have not taken up your offer to be vaccinated, I would encourage you to do so based on the clear benefits it offers.\"\nProf Chris Robertson, of the University of Strathclyde and Public Health Scotland, said: \"This study shows the value of carrying out analyses of routine healthcare data available in near real-time.\n\"Our findings are encouraging in showing that the vaccine remains an effective measure in protecting both ourselves and others from death from the most dominant variant of Covid-19.\" \nHe added that it was important to validate these early results with follow-up studies.\nThe team behind the study said due to the observational nature of the figures, data about vaccine effectiveness should be interpreted with caution and said it was not possible to make a direct comparison between both vaccines.

      "text": "Glasgow businessman Mohsen Souli is in two minds about the COP26 summit.\nThe cafe and antiques shop owner is excited at the prospect of tens of thousands of people descending on Glasgow, potentially boosting his sales.\nBut he's also worried. His businesses are only a short distance away from the SEC Campus, where COP26 is due to take place from the end of this month.\nRoad closures around Finnieston, where he is based, have left him wondering if shop footfall will grow or slump.\nBut he's even more worried about security.\n\"I am concerned about what might happen if there are protests. I am hopeful that they will be very peaceful but if not, a broken window would cost me \u00a35,000 to replace,\" he says.\n\"I also don't know what affect the closing of roads is going to have on my business - will it be good or bad?\"\nMr Souli says he plans to stock up on goods for his cafe ahead of the summit, in case deliveries are affected by security and traffic measures.\n\"I can't be sure whether I will be getting too many supplies - things are very uncertain at the moment.\n\"I have spoken to other businesses in the area and everyone has the same feeling of uncertainty. We will just have to see how it goes,\" he adds.\nBusinesses in other sectors have widely welcomed COP26 - and its potential for future business - but some remain concerned over the impact on trading of road closures, traffic congestion and planned rail and bus strikes.\nRoad closures are due to come into effect in Glasgow from Saturday 23 October - more than a week before the start of the event - and last until 15 November.\nGet Ready Glasgow, the city's information site, has produced a congestion map showing how travel in the city will be \"significantly impacted\".\nHotels and other accommodation providers in central Scotland have reported high levels of occupancy for the duration of the UN climate summit, bringing in welcome business as they work to recover from the pandemic. \nBut Leon Thompson, executive director for Scotland of trade body UKHospitality,  said the picture was less clear for bar and restaurant owners.\n\"They will be hoping to see greater footfall on the streets during the event, but road closures in the city may have an impact on that,\" he explains. \n\"Traffic congestion may also have an effect on the number of people going out and about during the summit.\" \nA further uncertainty, he added, was the amount of disruption road closures could have on deliveries of supplies to premises.\nThe Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland has also raised concerns about the potential disruption facing some members.\nPolicy chairman Andrew McRae explained: \"Like any global conference, COP26 was bound to cause some disruption to residents and businesses in Glasgow. \n\"While communications from the relevant authorities have mostly been good, the scale of the road closures has worried some in business as well as people who travel for work. \n\"And even if you know about a major diversion, that doesn't compensate you if, for example, it becomes more difficult for your customers to reach you for almost a month. \n\"On a more positive note, the high-end tourism and hospitality sector in Scotland looks likely to do well from the conference. \n\"And the event is an opportunity to show Glasgow and Scotland, as well as our business community, to some of the most important decision-makers on the planet.\"\nThe Glasgow Chamber of Commerce said \"inevitably\" there would be some disruption to businesses over the course of the summit, but added it was working closely with Glasgow City Council and the Scottish and UK governments to minimise the impact.\nChief executive Stuart Patrick said: \"COP26 will put Glasgow on the world stage and we will be working hard with our members to ensure there is a lasting economic and environmental legacy from the event.\"\nThe Scottish Retail Consortium said its industry had shown repeatedly over recent years that it was adept at coping with disruptions and ensuring shoppers could continue to have access to a good range of products. \nDirector David Lonsdale said: \"Most retailers in Glasgow have well-developed contingency plans in place to deal with a massive event like COP26, and to minimise any short-term impact on shoppers and deliveries to stores. \n\"Retailers continue to carefully monitor developments including road closures and industrial action with public transport.\n\"However, with trading conditions very tough at the moment, and with Glasgow's shopper footfall down by a fifth compared to pre-pandemic times, this will certainly put these plans to the test.\""

      "text": "The US House of Representatives has voted to hold ex-Trump adviser Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress, opening him up to a potential prosecution.  \nMr Bannon had defied a summons from a congressional panel investigating the 6 January riot at the US Capitol. \nThe House select committee voted to hold him in contempt on Tuesday, before passing the matter to the full chamber.\nThursday's vote largely fell along party lines, with 229 voting in favour compared to 202 against the move. \nOnly nine Republicans in the Democratic-controlled chamber voted to hold Mr Bannon in contempt.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now expected to certify the vote before it is referred to the US Department of Justice, which has the final say on charges.\nA committee investigating the riot has been chasing testimony from Mr Bannon about his communications with Mr Trump before the invasion of the Capitol, as well as any knowledge he may have had of plans to overturn the results of the November 2020 election. \nSupporters of Mr Trump stormed the Capitol building and disrupted certification of President Joe Biden's electoral victory. More than 670 people have been arrested.\nAs Thursday's vote began, Representative Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the 6 January committee, said Mr Bannon was believed to have \"valuable\" information about the riot.\n\"What sort of precedent would it set for the House of Representatives if we allow a witness to ignore us flat out without facing any kind of consequences?\" said the Mississippi Democrat.\nIndiana Republican Jim Banks took to the floor of the House to slam the \"illicit criminal investigation into American citizens\" and said Mr Bannon had become a \"boogeyman\" for the Democratic party.\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland, who leads the justice department, testified earlier on Thursday to Congress about the likelihood of criminal charges for Mr Bannon.\nMr Garland said that the department will \"apply the facts and the law and make a decision, consistent with the principles of prosecution\".\nContempt of Congress cases are notoriously difficult to litigate - the last time such a prosecution took place was in 1983 against a Reagan administration official.\nMr Trump has urged former aides and allies to reject requests to testify before the 6 January committee, claiming that his communications from the time are protected by executive privilege - a legal principle that shields many White House missives. \nMr Bannon has yet to comment on the proceedings. His attorney has previously said that he will only co-operate if Mr Trump's executive privilege claim is legally resolved."

      "text": "Nearly 1,500 people have been arrested in England and Wales in a week-long operation against so-called county lines drug dealing networks.\nPolice say they have started focusing on senior figures controlling phone numbers used to sell drugs.\nOfficers are also using modern slavery and human trafficking laws to prosecute gangs exploiting vulnerable children.\nSome 139 county lines were closed, and almost \u00a32m of Class A drugs, including cocaine and heroin, seized.\nCounty line gangs are urban drug dealers who sell to customers in more rural areas via dedicated phone lines.\nThey have become central to the trade in illegal substances across Britain and the way they operate is often accompanied by serious violence. \nGangs in cities operate phone lines advertised in other towns and rural areas to supply drugs, while remaining at arm's length to reduce the risk of arrest. \nBut police changed tactics two years ago and now have a strategy of identifying the \"line holder\" by analysing phone records, meaning gang leaders can often be arrested in possession of the phone, proving their involvement.\nAs a result the number of arrests has been growing during regular week-long operations in which different police forces co-ordinate their efforts. \nA total of 85% of defendants are now pleading guilty and the conviction rate is 99%, said Graham McNulty, deputy assistant commissioner of the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC).\n\"We are making significant inroads into dismantling violent county lines. \n\"The figures speak for themselves. We're stopping abhorrent criminals abusing young people and lining their own pockets in the process,\" he said. \nAn assessment of county lines drug dealing produced by the NPCC suggests the number of active lines has fallen from around 2,000 in 2018 to 600. \nIn the latest police push, between 11 October and 17 October:\nPolice also visited 894 addresses used by drug gangs for their operations against the will of the resident, a practice known as \"cuckooing\". \nMost of the gangs operate from Merseyside, the West Midlands and London. \nCounty lines gangs groom children and vulnerable adults to get them moving drugs around the country, often using threatening and coercive behaviour. \nPolice are pioneering the use of \"victimless prosecutions\" which aims to reduce the need for victims to give evidence in court. \nHowever, the Children's Society, a charity that works with young people facing abuse, neglect and exploitation, wants the government to boost the law on the criminal exploitation of children by adding a definition of the offence to the new Policing Bill.\nIryna Pona, Policy Manager at The Children's Society, said: \"This should also provide clarity for professionals in identifying young victims and would be strengthened further by a national strategy, supported by funding, to ensure more children get earlier help, ending the current postcode lottery in support.\"\n\"There needs to be a relentless focus among professionals upon identifying and supporting children at risk of exploitation as early as possible.\"\nThe Children's Society runs a campaign, Look Closer, designed to help people spot signs that children and vulnerable adults are involved with county lines. \nJames Simmonds-Read, from The Children's Society's\u202f prevention programme which has worked alongside police said: \"It's vital that professionals spot instances where children have been exploited by criminals, so we are pleased that many vulnerable people - including young people - have been identified as being in need of support.\"\n\"The public can also play a crucial role in spotting signs of exploitation and reporting them to the police and Look Closer highlights how everyone from commuters to transport and shop staff can help children to escape horrific exploitation.\"\n\"Young people may not ask for help themselves because they have been manipulated into thinking they are making a choice or because they have been subjected to terrifying threats.\"\nThe British Transport Police try to stop drugs being transported on trains. \nMeanwhile, the National Crime Agency is focusing on stopping drugs getting into the country in the first place. \nRecently the NCA has charged six men with importing 2.3 tonnes of cocaine worth \u00a3190m. \nOther seizures include 5.2 tonnes of cocaine being transported by sea, and the discovery of heroin and cocaine inside a British lorry.  \nNCA Director of Investigations Nikki Holland said: \"It is a high priority for the NCA to build on the successes we have had in source countries and along the drugs supply routes, so that organised crime groups land fewer drugs in our towns and cities and prevent them being pushed further afield through county lines groups.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Ofgem,Energy industry,Scottish Power",
      "text": "The boss of one of the UK's biggest energy companies has called for the energy price cap to be abolished. \nKeith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said the recent energy crisis had exposed deep flaws in the way the energy market was structured.\nHe added there had been serious failures on the part of Ofgem.\nThe regulator said the price cap had helped to keep down costs for millions of households.\nMr Anderson said that the price cap was a popular idea politically but it has caused dozens of companies to go bust.\nAs wholesale prices soared six-fold this year, companies had to buy gas at a price miles more than the rate they were allowed to sell it.\n\"There was a fixation about trying to create more and more competition and get more and more companies into the energy sector,\" he said. \n\"But it went too far. We ended up with a raft of small, not particularly well-run organisations coming into the retail sector. This crisis has shown this is quite a risky business.\"\nHe said that the regulator asking well-run companies to take on millions of customers from poorly-run and resourced companies is placing a massive burden on the sector which will mean prices will have to rise for the next 12 to 18 months.\n\"Every customer taken on at the price cap means \u00a31,000 of cost,\" he said.\n\"We estimate the total cost to the industry of between \u00a34bn and \u00a35bn.\n\"The risk is that you will end up going back to the big five or the big six.\"\nHe added that a one-size-fits-all cap was regressive, as it did not even succeed in protecting more vulnerable customers, who spend a disproportionate amount of household income on energy.\nHis solution would be the abolition of the cap while having a special tariff for people in fuel poverty.\nMore affluent customers would pay more but that would be a more progressive way to regulate the industry.\nMr Anderson was scathing about the competence of Ofgem saying the regulations were not fit for purpose.\n\"The regulator has not kept pace with what has been going on in the marketplace,\" he added.\nOfgem responded by saying that the price cap had played its part in cushioning millions of households from soaring gas prices. \nBut it acknowledged that regulations would need to change.\n\"Ofgem, with industry and the government, will need to build an energy market that is more resilient to shocks like this in the future.\n\"This is likely to mean an approach to regulation which is more focussed on the business models that enter and operate in our energy market, and on the risk they carry,\" it said.\nMr Anderson rejected the notion that he is advocating an oligopoly with no price controls in which profit margins were allowed to be higher and people were disinclined to switch because they have seen smaller suppliers go bust. \nHe said that a removal of the cap would not see profiteering as a market of 10 or 15 well-run companies in competition would provide good value for money.\nMr Anderson noted that would still be more market competitors than you see in banking or supermarkets. \nHe acknowledged the cost of transitioning to a net zero economy would be hundreds of billions which would end up on our bills or in taxes but said that it would ideally be spread over decades.\nThe economic activity it generated would ripple right across the UK economy creating thousands of jobs, he said. \nHis comments come the day after Scottish Power confirmed it was investing \u00a36bn in three offshore wind projects.\nIt was the centrepiece of a raft of investments the government announced at a global investment summit in London followed by a reception for business leaders at Windsor Castle attended by the prime minister and the Queen."

We'll have another update for you this evening.\nThere are no plans to introduce tougher measures, or Plan B, in England despite daily coronavirus cases staying above 40,000 and a warning they could reach 100,000. This has been met with criticism from doctors who say ministers should trigger Plan B for the pandemic this winter, doctors say. The British Medical Association, which describes the rate of Covid infections as \"unacceptable\", accuses ministers of being \"wilfully negligent\" for not re-imposing rules. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has rejected fresh restrictions right now and urged people to get booster vaccines and wear face coverings in crowded places, or Plan A.\nThe slow supply of vaccines to poorer countries means the pandemic will go on for a year longer than it needs to - and could easily drag into 2022, according to the World Health Organization. In order to tackle this, Dr Bruce Aylward, senior leader at the organisation, appealed to wealthy countries to let pharmaceutical companies prioritise the lowest-income countries over theirs. So far fewer than 5% of Africa's population have been vaccinated, compared to 40% on most other continents. The UK is among those which have pledged vaccines to countries in need.\nMore funding is needed to ensure pupils won't suffer lasting damage after school closures were imposed by the government to tackle coronavirus. A new report from the Education Policy Institute says funding needs to quadruple to at least \u00a313bn and suggests targeting disadvantaged pupils and certain regions. It calculates a minimum of \u00a378bn in lifetime earnings could be lost by those who missed out on education in England. The government has a \u00a33bn catch-up plan, which includes a national tutoring scheme, to help millions of pupils by 2024.\nIt's probably known best as the place where Napoleon was exiled and died, but St Helena - a remote British island in the middle of the south Atlantic - is one of the few places in the world that has not reported a single case of coronavirus. It welcomes\u00a0tourists, like Alasdair and Gill Maclean who ended up staying for eight months while other countries were in lockdown, and hopes more will come to visit. Take a look.\nWhen 73-year-old John Fellows realised he missed singing during lockdown he headed to a shopping centre in South Gloucestershire and started serenading shoppers. He's on a mission to \"brighten up everybody's life\", and it appears to be working. \"You've cheered up my whole pandemic, you have,\" says one shopper.

      "tags": "Social care",
      "text": "There will be \"a tsunami\" of people without the care they need this winter unless staff shortages are tackled, England's care watchdog is warning.\nSocial care staff are \"exhausted and depleted,\" says Care Quality Commission (CQC) chief executive, Ian Trenholm. \nIn a report, the CQC urges immediate work to address the problem of rising numbers of unfilled care sector jobs. \nOn Thursday, the government announced an extra \u00a3162.5m to boost the adult social care workforce.\nThis is in addition to \u00a35.4bn earmarked for social care over the next three years from the government's health and social care levy, which already includes \u00a3500m to be spent on the workforce.\nThe CQC welcomes the money but has a warning: \"It must be used to enable new ways of working that recognise the interdependency of all health and care settings, not just to prop up existing approaches and to plug demand in acute care.\"\nIn its latest State of Health and Social Care in England report, the CQC confirms fears that social care providers are facing a staffing crisis, losing staff to better paid jobs in retail and hospitality, and unable to recruit replacements. \nAcross England, numbers of unfilled jobs are rising month on month, the researchers found, from 6% in April to more than 10% in September. \nLondon is worst affected with 11% of jobs vacant, followed by the East Midlands at 9.4% and the South West at 9.2%.\nThis means care providers are having to limit their services, the researchers found. \nIn Devon, Rebecca Marks, director of Ark Care Homes, says more than one in five of their beds are empty, because they cannot afford to staff them. \nShe says current staff are exhausted after the pandemic, and despite the company offering funding for training and qualifications, and paying joining bonuses, \"they are saying: 'You know, I'm going to go and work in a supermarket'\".\n\"We need help and we need it fast... whether it's funding to be able to pay our staff higher wages to represent the responsibility and the amazing job that they do, or something different. \n\"It's a very difficult place for care providers and care staff, and ultimately our residents.\"\nOona Goldsworthy, who oversees five care homes in the south-west of England, told BBC Breakfast she was \"literally throwing everything\" at the problem to try and fill vacancies - including increasing wages.\n\"We have to recognise paying carers the minimum wage is just not acceptable any more,\" she said.\nBy Alison Holt, social affairs editor\nIn the measured tones of a regulator, this report makes it clear that a staffing crisis in the long overlooked care system has much broader consequences. \nA \"tsunami of unmet need\" is more than a striking phrase. It represents a lack of support that can leave someone who is disabled or in the later years of their life struggling - alone or with family, facing grinding daily difficulties and too often deterioration that ends in crisis. \nIt is distressing for those at the heart of it and pressure on an overstretched NHS that with the right support might have been avoided. \nThe extra money the government has announced will help, but councils and care organisations have been quick to say it won't be enough. \nAnd the suggestion it could lead to tens of thousands of new care staff is likely to be greeted with a wry smile coming just 18 months after the last government recruitment campaign failed to do that.\nUnpaid carers who look after relatives at home are among those hit hard by the staffing squeeze. \nDorothy Cook cares for her husband Melvin, at home in Bristol. Melvin is in the advanced stages of a degenerative brain disease which has left him unable to wash, dress, shower or feed himself without her help. \nFollowing a fall in February, he was in hospital for six weeks, and then spent four months in a rehabilitation unit. \nMelvin is meant to have a care package at home but the provider ended it after five weeks, as his condition was too complex for them to manage.\nThat was 12 weeks ago, and Dorothy is struggling.\n\"It all falls on my shoulders, and I'm on my knees with exhaustion,\" she told the BBC.\n\"We both feel completely and utterly alone. We feel that nobody cares.\"\nCarers UK, which represents unpaid people like Dorothy, says a survey of 8,000 of its members suggests more than half (55%) have lost some or all of the support they need, since the pandemic. \nThe government says it will take steps to ensure that unpaid carers have the support, advice and respite they need, with more detail to be published later this year. \nCare companies say the main factors making it hard to find and keep staff are: \nIn its report, the CQC pays tribute \"to the professionalism and resilience of everyone that works in social care\", but according to chief executive Ian Trenholm: \"Those people cannot be expected to work any harder.\n\"If we're to get safely through this winter, there needs to be urgent action.\"\nHe says local leaders of health and social care services will need \"to make maximum use of everything they have at their disposal to get safely through the winter... If these things don't happen there is the genuine risk of a tsunami of unmet need, with many people not getting the care that they so desperately need this winter.\"\nHe believes the key is more collaboration between services and urges a rapid overhaul: \"We can't be in this position in a year's time. We need to be thinking about what systems will look like in the future.\n\"We are really clear, there are no silver bullets, there are no simple answers to what is a very, very complex problem.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care official said: \"We appreciate the dedication and tireless work of health and social care staff throughout the pandemic. \n\"We have provided record levels of investment to support them and will provide \u00a336bn over the next three years for health and social care across the UK. \n\"We are working on health and social care reform to ensure we can provide world-leading services and are committed to learning lessons from the pandemic, with a full public inquiry in the spring.\"\nShadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall, called the report \"devastating\", saying the government's recent social care announcement would not help.\n\"Labour is calling for a ten-year plan of investment and reform,\" to include a new deal to transform pay, training and conditions for care staff, and a shift in focus towards prevention and early intervention, said Ms Kendall.

      "text": "US surgeons say they have successfully given a pig's kidney to a person in a transplant breakthrough they hope could ultimately solve donor organ shortages. \nThe recipient was brain-dead, meaning they were already on artificial life support with no prospect of recovering. \nThe kidney came from a pig that had been genetically modified to stop the organ being recognised by the body as \"foreign\" and being rejected. \nThe work is not yet peer-reviewed or published but there are plans for this. \nExperts say it is the most advanced experiment in the field so far. \nSimilar tests have been done in non-human primates, but not people, until now. \nUsing pigs for transplants is not a new idea though. Pig heart valves are already widely used in humans.\nAnd their organs are a good match for people when it comes to size. \nDuring the two-hour operation at the New York University Langone Health medical centre, the surgeons connected the donor pig kidney to the blood vessels of the brain-dead recipient to see if it would function normally once plumbed in, or be rejected. \nOver the next two-and-a-half days they closely monitored the kidney, running numerous checks and tests. \nLead investigator Dr Robert Montgomery told the BBC's World Tonight programme: \"We observed a kidney that basically functioned like a human kidney transplant, that appeared to be compatible in as much as it did all the things that a normal human kidney would do.\n\"It functioned normally, and did not appear to be undergoing rejection.\"\nThe surgeons transplanted a bit of the pig's thymus gland too, along with the kidney. They think this organ might help stop the human body rejecting the kidney in the long term by mopping up any stray immune cells that might otherwise fight the pig tissue.\nA heart transplant recipient himself, Dr Montgomery says there is an urgent need for finding more organs for people on waiting lists, although he acknowledges his work is controversial.\n\"The traditional paradigm that someone has to die for someone else to live is never going to keep up. \n\"I certainly understand the concern and what I would say is that currently about 40% of patients who are waiting for a transplant die before they receive one. \n\"We use pigs as a source of food, we use pigs for medicinal uses - for valves, for medication. I think it's not that different.\"\nHe said it was still early research and more studies were needed, but added: \"It gives us, I think, new confidence that it's going to be all right to move this into the clinic.\"\nThe family of the recipient, who had wanted to be an organ donor, gave permission for the surgery to go ahead. \nUS regulator the FDA has approved the use of the genetically modified pig organs for this type of research use.\nDr Montgomery believes that within a decade, other pig organs - hearts, lung and livers  - could be given to humans needing transplants.\nDr Maryam Khosravi, a kidney and intensive care doctor who works for the NHS in the UK, said: \"Animal to human transplantation has been something that we have studied for decades now, and it's really interesting to see this group take that step forward.\"\nOn the ethics, she said: \"Just because we can doesn't mean we should. I think the community at large needs to answer these questions.\"\nA spokesperson for NHS Blood and Transplant, said matching more human donors remained the priority for now: \"There is still some way to go before transplants of this kind become an everyday reality.\n\"While researchers and clinicians continue to do our best to improve the chances for transplant patients, we still need everyone to make their organ donation decision and let their family know what they want to happen if organ donation becomes a possibility.\" "

      "text": "A California sheriff has said heat and possibly dehydration are to blame for the deaths of a family found on a remote hiking trail in August. \nJonathan Gerrish, 45, Ellen Chung, 30, their one-year-old girl Aurelia Miju Chung-Gerrish and dog Oski died due to hyperthermia in Devil's Gulch Valley. \nThe announcement comes over two months after rescue crews found their bodies in the Sierra National Forest.\nTheir unexplained deaths had puzzled summer hikers in the US West.\nIn a news conference on Thursday, the Mariposa County Sheriff's Office said that the family had been found with an empty 85oz (2.5-litre) water bladder, and did not have any other bottles or water filters with them.\nTemperatures on the day of their hike rose above 109F (42C), officials say.\nAccording to CBS News, the BBC's partner in the US, Mr Gerrish was from the UK and met Ms Chung in San Francisco before moving to the small town of Mariposa in 2020.\nTheir bodies were discovered by rescue crews on 17 August in an area south-west of Yosemite National Park after a friend called authorities to report them missing.\nThe Mariposa County Sheriff's Office has been working with FBI, environmental researchers and toxicologists to determine what killed the family.\nThey had already ruled out death by lightning, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, cyanide, illegal drugs, alcohol, gun \"or any other type of weapon\" or suicide. \nThe FBI is still attempting to access the mobile phone owned by Gerrish, Mariposa County Sheriff Jeremy Briese told reporters. \nHe added that there is no phone service in the area where they were hiking, and that an earlier fire had burned trees that would normally provide shade in some sections of the steep trail. \nConcerns over water quality in the nearby Merced River led to speculation that an algae bloom could have killed them, but officials say there is no evidence that the family drank the river water. \nOther dismissed theories included a leak that originated from abandoned gold mines that are common in the Gold Rush region."

      "text": "A 25-year-old man has been charged with murder and the preparation of terrorist acts after the fatal stabbing of MP Sir David Amess.\nAli Harbi Ali was arrested following the attack at a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on Friday.\nSir David, a Conservative MP since 1983, suffered multiple stab wounds and died at the scene.\nMr Ali is a British man whose father is a former adviser to Somalia's prime minister.\nNick Price, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"We will submit to the court that this murder has a terrorist connection, namely that it had both religious and ideological motivations.\"\nMr Ali is accused of visiting the home of one MP, the Houses of Parliament and the constituency surgery of another MP at various times this year as part of reconnaissance for a potential attack.\nOn Thursday, Mr Ali, from north London, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court. Wearing a grey tracksuit and black-rimmed glasses, he spoke only to confirm his name, age and address.\nHe was remanded in custody and is due to appear at the Old Bailey on Friday.\nMetropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Matt Jukes sent his \"deepest condolences\" to the family, friends and colleagues of the MP.\n\"Sir David's dedication to his family, his constituents and his community, and his positive impact on the lives of so many has been abundantly clear since his death,\" he said.\nSince the killing, a large team of detectives in the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command had been \"working around the clock\" to search several addresses in north London, analyse digital devices and review CCTV, Mr Jukes said.\nThere have been no other arrests and police are not seeking anyone else, he added.\nThe Metropolitan Police has been working with Parliament's security team and the Home Office to review the protection of MPs.\nPolice forces across the country have also been working with individual MPs about their security in their constituencies.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"I hope that the family of David Amess and all those who love him will get the justice they deserve as fast as possible.\"\nHe praised the police outreach to MPs on security, but said MPs must not be \"intimidated by this appalling murder into changing the way we conduct our Parliamentary business or the way we work in our constituencies - which I think is the last thing David Amess himself would have wanted\".\nOn Tuesday, MPs paid emotional tributes to their colleague, with Mr Johnson saying the killing was a \"tragic and senseless death\" of one of the \"most gentle individuals\" to serve in Parliament.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer praised him as a \"dedicated constituency MP\" and fellow Essex MP Mark Francois called him \"the best bloke I ever knew\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nFor the first time since July there have been more than 50,000 Covid cases recorded in the UK in one day. It comes after the prime minister urged those who become eligible for a third dose of vaccine to organise an appointment straight away. Boris Johnson also appealed to 12 to 15-years-olds to get their first vaccination, saying there were \"huge quantities\" available. Responding after doctors called for more restrictions, the PM said the government was \"continuing with its plan\". Things were much better now than a year ago, thanks to the rollout of the vaccine, he added. See who's next in line for a booster jab here and should the government be doing more to protect the NHS?\nThe debate continues over whether the government should ask people to wear masks - and, in particular, whether MPs should wear them in the House of Commons. On Wednesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told people in England to cover their faces in \"really crowded\" areas. The next morning Edward Argar, one of his ministers, said MPs should be allowed to decide for themselves whether to wear one in the Commons.\nEight bonfire and fireworks displays in Manchester, which would usually attract more than 100,000 people, are cancelled for the second year in a row. The city's council, which organises the events, said they would be impossible to manage as people would be asked to prove their Covid status, either through vaccination or a negative test, and this would need a big increase in infrastructure and security. \"This is not a decision we have taken lightly,\" a spokesman said.\nThrough the pandemic, more than four in 10 adults in England gained weight, a survey found. Now a Conservative ex-minister is calling for the government to \"tell people they must not eat so much\". Lord Robathan said it should not be \"socially acceptable\" to be very overweight, pointing to the increased risks from Covid. The government said it was important not to create more anxiety for people with eating disorders.\nStrictly Come Dancing hopeful Judi Love is self-isolating following a positive Covid test. A Strictly spokesperson confirmed Judi and professional partner Graziano Di Prima would not take part in this weekend's show, in accordance with Strictly protocol, but \"all being well\" would return to the dancefloor next week. The 41-year-old comedian and Loose Women panellist has survived the dance-off twice. Judi is not the first celebrity contestant to test positive this season; McFly singer Tom Fletcher and partner Amy Dowden missed a week earlier in the competition.  \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWith attention firmly on the booster vaccine rollout and getting a first dose to teenagers, find out how many people in the UK have been vaccinated so far.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust (RCHT) has declared a critical incident due to the pressures it is facing.\nA critical incident allows all health and care organisations to work together and focus on resolving the situation.\nThe trust reported up to 100 people were waiting to be seen in the emergency department on Wednesday, with 25 ambulances waiting outside.\nManagers contacted staff asking them to work extra hours to help handle \"intense pressures\".\nThe trust said the emergency department is designed to accommodate up to 40 people at any one time.\nSpeaking on behalf of the NHS in Cornwall, RCHT medical director, Dr Allister Grant said: \"There is unprecedented demand on health and care services in Cornwall, more so this week than at any point during the pandemic.\u202f\n\"As a result, we have escalated our operational level from OPEL4 to an internal critical incident.\n\"Pressure will always be most visible at the Emergency Department where ambulances are waiting, and our priority here is to move people into wards as soon as we can.\"\nAs part of the response, NHS staff are working in care homes where beds are available for patients, but there is a shortage of workers.\nDr Grant added: \"Families, friends and neighbours are urged to help us, too, by offering to support someone waiting for home care to leave hospital sooner, and we would ask them to contact the ward directly if they can help in any way. \n\"Getting someone home a day or two sooner will mean we can free up a vital hospital bed for someone else in urgent need.\" \nColin Holloway said his wife was waiting nearly 12 hours for an ambulance that never arrived. \n\"You never think that it is going to be you and several hours later it was us and it was very real and it was very scary.\"\nMr Holloway and his wife Kay, were watching television on Tuesday evening when she felt chest pains. \nAfter a 111 call, an ambulance was ordered which resulted in a 12-hour wait, only to be told the ambulance was not coming. \nThe \"stress was making her chest feel even worse than it was\", he said. \n\"I think we're heading for a catastrophe unless something really happens and I want people to sit up and take notice of this. \n\"My experience is dreadful, fortunately we've got through, it but someone's not going to make it,\" said Mr Holloway.\nKay was seen by her GP and things have settled down, he told the BBC. \nThere have been recent repeated warnings about the pressures on the Emergency Department at Treliske, and on the ambulance service.\nLast night the trust issued an urgent plea to staff asking if anybody could come in and work extra hours.\nBBC Spotlight has been contacted by people from Cornwall who say they have called for an ambulance on the advice of 111 and it hasn't turned up.\nThe trust said on Wednesday there were 120 people in beds in its wards that could have been discharged out into the community but the care simply wasn't there.\nThis obviously leads to a build up in pressure within the whole system and the visible manifestation of that is ambulances queuing outside. \nSouth Western Ambulance Service (SWAS) recorded the longest response times for life-threatening and emergency incidents across England in September.\nWill Warrender, CEO of SWAS, said the service was under \"the most sustained period of pressure in its history\", adding \"the situation today is no better than it was in September\".\nIn August seven leaders of Cornwall's health and care system wrote an open letter describing an \"ongoing surge in demand\".\nAll planned and urgent surgeries were temporarily suspended at RCHT in September due to the pressure it was under.\nRoutine surgeries remain suspended, with urgent procedures reviewed daily and continuing where possible.\nThe trust said on Thursday it was treating 44 patients with Covid-19 - 10 more than the previous week.\nFollow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "title": "Covid: Are people wearing masks less often?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Sajid Javid",
      "text": "Rules on wearing face coverings were lifted in England in July, along with most other Covid restrictions.\nBut as cases rise the government has faced some criticism for not reintroducing rules requiring masks in certain places.\nThe proportion of people wearing masks has steadily declined.\nBetween 18 July and 17 October, the percentage of people in England, Scotland and Wales who said they had worn a face covering outside their home in the past seven days dropped 13 percentage points, according to a survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). \nOf respondents over the age of 16, 95% said they had worn a mask in the week before remaining social distancing restrictions were lifted. By mid-October, this was down to 82%.\nA similar trend was found by the polling company YouGov. \nBetween 15 July and 22 September there was an 12-point drop (from 72% to 60%) in the number of people in the UK who said they were \"wearing a face mask when in public places\".\nBoth surveys relied on people saying whether or not they had worn masks. It is possible some people said they done so when they had not.\nOlder people were more likely to support mask wearing, according to the ONS. \nAmong over-70s,92% thought wearing a mask was important to slow the spread of Covid. However, only 80% of 16-29 year-olds thought the same.\nVenues and businesses are allowed to have their own rules, and passengers can be refused entry on Transport for London services if they refuse to wear a mask without a reasonable excuse.\nThe official government advice says the current approach in England \"enables personal risk-based judgements\".\nIt says: \"We expect and recommend that members of the public continue to wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces where you come into contact with people you don't normally meet. For example, on public transport. You should use your judgement in deciding where you should wear one.\"\nThe proportion of people who told the ONS they had worn a mask has been higher in Scotland and Wales than England. \nIn the most recent survey, 93% of people in Scotland and 97% of people in Wales said they had worn a mask outside their home in the previous week, compared with 80% in England.\nThis could be partly because of stricter rules in Wales and Scotland.\nMinisters in Scotland recently decided not to scrap rules requiring secondary school pupils and staff to wear masks. \nMasks must still be worn in shops, places of worship and on public transport - as well as pubs and restaurants when not seated. \nIn Wales, masks are still legally required on public transport and in all public indoor areas apart from pubs and restaurants\nIn Northern Ireland face coverings are no longer compulsory in places of worship, or for students in school classrooms, but they must be worn on public transport and in shops and hospitality venues.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid warned on Wednesday that the reintroduction of Covid restrictions in England would be more likely if people \"don't wear masks when they really should.\" He said this included \"really crowded\" places and those \"with lots of people that they don't normally hang out with\".\nMedical groups have been calling for the reintroduction of rules to force people to wear masks. The British Medical Association accused the government of being \"wilfully negligent\". But ministers have resisted making any changes to the guidance or rules. \nHealth Minister Maggie Throup told MPs: \"We believe that people can make informed choices. And I think as people see the levels [of cases] rising, then they will look at the guidance again and perhaps make decision to wear their face coverings in more venues.\"\nThis claim is not currently reflected in the ONS research. Between the start of August and 16 October, the weekly number of Covid cases rose from 180,964 to 304,862. However, the proportion of people telling the ONS they had worn masks while shopping in the previous seven days dropped from 92% to 82%.\nSome people fear forcing people to wear masks could have a negative impact on the economy.\nThe government was warned that keeping compulsory face masks could lead to \u00a34bn in lost revenues for the hospitality and events sector, the i reported in July.\nBut another reason for the government's reluctance could be more political.\nWhile Mr Javid has been encouraging people to wear masks in crowded places, most MPs from his party have been sitting on the packed green benches in the House of Commons without masks. \nIntroducing rules on masks risks angering some Conservative MPs. \nOn Thursday, Labour's shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire said Conservatives should wear them to set the \"best example to the public\".\nIn reply, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said many Labour MPs had been pictured without masks at the the party's recent annual conference in Brighton.\nAnd he claimed they were more likely to cover up \"when there are television cameras around\"."

      "tags": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,COP26,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "A huge leak of documents seen by BBC News shows how countries are trying to change a crucial scientific report on how to tackle climate change.\nThe leak reveals Saudi Arabia, Japan and Australia are among countries asking the UN to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels.\nIt also shows some wealthy nations are questioning paying more to poorer states to move to greener technologies.\nThis \"lobbying\" raises questions for the COP26 climate summit in November.\nThe leak reveals countries pushing back on UN recommendations for action and comes just days before they will be asked at the summit to make significant commitments to slow down climate change and keep global warming to 1.5 degrees.\nThe leaked documents consist of more than 32,000 submissions made by governments, companies and other interested parties to the team of scientists compiling a UN report designed to bring together the best scientific evidence on how to tackle climate change.\nThese \"assessment reports\" are produced every six to seven years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN body tasked with evaluating the science of climate change.\nThese reports are used by governments to decide what action is needed to tackle climate change, and the latest will be a crucial input to negotiations at the Glasgow conference. \nThe authority of these reports derives in part from the fact that virtually all the governments of the world participate in the process to reach consensus.\nThe comments from governments the BBC has read are overwhelmingly designed to be constructive and to improve the quality of the final report.\nThe cache of comments and the latest draft of the report were released to Greenpeace UK's team of investigative journalists, Unearthed, which passed it on to BBC News.\nThe leak shows a number of countries and organisations arguing that the world does not need to reduce the use of fossil fuels as quickly as the current draft of the report recommends. \nAn adviser to the Saudi oil ministry demands \"phrases like 'the need for urgent and accelerated mitigation actions at all scales\u2026' should be eliminated from the report\".\nOne senior Australian government official rejects the conclusion that closing coal-fired power plants is necessary, even though ending the use of coal is one of the stated objectives the COP26 conference. \nSaudi Arabia is the one of the largest oil producers in the world and Australia is a major coal exporter.\nA senior scientist from India's Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research, which has strong links to the Indian government, warns coal is likely to remain the mainstay of energy production for decades because of what they describe as the \"tremendous challenges\" of providing affordable electricity. India is already the world's second biggest consumer of coal. \nA number of countries argue in favour of emerging and currently expensive technologies designed to capture and permanently store carbon dioxide underground. Saudi Arabia, China, Australia and Japan - all big producers or users of fossil fuels - as well as the organisation of oil producing nations, Opec, all support carbon capture and storage (CCS).\nIt is claimed these CCS technologies could dramatically cut fossil fuel emissions from power plants and some industrial sectors.\nSaudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, requests the UN scientists delete their conclusion that \"the focus of decarbonisation efforts in the energy systems sector needs to be on rapidly shifting to zero-carbon sources and actively phasing out fossil fuels\".  \nArgentina, Norway and Opec also take issue with the statement. Norway argues the UN scientists should allow the possibility of CCS as a potential tool for reducing emissions from fossil fuels.  \nThe draft report accepts CCS could play a role in the future but says there are uncertainties about its feasibility. It says \"there is large ambiguity in the extent to which fossil fuels with CCS would be compatible with the 2C and 1.5C targets\" as set out by the Paris Agreement.\nAustralia asks IPCC scientists to delete a reference to analysis of the role played by fossil fuel lobbyists in watering down action on climate in Australia and the US. Opec also asks the IPCC to \"delete 'lobby activism, protecting rent extracting business models, prevent political action'.\"\nWhen approached about its comments to the draft report, Opec told the BBC: \"The challenge of tackling emissions has many paths, as evidenced by the IPCC report, and we need to explore them all. We need to utilise all available energies, as well as clean and more efficient technological solutions to help reduce emissions, ensuring no one is left behind.\"\nThe IPCC says comments from governments are central to its scientific review process and that its authors have no obligation to incorporate them into the reports. \n\"Our processes are designed to guard against lobbying - from all quarters\", the IPCC told the BBC. \"The review process is (and always has been) absolutely fundamental to the IPCC's work and is a major source of the strength and credibility of our reports.\nProfessor Corinne le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 of the University of East Anglia, a leading climate scientist who has helped compile three major reports for the IPCC, has no doubts about the impartiality of the IPCC's reports.\nShe says all comments are judged solely on scientific evidence regardless of where they come from. \n\"There is absolutely no pressure on scientists to accept the comments,\" she told the BBC. \"If the comments are lobbying, if they're not justified by the science, they will not be integrated in the IPCC reports.\"\nShe says it is important that experts of all kinds - including governments - have a chance to review the science. \n\"The more the reports are scrutinised\", says Professor le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, \"the more solid the evidence is going to be in the end, because the more the arguments are brought and articulated forward in a way that is leaning on the best available science\".\nChristiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who oversaw the landmark UN climate conference in Paris in 2015, agrees it is crucial that governments are part of the IPCC process.\n\"Everybody's voice has to be there. That's the whole purpose. This is not a single thread. This is a tapestry woven by many, many threads.\"\nThe United Nations was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2007 for the IPCC's work on climate science and the crucial role it has played in the effort to tackle climate change.\nBrazil and Argentina, two of the biggest producers of beef products and animal feed crops in the world, argue strongly against evidence in the draft report that reducing meat consumption is necessary to cut greenhouse gas emissions. \nThe draft report states \"plant-based diets can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50% compared to the average emission intensive Western diet\". Brazil says this is incorrect. \nBoth countries call on the authors to delete or change some passages in the text referring to \"plant-based diets\" playing a role in tackling climate change, or which describe beef as a \"high carbon\" food. Argentina also asked that references to taxes on red meat and to the international \"Meatless Monday\" campaign, which urges people to forgo meat for a day, be removed from the report.\nThe South American nation recommends \"avoiding generalisation on the impacts of meat-based diets on low-carbon options\", arguing there is evidence that meat-based diets can also reduce carbon emissions. \nOn the same theme, Brazil says \"plant-based diets do not for themselves guarantee the reduction or control of related emissions\" and maintains the focus of debate should be on the levels of emissions from different production systems, rather than types of food. \nBrazil, which has seen significant increases in the rate of deforestation in the Amazon and some other forest areas, also disputes a reference to this being a result of changes in government regulations, claiming this is incorrect.\nA significant number of Switzerland's comments are directed at amending parts of the report that argue developing countries will need support, particularly financial support, from rich countries in order to meet emission reduction targets.\nIt was agreed at the climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009 that developed nations would provide $100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020, a target that has yet to be met.\nAustralia makes a similar case to Switzerland. It says developing countries' climate pledges do not all depend on receiving outside financial support. It also describes a mention in the draft report of the lack of credible public commitments on finance as \"subjective commentary\". \nThe Swiss Federal Office for the Environment told the BBC: \"While climate finance is a critical tool to increase climate ambition, it is not the only relevant tool.\n\"Switzerland takes the view that all Parties to the Paris Agreement with the capacity to do so should provide support to those who need such support.\" \nA number of mostly eastern European countries argue the draft report should be more positive about the role nuclear power can play in meeting the UN's climate targets.   \nIndia goes even further, arguing \"almost all the chapters contain a bias against nuclear energy\". It argues it is an \"established technology\" with \"good political backing except in a few countries\". \nThe Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia criticise a table in the report which finds nuclear power only has a positive role in delivering one of 17 UN Sustainable Development goals. They argue it can play a positive role in delivering most of the UN's development agenda. \nDo you have any questions about the leak of climate documents?

      "text": "The Queen has cancelled a trip to Northern Ireland and has \"reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days\", Buckingham Palace says.\nThe 95-year-old monarch will remain at Windsor Castle but is still expected to attend the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow later this month.\nThe Queen is in \"good spirits\" but \"disappointed\" that the visit cannot go ahead, the palace said.\nShe was due to begin the two-day trip on Wednesday.\nThe nation's longest-reigning monarch has attended a series of events in recent days, hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening.\nEarlier in the day, she held two audiences via video link, greeting the Japanese ambassador Hajime Hayashi and the EU ambassador Joao de Almeida.\nOn Monday, she held a virtual audience with the new governor-general of New Zealand, and at the weekend, she attended the races at Ascot.\nIt was revealed on Tuesday that the Queen had declined the Oldie of the Year award, from the magazine of the same name, saying: \"You are only as old as you feel\".\nA Buckingham Palace spokesman said: \"The Queen has reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days.\n\"Her Majesty is in good spirits and is disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland, where she had been due to undertake a series of engagements today and tomorrow.\n\"The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland and looks forward to visiting in the future.\"\nThe Queen's decision is understood to be unrelated to coronavirus.\nBuckingham Palace is keen not to cause any alarm and has stressed that the Queen has \"reluctantly accepted\" the advice of doctors to rest for the next few days.    \nShe has had a busy schedule of engagements over the past couple of weeks that would test the resilience of many people far younger than her.\nI saw her last Tuesday at an event at Westminster Abbey.\nIt was the first time she had used a walking stick in public.\nShe also took a shorter route into the Abbey. \nWe were told this was \"for her own comfort.\"\nBut she still looked incredibly well and engaged for a 95-year-old.\nIt is clear though that getting older takes its toll on us all and the Queen's diary will be carefully managed going forward.\nThe Queen had been due to arrive in Hillsborough in County Down on Wednesday afternoon and attend a church service marking the centenary of the formation of Northern Ireland in Armagh tomorrow.\nAn advance team was already in Northern Ireland making preparations for the two-day visit.\nMeanwhile, the Prince of Wales was also at Windsor Castle on Wednesday for an investiture ceremony where the chef and TV presenter Mary Berry was made Dame Commander.\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, said on Twitter: \"We thank Her Majesty for her good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland and trust that she will keep well and benefit from a period of rest.  \n\"It is always a joy to have Her Majesty in Royal Hillsborough and we look forward to a further visit in the near future.\"\nWishing her well, Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said the Queen had been \"a source of great comfort during Northern Ireland's darkest days and provided lasting leadership as we moved into a new era for all our people\".\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he wished the Queen \"all the very best as she takes a few days' rest\".\nChurch leaders in Northern Ireland said in a joint statement that they were sorry she would not attend the Service of Reconciliation and Hope in Armagh, and acknowledged \"the significance of her commitment to the work of peace and reconciliation, which has meant a great deal to people throughout this island\".\nThe Queen first travelled to Northern Ireland in 1945, just after the end of World War Two, when she was a princess. If it had gone ahead, this week's trip would have been her 26th visit.\nRoyal visits to Northern Ireland during its centenary year have included the first in line to the throne, Prince Charles who went to Belfast in May, and Prince William who visited Londonderry in September."

      "text": "Vikings had a settlement in North America exactly one thousand years ago, centuries before Christopher Columbus arrived in the Americas, a study says.\nScientists say a new dating technique analysing tree rings has provided evidence that Vikings occupied a site in Newfoundland, Canada, in 1021AD.\nIt has long been known that Europeans reached the Americas before Columbus's arrival in the New World in 1492.\nBut this is the first time researchers have suggested an exact date.\nWriting in the journal Nature, scientists said they had analysed the tree rings of three pieces of wood cut for the Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows. \nThey said that using an atmospheric radiocarbon signal produced by a dated solar storm as a reference, they were able to pin the \"exact felling year of the tree\" to 1021.\nSuch a solar storm - a huge blast of radiation from the Sun that hits Earth - was known to have taken place in the year 992AD, the scientists said. This enabled them to determine a more accurate date than previous estimates for the camp of about 1000AD. \n\"The association of these pieces with the Norse is based on detailed research previously conducted by Parks Canada,\" the study says, adding that there was clear evidence the sampled wood had been modified by metal tools.\nIt adds that the L'Anse aux Meadows camp was a base from which other locations, including regions further south, were explored.\nThe authors say the discovery represents a definitive point for future research into the initial consequences of transatlantic activity, such as the transfer of knowledge and the potential exchange of genetic information and pathologies.\nDr Colleen Batey, a Viking specialist associated with the Institute for Northern Studies in Scotland, says the study does not necessarily suggest Vikings were not in the area in 1000AD. \n\"It suggests that the short-lived settlement was active in about 1021 when wood was being worked at the site, probably related to either building or ship repair,\" she says.\n\"As an archaeologist, I might interpret this as one stage of the occupation activity, not necessarily the first or indeed the last.\"\nL'Anse aux Meadows, a Unesco world heritage site on the northernmost tip of the island of Newfoundland, is the first and only known site established by Vikings in North America and the earliest evidence of European settlement in the New World. \nRadiocarbon dating is a technique that measures residual concentrations of a radioactive isotope of carbon (carbon-14) present in an object. \nCarbon-14 decays over time and measuring how much is left tells you the age of a sample."

      "text": "The pilot of a plane that crashed into the English Channel, killing footballer Emiliano Sala, was ordered not to fly the aircraft, a court has heard.\nFay Keely said she asked that David Ibbotson not fly her plane after being told of previous infringements.\nDavid Henderson, 67, was the plane's operator and was responsible for choosing appropriate pilots. \nMr Henderson is on trial at Cardiff Crown Court accused of endangering the safety of an aircraft.\nSala, 28, was involved in a multimillion-pound transfer from French club Nantes to Cardiff City FC, when the plane crashed into the sea in January 2019, killing the striker and pilot Mr Ibbotson, 59.\nMr Henderson denies the charge of endangering the safety of an aircraft.\nHe has previously admitted a charge of attempting to discharge a passenger without valid permission or authorisation.\nMs Keely said she had bought the Piper Malibu aircraft in 2015 through her family's trust, Cool Flourish Ltd, of which she is secretary and director. \nShe said that she had told Mr Henderson in 2018 that Mr Ibbotson should not fly the aircraft again after she was notified by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of two infringements that had happened while he was in the air.\nShe later found out that Henderson had hired Mr Ibbotson again, this time to pilot a flight carrying her sister a month later, in August 2018.\nShe said: \"Later on in the year, in August, he tried to contact me while I was on holiday. He was due to fly my sister on a trip and was going to be piloting himself.\n\"I found out after the event that he was unavailable and had asked David Ibbotson to fly instead of him.\"\n\"He allowed that to happen without my permission,\" she added.\nAsked by defence counsel Stephen Spence QC if she had warned Henderson not to hire Mr Ibbotson again, she said: \"No. As far as I was concerned I had made my feelings clear that he shouldn't be flying the aircraft.\"\nIn an text message exchange from August 2018, that was read to the jury, Mr Henderson had a conversation with someone who had flown with Mr Ibbotson. \nIt said: \"The Ibbotson experience was interesting! He was all over the place. Had to help him out coming into White Waltham [airfield].\"\nMr Henderson replied: \"His handling OK? Takes a lot to try and knock these new guys into shape.\"\n\"He's just not very quick and not thinking ahead,\" was the reply. \nIn another text message, found on Mr Henderson's phone from July 2018, Mr Ibbotson explained he had \"messed up a couple of times\" during a flight. \nJurors also heard that, hours after the night-time crash, Mr Henderson had messaged aircraft engineer David Smith telling him to \"keep very quiet\", adding \"need to be very careful. Opens up a whole can of worms\".\nThe court has already heard that Mr Ibbotson did not hold a commercial pilot's licence, was not allowed to fly at night, and that his rating to fly the Piper Malibu had expired.\nDespite this, when Mr Henderson was unavailable to fly the plane carrying Sala between Nantes and Cardiff in January because he was away with his wife in Paris, he hired Mr Ibbotson again.\nMr Smith, an employee of aircraft maintenance company Eastern Air Executive, said he had become aware of some issues with the aircraft on January 21 before it was due to fly back from France to the UK and insisted it was checked by a French engineer. \nThe trial is expected to last until the end of next week.

      "tags": "Medical research,Medicine,James Gallagher",
      "text": "An innovative type of medicine - called gene silencing - is set to be used on the NHS for people who live in crippling pain. \nThe drug treats acute intermittent porphyria, which runs in families and can leave people unable to work or have a normal life. \nClinical trials have shown severe symptoms were cut by 74% with the drug.\nWhile porphyria is rare, experts say the field of gene silencing has the potential to revolutionise medicine.\nSisters Liz Gill and Sue Burrell have both had their lives turned around by gene silencing. \nBefore treatment, Liz, from County Durham, remembers the trauma of living in \"total pain\" and, at its worst, she spent two years paralysed in hospital. Younger sister Sue says she \"lost it all overnight\" when she was suddenly in and out of hospital, made redundant and did know whether her partner would stick with her (he did).\n\"It was scary,\" she tells me.\nBoth became used to taking potent opioid painkillers on a daily basis. But even morphine could not block the pain during a severe attack that needed hospital treatment.\nGene silencing gets to the root-cause of the sisters' disease rather than just managing their symptoms. Their porphyria leads to a build-up of toxic proteins in the body, that cause the physical pain. Gene silencing \"mutes\" a set of genetic instructions to block that protein production. \nBoth had been taking the therapy as part of a clinical trial and are still getting monthly injections. \n\"The difference is astronomical, we're not in pain anymore,\" Liz said.\n\"You're not dependent on opiate-based pain relief and that leads to things like being able to succeed in a job and being able to buy your own home.\" \nSue, from Norfolk, said the therapy had transformed her life: \"[You're] able to do things that you couldn't do before, being able to be a mother better, being able to be a wife better\u2026 to just live life.\"\nClinical trials showed the gene silencing therapy, called givosiran, cut the number of severe attacks by 74%.\nThe National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which approves drugs for use in England, said the therapy \"would improve people's quality of life\" and was \"value for money\".\nProf David Rees, the director of the King's College Hospital National Acute Porphyria Service, told the BBC: \"To find a drug that really does transform people's lives is extraordinary.\"\nHowever, acute intermittent porphyria is rare. Only around 17 people are diagnosed in the UK each year. \n\"[But] if we can control genes and switch them on and off when we want to, then almost anything is possible in terms of treating diseases including Alzheimer's and cancer and everything else,\" Prof Rees said.\nGene-silencing has already proven effective in other rare genetic diseases such as amyloidosis. Its ability to tweak how DNA works in the human body, without permanently altering it, has already seen it used as a twice-a-year cholesterol busting jab.\nTara Moore, a professor of personalised medicine at the University of Ulster, said gene silencing had the potential to be as big as antibiotics. \nShe told BBC Radio 4's Inside Health: \"It will be, it's a very powerful tool, it is so specific, it's really phenomenal.\n\"There's really nothing to stop us targeting so many different diseases from cancer to cardiovascular disease to cholesterol problems.\" \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "David Amess death,Priti Patel,Counter-terrorism",
      "text": "The terror threat level currently facing MPs has been raised from \"moderate\" to \"substantial\" following a review, the government has announced.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel told the Commons that police and intelligence services would \"properly\" reflect the change in their security arrangements.\nBut she added there was no information on \"any credible or specific threat\".\nThe announcement comes after Conservative MP Sir David Amess was killed in his constituency on Friday.\nHis stabbing, while meeting constituents at a church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, came five years after the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox.\nA 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after the attack on Sir David and police are treating the killing as a terrorist incident.\nFollowing a security review by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, Ms Patel told the Commons: \"While we do not see any information or intelligence which points to any credible or specific or imminent threat, I must update the House that the threat level facing Members of Parliament is now deemed to be substantial.\"\nShe added: \"I can assure the House that our world-class intelligence and security agencies and counter-terror police will now ensure that this change is properly reflected in the operational posture.\" \nThe terror threat for the UK as a whole is currently also deemed to be \"substantial\", meaning an attack is \"likely\". At the \"moderate\" level, this is judged to be \"possible but not likely\".\nThe terror threat level is best understood as a shorthand that serves two purposes. \nFirst, it gives the public an insight into what security chiefs think. So while not as remotely revealing as local crime statistics - it gives us a bit of a clue as to the national picture and, in theory, helps keep the public aware. \nSecondly, it should help keep the UK's security and emergency agencies on their toes by making sure they have got the right plans and resources in place to minimise the likelihood or impact of an attack.\nFor 11 years, the level has been broken down publicly into three parts: The threat from international terrorism, the threat from Northern Ireland paramilitaries inside Northern Ireland - and the threat from those paramilitary groups to the rest of the UK. \nMy understanding is that until Wednesday there was not a formal assessment of the threat to Parliamentarians which had been kept secret.\nThe Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre - the body that analyses and assesses all available intelligence to come up with the rating would regularly discuss the safety of MPs in a similar way to how it would debate the threats to other potential targets in society. \nThat broad-brush assessment has now been formalised into an official rating of its own.\nAddressing the Commons, Ms Patel also called social media a \"cruel space\", saying: \"It has become far too permissive for too much cruelty and harm and it's not just levelled and leveraged towards elected Members of Parliament.\n\"We see children, different people of different races, religious groups being targeted and affected by some of the most awful, barbaric statements. That is what has to stop and change.\"\nFor Labour, shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called on the the government to outline what would be done to protect the staff of MPs.\nHe added: \"In order to stand firm in the face of these threats, we must do everything possible to guard against these violent positions, not least as we hear, as the home secretary has set out, that the threat level to MPs has been raised to substantial, and we accept the assessment made by the joint terrorism assessment centre that the threat has increased.\""

Her admittance is understood not to be related to coronavirus. \nThe overnight stay was said to be for practical reasons and the Queen was undertaking light duties back at Windsor on Thursday afternoon.\nIt is the first time the Queen has stayed in hospital since 2013, when she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis.\nThe King Edward VII's is a private hospital used by senior royals - including the Queen's husband, the late Duke of Edinburgh, who received treatment there earlier this year.\nThe news on Wednesday that the Queen would have to cancel a trip to Northern Ireland was always going to cause concern. \nDespite looking very well and happy at the numerous events she has attended over the past week, it cannot be forgotten that she is 95 years old. \nIt is a tricky balance for the palace to release enough details about the Queen's health to keep the public informed while maintaining the privacy to which she is entitled. \nIt was for this reason that the news that she had been taken to hospital for tests was not announced, until a report on the Sun newspaper's front page forced the palace's hand. \nPeople will be concerned, but the reassuring guidance remains that she is in \"good spirits\" on her return from hospital and is well enough to undertake some light duties.\nIt has been a busy period of official engagements for the Queen.\nAn official record of the Queen's diary showed at least 16 formal events during October, and there had been the plans for her to embark on the two-day trip to Northern Ireland this week.\nShe was pictured hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening alongside Mr Johnson.\nHowever, on Wednesday a Buckingham Palace spokesman said the monarch had \"reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days\".\nHe said the Queen was \"disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland\" - which would have involved an overnight stay.\nThe Queen began the month in Scotland, planting a tree with the Prince of Wales at the Balmoral Estate on 1 October and attending the opening of the sixth session of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh the following day.\nThe following week, she met members of the Canadian military at Windsor Castle on 6 October and attended the launch of the Commonwealth Games baton relay at Buckingham Palace on 7 October.\nLast week, on 12 October, she attended a church service to mark the centenary of The Royal British Legion at Westminster Abbey.\nShe then travelled to Wales to open the sixth term of the Senedd on Thursday.\nBy Saturday she was back in England - attending Champions Day at Ascot racecourse in Berkshire.\nAnd on Tuesday evening she was back at Windsor Castle hosting the Global Investment Summit.\nThe Queen is expected to lead a royal delegation to the Glasgow COP26 climate change summit in two weeks' time.\nIn reported remarks overheard at an event last week, she appeared to suggest she was irritated by people who \"talk\" but \"don't do\" when it came to protecting the environment.\nEarlier this week, the Queen declined a magazine's award of Oldie of the Year, saying \"you are only as old as you feel\".\nShe \"politely but firmly\" turned down the award, but sent the Oldie magazine a message with her \"warmest best wishes\"."

      "title": "The remote British island hoping to see more visitors",
      "text": "Alasdair and Gill Maclean say they felt a bit guilty having spent much of the past year happily living on a beautiful, tropical island, untouched by Covid-19.\nThe English couple had been sailing around the world prior to the start of the pandemic, when they arrived at the British Overseas Territory island of St Helena, in the middle of the south Atlantic.\n\"We had been due to leave 10 days later, and we ended up spending just over eight months,\" says Mr Maclean.\nHe adds that he and his wife were conflicted about updating friends back in the UK about their good fortune. \"How do you tell them you're having a lovely time, freely going to restaurants, and partying when they're all in lockdown?\"\nLocated some 1,200 miles (2,000 km) west of the African nation of Angola, and 2,500 miles east of Brazil, St Helena has a population of around 4,500 people, and is 47 sq miles (121 sq km) in size. To put that into context, it has about the same landmass as Jersey in the Channel Islands.\nSt Helena's claim to fame since March 2020, is that it remains one of only a handful of places on Planet Earth to have not reported a single case of coronavirus.\nThis meant that when the UK government introduced its Covid traffic light system back in May, for countries (and overseas territories) that people could visit, St Helena was always one of the few on the green list - meaning you wouldn't have to quarantine upon your return.\nThe island hopes that this spotlight has encouraged more potential tourists to visit.\nMatthew Joshua, the St Helena Government's head of visitor information services, says this already appears to be the case. \"We're getting an increase in inquiries. It has put St Helena on the map.\"\nBut how exactly do you get to St Helena? Prior to the opening of the island's airport in 2016 the only way to reach the island was by sea.\nThen for the first year of the airport's operation it was unusable due to safety concerns about high winds over the approach to the runway. This led to the facility, which cost the UK government \u00a3285m, being dubbed \"the world's most useless\" airport.\nHowever, after a number of trial flights, the airport was eventually passed as safe to use, with the first commercial flights starting in October, 2017. \nMr Joshua says the issue got unfair press coverage. \"We don't have tropical storms like you do in the Caribbean, but there is wind.\"\nBefore the pandemic, St Helena was served by weekly flights from Johannesburg and Cape Town. But these routes are still on hold due to coronavirus restrictions in South Africa.\nInstead, St Helena is currently served by Titan Airways charter flights every three weeks to and from London Stansted Airport.\nFor many people, St Helena is best-known as the place where French military and political leader Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled to, and where he died in 1821.\nVisitors to the rocky, steep-sided island can see the house where he lived, which is now a museum. Other attractions include sea fishing, diving, hiking, the colonial era streets of the capital Jamestown, the warm weather, and exploring the fauna and flora - the island is home to more than 500 species of plants and animals not found anywhere else.\nNew Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.\nBack in 2019, St Helena had 5,135 overnight visitors, plus the odd day-visit by cruise ships. This number then fell to 2,071 in 2020, mostly before the end of March, and then down to 696 from January to July of this year.\nCurrently all visitors have to quarantine for 10 days.\nThe island has just two hotels, which remain closed. Sasha Ella, communications manager for the largest - Mantis St Helena Hotel - says that times have been tough, and they will only return to normal when the world puts coronavirus behind it.\n\"It is our feeling that when access and frequency of the flights to the island, and relaxation to the quarantine restrictions, take place, only then will a positive effect be felt on the island,\" she says.\nSt Helena also has a number of private guest houses.\nAnother very remote, and Covid-19 free British island that was permanently on the UK government's green list, is South Georgia. Located in the south Atlantic, some 800 miles south east of the Falkland Islands, it is 1,362 sq miles (3,528 sq km) in size.\nOnly accessible by sea, the island has no permanent human population. Instead there are two government officers, and two dozen or so staff from the British Antarctic Survey, the UK's polar research institute.\nLike St Helena, South Georgia is now waiting for tourists to return. Prior to the pandemic, it would be visited by cruise ships going to and from the coast of Antarctica.\nIn the summer of 2019/2020 (its summer is during winter in the UK) it had 12,568 visitors, but this fell to just two people in 2020/21.\n\"In a normal year, tourism accounts for around 20% of our income,\" says Ross James, visitor management & bio-security officer for the Government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands.\nThe island has no overnight accommodation available for visitors, who instead only stay for a few hours, and have to follow strict rules during their visit designed to safeguard the natural habitat.\nPrior to their arrival people are also encouraged to watch a video guide to the region, narrated by David Attenborough.\nAll cruise firms that travel to South Georgia are members of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators. Amanda Lynnes, the organisation's director of environment & science coordination, has this advice for visitors: \"Use your experience to be an ambassador for South Georgia's continued protection.\"\nSouth Georgia has dramatic snow-topped mountains for visitors to see amid cold temperatures - even in its summer months it struggles to go above 6C.\nBy contrast, St Helena enjoys highs of 34C. Yet Mr Maclean says it is not just the pleasant weather that makes it special. \"St Helena is up there as one of the friendliest communities in the world,\" he says."

      "text": "World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.\nLeft unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. \nWe face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.\nClimate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.\nThe rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. \nWhen these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.\nThe world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.\nTemperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100. \nHowever, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.\nIf nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species. \nExtreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. \nWith further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nPeople in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.\nOur oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.\nWildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather. \nAnd as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.\nIn a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.\nScientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken. \nClimate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. \nIf temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:\nCountries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. \nThe UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP26, in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030. \nMany countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.\nExperts agree that this is achievable, but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes.\nMajor changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Sajid Javid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 50,000 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK for the first time since 17 July.\nAmid calls for more restrictions, Boris Johnson urged people to come forward for booster jabs when their time comes.\nThe prime minister said those who become eligible for a third dose of vaccine should organise an appointment straight away.\nThe UK recorded 52,009 new Covid cases on Thursday - alongside 115 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMr Johnson said, despite high cases, the government was \"continuing with its plan\" and that things were much better now than a year ago.\nHe said that was in large part thanks to the rollout of the vaccine, which has weakened the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths.\nReported cases on 17 July were 54,674 and came several weeks after more households could mix together and indoor hospitality resumed. \nDoctors are demanding ministers trigger England's \"Plan B\" - which would reimpose rules such as mandatory face masks and working from home advice.\nSpeaking in Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson said that the numbers of infections and deaths being seen were \"within the parameters of what the predictions were... given the steps we've taken\". \nIt was also because the country was in an \"incomparably better position than last year because of vaccines\" that there was more confidence around the current plan in place,\" he said.\nHe also insisted that the \"most important thing people can do is get that booster jab\" and that \"when you get the call, get the jab\".\nThe PM appealed for 12 to 15-years-old to get their first vaccination because there was \"no shortage of supply\" and there were \"huge quantities\" of vaccine available.\nAn estimated 4.7 million booster doses - which come at least six months after second jabs - have now been delivered in the UK.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ministers were letting the \"security wall against the virus... crumble\" and the booster programme was \"stalling\".\nBut Prof Jeremy Brown, an adviser to the government on vaccines, said Sir Keir's criticism was \"not an accurate description of what's going on\".\n\"The problem at the moment [is] the people coming to hospital with severe Covid and ending up in intensive care and dying are those who've not had any vaccines,\" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme.\nUnder the government's plan for tackling Covid in England over the winter, the strategy currently in operation is Plan A.\nIt involves offering booster jabs to about 30 million people and offering a single vaccine dose to healthy 12 to 15-year-olds, as well as encouraging ventilation for indoor gatherings, hand-washing and face masks in crowded places.\nDaily UK infections have been above 40,000 for nine days in a row.\nAnalysis by BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby\nDaily cases of coronavirus in the UK continue to rise - now going past 50,000 - and hospital admissions are rising closer to 1,000 a day, but daily deaths have fallen slightly.\nCases last went above 50,000 in mid-July and then fell steeply without any further restrictions being introduced.\nIt's possible that could happen again now, but that's reliant on several things happening.\nThe current strategy is to speed up vaccinations - in the form of boosters to the most vulnerable, and first doses to young teens and the five million unvaccinated - to increase protection among the population.\nFree testing is also part of that plan, and one reason why the UK has one of the highest Covid rates in Europe.\nIn 10-19 year olds, these have reached a record high and there are concerns that infections could leak into other age groups.\nA change in people's behaviour now could bring cases down and reduce growing pressure on the NHS ahead of winter.\nScientists say it's difficult to predict what could happen over the next few weeks - but the UK is in a very different place to last autumn, when the Covid vaccination programme hadn't even started yet.\nCase rates are rising in all but one region of England, the UK Health Security Agency said, with the lowest rates in London.\nRates of Covid were highest in those aged 10 to 19-years-old, with the lowest seen in those over 80.\nThere were 8,142 patients with Covid in hospital as of Wednesday, the latest data showed, with 872 patients with Covid in beds equipped with ventilators.\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the doctors' union the British Medical Association, said it can \"categorically\" say that the \"time is now\" for starting Plan B.\nHe stressed that case numbers were comparable to March, when England was in lockdown, and were \"unheard of in similar European nations\".\n\"It is therefore incredibly concerning that [Mr Javid] is not willing to take immediate action to save lives and to protect the NHS,\" he said.\nAcross the UK, booster jabs are being offered to:\nThe dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination, and will typically be either Pfizer or Moderna.\nBut Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Wednesday that \"at this point\" the government would not introduce its Plan B measures.\nHowever, he also warned insufficient vaccine uptake would make restrictions in England more likely.\nAnd he said infections could soon rise to around 100,000 per day.\nIn other developments:"

I thought it was just through your drink.\n\"I've been out a few times since and I haven't had much to drink at all, or I've been completely sober, and it actually hasn't made me feel any better.\n\"[Clubbing] is quite a physical experience, so you can't have eyes everywhere.\n\"There are people suspecting they've been spiked in so many different parts of their body - you can't look out for that, whether you're sober or not, and it's just really terrifying having no clue what's going on.\"\nPeople in other parts of the country have come forward to report similar incidents in recent weeks, including a second-year Loughborough University student who said she was injected in the elbow at a student union bar.\n\"I don't remember actually getting spiked, I just remember going dizzy and collapsing in the smoking area,\" she said.\nThe student said a doctor later confirmed that she had been injected, and she went to hospital for monitoring after experiencing heart palpitations.\nHowever, she added she did not report the incident to police as she was not confident it would be properly looked into.\nPolice encouraged anyone who has been the victim of a similar offence to report it, while the university urged the student to come forward \"so we can fully investigate\".\nMeanwhile, Devon and Cornwall Police say they are investigating reports of a woman being attacked with a needle in Fever and Boutique in Exeter on Saturday.\nMore than 150,000 have signed a petition calling for nightclubs to \"thoroughly\" search customers on entry, and Home Secretary Priti Patel has asked police forces to examine the issue.\nMike Kill, chairman of the Night Time Industries Association, said the government should hold an inquiry into spiking.\nHe said his members have \"definitely seen more cases\" being reported, adding clubs are \"taking our responsibilities here very seriously\" and are working to raise awareness about efforts to train staff and keep people safe.\n\"Without a doubt we're going to see a step up on people being searched on entry,\" he said.\n\"There is no [specific criminal] categorisation in terms of spiking, so I think there's some work that needs to be done in terms of the Home Office, the policing and the collaboration with the industry to ensure that we're starting to get convictions to send a very clear message to people who feel they can carry out this heinous crime.\"\nMeanwhile, Nottingham City Council said it would hold talks with door staff and nightclub managers to see what more can be done to keep customers safe.\nCouncillor Toby Neal, chairman of the authority's licensing committee, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: \"There is clearly a matter of concern here and we need to understand what is going on.\n\"It is really worrying. Are a group of blokes going around doing this stuff and what are we going to do to protect people?\"\nYvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, urged police forces to work closer with hospitals, student groups and nightclubs to get a fuller picture of the scale of spiking.\n\"My concern is that they just don't have a proper assessment of the scale of the problem,\" she said.\n\"Partly it's because there's not proper work being done between police forces and A&Es, for example, to try and identify the scale of the problem, or proper work being done with nightclubs or with student groups and organisations.\n\"I think there's a big problem here that we don't even know or have the accurate figures, and that also is contributing to the police not, I think, taking this seriously enough.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,Armagh,NI 100",
      "text": "The head of the Irish Catholic Church has said partition causes him \"a deep sense of loss and sadness\".\nArchbishop Eamon Martin was addressing a service to mark the centenary of Ireland being divided and the formation of Northern Ireland. \nIn 1921, the island was divided into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson joined 150 guests from both sides of the border at the event on Thursday. \nArchbishop Martin said for the past 100 years, partition had \"polarised people on this island\". \n\"It has institutionalised difference, and it remains a symbol of cultural, political and religious division between our communities,\" he said.\nHe told the service in Armagh's Church of Ireland Cathedral that he also felt churches could have gone further.\n\"I have to face the difficult truth that, perhaps, we in the churches could have done more to deepen our understanding of each other and to bring healing and peace to our divided and wounded communities,\" he said.\nSpeaking afterwards, the prime minister said: \"It has been very moving to be here today and see the way in which people from very different perspectives have come together.\"\nMr Johnson said Northern Ireland was \"an incredible part of the country\" and had \"an amazing future\".\nThe prime minister added: \"I am a passionate unionist and, of course, I believe the future is within the United Kingdom.\"\nThe Queen had been due to attend the service but was unable to travel for medical reasons. \nIrish president Michael D Higgins declined an invitation.\nThe Armagh church service was organised to \"mark the centenaries of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland\".\nPresident Higgins said the title of the service made it \"inappropriate\" for him to attend as head of state.\nSinn F\u00e9in, including Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, also decided not to attend.\nHowever, Colum Eastwood, the leader of Northern Ireland's other nationalist party, the SDLP, was present.\nAmong others at the service were Northern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan, of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP); DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson; Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie; Alliance leader Naomi Long; Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride.\nTwo representatives from the Irish government were also present - Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, from the Fine Gael party, and chief whip Jack Chambers, from Fianna F\u00e1il.\nWith Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey, a Sinn F\u00e9in member, not attending, deputy speaker Roy Beggs formally represented the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nThe event, titled \"A Service of Reflection and Hope\", was organised by the leaders of the main Protestant and Catholic Churches. \nIt began with the ringing of the cathedral bell before the Dean of Armagh, Rev Shane Forster, sent his good wishes to the Queen.\nWelcoming the congregation in both English and Irish, he said: \"Our past has shaped us and scarred us, it has divided us. And, yet, it has also, on occasion, brought us together.\"\nThe leaders of Ireland's main churches delivered their personal reflections on the creation of Northern Ireland.\nThe Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Dr David Bruce, said: \"I grieve the times when fear has held us back from building relationships with those with whom we differ.\n\"If we are to build a better future, then we must recognise our own woundedness and our responsibility to care for the wounds of one another.\"\nDr Ivan Patterson, the president of the Irish Council of Churches, said \"we need to learn\" from the example of young people.\n\"They are a generation who want to build peace, a generation who respect and care for this planet in solidarity with the poorest and most vulnerable here and around the world.\"\nChurch of Ireland Primate Rev John McDowell said:  \"I am hopeful. Hopeful in a new generation who know that the big problems we've landed them with, especially climate change and economic inequality, can only be tackled together.\n\"I think there are already signs that the next generation will see the things that we obsessed about as secondary and place their priorities elsewhere.\n\"As we lament our failures, sorrows and pain, and recognise our wounded yet living history, may we with a united voice commit ourselves to work together for the common good, in mutual respect and with shared hope for a light-filled, prosperous and peaceful future.\"\nThe main sermon was given by the president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, Rev Dr Sahr Yambasu, who told the congregation: \"We have come a long way - not just a century but centuries. \n\"During that time people have cared for one another and made efforts to build community.\"\nBut he added: \"We have also been blighted by sectarian divisions, terrible injustices, destructive violence, and by win-lose political attitudes. And for this, we have cause to lament.\"\nDr Yambasu said Thursday's service was an opportunity \"to give thanks and, also, lament; to imagine what could be, and to choose the way forward that can be mutually beneficial\".\nThe service included an opening prayer in Irish led by Linda Ervine and Se\u00e1n Coll. \nIntercessions were offered by Prof Mary Hannon-Fletcher and Robert Barfoot, both of whom were injured in the Troubles.\nChildren carried a lantern to the altar, a symbol of light and hope for the future.\nNorthern Ireland was established in May 1921 after the partition of Ireland.\nIt followed decades of turmoil between nationalists, who wanted independence from British rule, and unionists, who wanted to remain in the United Kingdom.\nThe border divided the 32-county island into two separate jurisdictions - six counties in the north-east became Northern Ireland, which is still part of the UK. The other 26-county territory became the Irish Free State, but is now the Republic of Ireland.\nNationalists, north and south of the border, were infuriated by partition and continued to campaign for independence for the whole island.\nMany unionists were also bitterly disappointed, especially those who lived on the southern side and woke up to find themselves in a new state on 3 May 1921.\nThe BBC News NI website has a dedicated section marking the 100th anniversary of the creation of Northern Ireland and partition of the island. \nThere are special reports on the major figures of the time and the events that shaped modern Ireland available at bbc.co.uk/ni100.\nYear '21: You can also explore how Northern Ireland was created a hundred years ago in the company of Tara Mills and Declan Harvey.\nListen to the latest Year '21 podcast on BBC Sounds or catch-up on previous episodes."

      "tags": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,COP26,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "A huge leak of documents seen by BBC News shows how countries are trying to change a crucial scientific report on how to tackle climate change.\nThe leak reveals Saudi Arabia, Japan and Australia are among countries asking the UN to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels.\nIt also shows some wealthy nations are questioning paying more to poorer states to move to greener technologies.\nThis \"lobbying\" raises questions for the COP26 climate summit in November.\nThe leak reveals countries pushing back on UN recommendations for action and comes just days before they will be asked at the summit to make significant commitments to slow down climate change and keep global warming to 1.5 degrees.\nThe leaked documents consist of more than 32,000 submissions made by governments, companies and other interested parties to the team of scientists compiling a UN report designed to bring together the best scientific evidence on how to tackle climate change.\nThese \"assessment reports\" are produced every six to seven years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN body tasked with evaluating the science of climate change.\nThese reports are used by governments to decide what action is needed to tackle climate change, and the latest will be a crucial input to negotiations at the Glasgow conference. \nThe authority of these reports derives in part from the fact that virtually all the governments of the world participate in the process to reach consensus.\nThe comments from governments the BBC has read are overwhelmingly designed to be constructive and to improve the quality of the final report.\nThe cache of comments and the latest draft of the report were released to Greenpeace UK's team of investigative journalists, Unearthed, which passed it on to BBC News.\nThe leak shows a number of countries and organisations arguing that the world does not need to reduce the use of fossil fuels as quickly as the current draft of the report recommends. \nAn adviser to the Saudi oil ministry demands \"phrases like 'the need for urgent and accelerated mitigation actions at all scales\u2026' should be eliminated from the report\".\nOne senior Australian government official rejects the conclusion that closing coal-fired power plants is necessary, even though ending the use of coal is one of the stated objectives the COP26 conference. \nSaudi Arabia is the one of the largest oil producers in the world and Australia is a major coal exporter.\nA senior scientist from India's Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research, which has strong links to the Indian government, warns coal is likely to remain the mainstay of energy production for decades because of what they describe as the \"tremendous challenges\" of providing affordable electricity. India is already the world's second biggest consumer of coal. \nA number of countries argue in favour of emerging and currently expensive technologies designed to capture and permanently store carbon dioxide underground. Saudi Arabia, China, Australia and Japan - all big producers or users of fossil fuels - as well as the organisation of oil producing nations, Opec, all support carbon capture and storage (CCS).\nIt is claimed these CCS technologies could dramatically cut fossil fuel emissions from power plants and some industrial sectors.\nSaudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, requests the UN scientists delete their conclusion that \"the focus of decarbonisation efforts in the energy systems sector needs to be on rapidly shifting to zero-carbon sources and actively phasing out fossil fuels\".  \nArgentina, Norway and Opec also take issue with the statement. Norway argues the UN scientists should allow the possibility of CCS as a potential tool for reducing emissions from fossil fuels.  \nThe draft report accepts CCS could play a role in the future but says there are uncertainties about its feasibility. It says \"there is large ambiguity in the extent to which fossil fuels with CCS would be compatible with the 2C and 1.5C targets\" as set out by the Paris Agreement.\nAustralia asks IPCC scientists to delete a reference to analysis of the role played by fossil fuel lobbyists in watering down action on climate in Australia and the US. Opec also asks the IPCC to \"delete 'lobby activism, protecting rent extracting business models, prevent political action'.\"\nWhen approached about its comments to the draft report, Opec told the BBC: \"The challenge of tackling emissions has many paths, as evidenced by the IPCC report, and we need to explore them all. We need to utilise all available energies, as well as clean and more efficient technological solutions to help reduce emissions, ensuring no one is left behind.\"\nThe IPCC says comments from governments are central to its scientific review process and that its authors have no obligation to incorporate them into the reports. \n\"Our processes are designed to guard against lobbying - from all quarters\", the IPCC told the BBC. \"The review process is (and always has been) absolutely fundamental to the IPCC's work and is a major source of the strength and credibility of our reports.\nProfessor Corinne le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 of the University of East Anglia, a leading climate scientist who has helped compile three major reports for the IPCC, has no doubts about the impartiality of the IPCC's reports.\nShe says all comments are judged solely on scientific evidence regardless of where they come from. \n\"There is absolutely no pressure on scientists to accept the comments,\" she told the BBC. \"If the comments are lobbying, if they're not justified by the science, they will not be integrated in the IPCC reports.\"\nShe says it is important that experts of all kinds - including governments - have a chance to review the science. \n\"The more the reports are scrutinised\", says Professor le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, \"the more solid the evidence is going to be in the end, because the more the arguments are brought and articulated forward in a way that is leaning on the best available science\".\nChristiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who oversaw the landmark UN climate conference in Paris in 2015, agrees it is crucial that governments are part of the IPCC process.\n\"Everybody's voice has to be there. That's the whole purpose. This is not a single thread. This is a tapestry woven by many, many threads.\"\nThe United Nations was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2007 for the IPCC's work on climate science and the crucial role it has played in the effort to tackle climate change.\nBrazil and Argentina, two of the biggest producers of beef products and animal feed crops in the world, argue strongly against evidence in the draft report that reducing meat consumption is necessary to cut greenhouse gas emissions. \nThe draft report states \"plant-based diets can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50% compared to the average emission intensive Western diet\". Brazil says this is incorrect. \nBoth countries call on the authors to delete or change some passages in the text referring to \"plant-based diets\" playing a role in tackling climate change, or which describe beef as a \"high carbon\" food. Argentina also asked that references to taxes on red meat and to the international \"Meatless Monday\" campaign, which urges people to forgo meat for a day, be removed from the report.\nThe South American nation recommends \"avoiding generalisation on the impacts of meat-based diets on low-carbon options\", arguing there is evidence that meat-based diets can also reduce carbon emissions. \nOn the same theme, Brazil says \"plant-based diets do not for themselves guarantee the reduction or control of related emissions\" and maintains the focus of debate should be on the levels of emissions from different production systems, rather than types of food. \nBrazil, which has seen significant increases in the rate of deforestation in the Amazon and some other forest areas, also disputes a reference to this being a result of changes in government regulations, claiming this is incorrect.\nA significant number of Switzerland's comments are directed at amending parts of the report that argue developing countries will need support, particularly financial support, from rich countries in order to meet emission reduction targets.\nIt was agreed at the climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009 that developed nations would provide $100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020, a target that has yet to be met.\nAustralia makes a similar case to Switzerland. It says developing countries' climate pledges do not all depend on receiving outside financial support. It also describes a mention in the draft report of the lack of credible public commitments on finance as \"subjective commentary\". \nThe Swiss Federal Office for the Environment told the BBC: \"While climate finance is a critical tool to increase climate ambition, it is not the only relevant tool.\n\"Switzerland takes the view that all Parties to the Paris Agreement with the capacity to do so should provide support to those who need such support.\" \nA number of mostly eastern European countries argue the draft report should be more positive about the role nuclear power can play in meeting the UN's climate targets.   \nIndia goes even further, arguing \"almost all the chapters contain a bias against nuclear energy\". It argues it is an \"established technology\" with \"good political backing except in a few countries\". \nThe Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia criticise a table in the report which finds nuclear power only has a positive role in delivering one of 17 UN Sustainable Development goals. They argue it can play a positive role in delivering most of the UN's development agenda. \nDo you have any questions about the leak of climate documents?

      "text": "The NHS in Wales has recorded its worst performance figures ever amid growing concerns on staff pressures ahead of a difficult winter.\nNearly 250,000 people have been waiting more than nine months for treatment, up from about 25,000 at the start of the pandemic, statistics show. \nNHS Wales chief executive Andrew Goodall said the system was running \"at the hottest we've seen\" due to Covid.\nIt comes as the Welsh government unveils its winter pressures plan.\nThe Welsh Conservatives criticised the plan as a \"copy and paste failure\" from last year.\nRussell George MS, the party's health spokesman, said the party had called on the government to \"bring in rapid diagnostic centres to spot cancers earlier and deliver treatment to patients closer to home\", which would \"help address the backlog\".\nLatest Welsh NHS data shows accident and emergency waiting times were again the worst on record - only 66.8% were admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours.\nThis was down from 68.7% in July, which was itself a record.\nCancer treatment waiting times have improved slightly since July - 63.2% of patients newly diagnosed with cancer started their first treatment within 62 days of first being suspected of cancer. This is one percentage point higher than August 2019.\nSeventeen organisations representing staff have jointly warned of a \"deepening winter care crisis\". \nDr Goodall said: \"It does feel like this is the most challenging period... and we can see that in the data. \n\"Rather than just focusing on coronavirus we've got the NHS trying to restore a range of activities across all its settings.\"\nDr Goodall said there were 700 Covid patients in hospital beds - the equivalent of two medium-sized district general hospitals - alongside record ambulance calls, high levels of emergency demand and a busiest-ever primary care sector. \nWales' newest hospital, the Grange in Cwmbran, for a second month in a row recorded the worst A&E performance in a month for any Welsh emergency unit with just 38% of people dealt with within four hours. The target is 95%.\nAnd 8,484 people waited more than 12 hours in A&E when the target is that no-one should wait that long.\nWaiting lists also grew further to 657,539, a record which is equivalent to more than 20% of the Welsh population.\nDr Goodall said some planned operations would likely be postponed over the winter.\n\"Inevitably there will be some disruption and that will involve planned care, but the commitment of the NHS is to maintain as many of its activities in all of its settings for as long as possible,\" he said.\nHe said health boards would need to make decisions regarding the extent planned services could be protected in the face of other pressures.\nEarlier this week, Health Minister Eluned Morgan said it would be \"very tough\" to work through waiting lists, but health boards had been told to \"keep in touch\" and offer support, such as pain relief, to those waiting. \nThe Welsh government's winter pressures plan includes an extra \u00a340m for social care, as well as extra funding for front-line services, to try and tackle delays discharging patients from hospital and cut readmissions of frail and vulnerable people. \nBut Dr Goodall said staff shortages in the care workforce were concerning. \nHe said: \"The resilience of the care system is a concern - it feels it is at its most fragile even with the support available.\n\"We've provided funding to make sure the care sector is further supported, but workforce elements is a problem, whether it's people choosing to enter a care career or the community prevalence of Covid, meaning staff have to self-isolate.\"\nIn an effort to take pressure off emergency services, Aneurin Bevan Health Board has set up urgent care centres at Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital and Abergavenny's Nevill Hall Hospital.\nThis was after estimating that between 30% and 50% of those attending A&E could be seen in primary care settings. \nAlready, 5,500 patients have been seen and clinical director Dr Alice Groves said: \"The worry was patients would have waited ages at A&E or become unwell trying to access other services.\"\nMeanwhile, 17 medical royal colleges and faculties have warned of a growing winter crisis and called for a national plan to deal with staff shortages.\nA recent survey by the Royal College of Physicians found 46% of respondents in Wales said their organisation was not at all prepared for winter, 37% felt personally unprepared, with 63% feeling tired or exhausted. \nAsked if the pressures of winter might \"break\" exhausted staff, Dr Goodall said: \"This [pandemic period] has been a much more sustained experience than many of us would have envisaged. \n\"When we usually talk of a major incident we talk of a matter of hours or days. We've been running a major incident situation for 20 months now.\n\"Everybody needs to do their bit including the public, but I know NHS staff will pull out all the stops.\""

      "text": "Morocco has banned flights to and from the UK due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nSeveral UK airlines and holiday companies have been told by the Moroccan government that flights will be suspended from 23:59 BST on Wednesday until further notice. \nFlights between Morocco and Germany and the Netherlands have also been suspended. \nThe BBC has contacted the Moroccan embassy and tourism office, as well as the UK Foreign Office for comment. \nLatest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said that Morocco's weekly rate of reported coronavirus cases on 14 October stood at 10.4 per 100,000 people, compared with 445.5 per 100,000 people in the UK.\nOn Tuesday, the UK reported 43,738 new Covid-19 infections, with new cases above 40,000 for seven days in a row. The number of patients in hospital rose by 10% in a week to 7,749 on Monday.\nAnother 223 deaths were recorded, the largest number since March, although daily figures are often higher on Tuesdays.\nThe UK government updated its advice on travel to Morocco to state that the Moroccan government has suspended direct flights between the UK and Morocco for an unspecified period of time. \nUK passengers are not banned from travelling from the country, but must travel via a third country to do so. \nThe advice states that UK travellers will need to provide proof that they have been fully vaccinated for at least two weeks or a negative PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before boarding. \nThey will also be asked to present a Public Health Passenger form to the Moroccan authorities on arrival.\nEasyJet has said that it was told this morning. It has cancelled its outbound flights from the UK, Germany and Netherlands to Morocco until 30 November. \nThe airline had two flights operating from Manchester and Gatwick to Marrakech, which it will operate as \"ferry flights\" for return customers due to travel back to the UK today.\nIt said that, ahead of receiving further guidance from the Moroccan government, it intends to fly inbound flights in the coming days as repatriation flight options. \n\"We are contacting all customers whose flights are cancelled with their options, which include a free of charge transfer, receiving a voucher or a refund,\" an EasyJet statement said. \nBritish Airways has cancelled a flight from Heathrow to the same destination, meanwhile holiday operator Tui confirmed it had also been contacted by the Moroccan government. \nTui said: \"We are contacting customers in departure date order to discuss their options, which include amending to another destination or a full refund. We would like to thank our customers for their patience and understanding during this time.\"\nThe tour operator said it currently has about 2,000 UK travellers in Morocco, but hasnot yet confirmed whether it will need to bring these passengers back early.\nThe flight ban will affect families in England and Wales who booked half-term holidays in Morocco for next week. \nMorocco's National Office of Airports said the policy will remain in place \"until further notice\".\nThe UK's Foreign Office has updated its advice on travel to Morocco to include the latest development. \nIt says that passengers returning to the UK from Morocco should contact their airline or tour operator to arrange an alternative route via a third country, such as Spain or France, where flights are operating as normal.\nAlison Sedgewick is currently on holiday in Agadir, off the south-western coast of Morocco, with her husband and son.\nOn Thursday, they were due to return from their first holiday in the two and a half years since her son was born.\n\"You couldn't write it\u2026 the one week we've chosen to go away and they've closed the borders while we're here,\" she said.\nHowever, Ms Sedgewick added she felt hopeful that because she booked a package holiday with Tui, things would get sorted out swiftly. She said she received a \"holding message\" from the tour operator, telling her she will hear more information within 24 hours.\n\"I'm hoping it'll be a bit sooner than that because the bus to the airport is supposed to be picking us at half six tomorrow evening,\" she added.\nWhile she joked that her main concern is ensuring she doesn't run out of nappies for her son, Ms Sedgewick said she did feel put off the idea of travelling during the upcoming winter months. \n\"We debated doing a city break in November or December but I don't feel confident travelling abroad over winter because things like this might become more common,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, Peter Mercer, the owner of the Dar Zaman boutique hotel in Marrakech, said that several guests were \"rushing around\" and attempting to return to the UK on Wednesday before the ban came into place.\n\"It's going to have a major impact, not just from the UK but also the flights from Germany and the Netherlands,\" he said.\n\"It's not very encouraging because we're suddenly back to where we were in March 2020. In terms of our business model, it is worrying. People perhaps will lose faith in travel because restrictions can be imposed with little notice.\"\nWhile Mr Mercer said that he agrees with the Moroccan government's actions to reduce the spread of coronavirus, he hopes any restrictions on travel will be short-term."

      "text": "Vaccination is 90% effective at preventing deaths from the Delta variant of Covid-19, researchers say.\nThe data, released by the University of Edinburgh, was gathered using a Scotland-wide Covid surveillance tool.\nFigures suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 90% effective and the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab 91% effective at preventing deaths. \nIt looked at people who have been double-vaccinated but who have tested positive for Covid in the community.\nThe study is the first to show across an entire country how effective vaccines are at preventing death from the Delta variant, which is the most dominant form of Covid in the UK.\nResearchers defined death from Covid as anyone who died within 28 days of a positive PCR test, or with Covid recorded as a cause of death on their death certificate.\nThe study analysed data from 5.4 million people in Scotland between 1 April and 27 September this year.\nDuring this period, 115,000 people tested positive for Covid using a PCR test in the community, rather than in hospital, and there were 201 Covid-related deaths recorded.\nNo deaths have been recorded in those who have been double-vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine in Scotland, according to the data.  \nResearchers said it is therefore not possible to estimate this particular vaccine's effectiveness in preventing Covid-related deaths.\nThe research team from the University of Edinburgh, University of Strathclyde and Public Health Scotland analysed the dataset as part of the EAVE II project - Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of Covid-19.\nIt uses anonymised, linked-patient data to track the pandemic and the vaccine rollout in real time.\nSo far, 87.1% of adults in Scotland have taken a second dose of the Covid vaccine. \nThird \"booster\" doses are being offered to everyone over 50, along with frontline medical staff and younger adults with some underlying health conditions.\nProf Aziz Sheikh, director of the University of Edinburgh's Usher Institute and EAVE II study lead, said: \"With the Delta variant now the dominant strain in many places worldwide, and posing a higher risk of hospitalisation than previous variants seen in the UK, it is reassuring to see that vaccination offers such high protection from death very shortly after the second dose.\n\"If you still have not taken up your offer to be vaccinated, I would encourage you to do so based on the clear benefits it offers.\"\nProf Chris Robertson, of the University of Strathclyde and Public Health Scotland, said: \"This study shows the value of carrying out analyses of routine healthcare data available in near real-time.\n\"Our findings are encouraging in showing that the vaccine remains an effective measure in protecting both ourselves and others from death from the most dominant variant of Covid-19.\" \nHe added that it was important to validate these early results with follow-up studies.\nThe team behind the study said due to the observational nature of the figures, data about vaccine effectiveness should be interpreted with caution and said it was not possible to make a direct comparison between both vaccines.

And politicians often talk to members of the public and sports personalities and so on about setting a right example for the public and I do think it behoves them to do the same thing.\" \nMost MPs from opposition parties have been wearing masks in the Commons chamber since full in-person sittings resumed over the summer. \nThe government is still encouraging people in England to wear face coverings in \"crowded and enclosed spaces\", although it is no longer mandatory.\nOn Wednesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said mask-wearing was one of several measures that could help lower Covid transmission over the winter.\nSpeaking at a Covid press conference in Downing Street, he warned restrictions were \"more likely\" to return if people \"don't wear masks when they really should\".\nHe said this included \"really crowded\" places \"with lots of people that they don't normally hang out with\".\nHis statement came just hours after MPs packed into the Commons chamber for Prime Minister's Questions. \nNearly all Conservative MPs, including government ministers, did not wear a face covering during the session. \nLiberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said: \"It is utter hypocrisy that the public are rightfully being advised to wear masks while Conservative MPs refuse to do so.\n\"Conservative MPs and ministers have a duty to lead by example and take precautions to protect themselves, their colleagues and staff.\"\nUnions representing parliamentary staff say their members have been told to wear masks in the chamber, and have called for Tory MPs to do the same.\nThe Prospect union has previously accused maskless MPs of \"recklessly undermining\" public health messaging, and urged mask-wearing to be more rigorously enforced. \nGMB and Unite have called on Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who enforces the parliamentary dress code, to refuse entry to maskless MPs. \nSir Lindsay has encouraged MPs to continue to wear masks during debates, but has said there is \"no meaningful way\" for him to enforce this as he does not have the right to stop elected MPs entering the Commons."

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "The COP26 climate summit is under way in Glasgow - one of the biggest ever world meetings on how to tackle global warming. \nBBC News Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris answers some of your questions.\nYou can send a question using the form at the bottom of this page.\nHow is the average family going to find the extra \u00a320,000 needed to buy an electric vehicle?  Nicola Hippisley, London\nYou don't necessarily need an extra \u00a320,000 to buy an electric vehicle. \nOverall, electric cars have been more expensive than petrol or diesel ones for some time, but the difference has been narrowing. \nThe average cost of an electric car in the UK is about \u00a344,000, but you can buy a basic one for less than \u00a320,000. That's partly because the price of the batteries which electric cars use has fallen sharply in recent years. \nAt the moment, the price of raw materials is threatening to push battery prices up again, but the industry expects that as electric car sales increase, economies of scale will kick in. \nExperts predict that new electric and petrol/diesel cars will cost the same within the next five years. It is also possible to lease an electric vehicle, and there's a growing second-hand market as well, where vehicles are much cheaper. \nThe UK government currently offers a grant of up to \u00a32,500 as a discount on the price of certain brand new low-emission vehicles including some electric models. \nYou can also claim a grant of up to \u00a3350 to help meet the cost of installing a chargepoint at your house if you have dedicated off-street parking. This is available whether you lease your car or own it outright. \nSeparately, the Scottish government offers interest-free loans to help people buy brand new or used electric vehicles. \nHow will the decisions made at COP26 change our day-to-day lives? I want to know what I can do to help move these policies forward. Matthew Hadley, Harpenden\nThe decisions made at COP26 are part of the wider ambition to decarbonise our economies - and that will certainly have an impact on daily life. \nThe cars we drive and the way we heat our homes are going to change. Buying an electric vehicle, or getting a heat pump installed at home, is going to become more and more common. The hope - and for many the expectation - is that as these technologies become more established, the costs will come down. \nThere are also personal choices to be made about what we eat (the Climate Change Committee which advises the government recommends a 20% reduction per person by 2050 in the amount of beef, lamb and dairy we consume), and how often we fly. \nThen there are practical issues like recycling and cutting down on waste as much as possible. \nWhy are we still referring to 2050 as some sort of end goal, since very little has changed in the last two decades? Wouldn't 2040 or perhaps even 2030 put a little more urgency into every little step humanity takes? Jake Kettmann, Bega, NSW, Australia\nThe year 2050 is the target date set by many countries for reaching net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. But you're not alone in thinking that 2050 is much too far in the future to force some politicians or companies to take action now. \nThat's why there are also plenty of interim targets, and the 2020s have been identified as a critical decade for climate action - it can't all be delayed until the 10 years leading up to 2050.\nMany of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases have now set targets for 2030, and the UN says overall emissions need to fall by 45% [by that date]compared to 2010 levels, if the aim of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is to remain realistic. \nAt the moment, though, the world is nowhere near achieving that, even with the new pledges made at COP26.\nIf scientists have already considered a 1.5C reduction goal will not be achieved, why don't we set up a new goal, which we may able to achieve? Ana, Vietnam\nQuite a few scientists think it may already be too late to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but they'd rather have an ambitious target to aim for. \nThe Paris Agreement in 2015 set the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2C, and preferably to 1.5C. So \"well below 2C\" is already written into law as a secondary target. \nThere's also a growing awareness of the need to take action which will make a difference in the next five to 10 years. That's why many of the agreements made at COP26 - to reverse deforestation, for example, or to cut global methane emissions by 30% - set 2030 as their target date. \nThe challenge now of course is to turn those promises into practice, and to deliver urgent change.\nHow can we be sure the claims made about greenhouse gas emissions can be verified? What independent observer is measuring different countries' attempts to reduce their fossil fuel usage? Lee Gary, Spain\nChecking claims made about greenhouse gas emissions is one of the biggest issues for negotiators at COP26. \nAt the moment, countries only have to review and update their pledges for cutting emissions every five years. Many people argue that's not often enough, and some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change want to turn it into an annual process to keep the pressure on. \nThe role of independent observer is supposed to be filled by UN scientists. But a recent investigation by The Washington Post found multiple examples of flawed or inaccurate data submitted to the UN by individual countries. It is another example of climate promises falling short of what is required, as a process which relies so heavily on data needs to ensure that the data is accurate.\nLast month, a UN-backed body launched a scheme to verify net zero claims made by big companies, to ensure that corporate pledges can be easily compared and properly scrutinised.\nIs there a way to force countries in the UN, especially China and India, to cut back to net zero by 2050? Can sanctions or similar trade restrictions be used against them? Diana Butungi, Kampala\nOnly a few countries have made their net zero pledges legally binding. Many of the national pledges are non-binding targets, but there is a hope that as momentum towards net zero begins to accelerate it will provide an incentive for others to follow. \nIt would be possible in theory to impose trade or other sanctions on countries that are moving more slowly, but that could be counter-productive. The focus of meetings like COP26 is to try to encourage international cooperation. \nIt's also unfair to put all the blame on countries like India and China for the majority of carbon emissions, even though China is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world today and India is the third largest. China and India have huge populations, and much lower emissions per person than more developed countries.\nIn any case, it's important to consider the historical role played by European countries and the United States which are responsible for far more cumulative emissions than China or India. \nThe damaging effects of emitting CO2 into the atmosphere linger for hundreds of years, and the rich world has acknowledged that it has the primary responsibility for tackling climate change.\nAre there plans for governments and countries to invest in carbon-capture technologies on a very large scale? If not, why? Bernath Bence, Netherlands\nThe trouble with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is that the technology that does exist, won't be rolled out fast enough to make any significant difference this decade, when greenhouse gas emissions need to fall significantly.  \nIn 2020, for example, the UK allocated \u00a31bn to a CCS infrastructure fund, with the ambition of capturing the equivalent of 10m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030. \nThat target has already been increased to capturing 20-30m metric tonnes by 2030. But, to put that in perspective, the UK is estimated to have produced the net equivalent of more than 450m metric tonnes of CO2 in 2019.\nGovernment investment varies hugely around the world. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Australia are relying very heavily on CCS to allow them to continue producing fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, but that means scaling up the technology in a way which has not yet been proven to work effectively.  \nHow do agricultural products like rice and sugar contribute to the increase of CO2? What can we do to help reduce emissions? Ng Wee Meng, Singapore\nMost forms of agriculture produce CO2 emissions in one way or another.  \nBeef is widely agreed to be the most carbon-intensive food to produce globally, but there are emissions from sugar and rice - these are connected with factors such as deforestation, animal feed, energy used in processing and transport, and packaging. \nOne study estimates that rice, for example, produces the equivalent of 4kg of CO2 emissions for every 1kg of rice produced. Given that 755 million tonnes of rice are produced every year around the world, that is a lot of CO2. On the other hand, rice is an essential staple food feeding billions around the world.  \nThe best way to help reduce emissions is to try to ensure you eat food which is produced as sustainably as possible - although many people may not have the luxury of that choice.\nWould enforcing quotas for meat consumption and flight travels be efficient and feasible? Anonymous, Geneva\nMeat eating (especially beef) and travelling by air both have a sizeable environmental impact. \nEating one or two hamburgers a week for a year creates the same amount of greenhouse gases as heating a UK home for 95 days.\nAnd a return economy flight from London to New York emits about 0.67 tonnes of CO2. That's 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK.\nIn theory, enforced quotas for meat consumption or flying would make a difference, but there's little political appetite or support for that to happen. Instead, the focus is on encouraging behavioural change. \nThe UK Climate Change Committee - which advises the government - has recommended that people should consume 20% less meat and dairy by 2030, and 35% less by 2050. People are also being urged to think about flying less. \nUsing taxation to make certain things more expensive would probably be a more realistic solution than trying to enforce quotas. \nWhy can't we have an international fund to help poorer countries attain zero carbon emissions? Robert Patterson, Darlington\nThat is partly what the current debate on climate finance is all about. \nIn 2009, rich countries said they would provide $100bn (\u00a373bn) every year to the developing world by 2020. But they have been unable to live up to their promise, and they are now suggesting they will only meet that target in 2023. \nPoorer countries need this money to help tackle the effects of climate change that they are already facing. But they also need it to make sure their economies become greener as they develop, on a path to net zero carbon emissions.   \nIf it is people causing climate change, what is being done to stop over-population ? Gaye Schmidt, Perth, Australia\nOverpopulation isn't the root cause of climate change. Rather, it's the excessive emission of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet up. And the richest one per cent of the world's population is responsible for more carbon emissions than the poorest fifty per cent. \nIt is true to say the population of the planet can't keep increasing indefinitely, because there is a finite number of resources available. But excessive consumption has played a larger role in climate change than a growing global population.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nIs the global capitalist model not at odds with climate change and the need for a greener way of life? Andrew, Exeter\nMatt McGrath writes:\nAccording to some experts, such as the economist Lord Stern, climate change can be seen as the great failure of the market. \nThis is because businesses have not generally had to pay for the damage they have caused to the environment.\nGlobal efforts to tackle climate change over the past two decades have focused more on harnessing capitalism to limit warming - for instance, putting a price on carbon and making the polluter pay, to ensure that emissions are ultimately restricted.\nMeanwhile, it's also the case that if there's consumer demand for greener products and services, capitalism will try to meet that demand.\nBut there's evidently still a lot of work to be done to make these approaches work.\nDoes COP26 really need 25,000 people there? They will generate a lot of CO2, so why can't many elements be online? David, Birmingham\nMatt McGrath writes:\nThe pandemic might be seen as the perfect moment for the UN to use technology for negotiations, and it was attempted during a preparatory meeting for COP in June, which ran for three weeks.\nUnfortunately, it didn't go well - time-zone and technology challenges made it almost impossible for countries with limited resources, progress was limited and decisions were put off.\nAs a result, many developing nations have insisted on having an in-person COP. They feel that it is far easier for their voices to be ignored on a dodgy Zoom connection.\nThey also bring a lived experience of climate change that it is critical for rich countries to hear first-hand.\nThere's some evidence that this works. In 2015, the presence of island states and vulnerable nations was key to securing the commitment to limit temperature changes to 1.5C in the Paris Agreement.\nWhat questions do you have about changes in our climate? \nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "The NHS in Wales has recorded its worst performance figures ever amid growing concerns on staff pressures ahead of a difficult winter.\nNearly 250,000 people have been waiting more than nine months for treatment, up from about 25,000 at the start of the pandemic, statistics show. \nNHS Wales chief executive Andrew Goodall said the system was running \"at the hottest we've seen\" due to Covid.\nIt comes as the Welsh government unveils its winter pressures plan.\nThe Welsh Conservatives criticised the plan as a \"copy and paste failure\" from last year.\nRussell George MS, the party's health spokesman, said the party had called on the government to \"bring in rapid diagnostic centres to spot cancers earlier and deliver treatment to patients closer to home\", which would \"help address the backlog\".\nLatest Welsh NHS data shows accident and emergency waiting times were again the worst on record - only 66.8% were admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours.\nThis was down from 68.7% in July, which was itself a record.\nCancer treatment waiting times have improved slightly since July - 63.2% of patients newly diagnosed with cancer started their first treatment within 62 days of first being suspected of cancer. This is one percentage point higher than August 2019.\nSeventeen organisations representing staff have jointly warned of a \"deepening winter care crisis\". \nDr Goodall said: \"It does feel like this is the most challenging period... and we can see that in the data. \n\"Rather than just focusing on coronavirus we've got the NHS trying to restore a range of activities across all its settings.\"\nDr Goodall said there were 700 Covid patients in hospital beds - the equivalent of two medium-sized district general hospitals - alongside record ambulance calls, high levels of emergency demand and a busiest-ever primary care sector. \nWales' newest hospital, the Grange in Cwmbran, for a second month in a row recorded the worst A&E performance in a month for any Welsh emergency unit with just 38% of people dealt with within four hours. The target is 95%.\nAnd 8,484 people waited more than 12 hours in A&E when the target is that no-one should wait that long.\nWaiting lists also grew further to 657,539, a record which is equivalent to more than 20% of the Welsh population.\nDr Goodall said some planned operations would likely be postponed over the winter.\n\"Inevitably there will be some disruption and that will involve planned care, but the commitment of the NHS is to maintain as many of its activities in all of its settings for as long as possible,\" he said.\nHe said health boards would need to make decisions regarding the extent planned services could be protected in the face of other pressures.\nEarlier this week, Health Minister Eluned Morgan said it would be \"very tough\" to work through waiting lists, but health boards had been told to \"keep in touch\" and offer support, such as pain relief, to those waiting. \nThe Welsh government's winter pressures plan includes an extra \u00a340m for social care, as well as extra funding for front-line services, to try and tackle delays discharging patients from hospital and cut readmissions of frail and vulnerable people. \nBut Dr Goodall said staff shortages in the care workforce were concerning. \nHe said: \"The resilience of the care system is a concern - it feels it is at its most fragile even with the support available.\n\"We've provided funding to make sure the care sector is further supported, but workforce elements is a problem, whether it's people choosing to enter a care career or the community prevalence of Covid, meaning staff have to self-isolate.\"\nIn an effort to take pressure off emergency services, Aneurin Bevan Health Board has set up urgent care centres at Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital and Abergavenny's Nevill Hall Hospital.\nThis was after estimating that between 30% and 50% of those attending A&E could be seen in primary care settings. \nAlready, 5,500 patients have been seen and clinical director Dr Alice Groves said: \"The worry was patients would have waited ages at A&E or become unwell trying to access other services.\"\nMeanwhile, 17 medical royal colleges and faculties have warned of a growing winter crisis and called for a national plan to deal with staff shortages.\nA recent survey by the Royal College of Physicians found 46% of respondents in Wales said their organisation was not at all prepared for winter, 37% felt personally unprepared, with 63% feeling tired or exhausted. \nAsked if the pressures of winter might \"break\" exhausted staff, Dr Goodall said: \"This [pandemic period] has been a much more sustained experience than many of us would have envisaged. \n\"When we usually talk of a major incident we talk of a matter of hours or days. We've been running a major incident situation for 20 months now.\n\"Everybody needs to do their bit including the public, but I know NHS staff will pull out all the stops.\""

A total of 151 personnel are still driving tankers to transport fuel.\nSupermarket chain Asda said on 13 October that it had not had any petrol supply problems for a week after demand eased, while the Petrol Retailers Association said supplies in London and the South East had improved.\nLondon and the South East were the slowest regions to recover from the shortage, but petrol station storage tanks in these areas were an average of 42% and 45% full on Sunday, according to the Department for Business.\nThe situation in the most populous parts of the country had been described as \"serious\" at one point.\nBut the latest numbers also show that UK sales of fuel have slowed from an average of 35,900 litres per filling station on 24 September to 11,800 litres on Sunday.\nDuring the supply crisis, motorway service stations were prioritised for deliveries.\nMany parts of the UK economy, including supermarkets, retailers, and ports, have been affected by shortage of HGV drivers.\nA Road Haulage Association (RHA) survey of its members estimated there was now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK. \nThe industry believes the existing shortage has been exacerbated by the pandemic, Brexit, tax changes, and a slowdown in driver testing.\nIn response, the government has introduced temporary visas for 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK, although only just over 20 of the 300 applications have been approved so far, according to Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden.\nA government statement said: \"Thanks to our interventions and the continuing deliveries made by the military, fuel levels across all regions returned to normal earlier this month.  \n\"As the industry has said, we have ample fuel reserves and the return of normal buying habits by the public has reduced the exceptional demand seen in previous weeks.\""

      "tags": "Economics,UK economy,UK national debt,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "Government borrowing fell in September compared with a year earlier as the economy continued to recover from coronavirus lockdowns.\nBorrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - stood at \u00a321.8bn, which was \u00a37bn less than in September 2020.\nBut the figure was still the second-highest for September since monthly records began in 1993. \nBorrowing hit record levels during the pandemic.\nThe government spent billions of pounds on emergency measures to protect wages, such as the furlough scheme, which wrapped up last month.\nAs a result, government debt has been pushed up to more than \u00a32.2 trillion at the end of September this year - about 95.5% of the UK's gross domestic product (GDP), and the highest level recorded since the early 1960s.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that the government has borrowed a total of \u00a3108.1bn so far in the current financial year (April to September), although this is \u00a3101.2bn less than in the same period last year.\nAs well as higher spending on Covid measures, the government has collected less in tax receipts during the pandemic, having given some badly-affected firms tax holidays from VAT, for example. \nAs a result of a lower income from taxes and higher spending, the ONS now estimates that in the 2020-21 financial year the government borrowed \u00a3319.9bn. That amounted to 14.9% of GDP, the highest rate seen since the end of World War Two.\nSome government sources of income have started to recover more recently. In September, the amount it collected through Value Added Tax (VAT) rose by 4.5% in comparison with the same month a year earlier. \nFuel duty payments were also up by 6%, although alcohol and tobacco tax takes fell by 12.7% and 7% respectively.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak is due to deliver a new Budget and growth forecasts on 27 October, as well as new multi-year spending limits for individual government departments.\nThe monthly borrowing figure for September was lower than economists had expected. However, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that while the picture had improved for the government ahead of next week's Budget, he did not expect a \"major fiscal giveaway\".\n\"Borrowing has fallen much more quickly than almost everyone expected,\" he said.\n\"That said, the rumours are that the chancellor will still keep a very tight grip on the public finances in next Wednesday's Budget to try and bring down borrowing even quicker and build a fiscal war chest to deploy ahead of the 2024 election.\"\nIn response to the latest official figures, the chancellor said that although debt levels have risen, \"our recovery is well underway - with more employees on payrolls than ever before and the fastest forecast growth in the G7 this year\".\n\"At the Budget and Spending Review next week, I will set out how we will continue to support public services, businesses and jobs while keeping our public finances fit for the future.\"\nProf David Miles, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee and professor of financial economics at Imperial College, warned that there could be \"a long struggle ahead\" for the chancellor.\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"The debt came down very rapidly after the end of the Napoleonic wars, the First World War, the Second World War. \n\"All those people who had been in the army and the other armed forces came back into employment, tax revenue went up, the government was spending less on armaments - that's not going to happen now, so I think it is considerably more difficult to bring down the stock of debt to GDP than it was in the aftermath of those earlier wars.\"\nIn recent years, the government has been able to borrow easily at very low interest rates, which makes its debt more affordable.\nBut rising inflation means that the Bank of England may increase interest rates soon, in an attempt to ensure the cost of living does not increase too quickly.\nThe Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, warned on Sunday that it \"will have to act\" over rising inflation soon.\nAlthough he did not give any indication as to when it might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%, investors are expecting rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022.\nWhat's striking in the public sector finance figures is not how big the borrowing or debt is in the financial year to date. That's the same story we've known for months: the second-highest borrowing in peacetime, second only to last year's even more extraordinary amounts. \nWhat's newer, and more eyebrow-raising, is what the figures show about how rapidly borrowing can fall, before any spending cuts or tax rises have taken effect, simply because the economy is growing. \nWith expected growth this year of 7% or more, tax money is flowing into the Exchequer far faster than was anticipated at the last Budget. And much of the emergency spending required in the more severe lockdown last year no longer has to be spent because the economy has, mostly, reopened. Public sector borrowing (the amount government has to borrow to plug the gap between its income and its spending) has nearly halved, dropping by more than \u00a3100bn.  \nNot only that: all the borrowing accumulated over the years, also known as net debt, is also falling, down two percentage points, from 97.6% of gross domestic product in August to 95.5% in September. \nBoth borrowing and debt are falling, not because of any economic hairshirt the chancellor is requiring us all to wear, but because a successful vaccination programme has helped the economy to recover.

I followed orders, and if I wanted to stay I was going to have to sign my rights away.\"\nShe alleged several people working on the production had sustained serious injuries, including herself, a personal assistant, and a crew member who sustained third-degree burns.\nRose acknowledged that she \"fought people on set\", but said this was because she \"wanted safety\".\nShe also accused her co-star Dougray Scott of yelling at women on set and \"hurting a female stunt double\".\nResponding to her claims in a statement, Scott told the BBC: \"I absolutely and completely refute the defamatory and damaging claims made against me by [Rose]; they are entirely made up and never happened.\n\"As Warner Bros Television has stated, they decided not to exercise the option to engage Ruby for season two of Batwoman based on multiple complaints about her workplace behaviour.\""

      "text": "Further Covid restrictions in the run-up to Christmas are \"unlikely\" at the moment, Wales' health minister has said.\nHowever, Eluned Morgan pleaded with the Welsh public to \"play their part\" in keeping the virus at bay.\nIt comes as the Welsh NHS records its worst performance figures ever.\nThe Covid case rate in Wales is currently 651.9 per 100,000 people - and for a month it has been higher than any other UK nation.\nAsked whether Christmas would look more normal this year, Ms Morgan told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: \"We certainly hope so.\"\n\"But in our Covid plan, there is a second scenario where we start to go back up through those levels of restrictions, and that is something we'll keep an eye on.\n\"But at the moment it's unlikely that we'll go down that path - but who knows what the winter will bring, we still don't know whether there'll be a new variant, so we just have to keep an eye on the situation. It's still something that we're living and learning about as we go along.\"\nHowever, she admitted cases were not reducing in Wales as hoped, compared to other parts of the UK such as Scotland.\n\"As the head of the NHS has said, it's going to be the toughest winter ever in the history of the NHS,\" Ms Morgan said.\n\"And I would plead with the Welsh public to take their responsibility in trying to lower that pressure in making sure that they take their level of responsibility through being Covid-safe.\n\"Making sure that they are washing their hands, that they're working from home where they can, but also that they're not using services that are inappropriate, and there are mechanisms for example to take the pressure off GPs, the pressure off the ambulance services and our accident and emergency services.\"\nLatest figures on Thursday showed Blaenau Gwent has the highest case rate in the UK - and its highest point yet during the pandemic - reaching 1,036.3 cases per 100,000.\nThere have been big rises in neighbouring local authorities too.\nThe cases in the Aneurin Bevan health board area are likely to have partly been driven by 1,000 positive lateral flow tests in the last week - the highest incidence rate in Wales of asymptomatic people being picked up through routine testing.\nThe daily average for the number of patients in hospital beds with confirmed Covid was the highest since 5 March - 506 patients - although there were three times as many on average at this point of the second wave in January.\nMs Morgan also urged people to take their Covid booster jabs and winter flu jabs, if offered.\nShe said she was \"really concerned\" about the pressure NHS and social care workers are under.\n\"They are exhausted, they're also responding to Covid within the community,\" she said.\n\"We still have very high rates within our communities, as high as they've ever been, and of course some of those nurses are catching Covid too.\n\"That means they've got to get off work and that puts more pressure on the people who are already in work.\"\nThere were more patients in NHS acute beds in Wales on Wednesday than at any time during the pandemic - 5,887.\nThe number of vacant available beds - 538 - was the lowest and the bed occupancy - nearly 92% on Wednesday - was the highest.\nThe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is in dispute with the Welsh government over plans to increase pay by 3% - and will ask members if they are prepared to take industrial action.\nMs Morgan said it was \"not possible\" for the Welsh government to pay nurses more without more money from the UK government.\n\"The RCN are more than welcome to come back to the table - we've offered them lots of additional enhancements beyond the 3%,\" she added."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "If not enough people get vaccinated, it is more likely restrictions will be reintroduced in England, the health secretary has said. \nSajid Javid said the government would not be bringing in its Plan B measures, which include mandatory face coverings and working from home, \"at this point\". \nHe added that he did not believe the current pressures on the NHS were unsustainable. \nBut he warned cases could rise to 100,000 a day. \nDaily Covid cases have been above 40,000 for eight days in a row, with 49,139 new infections reported on Wednesday. \nNHS leaders have said some restrictions must immediately be reintroduced if England is to avoid \"stumbling into a winter crisis\".\nUnder the government's plan for tackling Covid in England over the winter, restrictions will only be reintroduced if the NHS comes under \"unsustainable pressure\". \nPlan B also includes introducing mandatory Covid passports. \nMr Javid told a Downing Street news conference: \"If not enough people get their booster jabs, if not enough of those people that were eligible for the original offer... if they don't come forward, if people don't wear masks when they really should in a really crowded place with lots of people that they don't normally hang out with, if they're not washing their hands and stuff, it's going to hit us all.\n\"And it would of course make it more likely we're going to have more restrictions.\"\nHowever, No 10 earlier said there were no plans for another lockdown in England. \nAsked about the pressures on the NHS, Mr Javid said: \"Don't get me wrong, there are huge pressures, especially in A&E, in primary care. At this point we don't believe they're unsustainable.\"\n\"If we feel at any point it's becoming unsustainable\u2026 we won't hesitate to act,\" he added. \nProf Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, said he expected the number of Covid patients in hospitals to continue to rise due to the high number of infections in the community.\n\"It undoubtedly feels exceptionally busy in the NHS and our NHS organisations are telling us that all the time,\" he said. \nProf Powis said there was \"no one number\" that the government would consider to trigger new restrictions - but it would look at factors including infection rates, vaccine effectiveness, hospital admissions, as well as flu and other viruses. \nAs of Tuesday, there were 7,891 patients in hospital. Another 179 people were reported to have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus on Wednesday. \nIt is important to remember that the situation is very different to 12 months ago.\nThe vaccination programme has transformed the situation, and has completely changed the calculation for ministers about the risks of coronavirus cases spreading, versus the many downsides of restrictions.\nBut there are nerves in Westminster about what might happen next. The health secretary warned the pandemic is not over, and the government's efforts to control it can't be either.\nAnd once again, at those famous three lecterns in Downing Street, ministers are asking all of us to think again about how we act.\nThe ultimate fear from the government's critics is that, in an echo of last autumn, their actions to control the disease could come too late.\nRead more from Laura.\nMr Javid also announced that people eligible for a Covid booster jab can book online if they have not received an invite from the NHS. \nBooster doses can be offered to people who are at least six months on from receiving their second dose. \nThe health secretary said boosters could be booked online if people had not been invited within a week of reaching the six month milestone.\nSeparately, around 14% of people in the UK aged 12 and over remain unvaccinated. \nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth accused Mr Javid of complacency, telling the BBC: \"The simple truth is that the so-called wall of defence we've built up with vaccination is now crumbling.\"\nHe said it was disappointing the health secretary did not give details on \"how he is going to grip this and drive up the vaccinations we need\". \nMeanwhile, the government has agreed deals for two new Covid treatments. \nThe Antivirals Taskforce has secured 480,000 courses of molnupiravir, which trials found cuts the risk of hospital admission or death by about half, as well as 250,000 courses of PF-07321332/ritonavir, which is currently undergoing clinical trials. \nIf approved by the UK's medicines regulator, the Department of Health said thousands of patients would be able to access the treatments this winter."
