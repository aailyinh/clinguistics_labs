      "text": "A massive increase in appeals for help over the past year from those suffering domestic abuse has exposed the scale of the problem, say campaigners. \nRefuge recorded an average of 13,162 calls and messages to its National Domestic Abuse helpline every month between April 2020 and February 2021.\nThat is up more than 60% on the average number of monthly contacts at the start of 2020, it says.\nOne campaigner described it as an epidemic beneath a pandemic.\nBetween January and March 2020, before the first lockdowns in the UK, the charity recorded an average of 8,176 calls and messages per month.\nBetween April 2020 and February 2021, it logged a total of more than 131,000 such contacts.\nRefuge said 72% of these were from women who said they were experiencing violence and abuse, and nearly a fifth said their abuser had threatened to kill them.\nIt said many calls were from women who were being terrorised in their own homes, and who were afraid to seek treatment for their injuries in case they overburdened hospital staff.\nSome were making plans to flee their homes, while others had no home to go to.\nLisa King, the charity's director of communications and external relations, said \"home is not a safe place\" for women and children experiencing domestic abuse.\n\"Lockdown measures, where women have been isolated and confined with their perpetrators, have compounded their exposure to violence and abuse,\" she added.\nRefuge said the largest number of calls and contacts had come from women in their 30s.\nMany 16- to 25-year-olds, as well as concerned family, friends and neighbours, reached out via the helpline's Live Chat facility - which enables people to communicate with helpline advisors online and, crucially, in silence.\nIn 2020, Refuge made nearly 4,500 referrals to refuges across the country, enabling women to flee abusive partners.\nIn January, when the prime minister announced the latest lockdown, he said that escaping domestic abuse was one of the reasons why people would be allowed to leave home.\nWhen the first lockdown was lifted last year, there was an increase in women seeking emergency accommodation. Refuge is preparing for a repeat when the current lockdown ends.\nBut it also warns that leaving an abuser can be an extremely dangerous time.\nRespect, a charity that runs an advice line for male victims of domestic abuse, says it saw a 70% increase in calls, emails and webchats in 2020 compared to 2019. And during the current lockdown, appeals for help have continued to rise.\nThe most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics show that in the period from March to June 2020 there was a 7% rise in domestic abuse offences recorded by the police in England and Wales.\nThe latest police figures show that in the four weeks to the middle of January, covering the first two weeks of the latest lockdown, there was a 4% fall in recorded incidents of domestic abuse. \nBut the National Police Chiefs' Council said not all such incidents would result in a crime being recorded and hidden abuse was not captured in this data. \nCharities have always stressed that many victims do not report to the police.\nThe Home Office said the government had given more than \u00a327m to domestic abuse organisations to help them deal with the effects of the pandemic.\nA spokesperson added: \"Our landmark Domestic Abuse Bill will bolster the response to domestic abuse on every level, strengthening protections for victims whilst also ensuring perpetrators feel the full force of the law.\"\nOnline webchats and text services are also available."

      "tags": "Scottish government",
      "text": "NHS Lothian says Edinburgh's new Sick Kids hospital is one of the \"best-designed healthcare facilities in the world\" but its full opening is the end point of a saga stretching back years.\nIt was more than 160 years ago when Edinburgh surgeon John Smith began a campaign to create Scotland's first dedicated children's hospital.\nHis public fundraiser, kickstarted by an emotional and eloquent letter to The Scotsman newspaper, resulted in a specialist medical centre being opened in 1860 - just a year on from that letter being penned.\nThe hospital initially struggled to keep up with demand in a city where the average death rate of children under the age of five was one in 13.\nSeveral moves followed before it settled in an imposing red sandstone building next to The Meadows park, in what was to be its home for the next 126 years. \nReceiving more than 50,000 patients through its doors every year, most people in Edinburgh have, or will know someone with, a Sick Kids story. \nIt is why the closure of the old site and the move to the new facility was a big deal. \nThe move has the feel of a football team locating to a new out-of-town stadium.  The cherished but tired setting in the city centre swapped for a spacious and state-of-the-art facility on the outskirts. \nStepping alone into the airy and colourful atrium of the new hospital is a world away from the cramped and chaotic feel of the old building. \nBut to get to this stage has been a long time coming. \nEdinburgh is no stranger to construction sagas involving public money, so it is perhaps not surprising the backstory to the Sick Kids is complicated. \nThe original business case for a new children's hospital next to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (ERI) in the Little France area of the city was approved in 2008. \nPossibly cognisant of the troublesome \u00a31bn Public Finance Initiative (PFI) deal to build the neighbouring ERI, NHS Lothian wanted to pay for the new facility straight from public purse. \nMore than \u00a31m was spent on developing this plan until 2010 when, amidst a wider squeeze on public spending, it was announced the new hospital would now be funded under the Non-Profit Distributing (NPD) system, the Scottish government's version of PFI.\nA deal signed in 2015 then saw private consortium IHSL appointed to design, build, finance and maintain the hospital. \nThe facility was to cost about \u00a3150m to build, but its full price tag over the following 25 years, including maintenance and facilities management fees, would come to \u00a3432m.\nThe old Sick Kids was sold for housing to a private developer and after a few bumps along the road - not least a fallout between NHS Lothian and IHSL that nearly went to court - the removal vans were booked for July, 2019. \nAs NHS staff were making the final arrangements for the move to Little France, 50 miles along the M8 in Glasgow a band of senior health board officials, civil servants and IHSL managers were locked in a day long crisis meeting. \nLast minute inspections had found safety concerns over the hospital's ventilation systems and the meeting saw Health Secretary Jeane Freeman presented with a number of options before she decided to postpone the opening to get the problems fixed. \nThe issue for the health secretary - and the public purse - was that under the terms of the NPD contract, repayments - which average about \u00a31.4m a month - had already started because NHS Lothian had taken possession of the site from IHSL because it had been signed off as ready by independent assessors.\nA political row followed and a series of independent reviews pointed to a \"collective failure from the parties involved\" to not spot that parts of the hospital failed to comply with ventilation guidelines designed to control infections.\nAn NHS Lothian-commissioned review found a \"human error\" in a 2012 spreadsheet with the specifications for air flow in critical care rooms had set in motion a series of events that delayed the opening. \nThe hospital opened to outpatients in July 2019 and the repairs to the ventilation system were made. \nMs Freeman has previously said the cost of this remedial work and delays in opening the hospital campus is estimated to be \u00a328m, but the final bill is likely to be bigger, including higher NPD repayments.   \nThe issues surrounding the delayed opening of the Sick Kids are now being examined by a public inquiry. \nBy the time of the inquiry's first hearing on 22 June, the new hospital should have bedded in and the benefit of the leap in quality of facilities should have been apparent to the \"little creatures\" and families written about in Dr Smith's Scotsman newspaper letter.\nHighlighting the horror he had seen in 1850s Scotland, the surgeon said: \"The whisperings of distress lisped out by those unfortunate little creatures too feeble to attract attention.\""

      "text": "Cineworld has announced it will reopen US cinemas next month, followed by the UK in May, after signing a deal with Warner Bros to show films in theatres before they are streamed.\nThe company will open a handful of its Regal cinemas in the US in early April.\nGodzilla vs. Kong will be the first film to make its debut in the theatres.\nCineworld said the deal with Warner Bros means films will have a period of exclusivity in cinemas before being made more widely available.\nIt follows a row last year when Cineworld and rival AMC, which owns the Odeon Cinemas chain, criticised Universal Pictures for releasing Trolls: World Tour online while theatres were forced to close because of the coronavirus.\nBoth Cineworld and AMC threatened not to show some Universal Pictures films. \nHowever, AMC later reached an agreement with Universal where films would first show in theatres for a period before becoming available to rent online.\nUnder its deal with Warner Bros., from next year Cineworld can exclusively show its films for 45 days. In the UK, the period will be 31 days though that can be extended to 45 days for movies \"that open to an agreed upon  box-office threshold\".\n\"This agreement shows the studio's commitment to the theatrical business and we see this agreement as an important milestone in our 100-year relationship with Warner Bros,\" said Cineworld chief executive Mooky Greidinger.\nGodzilla vs. Kong, starring English actress Millie Bobby Brown, will start showing on 2 April in the US in a phased reopening of Cineworld's Regal theatres. It will be followed by Mortal Kombat, the movie based on the hugely popular computer game, on 16 April.\nThe company said it also plans to reopen in the UK - which is its second biggest market - in May, \"in line with current government guidance\".\nThe cinema industry has been one of the worst hit sectors during the pandemic with many theatres closed for extended periods or operating at reduced capacity.\nGlobal box office takings in 2020 fell by more than 70% from the previous year to $12.4bn, according film technology firm Gower Street Analytics.\nMajor releases such as the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, have been delayed a number of times because of Covid. \nThe much-anticipated sci-fi movie Dune, starring Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, was originally slated to be released in December 2020, but is now set to premiere in October 2021."

      "tags": "Bristol City Council,Avon and Somerset Constabulary,Bristol",
      "text": "Police are scouring an \"enormous amount\" of footage and have vowed to make more arrests after violence at a Kill the Bill protest in Bristol.\nProtesters clashed with officers as thousands turned out for the march on Sunday.\nEight people have already been arrested after 21 officers were injured.\nAvon and Somerset Police said the investigation could result in the largest number of images for wanted suspects in the force's history.\nEarlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel accused some protesters of \"thuggery\" and Bristol's mayor said those involved in the violence were \"selfish\".\nOne of the injured officers suffered a punctured lung, with the chairman of the local Police Federation saying the actions of some were \"close to attempted murder\".\nOf the eight people arrested so far, six were detained for violent disorder and two for possession of an offensive weapon.\nDet Ch Supt Carolyn Belafonte said CCTV footage, body-worn camera videos and social media coverage were being studied along with photographs.\nA dedicated page has also been set up on the Avon and Somerset Police website for people to send footage and pictures in.\n\"From what we've already obtained, we're confident more arrests are imminent,\" said Det Ch Supt Belafonte.\nShe said forensic evidence, including fingerprints, had been recovered from the scene.\n\"To those who took part in this spree of offending, you can expect a knock at your door in the days or weeks to come - it may come sooner than you think,\" she added\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said people had a right to protest but the violent scenes were \"unacceptable\".\nHe added: \"They should protest peacefully and legally.\"\nSpeaking in the House of Commons earlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel condemned the protests as \"anarchic\" and \"violent\".\nShe said the minority of people who confronted police officers in the city centre on Sunday night had demonstrated \"criminal thuggery and disorder\" that put lives at risk.\n\"Our exceptional and brave police officers put themselves in harm's way to protect the public. \n\"For them to face the criminal violence against them while upholding the law is completely unacceptable,\" she added.\n\"My thoughts are with the injured officers and their family.\"\nBristol Mayor Marvin Rees slammed offenders as \"selfish\" for \"living out their revolutionary fantasies\".\nAvon and Somerset Police Chief Constable Andy Marsh said the protest had been \"hijacked by extremists\", by \"people who were determined to commit criminal damage\".\nMr Marsh said: \"There was a hardcore of serious criminals hidden within those 3,000 people - perhaps 400 or 500 people - and we certainly didn't trigger this.\"\nCrowds had gathered to peacefully protest in opposition to the new Police and Crime Bill but it went in a \"violent direction\" outside Bridewell Police Station at about 17:30 GMT, Mr Marsh said.\nAs angry scenes unfolded, demonstrators scaled the station, threw fireworks into the crowd and daubed graffiti on the walls.\nMr Marsh said that while it would not have been \"practical or possible\" to arrest more people on the night, those involved in the violence can expect \"very serious consequences\".\n\"We will be asking for the people of Bristol to identify these thuggish citizens so we can bring them to justice,\" he added.\nBy 17:30 there were approximately 300 police officers at the scene. \nTwo officers were injured and treated in hospital, with one suffering a punctured lung and broken ribs, and the other a fractured arm. Both have since been discharged.\nTwelve police vehicles were also damaged, with two set on fire. It is understood the police operation cost around \u00a31m.\nAndy Roebuck, chairman of Avon and Somerset Police Federation said: \"We had them actually squirting liquid on our visors. \n\"They've turned up with weapons and then tried to set fire to a police vehicle with police officers actually inside it. \n\"That is close to attempted murder of those police officers as far as we are concerned in the Police Federation. \n\"That is the level of violence and determination that these animals have gone to. And this is something we can not tolerate.\"\nAt times there were as few as 50 police officers, facing 100 or more violent protesters.\nHorses and dogs were used to great effect, but their numbers have been cut in the last decade. \nThis means that arguably, the police were outnumbered.  To arrest one protester during the pandemic, it currently takes an average of three officers and one vehicle, since suspects have to be kept socially distanced.  \nHowever, public order commanders know that sending in snatch squads to make arrests also leads to a more violent response.  \nSo, instead of clearing the streets, and making arrests, a decision was taken for police to hold their ground, and gather evidence for later investigations.  \nThe result has given a dangerous impression.  A feeling of a loss of control which was also a feature of the early stages of the 2011 riots in England.  \nWorkers from Bristol Waste spent the morning removing broken glass, debris and offensive graffiti from the streets. \nBristol Mayor Marvin Rees said the violence had made people already dealing with inequality in the city less safe and questioned whether the perpetrators were from Bristol or were \"protest tourists\".\nHe said: \"Smashing buildings in our city centre, vandalising vehicles, attacking our police will do nothing to lessen the likelihood of the bill going through. \n\"On the contrary, the lawlessness on show will be used as evidence and promote the need for the bill.\n\"This is a shameful day in an incredible year for Bristol. These people should feel shame.\"\nSue Mountstevens, Avon and Somerset's police and crime commissioner, said the behaviour was \"completely unacceptable\".\nShe said: \"It's disgraceful these men and women who started their days expecting a normal day of policing have all returned battered and bruised.\n\"These people have shown reckless disregard of the lives and safety of our communities in central Bristol and our officers.\n\"Whether you agree or disagree with the bill, these men and women did not deserve to face the level of violence directed at them. Nothing can justify such actions.\"\nUniversity student Rhianna Prewitt, who attended the demonstration, said: \"This is a symptom of not allowing organisers to actually properly organise protests and, by doing that, extremists and people who are looking for a riot are going to take advantage to cause chaos.\n\"Also, if the government doesn't want us to protest during the pandemic, why are they pushing through a significant law at this time without public scrutiny?\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the disorder was \"inexcusable\" and those involved should be identified and \"prosecuted where appropriate.\" \nHe condemned the \"lawlessness\" by people who were \"intent on violence,\" adding parallels could not be drawn between the protests in London against harassment and violence against women and the scenes in Bristol.

      "tags": "Colorado,US gun violence,United States",
      "text": "A gunman has killed 10 people, including a police officer, following an hours-long stand-off at a grocery store in the US state of Colorado.\nThe attack in Boulder ended with police detaining an injured suspect at the King Soopers market. \nThe shooting was live-streamed by witnesses and broadcast on YouTube.\nAmong the dead was 51-year-old Eric Talley, who was the first police officer to respond to the shooting.\n\"This is a tragedy and a nightmare for Boulder County,\" the area's district attorney, Michael Dougherty, said. \n\"These were people going about their day, doing their shopping. I promise the victims and the people of the state of Colorado that we will secure justice.\"\nNo other details have been released about the nine other victims or a motive for the attack.\nThe grocery store is located in a busy shopping plaza in Boulder, a north-central Colorado city about 30 miles (50km) away from the state capital of Denver.\nThe supermarket attack comes less than a week after a mass shooting that left eight dead, including six Asian women, at three spas in Atlanta.\nThe incident began at about 14:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Monday when the suspect entered the supermarket and began firing.\nShoppers and employees of the store said they had to dive for cover or run to safety as the shooting unfolded.\nSome of the stand-off was captured on camera by a passer-by, showing victims near the grocery store. \n\"I don't know what's going on... I heard gunshots, someone's down,\" the cameraman shouts. \"There's an active shooter, get away\". \nGunshots can be heard as he runs away from the shop.\nThe video continues, with police arriving on the scene and surrounding the market.\nThe Boulder police department later warned people to avoid the area and told them not to \"broadcast on social media any tactical information you might see\".\n\"We were at the checkout, and shots just started going off,\" said Sarah Moonshadow, a customer caught up in the shooting with her son Nicholas.\nShe told Reuters she had tried to help one of the victims lying on the pavement outside the store, but her son pulled her away saying \"we have to go\".\n\"I couldn't help anybody,\" she said.\nRyan Borowski, who was also inside the store, told CNN he could not believe what had happened in his town: \"This feels like the safest spot in America, and I just nearly got killed for getting a soda and a bag of chips.\"\nEyewitnesses said the suspect was armed with a rifle. A police source told CNN it was an AR-15 style rifle, a semi-automatic gun that has been used in several mass shootings across the US.\nAerial footage later showed a handcuffed, shirtless man with an apparent injury to his leg being put onto a stretcher for treatment. Authorities did not say whether he was the suspect or not.\nSpeaking at a press conference, Boulder police chief Maris Herold confirmed that a suspect was in custody and was receiving hospital treatment. \"I want to reassure the community that they are safe,\" she said. \nMs Herold named the officer killed as Eric Talley, a father of seven who had been with the Boulder Police Department since 2010.\n\"The heroic action of this officer when he responded to the scene... phone calls of shots fired in the area and a phone call about a possible person with a patrol rifle,\" she said.\nMs Herold did not provide further details about the shooting, but said that the investigation was \"very complex\" and would take \"no less than five days to complete\". \nThe names of the other victims will not be released until relatives have been informed. \n\"Today we saw the face of evil. I am grieving with my community and all Coloradans,\" tweeted Colorado Governor Jared Polis.\nThe supermarket shooting was the seventh mass killing so far this year following a lull in mass killings during the pandemic last year, according to a database compiled by the Associated Press (AP), USA Today and Northeastern University. The database defines mass killings as four or more dead.\nIt has already led to renewed calls for tighter gun controls in the US, a starkly divisive issue that has seen little in the way of change over the years despite hundreds of mass shootings.\nFormer Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, a gun control advocate who was seriously injured in a mass shooting in 2011, said: \"It's been 10 years and countless communities have faced something similar... this is not normal.\"\nResponding to the news, US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on Twitter: \"This Senate must and will move forward on legislation to help stop the epidemic of gun violence.\"\nPresident Joe Biden, who has been briefed about the latest attack, said last month he would be recommending tougher legislation to ensure background checks on anyone wishing to purchase a firearm. \nFreshman Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, a staunch defender of gun rights, tweeted that she was \"praying for the police, first responders, and those affected by this tragedy\".\nThe right to bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment to the US constitution and is staunchly defended by many conservatives, including ex-president Donald Trump.\nThe state of Colorado has seen a number of mass shootings over the last few decades, including the 1999 Columbine High School attack that left 12 students and a teacher dead and the 2012 attack at a cinema in Aurora that killed 12 people."

      "tags": "Unemployment,Youth unemployment,UK economy,Young people,Office for National Statistics,Unemployment in the UK,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of workers on company payrolls in the UK climbed by almost 200,000 in the three months to February, amid signs that the jobs market may be stabilising. \nHowever, the number on payrolls is still 693,000 lower than last February, before Covid lockdown measures began.\nIt comes amid growing optimism that the vaccine rollout will lead to a faster-than-expected economic recovery.\nThe official unemployment rate now stands at 5%, down from 5.1% before. \nSam Beckett, head of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics, told the BBC's Today programme there was still a lot of uncertainty in the jobs market. \nShe added that people aged under 25 continued to bear the brunt of the job losses.\n\"Furlough is still doing a lot of heavy lifting in the labour market. There are around five million people still on furlough, it's down from its peak of nine million but has been rising recently. \n\"But you have to remember the underlying picture is that close to 700,000 people have come off the payroll since the start of the pandemic so there has been a large fall in employment since the start\n\"Around two-thirds of the fall is under-25s. London has been particularly hard hit.\"\nThe latest figures cover a period when most parts of the UK entered strict lockdowns. \nHowever, the number of workers on payroll increased for the third month in a row in February, the ONS said. \nThe number of redundancies across the UK also fell slightly to 11 per 1,000 people in January - down from 14 per 1,000 two months previously. \nDespite this, the ONS said the jobs crisis remained acute, with 1.7 million people out of work - around a five-year high.\nIt said the hospitality and retail industries had been hit particularly hard, with a total of 491,000 payroll jobs lost across both sectors since the pandemic began.\nNonetheless, commentators said they believed the worst may soon be over as the vaccine programme gradually allows the UK economy to reopen.\n\"Overall, we think employment is getting close to its trough,\" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. \"We still expect the unemployment rate to rise to 6% by early 2022, but the bulk of that will be driven by those who left the labour force returning, rather than people losing their jobs.\"\nIt echoes projections from the government's fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which has forecast that the unemployment rate will peak at 6.5% this year instead of the 11.9% predicted last July. \nUnemployment stayed generally stable in January despite further national lockdowns. On some weekly or monthly measures, joblessness actually fell a little to just below 5%, despite the compulsory closure of large swathes of the hospitality industry at the beginning of the year.\nThis is thanks to two factors - the fact that five million people are on the furlough scheme and the fact that employers have become better adapted to lockdowns. \nThe ONS also tried to assess just how many foreign workers left the UK last year. While some estimates had put the fall at over one million, the ONS suggested the fall was around 180,000, or the same as the population of the city of Portsmouth. \nThat is entirely the result of EU workers leaving the UK. The number of non-EU workers actually increased a little during the pandemic.\nBecky O'Connor, head of pensions and savings at Interactive Investor, said the latest data showed \"chinks of light\" but that the impact of the crisis would be felt for some time to come. \n\"Even as work opportunities return, people who have lost their jobs or part of their income will need continued support as the economy opens back up.\n\"If the doors to work reopen for those people, their decimated personal finances from a year of lost income will take far longer to get back off the ground.\"\nAccording to official figures, the UK economy shrank by 2.9% in January amid the third lockdown, but the drop was much smaller than expected, suggesting businesses have adapted to trading in lockdown.\nIt has added to growing expectations that the recovery will be stronger than previously expected, although last week the Bank of England cautioned that the outlook remained \"unusually uncertain\"."

      "text": "Germany has extended its lockdown for three weeks, imposing an almost complete halt over the Easter holiday in response to a third wave of coronavirus infections.\nAfter talks with regional leaders, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany was now in a \"very serious\" situation.\nRestrictions will be even tougher from 1-5 April, when most shops will be shut and gatherings will be limited.\nMeanwhile, France's president wants vaccinations \"morning, noon and night\".\nEmmanuel Macron was responding to an increase in intensive care cases and warnings of an \"explosion\" in hospital admissions.\nIn contrast, the UK has managed to reduce its infection rate, attributing that to its tough lockdown and large-scale vaccinations. \nSpain says it will allow British travellers back in from 30 March, easing a restriction in place since 22 December. That restriction only allowed in Spanish nationals and residents arriving from the UK. But the UK currently bans foreign holidays, so there will be no rapid revival of Spanish tourism.\n\"Essentially, we have a new virus,\" Chancellor Merkel said after marathon talks with the leaders of Germany's 16 states. The highly contagious UK (Kent) variant of coronavirus had become dominant in Germany, she explained, plunging the country into \"a new pandemic\".\nIt is much deadlier, much more infectious and infectious for much longer. Germany was in a race against time to vaccinate against the coronavirus, she added. \nTuesday's lockdown extension to 18 April marks a reversal from earlier this month, when state leaders agreed to begin a cautious reopening process.\nFor five days over Easter from 1 April, Germans are being asked to stay at home and reduce contacts:\nThe heads of Germany's Catholic and Protestant Churches expressed dismay over the ban on Easter church congregations. They argued that their existing social-distancing measures made church attendance safe, German ARD news reported. \nThe infection rate has risen above 100 per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany. A further 7,485 infections have been reported in the past 24 hours, as well as 250 deaths. An \"emergency brake\" will halt further re-openings in areas where infections exceed 100 new cases per 100,000 people over a seven-day period.\nCoronavirus infections have been surging in some parts of Europe in recent weeks as countries scramble to vaccinate their populations despite delays in rolling out jabs. \nDutch lockdown measures are also to remain in place until 20 April because of a \"worrying and uncertain\" Covid situation. But a curfew in place since January will start an hour later, at 22:00, from Wednesday 31 March.\nFrance's vaccination drive has been relatively slow to get off the ground, partly due to delayed supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and confusion surrounding the safety of the inoculation. \nHowever, the head of the French hospital federation, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Valletoux, warned on Tuesday that the number of new cases was \"exploding\" and hospitals were likely to be hit in the next two to three weeks by a \"wave of unprecedented violence\". \nFrench hospitals admitted another 471 patients into intensive care in 24 hours, and another 15,792 cases were reported on Monday evening.\nPresident Macron, on a visit to the northern town of Valenciennes, said that from Saturday the vaccination campaign would be extended to people aged 70-75. \"We're fighting to get hold of doses... there are no weekends or public holidays for vaccinations,\" he insisted.\nSo far the campaign has focused on over-75s and the most vulnerable aged 50-74. From late April, teachers and other key workers in exposed positions would also be given the jab, he promised. France aims to have 10 million people vaccinated by mid-April and 30 million by mid-June.\nWhile cases in other European countries are rising, Denmark has announced a timetable for further reopening. \"We will proceed with caution. We can open up more now in Denmark, in contrast to several other countries, where the third wave of corona is a reality,\" said Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.\nAmong measures agreed late on Monday by Danish leaders is a proposed \"corona pass\", which would say whether the holder has been vaccinated, previously infected or has had a negative test in the past 72 hours. Children under 15 would be exempt.\nThe aim of the passport, which will be available on mobile phones as well as on paper, will be to enable people who fulfil the requirements to go to the hairdresser, a restaurant or eventually a cinema.\nThe current plan is to reopen small shopping centres from 13 April and larger ones from 21 April, along with outdoor eating at cafes and restaurants. Cinemas and indoor dining would resume on 6 May. \nThe rollout of vaccinations across the EU is far behind the scale of vaccinations achieved by Israel, the UK and US. \nThe EU regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), has so far approved four vaccines - from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and Oxford-AstraZeneca.  \nThe AstraZeneca vaccine is now at the centre of political tensions between the UK and EU over the firm's contractual obligations. \nThe EU is now considering an export ban targeting AstraZeneca production in Europe. EU officials complain that too much of the vaccine is going to the UK and other countries, rather than staying in the EU."

      "tags": "Xinjiang,Human rights,China,Uighurs,European Union",
      "text": "Several Western countries have imposed sanctions on officials in China over rights abuses against the mostly Muslim Uighur minority group.\nChina has detained Uighurs at camps in the north-west region of Xinjiang, where allegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged.\nThe sanctions were introduced as a coordinated effort by the European Union, UK, US and Canada.\nChina responded with its own sanctions on European officials. \nIt has denied the allegations of abuse, claiming the camps are \"re-education\" facilities used to combat terrorism. \nBut UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the treatment of Uighurs amounted to \"appalling violations of the most basic human rights\". \nThe EU has not imposed new sanctions on China over human rights abuses since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, when troops in Beijing opened fire on pro-democracy protesters. \nThe sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, target senior officials in Xinjiang who have been accused of serious human rights violations against Uighur Muslims. \nThose targeted have been named as:\nMr Raab called the abuse of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang \"one of the worst human rights crises of our time\". \n\"I think it's clear that by acting with our partners - 30 of us in total - we are sending the clearest message to the Chinese government, that the international community will not turn a blind eye to such serious and systematic violations of basic human rights and that we will act in concert to hold those responsible to account,\" he told fellow parliamentarians.\nIn a statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China was committing \"genocide and crimes against humanity\". The US said it sanctioned Wang Junzheng and Chen Mingguo for their connection to \"arbitrary detention and severe physical abuse, among other serious human rights abuses\". \nCanada's foreign ministry said: \"Mounting evidence points to systemic, state-led human rights violations by Chinese authorities.\"\nThe sanctions came amid increasing international scrutiny over China's treatment of Uighurs.  \nMore than a million Uighurs and other minorities are estimated to have been detained in camps in Xinjiang.\nXinjiang lies in the north-west of China and is the country's biggest region. Like Tibet, it is autonomous, meaning - in theory - it has some powers of self-governance.  But in practice, both face major restrictions by the central government.\nUighurs living in the region speak their own language, similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. \nThe Chinese government has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on Uighur women and separating children from their families. \nA BBC investigation published in February contained first-hand testimony of systematic rape, sexual abuse and torture of detainees.\nOne woman testified that women were removed from their cells \"every night\" and raped by one or more masked Chinese men.  A former guard at one of the camps, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described torture and food deprivation of inmates.\nChina has banned BBC World News television over coverage of the Uighur issue and coronavirus. \nThe country initially denied the existence of the camps, before defending them as a necessary measure against terrorism. It has denied allegations of human rights abuses. \nChina on Monday said the sanctions - initially announced by the EU - were \"based on nothing but lies and disinformation\". \nIt said it would sanction 10 people and four entities in Europe \"that severely harm China's sovereignty and interests and maliciously spread lies and disinformation\" in response.  Those affected by China's sanctions are barred from entering the country or doing business with it.  \nGerman politician Reinhard Butikofer, who chairs the European Parliament's delegation to China, was among the most high profile officials on China's list. Adrian Zenz, a leading expert on China's policies in Xinjiang, and Swedish scholar Bjorn Jerden were also targeted. \nMr Zenz has reported extensively on alleged abuses in Xinjiang. His report last year on the forced sterilisation of Uighurs prompted international calls for the United Nations to investigate. State media has called him an \"infamous anti-China\" figure, and accused him of spreading lies. \nDutch lawmaker Sjoerd Sjoerdsma, who was put on China's sanctions list, said the retaliatory measures \"prove that China is sensitive to pressure.\" \n\"Let this be an encouragement to all my European colleagues: Speak out,\" he wrote on Twitter.

      "text": "Fourteen Humboldt penguins have had to make an international trek across four countries to a new home after Covid restrictions interfered with a move.\nThe birds' trip from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland, which should have been a short trip across the Irish Sea, was hit by local travel restrictions.\nAs a result, the only route from Curraghs Wildlife Park to Exploris Aquarium was via England and Scotland.\nThe park's manager said it was a \"miracle\" the move had gone to plan. \nKathleen Graham added that arranging the logistics had felt \"like spinning 20 plates in the air\". \n\"It was a great team effort,\" she added. \nThe move was part of a European breeding programme for endangered animals.  \nThe Ballaugh park has successfully reared 15 penguins in the last three years, recording 10 births in 2020 alone, and with plans to continue breeding, the decision was taken in June to relocate the site's youngest birds.  \nHowever, the plan to move them to Northern Ireland was hit by Covid-19 regulations and Brexit-related paperwork.\nThere is currently no direct route from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland, which meant the penguins had to be loaded into a temperature-controlled van and taken by ferry to England, before being driven to Scotland for another sailing across to Belfast.\nThey arrived at the aquarium in Portaferry on Friday, 17 hours after setting off. \nThe site's managing director Kieran Quinn said the birds were \"settling in and feeding well\" and had already created a \"buzz around the town\".\nHumboldt penguins, which are native to South America, are classed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

      "tags": "Unemployment,Youth unemployment,UK economy,Young people,Office for National Statistics,Unemployment in the UK,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of workers on company payrolls in the UK climbed by almost 200,000 in the three months to February, amid signs that the jobs market may be stabilising. \nHowever, the number on payrolls is still 693,000 lower than last February, before Covid lockdown measures began.\nIt comes amid growing optimism that the vaccine rollout will lead to a faster-than-expected economic recovery.\nThe official unemployment rate now stands at 5%, down from 5.1% before. \nSam Beckett, head of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics, told the BBC's Today programme there was still a lot of uncertainty in the jobs market. \nShe added that people aged under 25 continued to bear the brunt of the job losses.\n\"Furlough is still doing a lot of heavy lifting in the labour market. There are around five million people still on furlough, it's down from its peak of nine million but has been rising recently. \n\"But you have to remember the underlying picture is that close to 700,000 people have come off the payroll since the start of the pandemic so there has been a large fall in employment since the start\n\"Around two-thirds of the fall is under-25s. London has been particularly hard hit.\"\nThe latest figures cover a period when most parts of the UK entered strict lockdowns. \nHowever, the number of workers on payroll increased for the third month in a row in February, the ONS said. \nThe number of redundancies across the UK also fell slightly to 11 per 1,000 people in January - down from 14 per 1,000 two months previously. \nDespite this, the ONS said the jobs crisis remained acute, with 1.7 million people out of work - around a five-year high.\nIt said the hospitality and retail industries had been hit particularly hard, with a total of 491,000 payroll jobs lost across both sectors since the pandemic began.\nNonetheless, commentators said they believed the worst may soon be over as the vaccine programme gradually allows the UK economy to reopen.\n\"Overall, we think employment is getting close to its trough,\" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. \"We still expect the unemployment rate to rise to 6% by early 2022, but the bulk of that will be driven by those who left the labour force returning, rather than people losing their jobs.\"\nIt echoes projections from the government's fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which has forecast that the unemployment rate will peak at 6.5% this year instead of the 11.9% predicted last July. \nUnemployment stayed generally stable in January despite further national lockdowns. On some weekly or monthly measures, joblessness actually fell a little to just below 5%, despite the compulsory closure of large swathes of the hospitality industry at the beginning of the year.\nThis is thanks to two factors - the fact that five million people are on the furlough scheme and the fact that employers have become better adapted to lockdowns. \nThe ONS also tried to assess just how many foreign workers left the UK last year. While some estimates had put the fall at over one million, the ONS suggested the fall was around 180,000, or the same as the population of the city of Portsmouth. \nThat is entirely the result of EU workers leaving the UK. The number of non-EU workers actually increased a little during the pandemic.\nBecky O'Connor, head of pensions and savings at Interactive Investor, said the latest data showed \"chinks of light\" but that the impact of the crisis would be felt for some time to come. \n\"Even as work opportunities return, people who have lost their jobs or part of their income will need continued support as the economy opens back up.\n\"If the doors to work reopen for those people, their decimated personal finances from a year of lost income will take far longer to get back off the ground.\"\nAccording to official figures, the UK economy shrank by 2.9% in January amid the third lockdown, but the drop was much smaller than expected, suggesting businesses have adapted to trading in lockdown.\nIt has added to growing expectations that the recovery will be stronger than previously expected, although last week the Bank of England cautioned that the outlook remained \"unusually uncertain\"."

Despite concerns about coronavirus, health officials from the CDC have said these facilities can open at 100% capacity."

      "text": "A \u00a35,000 fine for anyone in England trying to travel abroad without good reason is due to come into force next week as part of new coronavirus laws.\nThe penalty is included in legislation that will be voted on by MPs on Thursday. \nForeign holidays are currently not allowed under the \"stay at home\" rule which ends on Monday.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said it was \"too early\" to set out new foreign travel rules for the summer.\nMr Johnson told a Downing Street news conference he hoped for more information by 5 April.\nHe said: \"A lot of people do want to know about what's going to happen on the holiday front and I know there's a great deal of curiosity and interest.\"\nFrom next week the ban on leaving the UK will become a specific law, backed up by the threat of a fine.\nUnder the current plan for easing restrictions, the earliest date people in England could go abroad for a holiday would be 17 May.\nIt comes as another surge in Covid cases in continental Europe, as well as the slow rollout of vaccines across Europe, casts doubt on the resumption of holidays abroad.\nThe PM's announcement on travelling abroad from England will be made sooner than expected - a taskforce looking into the issue had been scheduled to report back by 12 April. \nBut it is understood the timings in the roadmap for easing lockdown - including the 17 May date - will remain unchanged.\nGovernment adviser Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's World at One border measures should be relaxed more slowly than domestic restrictions.\nHe said: \"I think conservatively, and being risk averse at the moment, I think we should be planning on summer holidays in the UK not overseas.\"\nProf Ferguson also criticised the exemptions that currently permit foreign travel and suggested everybody should be subject to mandatory testing when arriving into the UK.\nLegally-permitted reasons for foreign travel currently include work, volunteering, education, medical needs, and to attend weddings or funerals. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said restrictions on travelling abroad for leisure were necessary to guard against the importation of large numbers of cases and new variants which might put the vaccine rollout at risk. \nShadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said Labour supported measures to keep the UK's borders secure and avoid the importation of new variants but criticised the government's \"slowness to react\".\nAirlines UK, which represents big carriers, called for a \"tiered system, based on risk\" and confirmed airlines were working with government to restart international travel safely from 17 May.\nHarriet, 31, and her fianc\u00e9 Chris, 30, had planned a wedding abroad in Ibiza last September. As the pandemic took hold, they decided to play safe and reschedule for 17 June 2021.\nBut the announcement of new travel regulations has thrown their revised plans into doubt.\n\"We have 100 guests due to fly out to Ibiza for our wedding in June and once again, people will have to spend even more money on moving it,\" she tells BBC News.\n\"The lack of clarity from the government and mixed messages that were released over the weekend are abysmal.\"\nHarriet points out that she went to Greece on holiday last summer without restrictions - and with more mass testing available now \"how can we possibly be in a worse-off situation than we were last year?\"\nOne government minister, Lord Bethell, said England might put \"all our European neighbours\" on the \"red list\" of countries. \nHowever, Mr Hancock denied there were plans to do this. \nPeople from those countries are currently not allowed to travel to the UK, with the exception of British nationals and people who are normally resident in the UK - but those two groups must pay to quarantine in a hotel if they do choose to come at the moment.\nThe \"red list\" was introduced as part of travel regulations aimed at stopping Covid variants entering the country and is regularly reviewed, meaning countries are added or removed depending on their Covid situation.\nThe government's global travel taskforce is considering a tiered or traffic light system for international travel when the ban on leaving the country is lifted. \nThe discussion is focusing on what restrictions would apply to travellers returning from destinations in the lowest level. \nThe intention is to publish the framework on 12 April, with decisions about which countries are in which tier to be taken later. \nTesting for children who travel is being considered because coronavirus vaccines are not currently approved for under-18s.\nThe new coronavirus laws, due to be introduced on Monday, suggest anyone who leaves England for a destination outside the UK without a reasonable excuse, such as for work, education or medical treatment, could face a \u00a35,000 fine.\nAnyone travelling abroad has to fill in a \"Declaration to Travel\" form, stating a valid reason for leaving the country, such as education, work or childcare.\nEngland's travel ban does not apply to those going to or from the common travel area of the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland unless that is not the final destination.\nThe UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions.\nThe earliest date people from Scotland and Wales will be able to go on holiday abroad is, like England, 17 May, while Northern Ireland has not yet announced its own plans."

      "tags": "Shrewsbury,Trade Unions,Flint,Liverpool,Strike action",
      "text": "The Court of Appeal has overturned the convictions of 14 men sentenced for their involvement in pickets in 1972.\nTrade unionists who picketed during the national builders' strike were charged with offences including unlawful assembly and conspiracy to intimidate.\nLawyers for the so-called Shrewsbury 24 had argued the destruction of witness statements made their convictions unsafe.\nLord Justice Fulford said \"what occurred was unfair\".\nThe Royle Family star Ricky Tomlinson was among those convicted. He was jailed for two years.\nSpeaking after the verdict, he said: \"It is only right that these convictions are overturned.\"\nSix of the 14 who brought the action have since died, including Dennis Warren, who was jailed for three years.\nMr Tomlinson added: \"My thoughts today are with my friend and comrade Des Warren.\n\"I'm just sorry he is not here today so we can celebrate, but I'm sure he's with us in spirit.\"\nSpeaking at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Lord Justice Fulford said: \"These 14 appeals against conviction are allowed across the three trials and on every extant count which the 14 appellants faced.\"\nBut he added: \"It would not be in the public interest to order a retrial.\"\nIn its written ruling, the Court of Appeal allowed the 14 appellants' appeals on the grounds that original witness statements had been destroyed.\nIn June 1972, trade unionists called the UK's first-ever national builders' strike in protest against pay, unjust employment practices and dangerous conditions on sites.\nTrade unionists travelled to demonstrate from one site to another and in September six coach-loads of strikers demonstrated in Shrewsbury and Telford.\nPolice arrested none of the demonstrators that day but five months later the picketers were charged and subsequently convicted.\nLord Justice Fulford wrote: \"If the destruction of the handwritten statements had been revealed to the appellants at the time of the trial, this issue could have been comprehensively investigated with the witnesses when they gave evidence, and the judge would have been able to give appropriate directions.\n\"We have no doubt that if that had happened, the trial process would have ensured fairness to the accused. Self-evidently, that is not what occurred.\n\"By the standards of today, what occurred was unfair to the extent that the verdicts cannot be upheld.\"\nLawyers had argued the broadcast of a documentary about communism during the trials was \"deeply prejudicial\", but the Court of Appeal dismissed the claim that the Red under the Bed documentary might have made the verdicts unsafe.\nArthur Murray, who was convicted of affray and unlawful assembly and sentenced to six months, said: \"We were innocent all along, yet it has taken us nearly 50 years to clear our names.\n\"Sadly my mother and four of my siblings have passed away without knowing that we were innocent.\n\"Serious questions need to be asked about the role of the building industry bosses in our convictions and the highest offices of government who all had a hand in our trial and conviction.\n\"Make no mistake, our convictions were a political witch-hunt.\" \nMr Tomlinson, from Liverpool, echoed his remarks, saying: \"We were brought to trial at the apparent behest of the building industry bosses, the Conservative government and ably supported by the secret state.\n\"This was a political trial not just of me, and the Shrewsbury pickets - but was a trial of the trade union movement.\"\nTerry Renshaw, a former Flintshire mayor, who was convicted of unlawful assembly, paid tribute to the campaign's researcher, Eileen Turnbull, who worked \"tirelessly\" to obtain \"crucial evidence\".\nShe uncovered a document in the National Archives which were part of the prosecution papers and revealed for the first time police had destroyed some of the original witness statements.\nMr Renshaw added: \"It's been 47 years. I'm just so emotional. I didn't think it would hit me like this. I am no longer a criminal.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The judge ruled the letter was \"personal and private\" and Meghan had a \"reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private\".\nLord Justice Warby subsequently said the MoS must print a single statement on the front page, referring readers to a further statement on page three.\nMailOnline must also publish the statement \"for a period of one week\".\nOn Monday, Lord Justice Warby said ANL had applied for permission to appeal.\nThe judge refused ANL permission, but granted a \"stay\" of the order \"only until the matter has been decided by the Court of Appeal\".\nHe said the stay would expire on 6 April, to give ANL time to apply directly to the Court of Appeal.\nMeghan welcomed her High Court privacy victory last month.\nAfter the Mail On Sunday was ordered to print the statements earlier this month, a spokesman for the newspaper said: \"We will be applying to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal, including in relation to aspects of the judgment today.\""

      "tags": "ITV,Television,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children",
      "text": "Good Morning Britain host Kate Garraway has said she has a \"fear of the reality\" of becoming her husband's primary carer.\nDerek Draper remains in hospital after contracting Covid-19 in March 2020 and remains very poorly.\nGarraway's year-long struggle will be shown in an ITV documentary, Finding Derek, on Tuesday evening.\n\"If he needs 24-hour care I will be the primary carer. I have a fear of the reality of that life,\" she says.\n\"It is a completely different dynamic to our relationship.\"\nIn the documentary, she discusses her family's future and whether their \"dynamic\" may change when Draper leaves hospital. \nHe was placed in a medically-induced coma when he was admitted to hospital at the start of the pandemic and although slowly improving, Garraway says Draper's doctors told her he was the most seriously ill person they had seen who remained alive.\nIn the programme, which was filmed over the last year, she says that while \"I don't think I ever really saw it (the situation) as giving up work,\" that may be a possibility she has to face.\n\"If I have to give up work to care for him then it is best to do it now when I am earning money,\" she says.\nBut on Tuesday's GMB, Garraway clarified: \"The truth is, as much as I like to think I have all the answers sometimes, Derek doesn't need me, I'm not the person to care for him.\n\"I will obviously be there completely, 100% if that would make a difference but actually what Derek needs is specialist, professional, medical support ongoing because there is a good chance he can improve but we need to make sure that support is there now for that to happen.\"\nGarraway's spokesperson has said she has no plans currently to give up her role on GMB. \n\"In fact, her job has been something of a lifeline and really kept her spirits up over this past year and she has no plans to change that,\" a spokesperson told the BBC on Tuesday.\nIn the documentary, Garraway is seen renovating the ground floor of their family home so it is wheelchair accessible ahead of his possible return.\nShe tells their 11-year-old son William: \"You know that we are hoping that dad will get better and better, but when he comes home he will probably need to be in a wheelchair, so we are trying to make it so he can do all this.\"\nThe couple also have a daughter Darcey, aged 15.\nGarraway says Draper's gradual recovery, which has seen him regain the ability to talk, \"feels like a positive\".\nShe told GMB that her husband's communication had \"regressed a little\" since filming the documentary, but \"he's even got his accent back\".\nIn the documentary, she discusses the ups and downs of dealing with Draper's condition.\n\"The only thing that panics me is that we are on such a rollercoaster with Derek that I am looking around during all this chaos and then the next minute there will be a phone call to say something has gone backwards.\n\"You think, 'Gosh, am I just fooling myself, I suppose?\"'\nGarraway also speaks to other families who have been severely affected by Covid, particularly those suffering from long-term symptoms, as well as NHS staff and other medical experts. \n\"I am very aware that I am very lucky, because Derek is still here. And we have got the chance to battle on.\"\nThe programme also sees Sir Elton John giving Garraway support over the phone, telling her: \"I pray for him every night, in my prayers, and you and your family.\n\"He is an amazing man, please give him my love when you talk to him next time.\"\nGarraway has been playing Draper music by Sir Elton in the hope he will respond.\nWhen Draper, a former political adviser, first became ill last year, Garraway was absent from GMB for several months. \nShe returned in July after doctors told her she had \"to get on with life\". \nKate Garraway: Finding Derek airs on ITV on Tuesday 23 March at 21:00 GMT.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Swansea,Newport,Coronavirus pandemic,Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board",
      "text": "The number of deaths involving Covid-19 has fallen for the eighth week in a row in Wales.\nThere were 68 deaths involving the virus, accounting for just under 10% of all deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nThis was 35 fewer deaths for the week ending 12 March than in the previous week, the lowest since 23 October.\nThere were no registered Covid deaths at all in Swansea, Newport, Blaenau Gwent and Ceredigion.\nThe most deaths registered involving Covid were again in north Wales. The 23 deaths in the Betsi Cadwaladr area included five hospital deaths of patients from Denbighshire and four from both Gwynedd and Wrexham.\nCardiff and Vale saw 17 deaths and there were 10 deaths across the Cwm Taf Morgannwg area.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, were below the five-year average for the second successive week.\nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a reliable measure of the impact of the pandemic.\nThe number of deaths in Wales fell to 685 in the week ending 12 March. This was 35 deaths (-4.9%) fewer than the five-year average.\nWhen looking across the course of the pandemic so far, there have been 39,454 from all causes, 7,717 mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate. This was 6,123 deaths above the five-year average.\nWhen deaths occurring up to 12 March but counting later registrations are included, the total number of deaths involving Covid rises to 7,731.\nThe first death involving Covid-19 in Wales occurred in Wrexham on 15 March 2020.\nBy this time last year, when the lockdown was brought in, there had already been 35 deaths.\nThe ONS figures show us the two waves of the pandemic. The first had a shorter, sharp spike; the second over the winter proved worse than the first.\nThe first wave over two months - March to May - brought more than 2,100 deaths. The peak came on 12 April with 73 deaths.\nThe second wave was more sustained: over nearly four months from late October to the end of February there were more than 4,800 deaths. The peak came on 11 January, when there were 83 deaths. "

      "text": "It is one year since the coronavirus pandemic put Scotland, along with the rest of the UK, into lockdown. As cases rose and deaths mounted, fear took hold. Exactly 12 months on, we look back at the key moments.\nIn the final days of February 2020, Scotland was still waiting for its first confirmed case of coronavirus to arrive.\nInfections had already been detected in England and most eyes in the UK were on the unfolding horror in northern Italy as hospitals filled and the death toll rose.\nScotland's first confirmed case came on 1 March, and was linked to recent travel in Italy, though we know now this was not likely to have been the country's \"Patient Zero\".\nIt later emerged there were cases in late February linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh. And Public Health Scotland data shows that five people were admitted to Scottish hospitals with Covid-19 on 1 March.\nOn 2 March First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us to expect a \"significant outbreak\" over the coming weeks.\nBut the speed with which the virus tore through the population took most people by surprise.\nOn 6 March, two cases of Covid-19 were confirmed on Shetland.\nThey were also linked to travel to Italy - a couple from the islands who had spent a long weekend in the Italian city of Naples, 500 miles (805km) to the south of the country's Covid cluster in Lombardy.\nFour days after Iain and Suzanne Malcolmson's test results came back, the number of confirmed cases in Shetland rose to six. Five days later, they stood at 15. By 19 March, they had risen again to 24.\nThe numbers were modest compared to later outbreaks, but they were enough to ensure that Shetland had the highest number of cases per 100,000 in the UK.\nThey also rooted the global Covid story firmly in one of Scotland's communities.\nContact tracers from NHS Shetland worked fast to bring the outbreak under control and with some success. Daily new cases returned to zero by the end of April and remained there for a long time.\nThe health board currently has the second lowest number of cases in Scotland, with just 224 confirmed since the start of the pandemic.\nThe prime minister announced the national UK lockdown on 23 March. In an address to the nation, Mr Johnson called coronavirus the \"biggest threat\" the country had faced for decades.\n\"All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer,\" he said.\nIt's strange now to see that on 23 March, just 83 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in Scotland.\nToday, that would be seen as a sign of an outbreak was well under control, but in March 2020 Scotland's testing strategy was in its infancy and the actual number of infections would have been vastly higher.\nDespite case figures being artificially low, it's still possible to see the growth rate. There was a slow build in the first days of March - and then the line on the graph steepens alarmingly.\nScotland went from an average of two cases a day on 7 March to peaking at an average of 343 a day a month later.\nHospital admissions and deaths also rose at a fast pace, the rates of both going from zero to their first wave peak in a matter of a few weeks.\nThe death rate lags behind the hospital admissions rate, but only by a fortnight - an indication of the fast progression of this disease in the sickest patients.\nBy the middle of March, there were only nine suspected Covid-19 cases among residents in adult care homes, according to Scottish government figures.y\nFour weeks later this figure stood at more than 1,700. It seemed the virus was tearing through the population most vulnerable to dying from the disease and the consequences of that were quickly obvious.\nBy 20 April, more than half of all deaths per week were in care homes, and remained so until the end of May, according to the National Records of Scotland (NRS).\nUsing the most recent NRS data from 17 March 2021, exactly a third of all Covid deaths were in care comes, with most deaths occurring in hospital.\nScotland's full lockdown was eased at the end of May, with cases, deaths and hospital admissions dropping to very low levels over the summer.\nBut the virus hadn't been eliminated and as people began to travel more widely, in the UK and abroad, the second wave began.\n\"Once as a society we are allowed to travel again, we brought fresh new strains into Scotland which started our second wave,\" Scotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said in December - commenting on a study that said travel had \"reignited\" Scotland's outbreak.\nSmall clusters were detected at the end of the July - one centred on a call centre in North Lanarkshire and another linked to an Inverclyde pharmacy.\nBut a much bigger outbreak was taking hold in Aberdeen, linked to bars in the city. It also started at the end of July and grew quickly enough to trigger Scotland's first local lockdown on 5 August.\nThe first minister called it the \"the biggest wake-up call\" since the early days of the pandemic - and so it proved.\nIf the Aberdeen outbreak in August provided a warning that Covid had not disappeared, then the outbreak among students in September signalled the virus was definitely back for a second round.\nIn mid-September, Glasgow's infection rate began to climb steeply as Covid spread among students living closely together in shared accommodation.\nSimilar outbreaks also occurred in student populations in Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen.\nPublic Health Scotland figures clearly show the rise in infections among younger people, with the elderly perhaps now being more cautious about exposure to the virus - or protected in locked down care homes.\nAs the number of cases built in the early autumn, the Scottish government began to apply a local restrictions strategy, with similar tactics being used in other parts of the UK.\nAn indoor visiting ban was put in place in parts of west Scotland at the beginning of September. It was followed by even stricter measures in October across much of the central belt.\nScottish ministers argued consistently that the restrictions were \"blunting\" the number of infections, though total cases in Scotland did not start going down until after the introduction of the levels system at the end of October.\nBut that decline was about to be brutally interrupted.\nNine cases of a new, more infectious, variant of Covid-19, first identified in south east England, were reported in Scotland on 15 December.\nAt this stage, there were still hopes for a Christmas easing of restrictions and Ms Sturgeon urged people not to \"prematurely overreact\" to the development.\nBut it was soon obvious the new strain was taking hold across the UK. Four days later, the Scottish government tightened the Christmas rules significantly and said tough level four restrictions would be applied to all of Scotland from 26 December.\nThe rise in cases was reflected once again in hospital admissions and deaths \nA full lockdown, with a firm stay at home message, was imposed across most of Scotland on 4 January.\nThe Scottish government was facing the prospect of the second wave biting far deeper than the first, with additional winter pressure on the NHS and a Covid variant which it was feared could lead to a higher chance of hospitalisation and death.\nThe number of Covid patients being treated in Scottish hospitals rose quickly past the spring 2020 peak and the death rate did the same.\nA corner was finally turned on 12 January when hospital admissions began to fall - but by then the new strain had already done its damage.\nIt's difficult to pick an exact date for when the first wave of Covid ended and the second began, but counting death certificates that mention Covid-19, average daily deaths reached their lowest point on 10 August.\nThis date is also near the middle of a five-week period in the summer when there were no Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nUp to 10 August, there were 4,219 deaths certificates mentioning Covid.\nSince that date there have been a further 5,614 deaths, using the latest figures available from the NRS.\nThere have been Covid deaths among younger people in Scotland - including a baby girl and two children aged between one and 14.\nBut almost 73% of the 9,831 deaths recorded by the NRS have been among the over-75s.\nThe latest figures from the NRS also show that the rate of Covid deaths gets higher the more deprived an area is.\nDeprivation is measured using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation and the NRS has made estimates of the death rates in each category.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December and more than two million people have now received their first dose.\nThere is some evidence that the vaccine is working with falling death rates among the vaccinated, though it is difficult to separate the effect of the vaccine with the impact of the current lockdown in Scotland.\nHowever, the evidence has been encouraging enough for the Scottish government to begin to talk more optimistically about a way of life \"much closer to normality\" by the summer.\nVaccination progress in Scotland has been good - about 45% of the population aged 16 or over have received a first dose of either the Pfizer or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.\nAnd crucially, close to 100% of those most at risk of serious illness or death from Covid-19 have been given a first dose.\nBarring serious disruptions to vaccine supply, the Scottish government is aiming to have offered a first dose to all adults by the end of July.\nThe pie chart above will then be one colour, or close to it. But Covid-19 will not have disappeared.\nNew variants may have emerged and much of the world's population will still not have been vaccinated. New infections will still be arriving in Scotland.\nIt is then that the real test of whether the vaccine has armoured the population against Covid will begin."

      "text": "Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's first ever tweet has been sold for the equivalent of $2.9m (\u00a32.1m) to a Malaysia-based businessman.\nThe tweet, which said \"just setting up my twttr,\" was first published on March 21, 2006 and was auctioned off by Mr Dorsey for charity.\nThe Malaysia-based buyer Sina Estavi compared the purchase to buying a Mona Lisa painting.\nThe tweet was bought using the ether cryptocurrency, a rival to bitcoin.\nIt was sold as a nonfungible token (NFT) on Monday to Mr Estavi, the chief executive of technology firm Bridge Oracle. \nAn NFT is a unique digital certificate that states who owns a photo, video or other form of online media. Each NFT is unique and acts as a collector's item that can't be duplicated, making them rare by design.\nNFTs have become hugely popular this year, with expensive digital artwork also being sold this way.\nMr Dorsey said he would convert the proceeds to bitcoin and then donate them to the Give Directly's Africa Response fund.\n\"This is not just a tweet!\" Mr Estavi posted on Twitter. \"I think years later people will realize the true value of this tweet, like the Mona Lisa painting.\"\nMr Dorsey's brief tweet was sold via an auction on an online platform called Valuables, which is owned by the US-based company Cent.\nUnder the platform's rules, Mr Dorsey receives 95% of the proceeds of the primary sale, while Cent receives 5%.\nBut the post will remain publicly available on Twitter even after it has been auctioned off.

      "tags": "Physics,Particle physics,Large Hadron Collider,CERN,Geneva",
      "text": "Physicists have uncovered a potential flaw in a theory that explains how the building blocks of the Universe behave.\nThe Standard Model (SM) is the best theory we have to explain the fine-scale workings of the world around us. \nBut we've known for some time that the SM is a stepping stone to a more complete understanding of the cosmos.\nHints of unexpected behaviour by a sub-atomic particle called the beauty quark could expose cracks in the foundations of this decades-old theory.\nThe findings emerged from data collected by researchers working at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It's a giant machine built in a 27km-long circular tunnel underneath the French-Swiss border. It smashes together beams of proton particles to probe the limits of physics as we know it.\nThe mystery behaviour by the beauty quark may be the result of an as-yet undiscovered sub-atomic particle that is exerting a force.\nBut the physicists stress that more analysis and data is needed to confirm the results.\nDr Mitesh Patel, of Imperial College London, told BBC News: \"We were actually shaking when we first looked at the results, we were that excited. Our hearts did beat a bit faster.\n\"It's too early to say if this genuinely is a deviation from the Standard Model but the potential implications are such that these results are the most exciting thing I've done in 20 years in the field. It has been a long journey to get here.\"\nThere are building blocks of our world that are even smaller than the atom. Some of these sub-atomic particles are made up of even smaller constituents, while others can't be broken down into anything else. The latter are known as fundamental particles.\nThe Standard Model describes all the known fundamental particles that make up the Universe as well as the forces they interact with.\nBut it cannot explain some of the biggest mysteries in modern physics, such as dark matter or the nature of gravity. Physicists know that it must eventually be replaced by a more advanced framework.\nThe Large Hadron Collider was built to discover physics beyond the Standard Model. So if the results from LHCb are confirmed they would represent an important discovery.\nThe LHCb produces sub-atomic particles called \"beauty quarks\", which are not usually found in nature but are produced at the LHC. Sub-atomic particles undergo a process known as decay, where one particle transforms into several, less massive ones. \nAccording to the Standard Model, beauty quarks should decay into equal numbers of electron and muon particles. Instead, the process yields more electrons than muons.\nOne possible explanation is that an as-yet undiscovered particle known as a leptoquark was involved in the decay process and made it easier to produce electrons.\nDr Paula Alvarez Cartelle, of the University of Cambridge, was one of the scientific leaders behind the finding. She commented: \"This new result offers tantalising hints of the presence of a new fundamental particle or force that interacts differently with these... particles.\n\"The more data we have, the stronger this result has become. This measurement is the most significant in a series of LHCb results from the past decade that all seem to line up - and could all point towards a common explanation.\n\"The results have not changed, but their uncertainties have shrunk, increasing our ability to see possible differences with the Standard Model.\"\nIn particle physics, the gold standard for a discovery is a level called five-sigma, in which there is a one in 3.5 million chance of the result being a fluke. \nThe measurement from LHCb is three-sigma - meaning there is roughly a one in 1,000 chance that the measurement is a statistical coincidence. So people should not get carried away by these findings, according to team leader Prof Chris Parkes, from the University of Manchester.\n\"We may be on the road to a new era of physics, but if we are, then we are still relatively early on that road at this point. We have seen results of this significance come and go before, so we should be cautious as well as excited,\" he said.\nBut if confirmed by further analysis and data when the LHCb restarts next year, it could be one of the biggest recent discoveries in physics, according to Dr Konstantinos Petridis, from the University of Bristol.\n\"The discovery of a new force in nature is the holy grail of particle physics. Our current understanding of the constituents of the Universe fall remarkably short - we do not know what 95% of the Universe is made of or why there is such a large imbalance between matter and anti-matter.\"\nThe results have been presented for publication in Nature Physics.\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"

      "tags": "Egypt,Mediterranean Sea,Shipping industry,Suez canal",
      "text": "A giant container ship the length of four football pitches has become wedged across Egypt's Suez Canal, blocking one of the world's busiest trade routes. \nDozens of vessels are stuck, waiting for rescue boats to free the 400m-long (1,312ft) ship, which was knocked off course by strong winds.\nEgypt has reopened the canal's older channel to divert some traffic until the grounded ship can move again.\nThe blockage sent oil prices climbing on international markets.\nAbout 12% of global trade passes through the Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe.\nThe Ever Given, registered in Panama and operated by the shipping company Evergreen, was bound for the port city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands from China and was passing northwards through the canal on its way to the Mediterranean.\nThe 200,000 tonne ship, built in 2018 and operated by Taiwanese transport company Evergreen Marine, ran aground and became lodged sideways across the waterway at about 07:40 local time (05:40 GMT) on Tuesday. \nAt 400m long and 59m wide, the ship has blocked the path of other vessels which are now trapped in lines in both directions.\nThe company that manages the container ship, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), has denied earlier reports that the ship had already been partially refloated. \nIn a statement, it said its \"immediate priorities are to safely re-float the vessel and for marine traffic in the Suez Canal to safely resume\".\nExperts have warned the process could take several days. \nReuters, quoting local sources, says there are at least 30 ships blocked to the north of the Ever Given, and three to the south.\nEvergreen Marine said the ship was \"suspected of being hit by a sudden strong wind, causing the hull to deviate... and accidentally hit the bottom and run aground\".\nBSM confirmed on Wednesday that all crew were \"safe and accounted for\", with no reports of injuries.\nEight tug boats are working to refloat the ship, and diggers on the ground have been removing sand from where it is wedged into the side of the canal bank.\nDr Sal Mercogliano, a maritime historian based in the US state of North Carolina, told the BBC that incidents such as this were rare, but could have \"huge ramifications for global trade\". \nFears that the blockage could tie up shipments of crude oil caused prices to rise by 4% on international markets on Wednesday, Reuters reported.\nThe Kpler energy intelligence service said that more than 20 oil tankers carrying crude and refined products were affected by the jam. \n\"This is the largest vessel ever to go aground in the Suez Canal,\" he said, adding that the ship got lodged in the embankment and would have lost power and its ability to steer.\n\"If they are unable to pull her free... in a high tide, they are going to have to start removing cargo.\" \nJulianna Cona, who says she is on board another ship located directly behind the Ever Given, wrote on Instagram: \"Ship in front of us ran aground while going through the canal and is now stuck sideways looks like we might be here for a little bit...\"\nThe Suez Canal is an artery of world trade, connecting the Mediterranean with the Red Sea, and providing an avenue for vessels to pass between Asia and the Middle East and Europe. The main alternative, a passage round the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, takes considerably longer.\nOn average, nearly 50 vessels per day pass along the canal, although at times the number can be much higher - accounting for some 12% of world trade. It is particularly important as an avenue for oil and liquified natural gas, enabling shipments to get from the Middle East to Europe.\nThe nightmare scenario, then, is for this crucial route to be blocked - which is exactly what has now happened with the stranding of the Ever Given. The question now is how long the route remains impassable, as a long delay would create serious problems for shippers, delaying consignments of goods and fuel. \nOn this occasion, reports suggest traffic could be flowing again relatively quickly, in which case the impact will be limited, although there has been a rise in the oil price.\nBut the incident has shown what can go wrong when the new generation of ultra-large vessels like the Ever Given have to pass through the relatively tight confines of the canal. Although parts of it were expanded as part of a major modernisation programme in the middle of the last decade, it remains tricky to navigate - and accidents can happen.\nThe ship has the capacity to carry 20,000 20-ft shipping containers, according to Reuters news agency. \nNearly 19,000 ships passed through the canal in 2020, according to the Suez Canal Authority - an average of 51.5 ships per day.\nIn 2017, a Japanese container vessel blocked the canal after it ran aground following reported mechanical issues. The Egyptian authorities deployed tug boats and the ship was refloated within hours.\nThe Suez Canal crosses the Suez Isthmus in Egypt - a strip of land between the Mediterranean and Red Sea. The canal is 193km (120 miles) long and incorporates three natural lakes.\nIn 2015, Egypt's government opened a major expansion of the canal that deepened the main waterway and provided ships with a 35km (22 mile) channel parallel to it."

His exact duties, hours and any payment are not clear.\nIt is his latest job move after he and the Duchess of Sussex stepped back as senior royals in March last year.\nIt also comes after the duke and Meghan gave an explosive interview to Oprah Winfrey earlier this month.\nIn it, the couple alleged an unnamed royal family member had asked about how dark their son Archie's skin might be, before he was born.\nBuckingham Palace has said the claim is \"concerning\", but it will be addressed privately. Earlier this week, Buckingham Palace said a diversity review was under way across all royal households.\nIn his statement, Prince Harry said his goal in his new function would be to \"lift up critical dialogues around mental health, build supportive and compassionate communities, and foster an environment for honest and vulnerable conversations\".\nPrince Harry will not manage employees or have people report directly to him, but he is likely to spend some time in the company's San Francisco headquarters once it is safe to do so, BetterUp CEO Alexi Robichaux told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). \nIn his role as the company's first chief impact officer, Prince Harry is expected to have input into initiatives including product strategy decisions and charitable contributions, and advocate publicly on topics related to mental health, the WSJ reports.\nPrince Harry said that when he met Mr Robichaux, they \"instantly recognised a shared passion for helping others realise their full potential\".\nThe chief impact officer position is relatively rare in the corporate world, notes the WSJ - it is seen more commonly in non-profit organisations such as Amnesty International.\nBetterUp, which was founded in 2013, provides mobile-based professional coaching, counselling and mentorship.\nThe firm says it has some 2,000 coaches offering services in 49 languages in 66 countries.\nPrince Harry has previously launched initiatives such as the Invictus Games, which aim for members of the armed forces to use sport for psychological and physical rehabilitation. He has also advocated publicly on mental health issues.\nPrince Harry and Meghan now live in California after confirming in January that they would step back as \"senior\" royals and work to become financially independent.\nThey announced last year that they had reached a deal with streaming giant Netflix to make a range of programmes, some of which they may appear in, as well as striking a deal with music streaming service Spotify."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has been cleared of breaching the ministerial code over her involvement in the Alex Salmond saga. \nAn independent inquiry by senior Irish lawyer James Hamilton had been examining whether the first minister misled the Scottish Parliament over what she knew and when.\nHis report said Ms Sturgeon had given an \"incomplete narrative of events\" to MSPs.\nBut he said this was a \"genuine failure of recollection\" and not deliberate.\nMr Hamilton said he was therefore of the opinion that Ms Sturgeon had not breached any of the provisions of the code. \nThe code sets out the standards expected of Scottish government ministers, and states that anyone who deliberately misleads Holyrood would be expected to resign.\nMr Hamilton concluded in his report, some parts of which were heavily redacted, that Ms Sturgeon did not breach the ministerial code in respect of any of the four issues he considered.\nThese included allegations that Ms Sturgeon had failed to record a series of meetings and telephone discussions with Mr Salmond and others in 2018.\nMr Hamilton concluded that the meetings were government business - contrary to Ms Sturgeon's claims that they were a party matter - but accepted her reasoning that \"it would have been impossible to record such meetings or discussions without a risk of prejudicing the proceedings or interfering with their confidentiality\".\nHe also looked at whether the first minister \"may have attempted to influence the conduct of the investigation\" into the harassment complaints made against Mr Salmond, her predecessor as first minister and SNP leader.\nThe lawyer said the key point was that Ms Sturgeon had not intervened, and said that had Mr Salmond really believed she had agreed to it during a meeting on 2 April 2018 then, \"one might have expected him to follow it up and to press home his advantage\" - but that no further contact was made for three weeks.\nThe third issue centred on whether Ms Sturgeon misled the Scottish Parliament in relation to the meetings in 2018.\nThe first minister insisted she had first learned of the complaints from Mr Salmond at her home on 2 April, but later said she had had \"forgotten\" about a meeting with his former chief of staff four days earlier, on 29 March.\nMr Hamilton said it was \"regrettable\" that Ms Sturgeon had not told MSPs about this meeting, but that he found it \"difficult to think of any convincing reason\" for her to deliberately conceal it.\nHe said she had given parliament \"an incomplete narrative of events\", but added: \"I accept that this omission was the result of a genuine failure of recollection and was not deliberate.\"\nThe fourth ground of investigation alleged that Ms Sturgeon was in breach of her duty to comply with the law in relation to Mr Salmond's successful legal challenge against the Scottish government. \nMr Salmond has pointed to external legal advice warning that the government may be at risk of losing the case as early as October 2018, but ministers decided to fight on until January 2019 - and ultimately had to pay Mr Salmond more than \u00a3500,000 in legal costs.\nMr Salmond was later cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault against nine women after a separate High Court trial in March of last year.\nMr Hamilton said Ms Sturgeon had relied on advice from the law officers, as she was \"fully entitled\" to do, and said Mr Salmond \"appears to be under the misapprehension that the government is under a duty to withdraw a case if advised that there is less than an evens chance of winning\".\nThe lawyer's 61-page report concluded: \"I am of the opinion that the first minister did not breach the provisions of the ministerial code in respect of any of these matters.\" \nMs Sturgeon welcomed the findings, and said she had \"sought at every stage in this issue to act with integrity and in the public interest\".  \nShe added: \"As I have previously made clear, I did not consider that I had broken the code, but these findings are official, definitive and independent adjudication of that.\"\nMs Sturgeon again apologised to the women who made the complaints, saying they had been let down by the government. \nBut she said: \"I was determined at the time these complaints emerged that they should not be swept under the carpet, and that I would not intervene in the process.\"\nThe first minister also called on opposition parties to respect the outcome of Mr Hamilton's inquiry, and said she would continue to devote \"all of my time and energy to leading Scotland and to helping the country through the pandemic\".\nJames Hamilton's conclusions are undoubtedly a significant boost for the first minister and her party.\nIn two days, the starting gun will be fired on the Scottish election campaign.\nMs Sturgeon will go into it saying her independent advisor cleared her. Her team see it as \"complete vindication\". \nRemember there is another report to be published tomorrow morning, by the Holyrood committee.\nWe know a majority of the committee believe Ms Sturgeon misled them in her evidence - so the issue of trust will no doubt continue to be part of the election campaign.\nBut Team Sturgeon is very happy tonight - going into an election campaign which could prove very important in determining whether there is another independence referendum. \nThe Scottish Conservatives plan to hold a vote of no confidence in the first minister on Tuesday afternoon.\nBut it looks doomed to fail after the Scottish Greens said they would not support it on the basis that \"the Tories have shown that they have no interest in establishing the truth.\"\nConservative leader Douglas Ross said the first minister had been \"given a pass\" by Mr Hamilton because he had judged that her failure of recollection was not deliberate. \nMr Ross said: \"I respect Mr Hamilton and his judgement but we cannot agree with that assessment. Nicola Sturgeon did not suddenly turn forgetful.\n\"She is not free and clear. The first minister promised to respect the decisions of both inquiry reports, not to pick and choose which one suits her and try to discredit the other.\n\"This report does not change the overwhelming evidence that Nicola Sturgeon misled parliament, her government badly let women down and wasted more than \u00a3500,000 of taxpayers' money.\"\nA separate report by a cross-party committee of MSPs that has been examining the government's botched handling of the complaints against Mr Salmond is expected to be published on Tuesday morning. \nDetails of the report that were leaked last week said that members voted by five to four that Ms Sturgeon had misled its inquiry during a marathon evidence session earlier this month. \nIt is also expected to be critical of the government's handling of the complaints against Mr Salmond.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said his party had been clear that it would not prejudge the outcome of the inquiry, and would now await the findings of the parliamentary committee.\nMr Sarwar said it was clear that the saga had deeply damaged public trust in politics at a time of national crisis, and that there were \"absolutely no winners today\"\nHe added: \"At the heart of this are two women who have been badly let down by the government, and it remains the case that nobody has taken responsibility.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon's \"errors of judgement still make resignation a live consideration\". \nNicola Sturgeon could not have hoped for a better outcome from this inquiry. \nShe effectively placed her reputation and political future in the hands of James Hamilton and he has cleared her of acting improperly. She has no intention of resigning. \nThat will not stop the Conservatives trying to force her out in a vote of no confidence on Tuesday - but that's a vote the first minister is expected to win with help from the Greens. \nShe faces further criticism in the separate Holyrood inquiry report, also due on Tuesday - with the opposition majority on that committee deciding she misled them. \nMs Sturgeon rejects that conclusion as partisan - which is how some see the decision of SNP members of the committee not to endorse it. \nThe arguments will continue into the Holyrood election campaign. The ultimate verdict on the Scottish government's handling of harassment complaints and its wider record will be made by Scottish voters. "

      "text": "Working from home, walking and shopping locally are among the lockdown behaviours that look likely to remain popular after pandemic restrictions are lifted, according to a new survey.\nThe study for BBC News and King's College London, conducted by Ipsos MORI, suggests virus regulations may have a lasting impact after Covid.\nSome 40% of 2,200 people surveyed said they expected to walk more than before.\nAnd staying at home appears to have connected people to their neighbours.\nThe survey also suggests the country is divided on whether the country is divided - 38% think the pandemic has deepened divisions, while 35% think it's brought people closer together.  \nAlmost a third of workers (32%) say they anticipate working from home more and doing more of their shopping locally (31%). A quarter of commuters (23%) say they will do less travelling to work than they used to, rising to almost a third (31%) in London.\nIt remains to be seen how significant the move from office working will be, but the implications are potentially huge. \nIn the English capital, for example, a reduction of a third in the numbers making the daily trek into central London would be a major hit to the hospitality and other service sectors that rely on commuters.\nA number of big employers have suggested they expect to see a permanent reduction in the number of people working from offices or the number of days spent commuting. \nA shift in spending towards local neighbourhoods could bring economic advantages to smaller towns and High Streets, many of which have been badly affected by the move to online shopping.  \nThe last year has not been uniformly bad for people. The survey suggests a quarter of the population (24%) had a \"much worse\" year than average, and two-thirds of people overall (65%) said it was \"worse\" than usual.  \nBut one in 10 say the last year has actually been better than average.\nSurprisingly, perhaps, 18% of young people (16-24) say the last 12 months have been better than average.    \nThe pandemic also appears to have changed political priorities. \nSeven in 10 say health workers should get more financial support from government. Around six in ten think the low-paid (62%) and social care staff (58%) deserve more help, and around half want homeless people (53%) and small businesses (50%) to get more state assistance. \nHowever, 44% say people in other countries who receive financial aid from the UK should get less money after the pandemic.\nIt may be a year since the start of the first nationwide lockdown, but it remains far from clear how this pandemic will change us and what the \"new normal\" might look like. The crisis is not yet over and the safety nets put in place by the government largely remain.  \nHow we respond to the profound economic, political and social challenges that lie ahead will be the real test of how Covid has changed Britain. \nFollow Mark on Twitter.

      "tags": "Scottish government,Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "The Scottish government's handling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond was \"seriously flawed\", a committee of MSPs has concluded. \nThe committee said women had been badly let down by the government. \nAnd they said they found it hard to believe that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was not aware of concerns about Mr Salmond's alleged behaviour before November 2017.\nThey also said Ms Sturgeon had misled their inquiry in her evidence.\nMs Sturgeon has already been cleared of breaching the ministerial code by a separate independent inquiry headed by senior Irish lawyer James Hamilton.\nShe said last week that she stood by all of the evidence she gave to the committee during her marathon eight-hour evidence session earlier this month, and has repeatedly apologised to the women who made the complaints.\nMany of the committee's findings were unanimous, but others were divided along party lines - with the four SNP MSPs being outvoted by the two Conservatives, one Labour, one Liberal Democrat and independent MSP Andy Wightman.\nThe committee had been examining the government's botched handling of two sexual harassment complaints that were made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants in 2018.\nThe government was forced to admit it had acted unlawfully in its investigation and paid the former first minister's legal fees of \u00a3512,000 after he launched a judicial review case. \nMr Salmond was later cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault against nine women after a separate High Court trial in March of last year.\nHe has accused government and SNP officials close to Ms Sturgeon - including her husband Peter Murrell, the party's chief executive - of running a \"deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort\" to damage him and even have him sent to prison.\nMs Sturgeon and her allies have dismissed these allegations as being false conspiracy theories.\nMembers of the inquiry committee voted by five to four that there had been a \"fundamental contradiction\" between Ms Sturgeon's account of meetings she had with Mr Salmond after the complaints were made, and the evidence given by his team. \nAnd they said they believed she had left her predecessor with the impression she might intervene in the complaints process.\nThey voted by the same margin that her written evidence was \"an inaccurate account of what happened\", and that \"she has misled the committee on this matter\".\nThe report also said members were \"concerned\" about how long it had taken Ms Sturgeon to inform the government's permanent secretary that she was aware of the complaints.\nAnd it said it was \"inappropriate for the first minister to continue to meet and have discussions\" with Mr Salmond.\nThe report also described the outcome of the judicial review case as being \"devastating\" for the government, as well as being \"wholly unsatisfactory for the two women who had made complaints\".\nIt added: \"This is not just about procedures or public money. It is about ensuring that, in the future, anyone complaining about sexual harassment is not let down in the way these women have been.\"\nThe committee has made a series of recommendations which it said would help ensure similar mistakes do not happen in the future, and ensure confidence in future complaints processes.  \nToday's report from the committee will make more difficult reading for Nicola Sturgeon. \nMSPs have spent some time looking into the Scottish government's handling of allegations against Alex Salmond - and they have a number of concerns.\nThe most serious allegations are that Ms Sturgeon misled the committee and the doubt they cast on her account of when she first found out about concerns about Mr Salmond.\nThis will mean the political row continues. \nBut Ms Sturgeon will point to the report for her independent adviser which concluded she did not break the ministerial code. \nThat was always going to be the key moment - and would have been extremely dangerous for Ms Sturgeon if he had concluded she broke the rules.  \nWhat does it all mean? Nicola Sturgeon is going nowhere. She will fight May's election saying her independent adviser cleared her. Her opponents will argue differently. \nThe committee was unanimous in saying that the government should have taken more time over the drafting of the new complaints procedure and should have included an independent system for reporting and investigating complaints.\nThe report said that the \"multiple roles\" fulfilled by Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans in the process \"should have been seen as a significant organisational risk\", saying this \"places a question mark over the process\".\nAnd they were critical of the government's handling of the judicial review case brought by Mr Salmond, saying there was a \"major flaw\" and a \"significant failure\" in the failure to identify and hand over relevant documents to the court.\nMembers were split over Ms Sturgeon's role in the judicial review, but agreed by five votes to four that they were \"concerned that the first minister decided to proceed with the judicial review despite clear advice that it would likely fail.\"\nBut they agreed unanimously that \"the Scottish government was responsible from an early stage for a serious, substantial and entirely avoidable situation that resulted in a prolonged, expensive and unsuccessful defence\" of the judicial review.\"\nThey said \"this state of affairs is unacceptable by an organisation such as the Scottish government and that those responsible should be held accountable\".\nThe committee - some of whose findings were leaked last week -  also said it was \"extremely serious\" that the allegations against Mr Salmond were leaked to the Daily Record newspaper in August 2018.\nMr Salmond has suggested that the leak to the newspaper came from the government - but an independent investigation by the Information Commissioners Office found there was no firm evidence for this\nThe committee said it had \"tried as far as possible to shine a light on what occurred\".\nBut it said its work had been \"hindered by the Scottish government's failure to produce key documents which were of interest to us until a very late stage in the inquiry\". \nThe report added: \"To leave it to a committee to have to drag information out of government and other bodies is a wholly unacceptable response to the accountability that is meant to exist by the executive to parliament.\"\nCommittee convener Linda Fabiani, an SNP MSP, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that it had to redact \"a lot of information\" from its report, and had been unable to publish some of the evidence it had received.\nThe redactions meant there were parts where \"the full picture is not given\", she said, but she insisted that these were \"very small elements\". \nThe Scottish Conservatives plan to hold a vote of no confidence in the first minister later on Tuesday - but it is doomed to fail after the Scottish Greens said they would back Ms Sturgeon.\nConservative leader Douglas Ross said the committee's verdict was that Ms Sturgeon had \"misled parliament and the public\".\nHe added: \"If she ploughs on regardless, as she did against the advice of lawyers in the doomed Alex Salmond judicial review case, the first minister will leave the country scarred by the most bitter divisions.\n\"It seems clear that Nicola Sturgeon will refuse to abide by the principle of democratic accountability for her government's monumental mistakes.\" \nScottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie, who is a member of the committee, said the report highlighted the \"catastrophic failings of the Scottish government on a matter of the utmost seriousness and sensitivity\".\nShe added: \"Three years on, nobody has yet taken responsibility for this failure.\n\"The Hamilton report may have exonerated the first minister of breaching the ministerial code, but the catastrophic and myriad failings this committee inquiry has revealed have called into question her judgement.\""

      "text": "The UK is marking one year since the first coronavirus lockdown, with the Queen reflecting on the \"grief and loss felt by so many\". \nA national minute's silence was held at midday, which parliaments across the UK paused business to observe.\nOn 23 March 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced tough restrictions on people's lives aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19. \nSince then, the UK's official death toll has risen from 364 to 126,172. \nMr Johnson, who observed the silence privately, praised the \"great spirit\" shown since the first lockdown and offered his condolences to those who have been bereaved during the pandemic.\nHe told a Downing Street briefing that \"at the right moment\" a permanent memorial to those who died from coronavirus would be built and said the whole period would be commemorated.\nThe prime minister said that the nation was \"step by step, jab by jab\" on the path to \"reclaiming our freedoms\" with the government on target to meet its vaccination goal.\nHe thanked people for their patience and praised the heroes of the NHS and social care as well as shop and transport workers, the police and armed forces and many others.\nAs of Monday more than 28.3 million people have received a first vaccine dose, with more than 2.3 million having had a second shot.\nLater, people are being encouraged to stand on their doorsteps at 20:00 GMT with phones, candles and torches to signify a \"beacon of remembrance\".\nIt is being organised by end-of-life charity Marie Curie. \nIt comes as a further 112 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total by this measure to 126,284, while a further 5,379 people tested positive for Covid, according to the latest government data.\nThe prime minister, who himself spent time in hospital seriously ill with Covid, said the last year had taken a \"huge toll on us all\" and that the anniversary was an opportunity to reflect on the year - \"one of the most difficult in our country's history\".\nAsked what he wished he had done differently, Mr Johnson said the \"biggest false assumption\" during the pandemic was over asymptomatic transmission which led to \"real problems\". \nHe added that no \"previous government\" had envisioned such a novel disease.\nThe Queen marked the anniversary by sending a bouquet of flowers to St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, where her husband the Duke of Edinburgh recently had surgery for a pre-existing heart condition. \nA message along with the flowers read: \"As we look forward to a brighter future together, today we pause to reflect on the grief and loss that continues to be felt by so many people and families, and pay tribute to the immeasurable service of those who have supported us all over the last year.\" \nCoronavirus cases, hospital admissions and deaths have all fallen in recent weeks as a result of the latest lockdown and the vaccine rollout. \nBut on Monday Mr Johnson warned that the effects of a third wave of coronavirus will \"wash up on our shores\" from Europe and said the country should be under \"no illusion\" it will feel the effect of increasing cases on the continent.\nOn Tuesday the prime minister's official spokesman said the roadmap out of lockdown for England remained \"on track\", with the government having outlined a \"cautious and hopefully irreversible\" route out of restrictions.\n16 March 2020: The public are told to avoid non-essential travel and social contact and to work from home where possible\n18 March: Schools are told to close from 20 March until further notice, except for the children of keyworkers and vulnerable pupils\n20 March: Restaurants, cafes and pubs are told to close\n23 March: The prime minister announces the first national lockdown, telling people they will only be allowed to leave their homes for limited reasons. Non-essential shops are told to close\nTo mark the anniversary, London's skyline will turn yellow, with landmarks including the London Eye, Trafalgar Square and Wembley Stadium lighting up at nightfall.\nOther notable buildings that will be illuminated include Cardiff Castle and Belfast City Hall, while churches and cathedrals will toll bells, light thousands of candles and offer prayers.\nScotland's first minister said in a tweet that her thoughts were with all of those who had lost a loved one to Covid or other causes in the past year. \nNicola Sturgeon also paid tribute to health workers, telling Holyrood the nation had been reminded \"just how much we owe to their dedication, expertise and compassion\", as she also announced slight easing of restrictions in some areas.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford paid tribute to the Welsh public for uniting \"in the darkest of times\".\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said it had probably been the \"toughest year in living memory\", while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it had been a \"huge challenge\".\nHealth leaders have also paid tribute to their colleagues and the public for their support during the crisis.\nDame Donna Kinnair, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: \"After a year of sacrifices and gestures, great and small, we are taking our turn to thank the public. In a time of loss and fear, they helped us to keep digging deeper.\"\nDr Susan Hopkins, Public Health England strategic response director for Covid-19, said the virus had \"left no-one untouched\" and she thanked public health workers \"who have worked long and difficult hours to help keep the country safe\".\nA year ago today, fewer than 1,000 people in the UK had died with coronavirus.\nThe figure now stands at more than 126,000.\nThe prime minister said then there were \"no easy options\" and the way ahead would be \"hard\". \nBut few would have imagined the scale of the loss of lives - or liberties - to come; the restrictions we would still be facing 12 months on.\nIndeed, as millions of us watched, listened and stopped a year ago, Boris Johnson said the restrictions would be reviewed three weeks later, and would be relaxed, if possible.\nThis easing of the rules came months rather than weeks later, soon to be followed by their reimposition as summer gave way to autumn and winter. \nAs we enter a second year of restrictions, there is hope life will soon get better.\nBut the shadow of the pandemic looms large.\nElsewhere, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the day of reflection was an opportunity to \"mourn those who have died but also to give thanks for those who have looked after us and our communities\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic \"to learn what went wrong to make sure we never repeat that\". \nDuring a visit to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, he accused the government of being \"slow to react\" implementing lockdowns and delivering protective equipment to the front line. \nDoctors, nurses and teachers are calling on the prime minister to formally recognise an annual Covid Memorial Day - paying tribute to the efforts of front line workers during the pandemic.\nThey are among those supporting a cross-party campaign, which has seen more than 50 MPs and peers sign a letter to the prime minister asking for a minute's silence every year on 23 March to remember the lives lost.\nMeanwhile, relatives of people who died with coronavirus have criticised the prime minister for \"refusing\" to meet them.\nThe Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign, which is calling for an urgent public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic, said they had written to the government six times seeking a meeting but had been refused.\nA UK government spokeswoman said the prime minister had always been clear there would be \"opportunities to look back, analyse and reflect\" on the pandemic, including an independent inquiry at an appropriate time, but added: \"For now, it is right we focus entirely on saving lives.\""

      "text": "The world's largest painting, which was created by British artist Sacha Jafri, has been sold for \u00a345m to raise funds for children's charities.\nJafri spent eight months painting the 1,600 sq m (17,000 sq ft) artwork in a deserted hotel's ballroom in Dubai.\nHe planned to sell it in 70 parts, but French cryptocurrency businessman Andre Abdoune has bought the whole work.\nThe price makes it one of the most expensive paintings ever sold at auction by a living artist.\nJafri said the full $62m (\u00a345m) would go to Dubai Cares, Unicef, Unesco and the Global Gift Foundation to help disadvantaged children in countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia and South Africa.\nThe 44-year-old artist from London originally hoped to raise $30m (\u00a322m). He told BBC News he was \"blown away\" to have doubled that.\n\"I was really overwhelmed by what happened - to raise that amount of money from one painting in one night,\" he said.\nJafri started by putting out an appeal for children to send him their pictures representing how they felt during the pandemic. He got responses from 140 countries, which he used for inspiration, he said.\n\"I was in a deep meditative state. I looked through all the [children's] work - I paint from the subconscious, and then whatever's in there comes out. Nothing's planned. There's no sketches. There were no drawings.\n\"I was literally pouring paint, and then putting another layer on top and another layer, another layer, another layer, just feeling my way through it until something magical happened.\"\nIn September, Guinness World Records recognised it as the largest ever art canvas.\nJafri worked on his own while the Atlantis hotel was closed to visitors, and needed an emergency operation on his spine during the process, as well as injuring his pelvis and feet.\n\"I was on my feet but bent right down so my brush can touch the floor,\" he explained. \"So that's a pretty bad position to be in for 20 hours a day. I was in a trance, so I didn't realise the damage I was doing to my body.\"\nThe painting, titled The Journey of Humanity, was sold in Dubai on Monday.\nJafri said the money would be spent on healthcare and sanitation for \"the poorest communities in the world\" and to connect them to the internet so children can have access to educational platforms. \"The biggest divide at the moment is those with the internet and those without,\" he said.\nThe buyer \"has a beautiful vision\" for the work, the artist said. \"His vision now is he wants to build a museum to house the painting.\"\nThe pair will \"set up a foundation together\" that will \"inspire the next generation to be inspired by art, to avoid the nonsense of the art world\", he added.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "British Armed Forces,UK defence spending,Military,British Army,Ministry of Defence",
      "text": "The size of the Army is to be reduced to 72,500 soldiers by 2025 as part of a move towards drones and cyber warfare.\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said \"increased deployability and technological advantage\" meant greater effect could be delivered by fewer people. \nHe set out plans for new capabilities such as electronic warfare and drones in the Commons.\nLabour has warned that \"size matters\" when it comes to defence.\nAnnouncing a major overhaul of the armed forces, Mr Wallace said it marked a shift from \"mass mobilisation to information age speed\", insisting they must be able to \"seek out and understand\" new threats to the country's security.\nHe said the government was increasing the UK defence spending by \u00a324bn over the next four years.\nMr Wallace said it was tempting to use the \"shield of sentimentality\" to protect \"outdated capabilities\" but doing so would put lives at risk. \nThe Army currently has 76,500 personnel and has not been at its \"established strength\" of 82,000 troops since the middle of the last decade, Mr Wallace said.\n\"These changes will not require redundancies and we wish to build on the work already done on utilising our reserves to make sure the whole force is better integrated and more productive,\" he said.\nShadow defence secretary John Healey warned that while \"threats to Britain are increasing\" the plan was for \"fewer troops, fewer ships, fewer planes, over the next few years\".\nA cut to the size of the Army had been anticipated - with a reduction of 10,000 widely trailed.\nWhat Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced was a cut to the target for the number of fully trained people in the Army, from 82,040 today to 72,500 in 2025.\n\"Full-time trained strength\" is the number of soldiers who have completed both their general, basic training and a second phase of specialised training for a specific role.\nBut the Army is not currently meeting its target - there are actually 76,350 such soldiers in the Army, which is almost 6,000 short.\nSo the Ministry of Defence is already well on the way to getting down to its new target.\nThe changes set out in the paper - titled Defence in a Competitive Age - include \u00a33bn for new vehicles, long-range rocket systems, drones, electronic warfare and cyber capabilities.\nIt sets out how forces will spend more time overseas to support allies and deter hostile powers, such as Russia.\nMr Wallace said previous reviews had been \"overambitious and underfunded leaving forces that were overstretched and underequipped\".\nThe size of the Army will be at its smallest since 1714 - with just 72,500 regular soldiers. \nThe number of tanks will be cut from 227 to 148 upgraded ones. The RAF will lose 24 of its older Typhoon jets and its fleet of Hercules transport aircraft. And the Royal Navy will be retiring two of its older frigates early before new ones come into service. \nAll this while the government says the threats are rising. \nThere will certainly be some pain before the armed forces experience the gains of extra investment. But there will be more money to invest in new technologies like robots and drones - and to compete in the domains of space and cyber. \nThe defence secretary, Ben Wallace, told MPs that his plans would equip the armed forces to fight the wars of the future. \nThey may be very different to what we saw in Iraq and Afghanistan. Small teams of troops will be sent all over the world to train and assist partner nations with the focus on conflict prevention.  \nBritish forces should be better able to counter cyber attacks and disinformation - the new front line of the so called \"greyzone\" now being exploited by Russia and China.  \nBut defence chiefs still insist that a smaller armed forces would be able to pack a punch in any serious conflict. \nThe armed forces are being asked to match the government's \"Global Britain\" ambitions. But opposition parties, and some allies, question whether Britain's military can really do more with less. \nAs part of the military restructure, the Royal Marines will be transformed into a new Future Commando Force, taking on many of the traditional tasks of the special forces - the SAS and SBS (Special Air Service and Special Boat Service).\nThe force will receive more than \u00a3200m of direct investment over the next decade to carry out maritime security operations and to \"pre-empt and deter sub-threshold activity, and counter state threats\".\nSpace is another area of investment with the Ministry of Defence to prioritise more than \u00a36.6bn for research and development over the next four years.\nNumerous aging RAF planes will be retired, as will the oldest Chinook helicopters, while Navy frigates and destroyers drop from 19 to 17 in the coming years.\nA third of the 227 Challenger tanks will be scrapped, with the rest of the fleet being upgraded at a cost of \u00a31.3bn.\nAmong other changes announced:\nConservative chairman of the Commons Defence Select Committee Tobias Ellwood congratulated Mr Wallace for investments in \"cyber and autonomous platforms\" but warned that they came at a \"huge price to our conventional defence posture with dramatic cuts to our troop numbers, tanks, armoured fighting vehicles\".\nFollowing the publication last week of the separate so-called integrated review of foreign and defence policy, ministers have said big changes are necessary to create a more agile military.\nAs part of that review, the government increased the cap on UK nuclear warheads from 180 to 260.\nBoris Johnson spoke to Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg ahead of the announcement and gave reassurances that increased investment would take the UK's total defence spending to 2.2% of GDP - above the Nato target, a Downing Street spokeswoman said.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,South Korea,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid-19 has shaken the world, with more than 2.5 million deaths and 115 million cases confirmed. BBC Panorama's Jane Corbin has scoured the globe to find the best examples of strategies for combating the virus.\nI have reported on Covid for the past year - now my mission was to find out from global leaders and senior health officials across four continents what their priorities were in tackling the virus.\nWhat has emerged strongly for me are four key areas which have been most effective in containing the spread of the virus and preventing deaths. \nNo-one can claim to have got everything right. But the steps listed below highlight some policies from around the world that have proved effective. Piece them together and you have the blueprint for a \"pandemic playbook\" - a manual for managing future infectious disease outbreaks.\nStanley Park lives in Seoul, South Korea. When he went to pick up his daughter, Joo Yeon, from the airport, he greeted her not with a hug but with a mask and a bottle of sanitising spray.\nFor Stanley, this isn't his first experience of a pandemic. He remembers the devastation and fear that the Mers outbreak brought to east Asia in 2015.\nIt's an experience his country has learned from, with the government making 48 reforms to bolster public-health emergency preparedness and response. These have paid off. When coronavirus hit, officials were able to flatten the epidemic curve quickly, without closing businesses or implementing stricter stay-at-home restrictions nationally.\nAfter her arrival from Atlanta, Joo Yeon completed a strict two-week quarantine at her parents' house, downloaded an app that tracks her movements and received six check-up calls from the authorities. She took her quarantine so seriously that she \"didn't even go to the garden, just in case\".\n\"From the very start we put in place thorough prevention measures to stop the same thing happening again - history repeating itself,\" Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said. \n\"It's very challenging at the moment, I have no idea if the patients I see have coronavirus or not,\" David Hodges, a GP from north-east England, told Panorama in March 2020. \"We might have hundreds of cases we're missing.\"\nAs cases soared ahead of the first lockdown in late March, and with resources stretched, the UK government, which had been conducting contact tracing until this point, stopped testing in the community. It had the capacity to test only in hospitals. The government's formal test-and-trace programme was launched in May.\nMost countries in east Asia started contact tracing in January. In South Korea, hospitals like Yangji, in the Gwan-Ak district of Seoul, were designated to handle Covid from testing to treatment. Here, people don't even need to enter the building - they're tested at arm's-length in a special fully-sealed booth. The hospital processes all its own tests on site and the results are usually available within four or five hours. In the UK it can take a day or more.\nDown the road from the hospital, a track-and-trace team follows up on every suspected case. The team can be forensic with the detail and has access to credit card and mobile phone data. It monitors CCTV throughout the district, sending teams out into the community to scour the streets when it sees something that concerns it. \nPrime Minister Chung Sye-kyun took personal charge of the situation before the country even had a confirmed case of Covid, giving priority to the three Ts - test, track and trace.\n\"By applying that strategy we've achieved a good, meaningful result,\" Mr Sye-kyun has said.\nThe death toll in South Korea, a country of 52 million people, stands at 1,693. \nThe UK government says the testing system has continued to evolve and it is doing everything it can to improve it.\n\"Making people stay at home is the main reason we've been able to contain Covid,\" says Usha Kumari, a community health worker in Kerala, India. Usha is one of 30,000 accredited social-health activists, known as Asha workers.\nUsha's role has been to ensure everyone who needs to self-isolate in her patch does so. She gets their shopping, collects their medicine and anything they might need, so that they don't leave their homes.\nThe support for those isolating doesn't end there. Community kitchens have been supplying up to 600 free meals to people self-isolating at home or in hospital each day and mental-health services have been offered since the start of the pandemic. \nFinancial aid has been provided and, in some cases, bills were temporarily frozen. In the UK it wasn't until September that a payment of \u00a3500 was offered to those self-isolating. However, in the first four months of the UK scheme, two-thirds of applicants were rejected. According to a Scientific Advice Group for Emergencies report released in September, less than 20% of people in the UK who were required to self-isolate, fully quarantined.\nNow, the UK government's expanding eligibility for the support payment. It says four million people could qualify.\nKerala's health minister KK Shailaja learned important lessons three years ago dealing with the deadly Nipah virus and has applied those lessons to tackling Covid. She insists that by ensuring support for those self-isolating, officials were able to control the spread and keep its hospitals from being overwhelmed.\nWith a population of 35 million, Kerala went from having the highest number of cases in India in March 2020 to having among the lowest Covid-19 death rates in the world.\nAt the start of April, GP Lisa Federle began testing in care homes in the ancient town of T\u00fcbingen, in the Baden W\u00fcrttemberg state of Germany, to keep the virus out and to allow visitors. \nThe town's mayor, Boris Palmer, thought \"we have to build up a special protection shield for the people who carry the highest risk\". He had seen the impact of the virus in Italy and Spain on the older demographic. \"These are the elderly people, so we need special protection for them.\"\nMr Palmer used his local budget to prioritise care and support for the town's elderly population, including a subsidised taxi service, free masks delivered to homes and special shopping hours.\nIt meant the town's University Hospital, received fewer Covid-19 patients and wasn't forced to cancel other medical procedures. \nUnlike the UK, where London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast made all the major decisions, Germany, with its federal system, allowed each of its states to decide locally how to respond to the virus. The elderly have been among the largest casualties of the pandemic - and, particularly in Europe, those living in care homes. \nAlthough visitors were banned in UK care homes right at the start, there was criticism that testing was slow. It wasn't until 15 April that it was announced by the UK government that all people discharged from hospitals into care homes needed to have a test. By July, at least 20,000 care-home residents in England and Wales had died from Covid-19 since the start of the outbreak, according to the Office for National Statistics. \n\"When it comes to nursing homes, they're a vulnerable group and that should not have been a surprise,\" says Prof Dale Fisher, an expert in infectious diseases who was sent to the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, in February 2020.\n\"I think it's been obvious where in the world nursing homes weren't given attention, the death tolls there were significant.\"\nMore than 26 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine - part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched. While well behind world leader Israel, which has so far fully inoculated more than half its population, the UK has had extraordinary success with its vaccine programme.\nThe UK's success is largely down to a tremendous effort in planning. The Department of Health and Social Care began planning a mass vaccination programme before there was even confirmation of the first Covid-19 case in the UK. In the summer, the government signed a contract for 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and 30 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nIt's a different story in Europe - planning started later and the rollout has been slow. Only 8% of people in Europe have received a vaccine so far compared with 36% in the UK. The UK's vaccine deals were struck three months before the EU's.\nThe situation is worse across the developing world. While nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns, only a handful of African countries have.\nIn South Africa's Cape Town, Michael Kuta is one of the many people in the townships who volunteered to take part in a trial run by Dr Linda Gail-Bekker for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Michael doesn't know whether he has received the vaccine or a placebo, but he says, for him, its worth it. \"It's the only chance that I have to get the injection for the pandemic. To live,\" he says. \"My family still need me.\" \nMany poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which aims to ensure access for all to Covid vaccines. The UK is one of the largest contributors, donating nearly \u00a3500m. South Africa has signed up to the initiative.\nHowever, a vaccination strategy must be an international effort. In countries where access to a vaccine is limited, the virus has an opportunity to mutate - as it has in South Africa and Brazil - creating new variants that are more transmissible, which can spread abroad. Scientists fear they could be more resistant to existing vaccines and therefore threaten countries that have had a successful rollout. \nThe UK government says there'll be opportunities to look back, analyse and reflect. There will be an independent inquiry - at the appropriate time. But for now it is focused entirely on the pandemic, which has challenged health systems across the world.\nAs work continues to distribute the vaccine globally, it appears we have finally turned a corner in our fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. \nProf Dale Fisher says we cannot risk not learning the lessons of the last 12 months. \n\"We've been hit hard and paid a hefty price. One of the worst things we can do is when this is over, we just go back to normal. If you don't learn from it, then history will repeat itself.\" \nWatch Panorama's Who Got It Right? on BBC One at 19:00 GMT on Monday, 22 March, or later on the BBC iPlayer (UK only)."

      "tags": "Congo-Brazzaville,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The leading opposition presidential candidate in Congo-Brazzaville, who was seriously ill with Covid-19, has died hours after polls closed. \nGuy-Brice Parfait Kol\u00e9las died on a plane taking him to France for treatment, his campaign director said. \nHours earlier the 61-year-old had appeared in a video shared on social media, where he removed his oxygen mask and told his supporters that he was \"fighting death\". \nHe urged them to vote in Sunday's poll.\nThe electoral law doesn't annul the election if one of the candidates dies.\nFrench prosecutors announced a criminal investigation into the cause of Mr Kol\u00e9las's death. His body has not yet been repatriated.\nMr Kol\u00e9las, who was diabetic, was one of six candidates running against President Denis Sassou Nguesso, 77, who has been in power since 1979, except for a five-year period after losing elections in 1992. \nCongo-Brazzavile has officially recorded more than 9,000 cases of Covid-19 and 130 deaths. \nThe country has imposed a night-time curfew in the two main cities of Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire and closed its borders due to the pandemic.\nHowever, campaign rallies were allowed, with not much sign of people respecting social distancing or wearing masks.\nMr Kol\u00e9las had missed his final campaign event on Friday after saying a day earlier that he feared he had malaria, the Associated Press news agency reports. \nHe was admitted to a private hospital in the capital, Brazzaville, and it was later confirmed that he had Covid-19.\nSpeaking in French from his hospital bed, Mr Kol\u00e9las said: \"My dear compatriots, I am in trouble. I am fighting death. However, I ask you to stand up and vote for change. I would not have fought for nothing.\"\n\"Rise up as one person... I'm fighting on my deathbed, you too fight for your change,\" he urged his supporters, saying the election was \"about the future of your children.\" \nThe head of the government's Covid-19 response team, Elira Dokekias, said that Mr Kol\u00e9las' condition had been serious on Saturday, the Associated Press reports.\nAfter casting his ballot in the capital, Mr Sassou Nguesso had wished the former fisheries minister and son of former Prime Minister Benard Kol\u00e9las, a swift recovery.\nA large crowd gathered on Sunday to catch a glimpse of the president, with many people not wearing masks and failing to adhere to social distancing rules. \nMr Sasou Nguessou beat Mr Kol\u00e9las in the last election in 2016, obtaining 60% of the vote compared with his rival's 15%.\nThe watchdog group NetBlocks reported that the internet had been shut down ahead of Sunday's voting. \nThe largest opposition party, the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS), is boycotting the election, saying it fears the poll could divide the nation. \nCongo-Brazzaville's Catholic Church episcopal conference has said it has \"serious reservations\" about the election's transparency.\nAnalysis by Emery Makumeno, BBC News\nMr Kol\u00e9las could have had an easy life, he was a government minister enjoying the perks that comes with being a top official but he gave all that up to challenge President Sassou Nguesso. \nHis death has robbed Congo's opposition of a tireless campaigner for democracy and has blighted the opposition's chances of a serious challenge for the presidency. \nWhat is certain is that there will not be any speculation about what Mr Kol\u00e9las thought about the state of the country in his last moments - he chose to record a personal message to Congolese urging them to continue fighting for democracy. \nHe came second in the 2016 presidential election, but even in a poll which many see as a foregone conclusion, how Mr Kol\u00e9las performs, even in death, will still be closely watched."

      "title": "Scottish independence: Draft bill for indyref2 published",
      "tags": "Scottish independence",
      "text": "The Scottish government has published draft legislation for the holding of a second independence referendum.\nIt wants to hold indyref2 after the pandemic but \"in the first half of the new parliamentary term\".\nThe SNP says it will attempt to pass the bill if May's election returns a majority of MSPs who back independence.\nThe legislation proposes using the same yes or no question as in 2014, with the date to be decided by MSPs.\nThe Conservatives, Labour and Lib Dems have all opposed the move, saying that Scotland's focus should be on recovery from the Covid-19 crisis rather than a row over the constitution.\nAnd the UK government has so far refused to give its consent to a new referendum, which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has previously said would be needed to ensure the legality of any vote.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon has not ruled out going to court to settle the question of whether Holyrood could legislate for a legal referendum without Westminster's backing.\nThe draft referendum bill was published shortly before Ms Sturgeon was due to learn the outcome of an independent investigation into whether her involvement in the Alex Salmond saga broke the ministerial code. \nThe legislation proposes using the same question as the 2014 referendum - \"should Scotland be an independent country?\" - with voters asked to answer either yes or no.\nThe paperwork accompanying the bill said that this question continues to be well understood by the Scottish public.\nHowever, the independent Electoral Commission will be asked to test the wording of the question after the bill is formally tabled.\nThe bill also proposes using the same franchise as is used for Scottish Parliament and local government elections, including allowing foreign nationals who live in Scotland to vote.\nBut there is no firm commitment to any date for the poll, with the bill stating that this is a decision \"for the next Scottish Parliament to take\".\nAnnouncing the publication of the draft bill, Constitution Secretary Mike Russell said the immediate priority would be \"dealing with the pandemic and keeping the country safe\".\nBut he said that \"better times lie ahead\", and that \"it should be the people living in Scotland who have the right to decide how we recover from the pandemic and what sort of country we wish to build after the crisis\".\nHe said the current government thinks the vote should be held inside the first half of the five-year Holyrood term.\nAnd he added that if May's election produces a pro-independence majority, \"there can be no democratic justification whatsoever for any Westminster government to seek to block a post-pandemic referendum\".\nHe said: \"Scotland's recovery should be made by the people who live here and who care most about Scotland. That is why Scotland's future should be Scotland's choice.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly ruled out giving his backing to a new referendum, saying the question was settled conclusively in 2014 when the country voted by 55% to 45% to reject independence.\nHe told the Scottish Conservative party conference earlier this month: \"I just find it incredible that the SNP would choose this moment to again push their campaign for separation.\n\"Just when everything is beginning to reopen again, when we will soon be reunited with our friends and family, the SNP think that this is the time to turn us all against one another.\"\nThis was echoed by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who said the bill was a \"reckless distraction\" and a bid to \"distract people from the Sturgeon-Salmond scandal\".\nHe added: \"A responsible government would be entirely focused on Scotland's post-pandemic recovery, but Sturgeon and her ministers have become detached from reality and the priorities of ordinary families.\"\nScottish Labour and the Lib Dems have also rejected the idea of having a new referendum in the immediacy, with Labour's constitution spokesman Colin Smyth saying that \"the focus for all of Scotland's politicians should be on bringing the country together, and an independence referendum is not a priority at this time\".\nAnd Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said civil servants who could have been \"planning to get cancer services running full speed\" had instead been ordered to work on a referendum bill.\nHe added: \"We are still in a pandemic. Thousands have lost their lives, thousands more have lost their job. Reasonable people will think that this is the wrong moment to be pushing a referendum.\"\nThe Scottish Greens back independence - with the party's co-leader, Lorna Slater, saying it \"could be crucial in securing a majority of MSPs in favour of Scotland having a say over our own future\"."

      "title": "Covid: The inside story of the government's battle against the virus",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Contact tracing,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": " At the beginning of March 2020, I asked a senior member of the government: \"Do you feel worried?\" They replied: \"Personally? No.\" But just weeks later, Downing Street was scrambling to manage the biggest crisis since World War Two.\nSince then, monumental decisions have had to be taken. And there have been many accusations of failings - the desperate shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), Covid ripping through unprepared care homes, hundreds of billions borrowed and spent to keep the economy going, to name a few. \nI have asked 20 of the most senior politicians, officials and former officials, who either witnessed or were involved in the big decisions, to pick five pivotal moments from the past 12 months. \nWhat they say tells us so much about what really happened, what our leaders were thinking, and, strikingly, how little they knew. The contributors are not being named, so they could speak freely. \nOn 31 January, it was reported that coronavirus had arrived in the UK, as two people were admitted to hospital. Meanwhile, more than 80 Britons evacuated from China were quarantined at a facility in the north-west of England. But for the government, Brexit had sucked up all the political energy - it was the day the country officially left the EU. \nThe prime minister and his team were exhausted but elated. It felt like Boris Johnson had \"just really started to take flight\", one member of the team tells me. \nMinisters and officials had already been meeting to discuss the virus in China - but it felt thousands of miles away. There was a \"lack of concern and energy,\" one source tells me. \"The general view was it is just hysteria. It was just like a flu.\" \nThe prime minister was even heard to say: \"The best thing would be to ignore it.\" And he repeatedly warned, several sources tell me, that an overreaction could do more harm than good. \nA small group in Downing Street had started daily meetings, after, according to one of those who attended, \"it became clear that there was no proper, 'Emergency break-the-glass' plan.\"\nBut for many of those I've spoken to, the game-changer was at the end of February, when the virus took hold in northern Italy - it was closer to home, and England's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, had, one minister told me, warned that if it got out of China, it would become global, and be on its way to the UK. \n\"The biggest moment for me was when I saw those pictures of northern Italy,\" one senior minister says. \"I thought that will be us if we don't move.\"\nReports of the chaos there catapulted the virus, one senior minister says, \"from not on the radar, to people on the floor of hospitals in Lombardy.\" They say that was the moment \"we knew that it was inevitable\". \nMinisters and officials became locked in arguments over how to respond. The prime minister and many cabinet ministers were reluctant to consider anything as draconian as a lockdown. To many people, the very idea would have seemed fanciful. \nEven stopping shaking hands seemed a step too far for the prime minister. \nBefore the first major coronavirus briefing on 3 March, he had, I am told, been prepared by aides to say, if asked by journalists, people should stop shaking hands with each other - as per government scientific advice.\nBut he said the exact opposite. \"I've shaken hands with everybody,\" he said, about visiting a hospital with Covid patients. \nAnd it was not just a slip, one of those present at the briefing says. It demonstrated \"the whole conflict for him - and his lack of understanding of the severity of what was coming\".\nA Downing Street spokesperson told the BBC: \"The prime minister was very clear at the time he was taking a number of precautionary steps, including frequently washing his hands. Once the social distancing advice changed, the prime minister's approach changed.\"\nBy this point, Mr Johnson was attending emergency committee Cobra meetings with officials and leaders from Holyrood, Belfast and Cardiff - although he had missed the first few. \nBut one senior politician who attended at the same time says: \"The early meetings with the prime minister were dreadful.\" And inside Downing Street, senior staff's concerns about the government's ability to cope grew.\nThere were huge logistical considerations about equipment, facilities and how fast the disease might move in the UK, and questions about how effective the actions taken in China to suppress the virus would be here. It was not well understood, for example, that people without symptoms could still pass it on, nor that Britons returning from half-term holidays in northern Europe were bringing the virus back home in large numbers.\n\"There was a genuine argument in government, which everyone has subsequently denied,\" one senior figure tells me, about whether there should be a hard lockdown or a plan to protect only the most vulnerable, and even encourage what was described to me at that time as \"some degree of herd immunity\".\nThere was even talk of \"chicken pox parties\", where healthy people might be encouraged to gather to spread the disease. And while that was not considered a policy proposal, real consideration was given to whether suppressing Covid entirely could be counter productive. \nOn 3 March, when the prime minister set out the government's plan, the focus was on detecting early cases and preventing the spread.\nBut on 12 March, with journalists crammed into the state dining room at No 10, he told the public that the country was facing its worst health crisis in a generation. Anyone with symptoms was told to stay at home for a week. \nAdvisers seemed confident it was not yet time to close schools or stop large crowds gathering. And the government's scientists felt they had time to slow everything down - the peak was not expected for another 10-14 weeks.\nThat same week, though, nervousness was rising among others in government that the virus was outpacing everyone's expectations, and the plans in place to smooth out the outbreak would not work.\nOne source tells me it felt like the \"government machine was breaking in our hands\", things were \"imploding\", and within 48 hours the approach outlined on the 12th would feel out of date. \nThere has been no shortage of controversy over whether the government was too slow to close the doors on 23 March - but many of the conversations I have had, pinpoint the moment it became urgent in No 10. \nOn 13 March, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) committee concluded the virus was spreading faster than thought.\nBut it was Downing Street \"modellers in the building\", according to one current official, who pored again over the numbers, and realised the timetable that had only just been announced was likely to result in disaster. \nThe next morning, a small group of key staff got together. Simple graphs were drawn on a whiteboard and the prime minister was confronted with the stark prediction that the plan he had just announced would result in the NHS collapsing under the sheer number of cases. \nSeveral of those present tell me that was the moment Mr Johnson realised the urgency - that the official assumptions about the speed of the spread of this new disease had been wrong. \nTo prevent the NHS \"falling over\", he was warned, the government would have to impose measures as infections rose. And while they could be relaxed as cases fell, this pattern might recur across \"multiple waves for 18 months\".\nSeveral sources recall vividly the \"snake like graph\" they were shown that day.\nThen, one official says, everything started to move at \"lightning speed\". And behind closed doors - before the terrifying projections of Imperial College became public, a couple of days later - plans were accelerated. \nOn 16 March, the public were told to stop all unnecessary social contact and to work at home if possible. \nNew cabinet committees were formed. And the machine moved into a different phase, with the prime minister and the \"quad\" - Matt Hancock, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak - the new decision-making form. It was, I am told, \"high tension - [with] a lot of testosterone in the room\".\nFor many inside government, the pace of change that week was staggering - but others remain frustrated the government machine, in their view, had failed to move quickly enough.\nThere was tension between those who wanted to ensure systems were as ready as they could be first, and others who argued vociferously that moving fast against the virus was more important than anything else. \nBut those I spoke to now agree on one thing - how much they did not know about the disease. \n\"You can kick yourself about the things that you wish you knew,\" one minister says, \"but we just didn't have anything in place.\" \nAnother cabinet minister says: \"It's easy to say we should have locked down longer, gone harder, but there are more complex debates about where the national interests really lie.\" \nAnd it was all so strange. \nOne minister who made some of the public announcements when lockdown came says: \"I remember when I wrote it into the script, I just couldn't believe that I was saying this.\" \nAnd one official, struck by how huge it all felt, says he googled: \"Did they shut the schools during the War?\" \nAnother, meanwhile, admits, \"We were more blind than we told the public,\" and suggests that is still the case one year on. \nOn 18 March, we reported that a small number of members of staff in No 10 had fallen ill. One insider says: \"People were dropping like flies.\" \nThe prime minister, however, was acting as though he was impervious to the risk. He had developed a habit of banging his own chest, telling staff he was \"strong as a bull\". Soon, though, this chest-banging turned into \"extreme coughing fits\". Tests, in short supply everywhere, were requested for him from 25 March. And two days later, he tested positive.\nHe switched to the chancellor's bigger suite of offices so that he could keep working, screened off from the rest of the building. Insiders recall how much he hated this and, in a second spell of isolation in the autumn, chairs had to be placed across the door \"like a puppy gate\", so he could still communicate with the tiny number of staff allowed into the same part of the building.\nThen, at the end of March, the prime minister became increasingly ill - each video call he made to reassure the public required more takes.\nOn 6 April, he agreed to go to St Thomas' Hospital and, struggling for breath on a phone call, I have been told, confirmed he wanted Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to stand in for him.\nInitially, Downing Street tried to give the impression that all was well. Journalists were even told that Mr Johnson was working on his red boxes. That message has been put down to a mix up, and we now know this was far from the truth. \nThe moment of genuine crisis came when he was moved into intensive care. No-one knew if the prime minister would make it through the night - or what the plan was if he did not. \nBy this point, with so many in No 10 and in government already sick, there were, I have been told, about \"half a dozen people running things\". \nFears that he might need to be intubated were shared by a tiny group inside Number 10. They discussed the possibility that ministers would have to gather in the cabinet room, with the doors closed, until they chose a successor - but there was no fixed protocol, and no conclusion was reached. The Tory Party, I have been told, even started to consider how to transfer the leadership without a contest, fearing that such a competition could be seen as \"venal\" after the prime minister's death. \nThen cabinet ministers were summoned urgently for a conference call. \"All of a sudden we were asked to join this call - not knowing if he was alive,\" one tells me.  Then No 10 prepared to make the news public. \nThe Downing Street voice on the other end of the phone cracked with fear as I was asked to get to the Foreign Office as soon possible with a camera to talk to Mr Raab, who was being sent out to try to reassure the country. We reported the news that Mr Johnson was in intensive care from the back of a taxi. \nA former official tells me: \"We thought we really could lose him - we had to plan for a full transition.\" That night was \"long and shocking\", one source says. \nBy the end of May, the number of coronavirus cases was falling, the prime minister was back at work full time, and the public had surprised the government by overwhelmingly sticking to the rules. \nFurthermore, despite some embarrassing and prominent lockdown breaches - in April, for example, Scotland's chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, had to quit over her visits to her holiday home - there had been what one senior minister describes as \"tremendous goodwill\". \nBut then came the Mirror and the Guardian's scoop - in March, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, had travelled hundreds of miles to County Durham, after his wife fell ill with Covid. He, too, succumbed to the virus and his stay on his family's farm to recover, before returning to London, had been kept secret - apart from among a tiny number of Downing Street staff. \nAnd Mr Cummings was determined not to quit. After considering sacking him, the prime minister stuck by him - but first, there was what has been described to me as tense \"mediation between a couple deciding whether to divorce\". \nBefore making that decision, he had summoned Mr Cummings to go through his version of events. Together, they planned for him to give this version publicly - despite others' protestations. The result was the surreal press conference in the Downing Street rose garden.\nMany of those I have talked to describe this episode as a terrible turning-point.\n\"Even for us, this is mad,\" a member of the Downing Street team tells me.\nSenior ministers say: \"The handling was a fiasco\". \"It was ridiculous\", and, at a time of national emergency, \"broke the political consensus\".\nPerhaps, after two months of lockdown, the public was ready to be angry with someone.\nMPs' inboxes were swamped with irate emails - mine too. \"The early pandemic washed away all the bitterness of Brexit,\" one senior minister tells me. \"That all came flooding back, all that bile, all that pent up frustration.\"  \nSome ministers tweeted their support for Mr Cummings. One of those who refused says: \"He should have resigned straight away. You lead by example. I was busy chopping logs with my chainsaw to get the frustration out.\" \nSome polling suggests the Barnard Castle episode really did dent the public's trust in the government. \"It gave people who wanted to break the rules an excuse,\" one source says.\nBut inside government, there was a belief that an extraordinary period of unity had already started to fade, and the public had started to tire of the rules once the government had moved towards its plans to lift them. \nThere is no question, though, the whole misadventure made the politics of the pandemic more scratchy and less consensual.\nMr Cummings was not the only one to be caught up. In June, Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, provoked anger by attending a huge Republican funeral. \nBut it was after Barnard Castle that it felt like the mood in the country had changed.\n\"People wanted to portray the PM as a clown,\" one minister tells me, \"or not up to the level of events.\"\nBritain in the summer did not feel like a country still gripped by a pandemic. \n\"There was loads of over optimistic messaging,\" one politician says.  \nFor example, the time when a Labour MP asked for advice at the end of June for his constituency, which was home to a popular beach and he was worried about huge numbers heading for the sea. \"Show some guts,\" the prime minister told him.\nIn July, a grinning chancellor delivered plates of Japanese curry to unsuspecting customers at a London restaurant, to promote his \"eat out to help out\" scheme. Then the prime minister started to encourage people back to the office. \nBut behind closed doors, there were significant doubts about the wisdom of this new mood. \"We knew there was going to be a second wave,\" one cabinet minister tells me, \"and there was a row about whether people should work from home or not - it was totally ridiculous.\" \nThe summer optimism and opening was \"the biggest mistake - a rush of blood to the head\", another senior figure says. \"The PM has to carry the can\". \nThe prime minister believed that another lockdown would be a disaster and wanted to avoid it at all costs - but for many of those involved in making the decisions, his hostility to tightening the rules again was frustrating, dangerous and political. \n\"The policy objective in the summer and the autumn was - do the minimum possible,\" one tells me. \nBut by the end of August, with Britons packing beaches, the warnings of what might come were already flickering in Number 10. \nSome days, sources suggest, the prime minister would express concern about the virus coming back. Others, he would be in \"let-it-rip mode\". And senior officials expressed deep concern about what seemed to be changes of heart on a daily basis.\nThe disease would not be contained by indecision, and  by the start of September, with schools and universities having returned, \"you could clearly see a steady increase,\" a senior figure says. \nThe testing system had not been able to keep pace with demand, and too few people were willing to, or could afford, to self-isolate if they tested positive. \"The idea that you could liberalise in the summer was based on the idea that you could whackamole with test and trace,\" the source says. \"But if you didn't whack the right moles then it doesn't work.\"\nBy the middle of September, \"the data was already screaming out\", one insider says. On the 17th, I was told by one source: \"If you do nothing now, by the end of October you will get something worse than the first wave.\"\nThe possibility of a short \"circuit breaker\" lockdown was already being discussed in Downing Street that week. Prof Whitty, the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, and Mr Cummings and others were arguing hard for action to be taken - but the prime minister was unpersuaded.  \nOthers wanted to push again - one current official recalls a \"concerted effort\" - and on Sunday 20th, the No 10 team gathered a range of scientists. But the prime minister remained reluctant.\nAnother current official describes his attitude as, \"if there is a way not to act, why do it?\". \nOver the next 36 hours, I have been told, a small group inside Downing Street repeatedly tried to change Mr Johnson's mind - but by then, he was operating in a very different atmosphere.\n\"A swampiness had risen because of ideological pressure on this government at every turn to do less - and to do it more slowly,\" a senior figure says. And it is understood Mr Johnson had privately assured groups of MPs there would be no more restrictions.\nThe Treasury was pointing out the damage any further restrictions would do to the economy, many of the traditional Tory-backing newspapers were hungry for restrictions to be relaxed, the party was restless, and I remember cabinet ministers who had hardly any cases of the virus in their constituencies at that point, suggesting they saw no evidence for further action. \nSo when Mr Johnson made changes to the coronavirus restrictions on 22 September, they were tweaks, rather than a real tightening up.  I remember talking to Tory backbenchers that day who felt they had won.\nThe importance of the missed September moment is cited by many senior figures - and some now concede it was a mistake. \n\"We strained at the leash to get things going,\" one cabinet minister admits. \"I was aggressively for that - but I have learned that it is better to go slow.\" \nAnother senior minister, one of those who pushed for more radical action at the time, now says: \"We should have locked down more severely, earlier in the autumn - the whole point was, the earlier you act the more you buy yourself time for a strategy that can get out.\"\nYou can still hear the frustration in the voices of those who lost the argument. \n\"The PM was saying the Tory Party won't swallow it,\" one tells me. \"Everyone else felt, we know we are going to have to do a lockdown.\" \nAnd there is no question that the tier system that was introduced over the autumn, which portioned England into different levels of restrictions, was soon tied up in confusion and regional spats. \n\"It was completely unintelligible to any normal human being,\" one senior official says. \"It was too slow, and too Byzantine, and that resulted in more cases.\" \nAnother says now: \"We ended up tying ourselves into ever tighter knots,\" as the system became more and more particular to each part of the country. \nIt is impossible to know what would have happened if the brakes had been slammed on in September - but some ministers pin the terrible scale of the second wave, at least in part, on the apparent reluctance to act.\nThe circuit-breaker that was imposed later in Wales did not make the problem go away, however. Case numbers weren't the only concern - the economy had been shuttered, and shattered. Political demands had changed. \nIn defence of Mr Johnson, one senior minister says: \"He's not to blame if he was trying to reflect the aspiration for the country back in the summer\". Another tells me the plans, and the billions spent on \"test-and-trace and tiering meant it was reasonable to do the unlock\".  \nThey reject the idea that a circuit breaker was the obvious option - \"There wasn't a slam dunk recommendation.\"\nRegarding the potential introduction of national restrictions in September, Downing Street referred us back to comments made by the prime minister to parliament in early November.  \n\"No-one wants to impose measures unless absolutely essential,\" Mr Johnson told the Commons. \"So it made sense to focus initially on the areas where the disease was surging and not to shut businesses, pubs and restaurants in parts of the country where incidence was low.\"\nBut while there is no question mistakes were made in the first phase of the pandemic, when so much about the virus was a mystery, those involved in the decisions are already less forgiving of their own mistakes the second time around.\n\"A miracle,\" is how one minister describes the vaccine gamble to me. A government so often lambasted by critics for busting convention did it again - but this time, so far, with a stunning outcome. \nVaccines had been discussed in January, as the government machine began to contemplate, slowly, what might be ahead. Early on the chancellor, holding the cheque book, indicated a willingness to spend at speed, without asking for guarantees.\nNo 10 decided to \"chuck everything at it\", at a meeting in April. With Sir Patrick's crucial experience and deputy chief medical officer for England Prof Jonathan Van-Tam's emphasis on the practicalities of delivering the vaccine, politicians were persuaded to take what was then a huge risk. \nThere was an early decision to \"pay high, pay early, and ensure it works,\" one senior official tells me. \nAnd it seems their decision was informed by everything that had gone wrong with trying to secure PPE - the collapse of the NHS's normal procurement process, which is controlled by the Department of Health.\nThe UK decided early not to participate in the EU's joint plan to buy vaccines. While publicly this decision may have been politically controversial, behind closed doors it was \"easy\" and \"straightforward\", ministers and officials say. \"No-one wanted any of the Brexit baggage anywhere near it.\" And, more importantly, the EU had made it clear any participating country would be unable to make its own deals with manufacturers the EU had an agreement with - or control its own supply. \nThe vaccines team had warned ministers at the start of May that nothing was certain - and developing a vaccine as quickly as the prime minister, who \"wanted it yesterday\", required would be an uphill struggle. But, as one minister says, it was \"the one thing we would wish that we had done in a year's time\". \nAnother, a senior minister, says: \"The PM strategically saw immediately that the combination of testing, drugs and vaccine was the way out.\" And when it came to vaccines, the UK was ready to take an expensive gamble. \nThe Treasury was spending speculatively in ways it had not since the War - and vaccine spending has already reached nearly \u00a313.5bn. \"Imagine if it hadn't come off and we had spent all of that taxpayers' money,\" one senior official says to me.\nThere was intense secrecy, throughout, with the various vaccines given secret code names to ensure commercial confidentiality. All were named after submarines - the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine \"Ambush\", I can now reveal, and the Oxford-AstraZeneca \"Triumph\".\nAfter 12 months of grappling with endless calculations about balancing risks to life, wider health and how the country makes a living, decision-makers are exhausted. They have to accept it is perfectly possible to be wrong, one senior minister tells me. And those who made the decisions are all too aware mistakes they made in these past 12 months may have had such a terrible cost. "

      "text": "Parts of the UK's skyline have been lit up in remembrance of those who have lost their lives in the pandemic.\nOne year on from the start of the first lockdown, candles have been lit on doorsteps around the country and major landmarks illuminated in yellow.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the country had been through a year-long \"epic of endurance and privation\".\nBut \"step by step, jab by jab\", the nation was on the path to \"reclaiming our freedoms\", he told a news briefing.\nSpeaking a year after tough Covid restrictions were introduced in March 2020, Mr Johnson thanked people for their \"courage, discipline and patience\".\nEarlier a minute's silence was held with parliaments across the UK pausing.\nSome of the country's most famous landmarks including the London Eye, Wembley Stadium and Cardiff Castle were lit up in yellow after dark, while people shone lights from their doorsteps to signify a \"beacon of remembrance\" at 20:00 GMT.\nOther notable buildings taking part include Cardiff Castle and Belfast City Hall, while churches and cathedrals tolled bells, lit thousands of candles and offered prayers.\nMr Johnson told a Downing Street briefing that \"at the right moment\" a permanent memorial to those who had died from coronavirus would be built, and that the whole period would be commemorated.\nHe also praised the heroes of the past year, including NHS and social care staff, shop and transport workers, the police and armed forces.\nIt comes as a further 112 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total by this measure to 126,284, while a further 5,379 people tested positive for Covid, according to the latest government data.\nThe prime minister said the pandemic would be something he would remember for the rest of his life and described it as a \"deeply difficult and distressing period\" in history.\n\"For month after month, our collective fight against coronavirus was like fighting in the dark against a callous and invisible enemy - until science helped us to turn the lights on and gain the upper hand,\" he said. \nMr Johnson said the government was on track to meet its target of offering a first dose of vaccine to every adult by the end of July. \nBut he warned the country must be \"very wary\" of a potential third wave, saying there were \"distinct signs\" of one in Europe.\nThe prime minister said he hoped to be able to say more on travelling abroad from England on 5 April - a week earlier than a taskforce into the issue had been scheduled to report back.\nEngland's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warned there would be \"bumps and twists on the road\", possibly including the emergence of more new variants.\nHowever, he said a \"wall of vaccinated people\" would significantly reduce the ratio between the number of cases and the resulting death toll.\nAs of Monday, more than 28.3 million people have received a first vaccine dose, with more than 2.3 million having had a second shot.\nDeaths in the UK have fallen below the five-year average for the first time since the summer, with experts putting the drop down to the end of the winter wave of Covid deaths, lockdown and the vaccine rollout.\nThe vaccination programme is going well, but once again we are being reminded of the threat of a third wave.\nBoth the prime ministers and his senior advisers made reference to it.\nWith restrictions lifting, cases are likely to go up - although there is hope the change in seasons will help limit those rises.\nOver half of people are vaccinated, but that still leaves many millions susceptible.\nSome will be in the vulnerable groups - either because they have chosen not to take up the vaccine or because it has not worked.\nThat means people will still die just as they do from flu each year.\nIn a bad winter, there can be more than 20,000 flu deaths. \nModelling suggests that with the vaccine rollout and a careful lifting of restrictions there could be 30,000 Covid deaths by summer 2022.\nBut the government's advisers made clear there really is no other option, saying there is \"close to zero chance\" of zero Covid for a virus that spreads so easily, often undetected because so many do not even develop symptoms.\nThe challenge now is managing that risk.\nAsked what he wished he had done differently over the past year, Mr Johnson said the \"biggest false assumption\" during the early part of the pandemic was over asymptomatic transmission, which led to \"real problems that we then had to work very, very hard to make up the ground\". \nHe added that no \"previous government\" had envisioned such a novel disease, while chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said having adequate testing at the beginning of the pandemic would have made a \"big difference\".\n16 March 2020: The public are told to avoid non-essential travel and social contact and to work from home where possible\n18 March: Schools are told to close from 20 March until further notice, except for the children of keyworkers and vulnerable pupils\n20 March: Restaurants, cafes and pubs are told to close\n23 March: The prime minister announces the first national lockdown, telling people they will only be allowed to leave their homes for limited reasons. Non-essential shops are told to close\nEarlier, the Queen marked the milestone by sending a bouquet of flowers to St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, where the Duke of Edinburgh recently had surgery for a pre-existing heart condition. \nA message along with the flowers read: \"As we look forward to a brighter future together, today we pause to reflect on the grief and loss that continues to be felt by so many people and families, and pay tribute to the immeasurable service of those who have supported us all over the last year.\"\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon paid tribute to health workers, telling Holyrood the nation had been reminded \"just how much we owe to their dedication, expertise and compassion\".\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford praised the Welsh public for uniting \"in the darkest of times\".\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said it had probably been the \"toughest year in living memory\", while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it had been a \"huge challenge\".\nDoctors, nurses and teachers, as well as more than 50 MPs and peers, have written to the prime minister as part of a cross-party campaign asking for a Covid Memorial Day - paying tribute to the efforts of frontline workers during the pandemic.\nThey are asking for a minute's silence every year on 23 March to remember the lives lost."

The 23 deaths in the Betsi Cadwaladr area included five hospital deaths of patients from Denbighshire and four from both Gwynedd and Wrexham.\nCardiff and Vale saw 17 deaths and there were 10 deaths across the Cwm Taf Morgannwg area.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, were below the five-year average for the second successive week.\nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a reliable measure of the impact of the pandemic.\nThe number of deaths in Wales fell to 685 in the week ending 12 March. This was 35 deaths (-4.9%) fewer than the five-year average.\nWhen looking across the course of the pandemic so far, there have been 39,454 from all causes, 7,717 mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate. This was 6,123 deaths above the five-year average.\nWhen deaths occurring up to 12 March but counting later registrations are included, the total number of deaths involving Covid rises to 7,731.\nThe first death involving Covid-19 in Wales occurred in Wrexham on 15 March 2020.\nBy this time last year, when the lockdown was brought in, there had already been 35 deaths.\nThe ONS figures show us the two waves of the pandemic. The first had a shorter, sharp spike; the second over the winter proved worse than the first.\nThe first wave over two months - March to May - brought more than 2,100 deaths. The peak came on 12 April with 73 deaths.\nThe second wave was more sustained: over nearly four months from late October to the end of February there were more than 4,800 deaths. The peak came on 11 January, when there were 83 deaths. "

Even people who don't feel very ill can put others at risk.\nA high temperature is 37.8C or above. A fever like this can happen when the body is fighting off any infection - not just coronavirus. \nIt is best to use a thermometer. But if you don't have one, check if you, or the person you are worried about, feels hot to the touch on the chest or back. \nA high temperature is unlikely with a cold. \nIf you have a fever, arrange a coronavirus test - you can also use the NHS 111 coronavirus service online.\nIf you have a cold or flu you may well have a cough, along with other symptoms. \nFlu usually comes on suddenly and sufferers will often experience muscle aches, chills, headaches, tiredness, a sore throat and a runny or stuffed nose, along with the cough. It feels worse than a heavy cold.\nColds tend to develop more gradually and are less severe, although they do still make you feel unwell. Along with a cough, there may be sneezing and a sore throat and runny nose. Fever, chills, muscle aches and headaches are rare.\nA coronavirus cough means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing fits or \"episodes\" in 24 hours. \nIf you usually have a cough because of a long-standing medical condition like COPD, it may be worse than usual. \nYou should get tested for coronavirus if you develop a new, continuous cough. \nThese are key symptoms of coronavirus and mean you should get a test. \nIt could still be that you have a simple cold. But you need to check, even if you don't feel unwell, to avoid the risk of spreading the virus.\nSneezing is not a classic symptom of coronavirus, and unless you also have a fever, cough or loss of smell and taste, you do not need a test, according to the NHS. \nSneeze droplets can spread infections though, so catch them in a tissue, put it in the bin and then wash your hands. \nTo help stop the spread of coronavirus and other illnesses:\nCurrently, the NHS says a runny nose or a headache is not a reason to get tested for Covid.  \nBut research suggests some people who test positive for Covid do have these symptoms.\nUS guidelines say people with the following symptoms may have Covid: \nPeople with coronavirus have a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe. Some will have none at all, but can still be infectious.\nSymptoms may appear up to two weeks after exposure to coronavirus, but usually around day five.\nFeeling breathless can be a sign of a more serious coronavirus infection.\nIf you are having trouble breathing, contact your doctor online or over the phone, or the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.\nIf you are very worried about sudden shortness of breath ring 999.\nAnd the NHS advises: \nNHS: How to treat coronavirus at home"

In a time of loss and fear, they helped us to keep digging deeper.\"\nDr Susan Hopkins, Public Health England strategic response director for Covid-19, said the virus had \"left no-one untouched\" and she thanked public health workers \"who have worked long and difficult hours to help keep the country safe\".\nA year ago today, fewer than 1,000 people in the UK had died with coronavirus.\nThe figure now stands at more than 126,000.\nThe prime minister said then there were \"no easy options\" and the way ahead would be \"hard\". \nBut few would have imagined the scale of the loss of lives - or liberties - to come; the restrictions we would still be facing 12 months on.\nIndeed, as millions of us watched, listened and stopped a year ago, Boris Johnson said the restrictions would be reviewed three weeks later, and would be relaxed, if possible.\nThis easing of the rules came months rather than weeks later, soon to be followed by their reimposition as summer gave way to autumn and winter. \nAs we enter a second year of restrictions, there is hope life will soon get better.\nBut the shadow of the pandemic looms large.\nElsewhere, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the day of reflection was an opportunity to \"mourn those who have died but also to give thanks for those who have looked after us and our communities\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic \"to learn what went wrong to make sure we never repeat that\". \nDuring a visit to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, he accused the government of being \"slow to react\" implementing lockdowns and delivering protective equipment to the front line. \nDoctors, nurses and teachers are calling on the prime minister to formally recognise an annual Covid Memorial Day - paying tribute to the efforts of front line workers during the pandemic.\nThey are among those supporting a cross-party campaign, which has seen more than 50 MPs and peers sign a letter to the prime minister asking for a minute's silence every year on 23 March to remember the lives lost.\nMeanwhile, relatives of people who died with coronavirus have criticised the prime minister for \"refusing\" to meet them.\nThe Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign, which is calling for an urgent public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic, said they had written to the government six times seeking a meeting but had been refused.\nA UK government spokeswoman said the prime minister had always been clear there would be \"opportunities to look back, analyse and reflect\" on the pandemic, including an independent inquiry at an appropriate time, but added: \"For now, it is right we focus entirely on saving lives.\""

      "tags": "Yemen,Houthis ,Yemen crisis,Saudi Arabia",
      "text": "Saudi Arabia has proposed a new peace plan to end nearly six years of war in Yemen.\nIt suggests a UN-supervised ceasefire between Yemen's Saudi-backed government and Houthi rebels, who are supported by Iran. \nThe plan also includes the reopening of vital air and sea links, and the start of political negotiations.\nHouthi rebels have said the offer did not appear to go far enough to lift the air and sea blockade in place.\nThe proposal was announced in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan, who called on the Houthis, who control large swathes of Yemen, to accept it.  \nHe said the ceasefire would come into force as soon as the Houthis accepted it.\nYemen's internationally recognised government has welcomed the offer, but the Houthis have said the initiative provided \"nothing new\", and fell short of their demand for a complete lifting of the blockade on the airport in the capital, Sanaa, and the western port of Hudaydah.\n\"We expected that Saudi Arabia would announce an end to the blockade of ports and airports and an initiative to allow in 14 ships that are held by the coalition,\" Houthi chief negotiator Mohammed Abdulsalam told Reuters news agency.\nThe group would continue to talk with the Saudis, the US and mediator Oman for a peace agreement, he said.\nSaudi officials say they are co-ordinating their steps with the United Nations and the United States, which have also stepped up their efforts to end a conflict which has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis. \nOnly days ago, the Houthis rejected a US plan for a nationwide ceasefire.\nA peace plan is already in the works; international diplomacy has been quietly accelerating for months. A push by UN envoy Martin Griffiths was recently bolstered by US President Joe Biden's new focus on ending this war, and the appointment of US special envoy Tim Lenderking to help make it happen. \nRiyadh's decision to make its own public statement underscores how it backs this effort to find a way out of this destructive conflict. And it wants to ensure it's being seen to do so. If these new moves don't work, the blame would lie with the Houthis. It could also help confirm the kingdom was in lockstep with its American ally, especially when that relationship is still strained over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. \nRiyadh's new concessions, including the opening of vital air and sea links, will help ease the enormous suffering of Yemenis. They are also longstanding Houthi demands. \nThis intensifying diplomacy also competes with the Houthis' drive for battlefield gains, including the capture of the strategic town of Marib. Western diplomats express hope that this now-stalled offensive could provide a window to accelerate efforts on the negotiating front. But it won't be easy. \nIran, which backs the Houthis, may also see an opportunity to burnish its own peace-making credentials. Whatever brings the warring sides to the table will be welcomed by an exhausted people on the brink of famine in this endless war. \nThe Saudi offer coincides with increasing drone and missile attacks by Houthi rebels on Saudi energy and security infrastructure.\nThere's also been renewed bombing by the Saudi-led coalition of Sanaa, which is under Houthi control.\nMany previous peace plans for Yemen have failed, including last year's Saudi ceasefire. But the kingdom is now offering some concessions the Houthis have long called for, including the opening of the international airport in Sanaa, currently under Houthi control, although the Saudi-led coalition controls the airspace.  \nIf the warring sides agree to a ceasefire, it would be supervised by the UN and help pave the way for peace talks. \nThe two sides are still far apart, but this is the most concerted effort to try to bring them together, the BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet says.\nThe conflict began in late 2014, when rebels seized control of much of the west of the country and a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched a military operation to restore President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi's rule.\nRiyadh led a military coalition into the country in 2015 to prop up the internationally recognised government, but it has struggled to oust the rebels.\nAn estimated 20 million people - two-thirds of the Yemeni population - depend on humanitarian assistance. Some two million children are acutely malnourished.\nIn addition to conflict, Yemen has seen a collapse of its health system, leaving it incapable of coping with the coronavirus pandemic."

      "text": "Waitrose has said it will no longer sell children's magazines with plastic disposable toys to help tackle pollution.\nThe retailer said the free plastic toys have a short lifespan and cannot easily be recycled.\nThis comes amid calls from some of the children they are aimed at to stop giving away free plastic toys. \nOver the next eight weeks, it will be removing magazines containing the free toys from its shelves.\nWaitrose is urging publishers to replace \"pointless plastic\" with sustainable alternatives.\nIt said the move was inspired by Skye, a 10-year-old from Gwynedd, who launched a campaign to persuade publishers to stop giving away the disposable toys in magazines.\n\"I'm really pleased so many people have agreed with me and supported my petition - I want to thank everyone who has signed and shared my campaign to ban plastics from comics and magazines,\" Skye told the BBC. \n\"Thank you to Waitrose for agreeing with us and no longer selling the unwanted plastic tat. \n\"I hope all retailers can do the same and then the publishers will realise this is not acceptable anymore. We really like the magazines - we just don't want or need the plastic packaging or the cheap plastic toys.\"\nThe ban will not include educational or reusable craft items which are designed to be used multiple times, such as colouring pens and pencils, and collectable models.\nMarija Rompani, partner and director of sustainability and ethics at Waitrose, said: \"While we know these magazines are popular with children, some of the unnecessary plastic attached to them has become really excessive.\n\"Many in the younger generation really care about the planet and are the ones inheriting the problem of plastic pollution.\n\"We urge publishers to find alternatives, and other retailers to follow our lead in ending the pointless plastic that comes with children's magazines.\"\nThe retailer has written to magazine distributors giving them eight weeks' notice of the policy, asking for alternatives to plastic toys and warning that they will not sell copies which contain the disposable items.\nIt is the latest move by the supermarket to cut down on single-use plastic, which has also seen it end the sale of Christmas crackers with plastic toys or glitter, and has a push to make all its own-label packaging recycled, reusable or home compostable.\nChildren's plastics campaign's have been successful in the past. In 2019, Burger King stopped including plastic toys in their children's meals and McDonald's gave children options of books with Happy Meals, after a campaign by two sisters."

      "tags": "Belfast,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Restaurants",
      "text": "Most businesses had no idea they would still be closed one year after the initial Covid-19 lockdown announcement. \nSome, like pubs that don't serve food for example, have only been open for three weeks of the last 12 months. \nWhile the health context has changed with the rollout of a vaccine - many business have the same frustrations.  \nOwners still want a date to re-open and guidelines to know if when they do re-open, they will be able to operate in a way that is viable. \nThe current lockdown restrictions were imposed on 26 December 2020 and have been extended until at least 1 April 2021. \nSome businesses have criticised the lack of detail in the NI Executive's blueprint for restrictions and in recent weeks the health minister has said it was too soon to follow a calendar-led approach.\nEarlier this month, Stormont's Department of Finance released \u00a3178m in new business support grants.\nBut many businesses say they are worse off financially compared to this time last year, as any cash reserves they may have had will have taken a significant hit. \nEd Lindsay is the owner of Finnebrogue Woods wedding venue in Downpatrick, County Down. \nLast year he told BBC News NI the first lockdown wiped out his bookings, but now he is still counting the cost. \n\"If they have to postpone twice, then really we are having to give three weddings and only get the income for one wedding. It has cost us hundreds of thousands of pounds.\" \nHe has a message for politicians at Stormont: \"Show some leadership, give us a plan. Give us some indicative dates, please.\" \nHospitality has been among the hardest hit by restrictions. \nFably Khanam is one of the owners of 7 Spice restaurant in Belfast which opened in October - just two days before Northern Ireland entered a second lockdown. \nShe said if they had known they would still be in lockdown now, they would not have opened.  \nThe new restaurant marked a significant investment of \u00a3500,000.  \nNow there is a question mark as to whether they will be able to afford to re-open. \nShe said: \"Because we have no date to re-open, there's no light at the end of the tunnel at the moment. Realistically, there is a possibility that the doors may not open.\" \n\"What funds we have left are just getting little and little - hardly anything's left so it's going to be difficult for us to get through.\" \nRosaleen Stewart owns a shop called Rosie's Emporium, in Lisburn, and is sitting with thousands of pounds of seasonal stock from Christmas to Mother's Day that she can't sell but still has to pay for.\n\"It's hard to believe some of this Easter stock is still here from last year,\" she told BBC News NI. \n\"We are coming up to the end of March and we still don't know what's happening for the rest of this year. \n\"Easter - we're closed. We still don't know what's happening with the rest of the seasons.\"\nShe said she had Christmas and Halloween stock ordered but did not know what was going to happen. \n\"I had started to build up a cash reserve, that's now everything gone - personal and business wise - there's no money left in the pot,\" she said.\nHospitality Ulster, which represents pubs and restaurants in Northern Ireland, is calling on the executive to engage with the industry and publish the criteria which will allow them to reopen. \nChief Executive Colin Neill said: \"Why does the health department not want to publish the criteria that must be met to allow us to reopen?\" \nHe added: \"We can't afford just to have doors open and then be severely curtailed and restricted to the point that it's not financially viable. \n\"Any revenue gained at reopening will only be going towards the offsetting of debt that has been accumulated over the least 12 months and beyond.\n\"How many more days must we wait without hope? It's now 365 days and counting.\" "

      "tags": "Car Technology,Toyota,Nissan,Honda,Japan,Semiconductors,Car industry",
      "text": "One of the car industry's biggest computer chip suppliers has warned that a major fire at one of its factories in Japan could have a \"massive impact\" on its ability to fulfil orders.\nThe incident comes at a time when supplies of chips to the auto industry were already running short.\nShares in the semiconductors firm Renesas fell, along with its clients including Toyota, Nissan and Honda.\nElsewhere, Volkswagen has said chip scarcity might last until the autumn.\n\"I think things will get stable by the fall but certainly its going to be complicated, and its going to be challenging but I think we'll navigate it,\" Scott Keogh, VW's North America chief executive told the BBC.\nHe added that some of the company's plants were likely to run fewer shifts a day, but added that he hoped factory shutdowns could be averted.\nRenesas has said the blaze occurred last Friday, and was caused by a plating tank catching fire as a result of an electrical \"overcurrent\", whose cause is still being investigated. It took fire fighters more than five hours to put out.\nThe fabrication plant involved is based in the city of Naka, in the eastern province of Ibaraki. It specialises in 300mm wafers, making it one of the company's most advanced facilities.\nThe firm has said there were no human casualties, but 11 of its manufacturing equipment units were damaged. \nAnd because this occurred in one of its environmentally-controlled \"clean rooms\" - which are designed to avoid any dust or other particles from ruining the tiny transistors and circuits involved in a chip - efforts to restart production will involve more than just swapping out the ruined kit.\nWhile Renesas said the majority of the products manufactured using the affected machines could in theory be manufactured elsewhere, the wider supply shortfall will make that difficult to achieve in practice.\nThe company has said it hopes to restart production in a month, but the Nikkei Asia news site said it could take three months before output is back to normal.\nRenesas has said that it has about a one-month stockpile of chips to continue fulfilling automakers' orders - so the impact to car production will not be immediate.\nBut it comes at a time of crisis.\nNew cars often include dozens of microprocessors.\nAt the start of the coronavirus pandemic, car-makers cut orders for the components because of a slump in sales of their vehicles. \nWhen the market rebounded towards the end of 2020, they found it hard to find supplies because other consumer electronics makers had stepped in with orders of their own to meet higher than normal demand for their gadgets because of lockdowns.\nIn addition, February's freezing weather in Texas closed chip-making plants there. \nUS trade restrictions placed on the telecoms firm Huawei and chip-maker SMIC, among others, have caused other Chinese companies to stockpile supplies of their own.\nAnd a drought in Taiwan is threatening production there. Wafer manufacturing requires a lot of water.\nMany car-makers have slowed or temporarily halted production at some of their plants. It had earlier been estimated that they faced losing more than $60bn (\u00a343.3bn) of sales as a result.\n\"Given that automotive semiconductor capacity is very stretched right now, this fire is effectively a blow upon a bruise, so to speak,\" commented Richard Windsor, owner of research firm Radio Free Mobile.\n\"But because following 2011's Fukushima nuclear disaster, Toyota ordered all its suppliers to keep more inventory than it had done in the past, it's quite possible it won't be as badly impacted as Honda and Nissan.\"\nRenesas' stock fell 4.9% in Tokyo trade on Monday.\nToyota's fell by 2.6%. Honda's by 3.6%. And Nissan's by 3.7%.\nElsewhere, there has been further evidence of constrained chip production having wider knock-on effects.\nThe Nikkei Asia reported on Sunday that the price of memory chips had risen 60% since the start of 2021. It noted that supplies of older chips were particularly constrained, which would impact printer-makers among other gadgets that rely on them.\nAnd last week, Samsung's co-chief executive Koh Dong-jin warned of a \"serious imbalance in supply and demand of chips in the IT sector globally\".\nAlthough the South Korean company is unusual in that it both designs and manufactures state-of-the-art chips for use in its own products and others, it still relies on third-party supplies. And it has faced a shortage of application processors from the US firm Qualcomm.\nQualcomm's chief executive commented indirectly on the issue at the China Development Forum in Beijing on Saturday.\nSteve Mollenkopf predicted that supplies of some older-technology chips would recover before their newer counterparts, adding: \"So, depending on the product, you may be in a position to get some improvement.\" "

      "tags": "UK devolution,Abortion,Brandon Lewis,Abortion in Northern Ireland",
      "text": "The decision to introduce new powers compelling Stormont to implement abortion laws has not been taken lightly, Brandon Lewis has said. \nThe government has published regulations allowing the NI secretary to direct commissioning of central abortion services in NI. \nAbortion was decriminalised in 2019, but full services have been stalled. \n\"We have used every opportunity and avenue to encourage progress,\" said Mr Lewis.\nMr Lewis said the government is \"disappointed with the continuing failure to commission abortion services\". \nHe added that the devolution settlement did not absolve the government of its responsibility to uphold the rights of women and girls. \n\"Our strong preference remains for the Northern Ireland Executive to take responsibility itself for upholding these rights,\" Mr Lewis said. \n\"It has always been our expectation and preference that the Department of Health would drive forward the commissioning of abortion services.\"\nEarlier the government said giving the NI secretary the powers was a \"necessary and appropriate\" step.\nThe regulations - which come into force on 31 March - state that Mr Lewis is acting as required to uphold legal and human rights duties on NI abortion services.\nStormont's Department of Health has said the matter is \"controversial\" and any decision on abortion services must be made by the whole executive.\nEighty-eight MPs - including SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, the party's South Belfast MP Claire Hanna and Alliance's Stephen Farry - have offered cross-party support for the NI secretary's move in a letter to Stormont ministers.\nHowever, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has criticised it and said it would have \"serious consequences\" for devolution.\nIn an interview with BBC News NI on Tuesday, North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said a \"dangerous game\" is being played.\nMr Paisley said: \"If the government is going to cherry pick elements of the New Decade, New Approach agreement, if it is going to cherry pick other issues and force them on to Northern Ireland, it does not augur well for those of us who may be in a position to influence what matters the Northern Ireland Executive decides to take on next.\"\nThe abortion law issue should be removed from the order paper and \"therefore there will be no tit for tat\", he added.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was \"so unfair\" that women have been denied access to \"modern and compassionate healthcare services\".\n\"It should be this executive that decides and makes sure that we deliver these services,\" Ms O'Neill said. \n\"I very much urge the health minister to commission the services.\"\nThis unusual move by Brandon Lewis can be viewed two ways.\nThose opposing it have accused London of a power grab, overriding locally-elected ministers on an issue that has been devolved to Stormont for more than a decade.\nThose in support say the government has an overarching responsibility to ensure the services - already provided for in law by MPs - are set up properly.\nLimited provision is taking place - more than 1,000 terminations have been carried out here since the laws changed last March.\nBut medical staff involved have been working without direction, resources and no funding meaning not every woman or girl seeking the services, can actually access them.\nIt is this that the government says it's trying to rectify, though Brandon Lewis would undoubtedly still prefer the executive to resolve it.\nHe has effectively placed the parties on notice that he will act if they do not. \nHowever, even stronger is the possibility this could all end up being resolved by the courts before the politicians.\nAlliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw welcomed the move by Brandon Lewis, but added it should not have been necessary. \n\"Abortion is a conscience issue for Alliance but this matter is about what should be the first duty of an executive - to ensure the law is implemented properly and fairly,\" Ms Bradshaw said. \n\"This episode once again shows why fundamental reform of the cross-community veto is long overdue.\"\nAbortion was decriminalised in Northern Ireland in 2019, and changes to NI's abortion laws came into force in March after Westminster acted during a period when the power-sharing institutions at Stormont were suspended. \nHowever, the commissioning of full services has been delayed.\nStormont and Westminster are facing legal action from the Human Rights Commission over this delay.\nThe regulations provide Mr Lewis with the powers, but they will need to be debated in both houses of Parliament - within 28 sitting days - to remain in force.\nLatest figures from the Department of Health show that since abortion regulations came into force at the end of March last year, 1,345 terminations have taken place. \nThe department added that full provision of services will require \"substantial additional investment\" from the government. \nThe letter from MPs backing the government's plan was drawn up by Labour MP Stella Creasy, who brought the initial amendment in 2019 that led to the changes to Northern Ireland's abortion laws.\nIt is addressed to Stormont's first and deputy first ministers, Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill, and Health Minister Robin Swann.\nIt states that it is \"disappointing\" the current laws have not been implemented, and that women and girls in Northern Ireland are entitled to have access to \"safe, legal and local abortion services should they wish to access them\".\n\"As parliamentarians from many different parties, we respect and value the devolution settlement of the United Kingdom, and are determined it must never be used to deny the human rights of any woman including those of women and girls in Northern Ireland,\" it adds.\n\"The secretary of state will therefore have our support for this action, and we urge you to commission abortion services urgently.\"\nThe changes meant abortion laws in Northern Ireland altered significantly last year, with terminations available in all circumstances of the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\nIt is legal in other circumstances up to 24 weeks and beyond that for cases of non-fatal fetal disabilities and fatal fetal abnormalities.\nAt present, health trusts are carrying out interim services for early medical abortions up to 10 weeks, meaning women seeking a termination beyond that are required to travel to England.\nThe Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is challenging the UK government, the Northern Ireland Executive and NI's Department of Health for delaying the commissioning of all services.\nThe case is due to be heard by Belfast High Court at the end of May.\nThe DUP, which opposed the changes to the abortion laws by Westminster, has proposed a piece of legislation at Stormont seeking to restrict abortions in cases of non-fatal disabilities.\nIt passed its second reading last week with the support of a number of parties.\nSinn F\u00e9in abstained on that vote, but has separately called for the Department of Health to commission full abortion services as required under the regulations.\nThe Alliance Party, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists view the issue as a matter of conscience for individual assembly members.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann has insisted that he, alone, cannot commission abortion services, according to legal advice the executive received from Stormont's Attorney General Brenda King.\nOn Monday, Mr Swann told the assembly that as it was deemed a \"controversial\" matter under the terms of Stormont's ministerial code, he had a duty to ensure any proposals to commission services had consensus of the whole executive.\nThe code states issues which are \"significant or controversial\" must be brought to the executive.\nSinn F\u00e9in Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has said she also intends to raise the issue at Thursday's executive meeting."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has warned the effects of a third wave of coronavirus will \"wash up on our shores\" from Europe.\nThe PM said the UK should be \"under no illusion\" we will \"feel effects\" of growing cases on the continent. \nOne of his ministers, Lord Bethell, also warned the UK might put \"all our European neighbours\" on the red list of countries, where arrivals are either banned or put in quarantine hotels. \nThe comments come amid a row over Covid-19 vaccine supplies in the EU.\nThe president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen has warned the EU could \"forbid\" doses made in the bloc from being exported to the UK.\nEU leaders will hold a virtual meeting on Thursday to discuss their plans.  \nOfficials confirmed the PM spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday about the ongoing issue, which would affect exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made in Europe. \nMr Johnson said he \"talked to EU friends repeatedly\" during the pandemic and had been \"reassured... over the last few month they don't want to see blockades\".\nDowning Street also said President von der Leyen, had told Mr Johnson earlier this year that the EU was not intending to restrict exports of vaccines.\nEU legislation allows measures to be taken \"if severe difficulties arise in the supply of certain products\" - which, in theory, could include export bans and the waiving of patent and intellectual property rights on vaccines.\nBut earlier, Mrs von der Leyen's chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, insisted that Brussels was not seeking to ban vaccine exports, but wanted pharmaceutical firms to meet their contractual obligations to the bloc.\nMr Mamer said: \"In that context, the president has said that, of course, we see that, actually, companies that manufacture doses in the EU have been exporting very widely - which is in itself a good thing - but that we want to see reciprocity and proportionality in these exports.\"\nAsked if he was worried about the row, Mr Johnson told reporters: \"I am reassured by talking to EU partners over the last few months that they don't want to see blockades.\"\nBut he went on to issue a warning about what the growing infections in Europe could mean for the UK.\nThe PM said: \"On the continent right now you can see, sadly, there is a third wave under way.\n\"And people in this country should be under no illusions that previous experience has taught us that when a wave hits our friends, I'm afraid it washes up on our shores as well.\"\nHe added: \"I expect we will feel those effects in due course. That's why we're getting on with our vaccination programme as fast as we can.\"\nLater, Health Minister Lord Bethell warned how the rising cases and issues with vaccines could affect travel to European countries going forward. \nHe told the House of Lords: \"I don't know how that will play out and it's certainly above my pay grade to speculate, but we are all aware that the possibility lies that will have to red list all of our European neighbours - but that would be done with huge regret.\" \nOn Monday, the UK reported 17 deaths over the last 24 hours of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 28 days. \nA further 5,342 cases were also confirmed, while another 367,006 people received their first vaccination - along with 52,612 who got their second jab. \nMeanwhile, the long-awaited results of the US trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which involved more than 32,000 volunteers, show that the jab is safe and highly effective.\nSeveral European leaders paused rollout of the vaccine amid concerns of a possible link with blood clots. UK and EU regulators said there was no evidence the vaccine causes blood clots.\nEuropean leaders have faced criticism for the slow pace of the vaccine rollout on the continent.\nLess than 12% of the EU's population is reported to have received the vaccine, compared with nearly 40% in the UK - although the bloc has 446 million citizens, compared to almost 67 million in the UK.\nThe EU has encountered production problems with the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines.\nBritish-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca said the fact that EU contracts were signed later than with the UK caused problems with supplying their vaccine.\nDowning Street has previously said that it does not believe that vaccine supply issues will affect the current road map for easing lockdown restrictions.\nIrish Taoiseach Michael Martin said it is vital that supply chains were kept open, telling RTE: \"Once you start putting up the barriers, other people start putting up barriers globally and it could lead to everybody losing. We'd all lose in that situation.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer also said the UK government was right to say that contractual obligations need to be honoured, telling LBC that the EU was not \"helping itself\".\nThe Guardian says a report by data analysts Airfinity suggests that if an export ban was applied to all vaccines - including those from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson that have yet to be deployed in the UK - it would see the offer of a first vaccine to every adult completed in late August rather than the target date of 31 July.\nBut Mr Johnson said the UK had already vaccinated over half of the adults in the country, adding: \"We'll just bash on with the road map we've set out.\" \nThe prospect of a third coronavirus wave won't engulf anyone with joy. So why did Boris Johnson highlight this danger today?\nPrivately and publicly ministers are making it clear that they don't want to delay the dates in England's roadmap out of lockdown.\nThere will be a vote in Parliament on coronavirus restrictions later this week. \nSo by stressing the risk that the virus still poses, the PM may be hoping to convince restless backbenchers that he can't go any quicker. \nHe may also be trying to persuade vaccinated people with itchy feet that booking spring or summer holidays would still be premature.\nHe is preparing us, too, for the strong possibility that cases could rise in the coming weeks - not just because of \"incoming\" risks, but because rules here are being slowly relaxed.\nBut by stressing the shared threat from the coronavirus - i.e. the sooner the EU population is vaccinated, the less chance of importing a third wave - his comments could be also be clearing the way for more UK/EU vaccine co-operation, and the dousing down of an inflammatory row with Brussels.\nThe latest point of contention between the UK and the EU appears to be over vaccine doses being manufactured at a plant in the Netherlands.\nAn EU official told Reuters news agency that those doses should be distributed among member states, and not sent to Britain."

      "tags": "Medical research,Warwick,Flu,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The virus that causes the common cold can effectively boot the Covid virus out of the body's cells, say researchers. \nSome viruses are known to compete in order to be the one that causes an infection.\nAnd University of Glasgow scientists say it appears cold-causing rhinovirus trumps coronavirus.\nThe benefits might be short-lived but rhinovirus is so widespread, they add, it could still help to suppress Covid. \nThink of the cells in your nose, throat and lungs as being like a row of houses. Once a virus gets inside, it can either hold the door open to let in other viruses, or it can nail the door shut and keep its new home to itself. \nInfluenza is one of the most selfish viruses around, and nearly always infects alone. Others, such as adenoviruses, seem to be more up for a houseshare.\nThere has been much speculation about how the virus that causes Covid, known as Sars-CoV-2, would fit into the mysterious world of \"virus-virus interactions\".\nThe challenge for scientists is that a year of social distancing has slowed the spread of all viruses and made it much harder to study. \nThe team at the Centre for Virus Research in Glasgow used a replica of the lining of our airways, made out of the same types of cells, and infected it with Sars-CoV-2 and rhinovirus, which is one of the most widespread infections in people, and a cause of the common cold.\nIf rhinovirus and Sars-CoV-2 were released at the same time, only rhinovirus is successful. If rhinovirus had a 24-hour head start then Sars-CoV-2 does not get a look in. And even when Sars-CoV-2 had 24-hours to get started, rhinovirus boots it out. \n\"Sars-CoV-2 never takes off, it is heavily inhibited by rhinovirus,\" Dr Pablo Murcia told BBC News. \nHe added: \"This is absolutely exciting because if you have a high prevalence of rhinovirus, it could stop new Sars-CoV-2 infections.\"\nSimilar effects have been seen before. A large rhinovirus outbreak  may have delayed the 2009 swine flu pandemic in parts of Europe.\nFurther experiments showed rhinovirus was triggering an immune response inside the infected cells, which blocked the ability of Sars-CoV-2 to make copies of itself. \nWhen scientists blocked the immune response, then levels of the Covid virus were the same as if rhinovirus was not there. \nHowever, Covid would be able to cause an infection again once the cold had passed and the immune response calmed down.\nDr Murcia said: \"Vaccination, plus hygiene measures, plus the interactions between viruses could lower the incidence of Sars-CoV-2 heavily, but the maximum effect will come from vaccination.\"\nProf Lawrence Young, of Warwick Medical School, said human rhinoviruses, the most frequent cause of the common cold, were \"highly transmissible\".\nHe added that this study suggests \"that this common infection could impact the burden of Covid-19 and influence the spread of SarsCoV2, particularly over the autumn and winter months when seasonal colds are more frequent\".\nExactly how all this settles down in future winters is still unknown. Coronavirus is likely to still be around, and all the other infections that have been suppressed during the pandemic could bounce back as immunity to them wanes.  \nDr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, has already warned of a \"hard winter\" as a result. \n\"We could see surges in flu. We could see surges in other respiratory viruses and other respiratory pathogens,\" she said,\nThe results have been published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.\nFollow James on Twitter"

We must put the politics aside on these things, and we must recognise this problem, acknowledge it, and we must fix it.\"\nHe has previously been criticised for his response, including for declining to meet protesters last week. He had invited march leaders to meet him in parliament, but they rejected the offer saying they would not meet \"behind closed doors\".\nQuestions over the government's handling of the crisis were once again raised after backbench government MP Michelle Landry said  she \"felt sorry\" for the fired aide.\nBut cabinet minister Karen Andrews told reporters her \"conscience will no longer allow me to remain quiet\" over sexism in Australian politics, saying gender quotas for political representatives should be considered - something Mr Morrison indicated he would not be entirely opposed to.\n\"We tried it the other way and it isn't getting us the results so I would like to see us do better on that front,\" he told reporters. \nLabor, the opposition party, already have quotas in place.\nThere has long been allegations of bullying and harassment in Australian politics. However, Ms Higgins' allegations have shone a spotlight on sexual assault and sexism.\nIn the days after she went public with her story, more allegations emerged - with Attorney General Christian Porter revealing he was the subject of a 1988 rape allegation.\nHe denies the allegation, and police closed the investigation because of a lack of evidence.\nMs Higgins' former boss, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds, was also forced to apologise and pay compensation to her former aide, after calling her a \"lying cow\". \nCritics say the government has also been too slow and ineffective in responding to wider accusations of sexism and misogyny in parliamentary culture - a problem they say extends across party lines.\nThe Labor opposition has said it would review its culture after dozens of anonymous allegations of sexual harassment and sexism against male figures within its party.\nIn his press briefing, the prime minister acknowledged widespread criticism of his own statements in the past two months.\nThese included a backlash over him invoking his role as a husband and father while discussing his response to an alleged assault. \nAnother involved him being accused of setting a low bar for democracy when he said of the protests: \"Not far from here, such marches, even now are being met with bullets, but not here in this country.\"\nOn Tuesday, he acknowledged \"many had not liked or appreciated\" his comments, but insisted he was committed to driving broad cultural change.\nBut moments afterwards, Mr Morrison drew criticism for publicly airing a previously unreported sexual harassment complaint at a media organisation. \nOpponents accused him of \"weaponising\" the complaint following a standard question from a reporter at  the outlet, Sky News Australia.\n\"What about the woman at the heart of that complaint now? National news,\" said Labor Senator Katy Gallagher."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nOn what's being called a day of reflection, people across the country are being asked to stand on their doorsteps with candles or torches at 20:00 GMT. It'll happen as the UK's landmark buildings, from the London Eye to Cardiff Castle, are lit up in yellow. Organiser Marie Curie, the end-of-life charity, wants to create a \"beacon of remembrance\" for the 126,172 people who've died with Covid. We'll bring you live updates this evening. And you can read tributes to some of those who've died. \nAt midday, the nation fell silent for a minute to remember those who've died, with the Queen reflecting on the \"grief and loss felt by so many\". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who observed the silence privately, praised the \"great spirit\" shown since the first lockdown. Later, he told a Downing Street briefing \"we've suffered so many losses\" in the last year, made more acute because people have not been able to see loved ones in their final days. One day the country will have a fitting memorial to everyone who has died, he added.\nDeaths in the UK have fallen below the five-year average for the first time since the summer. Experts say it means the winter wave of Covid deaths has ended - and lockdown and the vaccine rollout have saved lives. But they're still urging caution as social distancing is relaxed, particularly given the threat posed by new variants.\nA Banksy painting depicting a young boy playing with a superhero nurse doll has raised more than \u00a316m for NHS charities after being sold at auction. Game Changer, by the anonymous graffiti artist, appeared in a foyer at Southampton General Hospital during the first wave of the pandemic. Watch its unveiling below, and hear what hospital workers made of it.\nWe've been asking you to share the last \"normal\" picture you took ahead of a life-changing period for all of us. Just days before the first lockdown, Aga McPherson, from Canterbury, Kent, took this picture with her friend Fran Levy in the pub. \"I remember we were singing karaoke that night, and not worrying about any social distancing or passing germs,\" she says. \"It was a nice, relaxing evening and we were happy.\"  You can see more photos here.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "title": "Coronavirus: Third wave will 'wash up on our shores', warns Johnson",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has warned the effects of a third wave of coronavirus will \"wash up on our shores\" from Europe.\nThe PM said the UK should be \"under no illusion\" we will \"feel effects\" of growing cases on the continent. \nOne of his ministers, Lord Bethell, also warned the UK might put \"all our European neighbours\" on the red list of countries, where arrivals are either banned or put in quarantine hotels. \nThe comments come amid a row over Covid-19 vaccine supplies in the EU.\nThe president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen has warned the EU could \"forbid\" doses made in the bloc from being exported to the UK.\nEU leaders will hold a virtual meeting on Thursday to discuss their plans.  \nOfficials confirmed the PM spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday about the ongoing issue, which would affect exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made in Europe. \nMr Johnson said he \"talked to EU friends repeatedly\" during the pandemic and had been \"reassured... over the last few month they don't want to see blockades\".\nDowning Street also said President von der Leyen, had told Mr Johnson earlier this year that the EU was not intending to restrict exports of vaccines.\nEU legislation allows measures to be taken \"if severe difficulties arise in the supply of certain products\" - which, in theory, could include export bans and the waiving of patent and intellectual property rights on vaccines.\nBut earlier, Mrs von der Leyen's chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, insisted that Brussels was not seeking to ban vaccine exports, but wanted pharmaceutical firms to meet their contractual obligations to the bloc.\nMr Mamer said: \"In that context, the president has said that, of course, we see that, actually, companies that manufacture doses in the EU have been exporting very widely - which is in itself a good thing - but that we want to see reciprocity and proportionality in these exports.\"\nAsked if he was worried about the row, Mr Johnson told reporters: \"I am reassured by talking to EU partners over the last few months that they don't want to see blockades.\"\nBut he went on to issue a warning about what the growing infections in Europe could mean for the UK.\nThe PM said: \"On the continent right now you can see, sadly, there is a third wave under way.\n\"And people in this country should be under no illusions that previous experience has taught us that when a wave hits our friends, I'm afraid it washes up on our shores as well.\"\nHe added: \"I expect we will feel those effects in due course. That's why we're getting on with our vaccination programme as fast as we can.\"\nLater, Health Minister Lord Bethell warned how the rising cases and issues with vaccines could affect travel to European countries going forward. \nHe told the House of Lords: \"I don't know how that will play out and it's certainly above my pay grade to speculate, but we are all aware that the possibility lies that will have to red list all of our European neighbours - but that would be done with huge regret.\" \nOn Monday, the UK reported 17 deaths over the last 24 hours of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 28 days. \nA further 5,342 cases were also confirmed, while another 367,006 people received their first vaccination - along with 52,612 who got their second jab. \nMeanwhile, the long-awaited results of the US trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which involved more than 32,000 volunteers, show that the jab is safe and highly effective.\nSeveral European leaders paused rollout of the vaccine amid concerns of a possible link with blood clots. UK and EU regulators said there was no evidence the vaccine causes blood clots.\nEuropean leaders have faced criticism for the slow pace of the vaccine rollout on the continent.\nLess than 12% of the EU's population is reported to have received the vaccine, compared with nearly 40% in the UK - although the bloc has 446 million citizens, compared to almost 67 million in the UK.\nThe EU has encountered production problems with the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines.\nBritish-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca said the fact that EU contracts were signed later than with the UK caused problems with supplying their vaccine.\nDowning Street has previously said that it does not believe that vaccine supply issues will affect the current road map for easing lockdown restrictions.\nIrish Taoiseach Michael Martin said it is vital that supply chains were kept open, telling RTE: \"Once you start putting up the barriers, other people start putting up barriers globally and it could lead to everybody losing. We'd all lose in that situation.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer also said the UK government was right to say that contractual obligations need to be honoured, telling LBC that the EU was not \"helping itself\".\nThe Guardian says a report by data analysts Airfinity suggests that if an export ban was applied to all vaccines - including those from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson that have yet to be deployed in the UK - it would see the offer of a first vaccine to every adult completed in late August rather than the target date of 31 July.\nBut Mr Johnson said the UK had already vaccinated over half of the adults in the country, adding: \"We'll just bash on with the road map we've set out.\" \nThe prospect of a third coronavirus wave won't engulf anyone with joy. So why did Boris Johnson highlight this danger today?\nPrivately and publicly ministers are making it clear that they don't want to delay the dates in England's roadmap out of lockdown.\nThere will be a vote in Parliament on coronavirus restrictions later this week. \nSo by stressing the risk that the virus still poses, the PM may be hoping to convince restless backbenchers that he can't go any quicker. \nHe may also be trying to persuade vaccinated people with itchy feet that booking spring or summer holidays would still be premature.\nHe is preparing us, too, for the strong possibility that cases could rise in the coming weeks - not just because of \"incoming\" risks, but because rules here are being slowly relaxed.\nBut by stressing the shared threat from the coronavirus - i.e. the sooner the EU population is vaccinated, the less chance of importing a third wave - his comments could be also be clearing the way for more UK/EU vaccine co-operation, and the dousing down of an inflammatory row with Brussels.\nThe latest point of contention between the UK and the EU appears to be over vaccine doses being manufactured at a plant in the Netherlands.\nAn EU official told Reuters news agency that those doses should be distributed among member states, and not sent to Britain."

      "tags": "Employment,Banking,Goldman Sachs",
      "text": "The chief executive of Goldman Sachs says it's \"great\" a group of young analysts raised concerns about working conditions at the investment firm.\nA group of 13 US employees mocked up a presentation in which they told of 95-hour working weeks and \"inhumane\" conditions amounting to abuse.\nBoss David Solomon said in a message: \"It's great that this group of analysts went to their management.\"\nBut he added that going an \"extra mile\" can make a big difference for the bank.\nIn his address to the investment bank's 34,000 staff worldwide, Mr Solomon said he expected Goldman to continue to face high demand from clients and emphasised the need to meet the challenge, saying hard work brought rewards.\n\"Just remember: if we all go an extra mile for our client, even when we feel that we're reaching our limit, it can really make a difference in our performance,\" he said.\nThe analysts sent their complaints to bosses in February, but it only became public last week.\nMr Solomon said: \"We want a workplace where people can share concerns freely... If there are any issues, do not hesitate to reach out to ask for help.\" He promised to improve working conditions at the firm.\nMr Solomon said: \"I can imagine that many of you saw the presentation that a group of analysts shared with their management recently about their lack of work-life balance.\n\"This is something that our leadership team and I take very seriously.\" He pledged to enforce its \"Saturday rule\" to ring-fence junior bankers' time off from Friday evening into Sunday morning. \nThe world of investment banking is notorious for placing high demands on its employees, with remote working during the pandemic further blurring the lines between the office and home. \nAt Citi, the fourth largest bank in the US, new boss Jane Fraser recently sent a memo designating Zoom-free Fridays and reminding staff to try to schedule calls within traditional working hours.\nShe also added a company-wide holiday at the end of May, citing \"the need for a reset\".\n\"I know, from your feedback and my own experience, the blurring of lines between home and work and the relentlessness of the pandemic workday have taken a toll on our well-being,\" she wrote in the memo. \"It's simply not sustainable.\n\"Please try to limit scheduling calls outside of what had been traditional working hours pre-pandemic and on weekends\u2002(remember those?)\u2002We are of course a global company that operates across time zones, but when our work regularly spills over into nights, very early mornings and weekends, it can prevent us from recharging fully, and that isn't good for you nor, ultimately, for Citi.\"\nShe told staff to speak up \"if you need more time for a reset.\u2002It's not a sign of weakness; we are all feeling the weariness\".\nThe long hours and high pressures of investment banking were thrown into focus in 2015 when a 22-year-old Goldman analyst, Sarvshreshth Gupta, took his own life after complaining of working 100 hours a week and working all night.\nThe 13 Goldman Sachs employees gave striking testimony, which began circulating on social media on Wednesday, detailing five hours sleep a night, harsh treatment by senior bankers and the effects on their physical and mental health. One said: \"I've been through foster care and this is arguably worse.\"\n\"This is beyond the level of 'hard-working', this is inhumane/abuse,\" said another. \nGoldman is far from the only firm where staff are reporting burnout, as the pandemic blurs work-life boundaries.\nNearly 90% of workers say their work-life balance is getting worse, according to a recent survey published by the Harvard Business Review of 1,500 people across 46 countries.\nGoldman said last week in the light of the findings going viral that it had since taken steps to address employee burnout among this small group, and among wider teams.\nMr Solomon's address to staff said: \"We're accelerating our efforts to hire new junior bankers across investment banking and we're internally transferring bankers to business lines where activity levels are highest.\" \nHe added the firm was trying to manage its workload and reorganise some so it would be done automatically:. \"We're also being more selective about business opportunities that we pursue, and we're working to automate certain tasks in our business.\"\nThe investment bank reported net revenues of $44.6bn (\u00a332.1bn) for 2020.

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A \u00a35,000 fine for anyone in England trying to travel abroad without good reason is due to come into force next week as part of new coronavirus laws.\nThe penalty is included in legislation that will be voted on by MPs on Thursday. \nForeign holidays are currently not allowed under the \"stay at home\" rule which ends on Monday.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said it was \"too early\" to set out new foreign travel rules for the summer.\nMr Johnson told a Downing Street news conference he hoped for more information by 5 April.\nHe said: \"A lot of people do want to know about what's going to happen on the holiday front and I know there's a great deal of curiosity and interest.\"\nFrom next week the ban on leaving the UK will become a specific law, backed up by the threat of a fine.\nUnder the current plan for easing restrictions, the earliest date people in England could go abroad for a holiday would be 17 May.\nIt comes as another surge in Covid cases in continental Europe, as well as the slow rollout of vaccines across Europe, casts doubt on the resumption of holidays abroad.\nThe PM's announcement on travelling abroad from England will be made sooner than expected - a taskforce looking into the issue had been scheduled to report back by 12 April. \nBut it is understood the timings in the roadmap for easing lockdown - including the 17 May date - will remain unchanged.\nGovernment adviser Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's World at One border measures should be relaxed more slowly than domestic restrictions.\nHe said: \"I think conservatively, and being risk averse at the moment, I think we should be planning on summer holidays in the UK not overseas.\"\nProf Ferguson also criticised the exemptions that currently permit foreign travel and suggested everybody should be subject to mandatory testing when arriving into the UK.\nLegally-permitted reasons for foreign travel currently include work, volunteering, education, medical needs, and to attend weddings or funerals. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said restrictions on travelling abroad for leisure were necessary to guard against the importation of large numbers of cases and new variants which might put the vaccine rollout at risk. \nShadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said Labour supported measures to keep the UK's borders secure and avoid the importation of new variants but criticised the government's \"slowness to react\".\nAirlines UK, which represents big carriers, called for a \"tiered system, based on risk\" and confirmed airlines were working with government to restart international travel safely from 17 May.\nHarriet, 31, and her fianc\u00e9 Chris, 30, had planned a wedding abroad in Ibiza last September. As the pandemic took hold, they decided to play safe and reschedule for 17 June 2021.\nBut the announcement of new travel regulations has thrown their revised plans into doubt.\n\"We have 100 guests due to fly out to Ibiza for our wedding in June and once again, people will have to spend even more money on moving it,\" she tells BBC News.\n\"The lack of clarity from the government and mixed messages that were released over the weekend are abysmal.\"\nHarriet points out that she went to Greece on holiday last summer without restrictions - and with more mass testing available now \"how can we possibly be in a worse-off situation than we were last year?\"\nOne government minister, Lord Bethell, said England might put \"all our European neighbours\" on the \"red list\" of countries. \nHowever, Mr Hancock denied there were plans to do this. \nPeople from those countries are currently not allowed to travel to the UK, with the exception of British nationals and people who are normally resident in the UK - but those two groups must pay to quarantine in a hotel if they do choose to come at the moment.\nThe \"red list\" was introduced as part of travel regulations aimed at stopping Covid variants entering the country and is regularly reviewed, meaning countries are added or removed depending on their Covid situation.\nThe government's global travel taskforce is considering a tiered or traffic light system for international travel when the ban on leaving the country is lifted. \nThe discussion is focusing on what restrictions would apply to travellers returning from destinations in the lowest level. \nThe intention is to publish the framework on 12 April, with decisions about which countries are in which tier to be taken later. \nTesting for children who travel is being considered because coronavirus vaccines are not currently approved for under-18s.\nThe new coronavirus laws, due to be introduced on Monday, suggest anyone who leaves England for a destination outside the UK without a reasonable excuse, such as for work, education or medical treatment, could face a \u00a35,000 fine.\nAnyone travelling abroad has to fill in a \"Declaration to Travel\" form, stating a valid reason for leaving the country, such as education, work or childcare.\nEngland's travel ban does not apply to those going to or from the common travel area of the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland unless that is not the final destination.\nThe UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions.\nThe earliest date people from Scotland and Wales will be able to go on holiday abroad is, like England, 17 May, while Northern Ireland has not yet announced its own plans."

      "text": "Deaths in the UK have fallen below the five-year average for the first time since the summer.\nExperts say it means the winter wave of Covid deaths has ended and lockdown and the vaccine rollout have saved lives.\nIn the week up to 12 March, 14% of all deaths involved Covid, compared with 44% at the 22 January peak, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show.\nIn January, Covid deaths drove overall mortality in the UK 40% higher than the average seen between 2015 and 2019.\nThere have been more than 145,000 deaths involving Covid in the UK since the first lockdown, a year ago.\nDuring the first wave of the virus, tens of thousands of Covid deaths meant many more people were dying overall than during the same months in previous years.\nThe first lockdown brought cases down - but it took longer for this to translate to a fall in deaths.  \nFollowing this lockdown, and in the warmer weather from late June until the beginning of August, deaths dipped back below the five-year average.\nBut after the first week of August, they again began to rise above levels expected for the time of year.\nAnd they remained above expected levels every week since - with the exception of the week ending 4 September, which was skewed by delays in reporting because of the August Bank Holiday - until the second week in March, which saw them fall 5% below the average.\nThis time we have a tool we did not have previously, though, in the form of vaccines.\nProf Neil Ferguson, director of the Medical Research Council Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, at Imperial College London, said: \"The new ONS data on deaths is encouraging in suggesting the second devastating wave of the pandemic is behind us. \n\"But calling epidemics 'waves' can be misleading in implying a phenomenon which has reached a natural end - that is not the case here. \n\"The rapid decline in deaths we have thankfully seen is entirely because of the lockdown and the rapid rollout of vaccines. \n\"So while I'm optimistic that this we will be able to return to something more like normal in the next few months, we need to remain vigilant and cautious in the pace with which social distancing is relaxed - particularly given the threat still posed by new variants of the virus.\""

In the UK, the period will be 31 days though that can be extended to 45 days for movies \"that open to an agreed upon  box-office threshold\".\n\"This agreement shows the studio's commitment to the theatrical business and we see this agreement as an important milestone in our 100-year relationship with Warner Bros,\" said Cineworld chief executive Mooky Greidinger.\nGodzilla vs. Kong, starring English actress Millie Bobby Brown, will start showing on 2 April in the US in a phased reopening of Cineworld's Regal theatres. It will be followed by Mortal Kombat, the movie based on the hugely popular computer game, on 16 April.\nThe company said it also plans to reopen in the UK - which is its second biggest market - in May, \"in line with current government guidance\".\nThe cinema industry has been one of the worst hit sectors during the pandemic with many theatres closed for extended periods or operating at reduced capacity.\nGlobal box office takings in 2020 fell by more than 70% from the previous year to $12.4bn, according film technology firm Gower Street Analytics.\nMajor releases such as the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, have been delayed a number of times because of Covid. \nThe much-anticipated sci-fi movie Dune, starring Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, was originally slated to be released in December 2020, but is now set to premiere in October 2021."

      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been cleared of breaking rules during an investigation into her predecessor, Alex Salmond, but she's been criticised in a separate report by MSPs.\nAn independent report found that Ms Sturgeon did not breach the ministerial code during the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints against Mr Salmond. \nHowever, a separate inquiry by MSPs has described the government's actions as \"deeply flawed\", and questioned some of Ms Sturgeon's evidence. \nThe pair dominated Scottish politics for more than a decade. They led the campaign for Scotland to become independent from the UK. \nAlex Salmond was Scotland's first minister and Scottish National Party leader before Ms Sturgeon, who had been his deputy. She took over after the 2014 independence referendum, which saw Scotland back remaining in the UK by 55% to 45%. \nThe row began when allegations of sexual harassment - strongly denied - were made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants in 2018.\nThe complaints were made after Ms Sturgeon asked for new government policies on sexual harassment to be put in place in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Mr Salmond believed the policy was aimed at him.  \nThe Scottish government eventually admitted it had acted unlawfully. It had to pay Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000.\nMr Salmond has accused officials close to Ms Sturgeon - including her husband Peter Murrell, the SNP's chief executive - of plotting against him. They all deny these claims.\nThen, in January 2019, Mr Salmond was arrested and charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, including attempted rape.\nMr Salmond was cleared of all 13 charges - which were alleged to have happened while he was first minister - after a trial last March. \nThe nine women who made the allegations included an SNP politician, a party worker and several current and former Scottish government civil servants and officials. \nIn court, Mr Salmond said the claims made about his alleged conduct were \"deliberate fabrications for a political purpose\", or \"exaggerations\".\nAfter being acquitted, he said there was \"certain information\" he had been unable to talk about during the trial, but which would \"see the light of day\" in the future. \nHe has since claimed there was a \"deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort\" from some in the Scottish government and leading SNP figures to damage him and even have him sent to prison.\nMs Sturgeon has accused him of peddling false conspiracy theories and suggested her predecessor is angry because she \"did not collude with him\" to make the sexual harassment allegations \"go away\". \nFollowing the trial, two separate inquiries began. One was by a committee of MSPs and the other by James Hamilton, Ireland's former director of public prosecutions.\nMr Hamilton's inquiry looked at whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave. It examined whether she had interfered with the civil service investigation into the allegations against Mr Salmond, or misled parliament about what she knew and when.\nThis report cleared Ms Sturgeon of breaching the ministerial code, but said it was up to parliament to decide whether she had misled them.\nSeparately, the committee of MSPs examined the Scottish government's handling of the initial complaints against Mr Salmond. \nIts report said the Scottish government's actions had been \"seriously flawed\". \nMSPs on the committee voted by five to four that Ms Sturgeon misled their inquiry during her marathon evidence session earlier this month. \nThe committee also said the female civil servants who had made the complaints against Mr Salmond had been badly let down by the government.\nThe row has divided the SNP ahead of the Scottish Parliament election on 6 May, with some prominent MPs and many grassroots activists openly backing Mr Salmond. \nSome opinion polls have suggested that the fallout could threaten the SNP's hopes of winning an overall majority in the election - although it remains on course to once again finish as the largest party.\nPanorama on Salmond v Sturgeon is available on BBC iplayer."

      "text": "Fourteen people have been arrested at a second night of protests in Bristol, police have said. \nOn Tuesday about 130 people demonstrating against the government's new Police and Crime Bill gathered at College Green.\nIt comes two days after another protest in the city turned violent, injuring several police officers. \nOne witness said the police had been \"quite heavy-handed\", which was \"shocking to see\".\nAvon and Somerset Police said the gathering had \"the making of a rave or a party rather than a protest\" and that it had to act due to lockdown restrictions.\nOne of those arrested was in connection with the disorder on Sunday, while others were arrested for offences including breaches of Covid-19 legislation and obstruction of a highway.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said there was \"no acceptability\" for \"criminality and thuggish behaviour\".\n\"Protests are unlawful right now and quite frankly we have just seen more criminality and violent behaviour, which is simply unacceptable,\" Ms Patel said.\n\"We live in a democracy and obviously we uphold the right to protest but we're in the pandemic and I would urge people to continue to follow the rules and guidance.\"\nThere were between 200 and 250 people at the peak of the protest on Tuesday afternoon, which had been peaceful, with some of those intending to sleep in tents overnight.\nProtesters said they were unhappy about an element of the Police and Crime Bill, which would ban residing on any private or public land in vehicles without permission where they are causing \"significant disruption, distress or harm to local communities\".\nJournalist Martin Booth, who attended the protest for the Bristol 24/7 website, said he believed police had been \"quite heavy-handed\" against protesters. \n\"Some of them were sitting down as the police waded in and it was quite shocking to see,\" he said. \n\"These protesters may have been there against the law but they were not spoiling for any fight, from my perspective.\"\nBut, the force said, like on Sunday, it only took action after dark when people ignored instructions to leave.  \nCh Supt Claire Armes said: \"We will always attract opposing and differing views in these situations but we have successfully cleared the area and minimised any disruption to the city of Bristol.\"\nEarlier, she said protesters had \"insulted\" Bristol's communities, who \"have made too many sacrifices and worked so hard\" to defeat coronavirus. \nAvon and Somerset Police Chief Constable Andy Marsh said: \"It had the making of a rave or a party rather than a protest...we would be having a very different conversation if we had allowed 200 people to set-up a camp on college green with music, food stalls, and human excrement.\n\"We have a duty to uphold the law and stop the risk of a third wave.\" \nOfficers from British Transport Police, Devon and Cornwall, Dorset, Dyfed Powys, Gloucestershire, Gwent and Wiltshire forces were drafted in to help.\nIn a tweet, police said officers had attempted to engage with demonstrators earlier in the evening and asked them to move on.\n\"It's disappointing we needed to take this action on a day we remember those who've lost their lives,\" the force said earlier, referring to the anniversary of the first national lockdown. \nAndrew Plant, BBC Points West \nIt's the second time in three days that we've seen riot police on the streets of Bristol. \nSunday felt very hostile - this didn't. There were lots of things being thrown on Sunday - bottles flying over people's heads and riot police were really under attack. \nThis, the police had under control by going in quite hard, I think it's fair to say. \nThey said they've done that because these gatherings under Covid law are illegal so they felt they need to move people on.\nThey had asked people earlier in the day to leave and disperse and when those people didn't engage, this happened. \nBut it wasn't Sunday, it was very different.\nThe national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales said his colleagues in the city felt \"under siege\".\nJohn Apter said: \"I really feel for my colleagues in Bristol. There is a sense that you really feel under siege. And for some, whatever they [police officers] do, is not enough and for others, it's too much.\n\"My colleagues are battered and bruised, in some cases physically. We've got a number of officers who were injured on Sunday evening, some very seriously. \n\"This is completely unacceptable.\"\nShortly before 23:00 GMT, police said protesters had been moved off College Green but that a \"significant number\" remained on Deanery Road \"and continue to refuse to leave the area\".\nThe force tweeted: \"Officers will take proportionate action to disperse crowds. They are not containing anyone and we continue to urge people to move on.\"\nA YouTube livestream appearing to be from the demonstration showed large numbers of police with some officers on horseback and others with dogs lined up.\nShouts of \"our streets\" and \"shame on you\" could be heard.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Avon and Somerset Police released images of 10 people it wants to trace over Sunday's disorder.\nIt has since arrested a total of nine people in relation to that day's events and said it was investigating assaults on 40 police officers and one journalist. \nCh Supt Carolyn Belafonte said the investigation will be \"substantial\" and \"has the potential to be one of the largest\" in the force's history.\nFollowing medical assessments on two officers taken to hospital at the weekend, neither suffered broken bones. \nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Some experts, however, said that the choice of location was misguided.\nAt the chancellor's recent Budget, emphasis was also placed on investment in the life sciences, clean energy and technology industries. \nMr Sunak announced the creation of a national infrastructure bank that would mainly invest in green projects ahead of the COP26 climate change summit in the UK later in November."

A woman was found dead at the scene.\nThey were then called to a house at Glenville Road, where a second woman was found dead and Ken Flanagan was found unconscious. He subsequently died. \nSam Lillie, the father of Ms Knell's child, told BBC News NI he had contacted social services and the PSNI earlier on Friday because of concerns about his child.\nHe said he had had a \"really bad feeling something bad was going to happen\".\n\"I never, ever predicted it would be this,\" he added.\n\"As you know the police can't do anything unless somebody does something.\n\"I knew that even before I went to the police station, so I knew I was wasting my time going there, but I did what they told me to do.\"\nMr Lillie said social services had taken what he said \"seriously\" and that they had said they would contact Ms Knell on Monday. \nPolice have confirmed they received a report of concern for the safety of a child on Friday, 19 March.\n\"Following review, there was no evidence of immediate concern for the child's safety and the caller was provided with advice in respect of the matter,\" said Ch Supt Davy Beck.\nWhen contacted, the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust said it was unable to comment at this stage, due to confidentiality issues and an ongoing police investigation.\nNorth Belfast MLA Paula Bradley suggested that, given what had happened, the system was not working.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster on Monday, she said: \"We have a system that requires hard evidence before police or social services will step in to try and divert.\n\"That whole early intervention service is something that we need in place to assist the police and social services.\n\"For that young man who went forward to police, he obviously is devastated that the actions he took were not heard or not acted upon.\"\nMs Bradley also called for a gender-based strategy to deal with violence against women and girls.\n\"We also need to see a shift in our judiciary when it comes to handing out the maximum tariffs for anyone who has been found guilty of any form of domestic abuse,\" she said.\n\"There needs to be a bigger shift in just how we deal with violence against women and girls.\"\nIn the assembly on Monday, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said legislation was needed that would make misogyny a hate crime. \nJustice Minister Naomi Long said she hoped to put a paper before the NI Executive this week on a strategy to protect women and girls from violence.\nNorthern Ireland is the only part of the UK without a specific strategy.\n\"We must as a society do all we can to erode sexism and protect women. We must do it for Stacey and Karen and their families, and for the many other victims that should have been protected in our society but weren't,\" said Ms Mallon.\nUlster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said there was \"far too much violence\" in society against women. \n\"What do we say to our young daughters? What do we say to our wives, our mothers, our sisters, particularly as men in Northern Ireland? \n\"We have to acknowledge the fact that we have a significant problem, and we have to deal with it.\"\nTUV leader Jim Allister said there was a need for a \"great change of attitude where a resort to violence isn't readily taken\".\n\"This past weekend is yet another tragic example of that,\" he added.\nSinn F\u00e9in Mid Ulster MLA Linda Dillon said it was a problem for \"entire communities\". \n\"It is a problem that we all need to deal with. But we're not only talking about domestic abuse. \n\"We're talking about violence against women and girls in every facet, whether that's within their home, on the streets, in the workplace, in their place of education, or wherever it may be, we have to deal with this issue.\"\nMrs Long said it was an \"absolute tragedy\" to see women losing their lives to violence in Northern Ireland. \nSpeaking on Sunday, she said early intervention was needed to tackle \"offending behaviours\" in the perpetrators of violence."

It's all the questions that go around your head.\"\nMrs Williams, from Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, helped set up the group after losing her husband Mark, 58, at the start of the pandemic. \nShe said: \"He was fit and well, and a kayaker. The media message wasn't right (at the start of the pandemic), saying it was mainly old and overweight people.\n\"It has helped me, and others in the group, knowing others feel the same. \n\"We are taking everything at our own pace and we are going to light up Wales to remember.\"\n\"My dad isn't coming back so that's what's been really, really hard,\" said Bethan Hayes, who lost her 59-year-old father Keith to Covid in January.\n\"He really was my world, my best friend,\" said the 29-year-old from Barry.\n\"Since this has happened, my world's just been torn into two.\"\nShe is calling on people to take part in the day of reflection with yellow hearts.\n\"I really do think this initiative is amazing,\" she said.\n\"I want the yellow heart to now be like the new symbol... so when we look at the rainbow, we see that's about the NHS and positivity and hope.\"\nKirsty Fox-Smith, from Rogerstone, Newport, has been making yellow hearts for members of the Covid-19 Families Wales group after losing her dad, Andrew Payne, 58, in January. \nMr Payne had a number of health issues after having a kidney transplant and diabetes, and told his family he was in the \"prime box\" if he caught it. \nHowever, they vowed to make sure he did not, which made it a shock when he died.\n\"Every window upstairs [in my house] that faces on to the road has hearts, which light up every day,\" Mrs Fox-Smith said.\n\"Every neighbour on the whole row, eight houses, have yellow hearts as well. Dad lived on the same estate and everyone is gutted.\"\nRhondda Cynon Taf has been the worst hit local authority in Wales, with 339.8 deaths per 100,000 people compared with a rate of 196.4 across the country.\nTonyrefail has been particularly badly affected, with it having the most deaths of Wales' 400 localities, and is second overall once population is taken into account.\nBut adversity has brought the community together, with resident Dawn Parkin saying: \"They have all come together like a territorial army. I'm an Army officer, and they really have been like troops on the ground.\"\nWhen Covid hit and the community centre closed, her garage became the local foodbank helping hundreds, before people started donating clothes, prams, anything for those who could not get out. \nResidents then started coming up with ideas to keep spirits up - such as a Tonyrefail Bake Off competition, and cooking nights, where people would all buy the same ingredients and create meals at home following the same instructions.\nIt has helped keep spirits up, with funeral director Huw Parkman saying at the peak of the outbreak he would have up to 20 services a week to organise.\n\"Some of these funerals would've had several hundred people there,\" he said. \n\"The death of a person in their 40s and 50s could be the hardest ones, because only immediate family could go, which can leave loved ones behind.\"\nJames Thomas' burger van Beefy's Baps did not qualify for any government grants as it is a relatively new business, so instead, he decided to focus his energies on helping people. \n\"It spiralled and I was soon covering all of Tonyrefail and Gilfach Goch,\" Mr Thomas said. \n\"About 3,600 meals we've given for free, including in local nursing homes.\"\nIn total, he has helped raise \u00a316,000 in donations, which funded selection boxes for children at Christmas, \u00a33,000 for homeless charities, plus Easter eggs for children's charities.\n\"It's really important for the older people who weren't getting to see anyone. Speaking to some, they were saying it [lockdown] didn't make any difference as they weren't seeing anyone anyway. But for others it made a massive difference,\" he added.\n\"It's been bad in a lot of ways with a lot of deaths. A lot of people I know have died, but a lot about it [how people have come together] has been really good. \n\"I keep thinking 'are we going to stop' [with the free meals], but we just can't.\"\nMeanwhile, two communities in north Wales - Llandudno Junction South and Llasanffraid Glan Conwy, and Rhyl South West - have registered no deaths at all with Covid during the past 12 months.\nLuck and following lockdown rules has helped keep the virus out of Llansanffraid Glan Conwy, according to local pub and cafe owner Sylvia Hughes.\n\"We've been one of the lucky ones, on the whole,\" said Ms Hughes, who runs the Cross Keys pub and Caffi Llan in the village.\n\"It is partly down to how well most people have complied with rules in the village, like no mass parties or gatherings.\n\"We've had the odd little Covid incident but nothing major.\"\nHowever Ms Hughes said the restrictions were \"a nightmare\" for her businesses and many were hoping for \"normality\" soon.\nSharon Hutton owns the Sunrize tanning salon in Rhyl South West, and said she felt \"everyone had really come together\" throughout the lockdowns.\n\"Housing estates were doing social distancing bingo on drive ways at one point, people organising zoom calls and virtual quizzes - everyone has been trying to be as united as possible,\" she said.\nThe 58-year-old said while it had been \"frustrating\" as a salon owner, she had seen new interest from customers who want to \"feel good\" and \"get back to normality\".\nShe said phone calls with customers showed many people were \"itching\" to get out into the town again.\nTwo weeks ago, Wales passed the threshold for \"trigger\" figures for a lockdown, with its case rate and test positivity rate.\nCurrently Wales has an average weekly case rate of 42 per 100,000 people in the population - below the 50 cases threshold, and its lowest point since 17 September last year.\nConfirmed and suspected cases are down to a fifth of Wales' record levels in late December and back to numbers last seen in September.\nThe number of people who have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine now stands at 1,273,186 - a rise of 14,417 on the previous day.\nOf that total, 346,058 people have now had a second dose.\nLatest figures show there were no new Covid admissions in both Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Swansea Bay hospitals on Monday.\nThe number of Covid patients in hospital beds in Wales stands at 749, according to NHS Wales figures -  and the daily average is the lowest since 21 October. \nWales' local authority with the highest case rates for the seven-day period up until 18 March remains Merthyr Tydfil at 111 cases per 100,000, although it has fallen from 121 the previous day.\nThe lowest case rates are seen in Ceredigion (11), Monmouthshire (down from 15.9 to 13.7) and Powys (15.1)."

      "text": "Covid-19 vaccines, vaccine passports and faked negative test papers are being sold on the darknet.\nPrices range between $500 (\u00a3360) and $750 for doses of AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Sinopharm or Johnson & Johnson jabs.\nFake vaccination certificates are also being sold by anonymous traders for as little as $150.\nResearchers say they have seen a \"sharp increase\" in vaccine-related darknet adverts, while the BBC has been unable to verify if the vaccines are real.\nThe darknet, also known as the dark web, is a portion of the internet that is only accessible through specific browser tools.\nResearchers at cyber-security company Check Point have monitored hacking forums and other marketplaces since January, when vaccine adverts first appeared.\nThey say the number of adverts they have seen has tripled to more than 1,200.\nSellers of vaccines appear to be from the US, UK, Spain, Germany, France and Russia.\u00a0 \nThe team found multiple adverts in Russian cyrillic text as well as in English.\nThe vaccines advertised include the Oxford-AstraZeneca at $500, and Johnson & Johnson and Sputnik each at $600, and Sinopharm at $750.\nOne seller is offering next-day delivery, saying: \"For overnight delivery/emergency leave us a message.\"'\nAnother advert on a hacking forum is offering fake negative tests and reads: \"We do negative Covid tests, for travellers abroad, for getting a job etc. Buy two negative tests and get the third for free!\"\nSome holiday operators require vaccination certificates for passengers.\nA vaccine passport system is also being considered in the UK and could be used to allow visitors entry to venues such as bars, or sports stadiums.\nEuropean officials have also announced plans for a \"Green Digital Certificate\". This would allow anyone vaccinated against Covid, or who has tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus, to travel within the EU.\nIt's no surprise then that faked documents are being offered on the darknet for sale.\nCheck Point investigators found many sellers offering forged documents, including one supposedly from the UK, with a vaccination card for $150 using the hard-to-trace cryptocurrency Bitcoin as the payment method.\nWhen they got in touch with the seller, the team were told that they just needed to provide their names and some dates for when the fake jabs occurred. The seller messaged: \"You don't have to worry\u2026it's our job\u2026.we have done this to many people and it's all good.\" \nOded Vanunu, head of product vulnerabilities research at Check Point said:\u00a0\"It's imperative for people to understand that attempting to obtain a vaccine, a vaccination card or negative Covid-19 test result by unofficial means is extremely risky, as hackers are more interested in your money, information and identity for exploitation.\"\nMr Vanunu also told the BBC that his team purchased a dose of the Sinopharm vaccine from a vendor for $750 as part of their research, but are yet to receive it.\nHis team has told the BBC that they believe this seller was a scammer, but say others may or may not be selling real vaccines. \nCheck Point is urging countries to adopt a QR code system across all vaccine documentation to make forgeries more difficult."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nA minute's silence will be held at midday as part of a day of reflection, marking one year since the start of the UK's first lockdown. After 12 months of restrictions on socialising, shopping and education, the UK's official Covid death toll stands at 126,172. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is offering condolences to the bereaved, while praising the \"great spirit\" shown by the nation.\nEven after coronavirus restrictions are lifted, there's likely to be a permanent shift in habits, a study for BBC News suggests. Some 40% of 2,200 people surveyed say they expect to walk more than before. Almost a third anticipate working from home more and doing more shopping locally, while 23% - 31% in London - say they will travel to work less than before.\nAnyone in England trying to travel abroad without good reason could be fined \u00a35,000 under a measure due to come into force next week as part of new coronavirus laws. Foreign holidays are currently not allowed under the \"stay at home\" rule, which ends on Monday. But MPs will vote on legislation that would back up the ban on leaving the UK with the threat of the fine.\nHaving a baby is challenging at the best of times, but the pandemic has made things particularly tough for parents of newborns. For the last 12 months, family and friends have been forced to keep their distance, with some relatives first catching a glimpse of new arrivals through windows.\nWhile coronavirus restrictions have been playing havoc with humans' travel plans, spare a thought for 14 Humboldt penguins from Curraghs Wildlife Park, on the Isle of Man. Their scheduled hop across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland's Exploris Aquarium ended up involving a detour through England and Scotland. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can remind yourself how rules change from next Monday.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Medical research,Warwick,Flu,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The virus that causes the common cold can effectively boot the Covid virus out of the body's cells, say researchers. \nSome viruses are known to compete in order to be the one that causes an infection.\nAnd University of Glasgow scientists say it appears cold-causing rhinovirus trumps coronavirus.\nThe benefits might be short-lived but rhinovirus is so widespread, they add, it could still help to suppress Covid. \nThink of the cells in your nose, throat and lungs as being like a row of houses. Once a virus gets inside, it can either hold the door open to let in other viruses, or it can nail the door shut and keep its new home to itself. \nInfluenza is one of the most selfish viruses around, and nearly always infects alone. Others, such as adenoviruses, seem to be more up for a houseshare.\nThere has been much speculation about how the virus that causes Covid, known as Sars-CoV-2, would fit into the mysterious world of \"virus-virus interactions\".\nThe challenge for scientists is that a year of social distancing has slowed the spread of all viruses and made it much harder to study. \nThe team at the Centre for Virus Research in Glasgow used a replica of the lining of our airways, made out of the same types of cells, and infected it with Sars-CoV-2 and rhinovirus, which is one of the most widespread infections in people, and a cause of the common cold.\nIf rhinovirus and Sars-CoV-2 were released at the same time, only rhinovirus is successful. If rhinovirus had a 24-hour head start then Sars-CoV-2 does not get a look in. And even when Sars-CoV-2 had 24-hours to get started, rhinovirus boots it out. \n\"Sars-CoV-2 never takes off, it is heavily inhibited by rhinovirus,\" Dr Pablo Murcia told BBC News. \nHe added: \"This is absolutely exciting because if you have a high prevalence of rhinovirus, it could stop new Sars-CoV-2 infections.\"\nSimilar effects have been seen before. A large rhinovirus outbreak  may have delayed the 2009 swine flu pandemic in parts of Europe.\nFurther experiments showed rhinovirus was triggering an immune response inside the infected cells, which blocked the ability of Sars-CoV-2 to make copies of itself. \nWhen scientists blocked the immune response, then levels of the Covid virus were the same as if rhinovirus was not there. \nHowever, Covid would be able to cause an infection again once the cold had passed and the immune response calmed down.\nDr Murcia said: \"Vaccination, plus hygiene measures, plus the interactions between viruses could lower the incidence of Sars-CoV-2 heavily, but the maximum effect will come from vaccination.\"\nProf Lawrence Young, of Warwick Medical School, said human rhinoviruses, the most frequent cause of the common cold, were \"highly transmissible\".\nHe added that this study suggests \"that this common infection could impact the burden of Covid-19 and influence the spread of SarsCoV2, particularly over the autumn and winter months when seasonal colds are more frequent\".\nExactly how all this settles down in future winters is still unknown. Coronavirus is likely to still be around, and all the other infections that have been suppressed during the pandemic could bounce back as immunity to them wanes.  \nDr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, has already warned of a \"hard winter\" as a result. \n\"We could see surges in flu. We could see surges in other respiratory viruses and other respiratory pathogens,\" she said,\nThe results have been published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has survived a vote of no confidence at Holyrood over her government's handling of complaints against Alex Salmond.\nA Holyrood committee inquiry has concluded that there were \"serious flaws\" in the government's approach.\nThe confidence vote was tabled by Tory MSP Ruth Davidson, who said nobody had taken responsibility for the failures.\nBut MSPs voted by 65 to 31 to reject the motion, with the Greens backing the SNP and Labour and Lib Dems abstaining.\nMs Sturgeon said she \"may not have got everything right\" in her handling of the matter, but insisted that she \"acted appropriately and made the right judgements overall\".\nAnd she told opposition parties that if they wanted to remove her they should do it in the forthcoming election on 6 May, adding: \"It is now time for the country to decide.\"\nThe Holyrood inquiry - which was set up in 2019 after the government conceded its handling of complaints against Mr Salmond had been unlawful - published its report earlier on Tuesday, stating that women had been badly let down by the failed process.\nA majority of members said Ms Sturgeon had misled the inquiry in her evidence, and said they found it hard to believe that she was not aware of concerns about Mr Salmond's alleged behaviour before November 2017.\nHowever an independent investigation by Irish lawyer James Hamilton concluded on Monday that Ms Sturgeon had not breached the ministerial code.\nHe said Ms Sturgeon had given an \"incomplete narrative of events\" to MSPs, but that he believed this was a \"genuine failure of recollection\" and not deliberate.\nThe Scottish Conservatives had tabled a motion of no confidence in Ms Sturgeon before either report had been published - saying that \"overwhelming\" evidence of wrongdoing had already emerged.\nMs Davidson, the party's leader at Holyrood, told MSPs that \"nobody has taken responsibility for the multiple failings at every level which occurred\".\nShe said that Ms Sturgeon \"should not feel able to continue in post\", and that \"the honourable thing would be to resign\".\nMs Davidson said: \"The committee found that Nicola Sturgeon misled this parliament. Nothing can erase that fact, however inconvenient it is to the first minister and her supporters.\"\nThe best time for the opposition to call a no confidence vote is when they have enough support to win and can force a minister from office. \nThat has never been a realistic prospect for the Conservatives in their efforts to oust Nicola Sturgeon. \nWhen they first announced plans for a vote the day before the first minister gave evidence to the Holyrood committee, it was clear she could see off their challenge with support from the Greens. \nWhen she was cleared of breaking the ministerial code by the Hamilton inquiry, her position strengthened. \nBy pressing on regardless, the Tories managed to divide the opposition - with Labour and the Liberal Democrats refusing to vote with them and abstaining instead. \nThe Tories say that makes them the only party strong enough to take on the SNP. \nBut in enabling Nicola Sturgeon to comfortably win a confidence vote today they've given her a pre-election boost after some of her toughest weeks in office. \nMs Sturgeon said she \"may not have got everything right in my handling of this situation\", but said she would \"reject entirely any suggestion of misleading this parliament\".\nAnd she said she would have resigned if Mr Hamilton had found she breached the code.\nHowever she said she had been \"cleared of any breach of the ministerial code\", and told Ms Davidson: \"If you think you can bully me out of office you are mistaken and have misjudged me.\n\"If you want to remove me from office as first minister, do it in an election\".\nMs Sturgeon said she had been accused of \"conspiracy against, collusion with and cover-up on behalf of Alex Salmond\", but that \"none of that is supported by evidence because none of that is true.\"\nThe first minister was backed by Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie, who said the inquiry had become a \"farce\" and accused opposition members of the committee of \"destroying the credibility of their own work\".\nBoth Labour and the Lib Dems abstained in the final vote, meaning only the Conservatives backed the motion.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said there had been a \"litany of failures\" by the government, but said the Tories were \"only interested in getting a scalp\" and \"grubby party politics\". \nHe said: \"This is a day of shame for our parliament. Scotland deserves a better government and a better opposition.\"\nMeanwhile Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said \"nobody wins from this ugly debate\", and that the confidence debate and motion \"cannot be the end\" of the matter."

      "text": "A man whose parents both died in the pandemic has said there needs to be a Wales-specific Covid public inquiry.\nJames Heaton, 43, from Pontypridd said \"lessons need to be learnt\" to prevent others going through the \"sheer hell\" he has been through.\nWales' first minister said his government's decisions should be scrutinised in a UK-wide inquiry.\nThe Conservatives and Plaid Cymru said they would call a Wales inquiry if they were in power after May's election.\nThe older people's commissioner Helena Herklots said a Wales inquiry as well as a UK one would be \"useful\" as it could provide \"additional scrutiny\". \nBut the British Medical Association said \"Welsh actions\" had been dependent on UK policy and should be \"assessed in the round\" as part of a UK inquiry.\nMr Heaton's parents, Frank and Ann Heaton, died within weeks of each other last autumn.\nHe described them as a \"very happy, self-contained couple,\" adding that it was rare to see \"one without the other\".\nFrank, 74, developed mild pneumonia in September.\nMr Heaton said his father was \"persuaded\" by another doctor to go into the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant.\nFive days later he was \"rallying well\" and his discharge from hospital was being planned.\nBut his condition then declined and he died the following Wednesday, 11 days after going into hospital, and his primary cause of death was Covid-19.\nMr Heaton said he believed his father caught the virus in hospital and that hospital-acquired infections are one area a public inquiry should scrutinise.\n\"The overall rate was so low but it seemed to go very high very quickly in that particular hospital,\" he said.\n\"Why did some particular areas get such a high infection rate at a time when the overall infection rate was so low?\n\"Was it assumed with the low infection rates in late summer we were on top of it and it was dying out?\n\"What could have been done to prevent this?\"\nJust over a week after Frank's death, Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board said 25 people had died with Covid after an outbreak at the Royal Glamorgan, a figure which later rose significantly.\nGreg Dix, director of nursing, midwifery and patient care at the health board, said it apologises to \"anyone who has felt let down\".\nHe said: \"With the close support of public health and infection control teams during the Covid-19 outbreak at Royal Glamorgan Hospital late last year, we were able to get a greater understanding of the virus and strengthen our infection control measures even further. \n\"Last week we confirmed there were no active adult cases of the virus in the hospital, but we continue to be extremely vigilant with robust risk assessments, regular reviews of infection prevention and control measures, and increased testing of our staff and patients.\"\nMr Heaton's mother Ann, 75, died the following month of frailty of old age and a urinary tract infection.\nAlthough Covid was not her cause of death, she did catch the virus back in May when there was an outbreak at her care home, something which her son said left her \"brutally weakened\".\nHe said he suspects the cause may have been \"the notorious discharge of untested patients to care homes\", and added that while the care home managed the outbreak \"really well\", his mum \"never fully recovered\".\n\"While it doesn't say Covid on her death certificate I'm in absolutely no doubt it shortened her life.\"\nMore than 1,700 people were transferred from hospitals to care homes in Wales in March, April and May of last year, including 53 who had tested positive for Covid in the 15 days before their discharge.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said in November further analysis was needed before conclusions were drawn on the impact those transfers had.\nMr Heaton said what happened to his parents illustrates the need for a Wales-specific public inquiry, \"ideally this year\".\n\"We need to learn the lessons of what went wrong this time to prevent others going through the sheer hell I have been going through for the last five months.\n\"I think there should be a Wales-specific inquiry. \n\"The two reasons for that being, I think the Welsh experience would be a very small part of the whole UK inquiry.\n\"And with health being a devolved matter and with the Welsh NHS being a separate body reporting to the Senedd, we need to look at what was done differently in Wales and what could have been done differently in Wales.\n\"Learn from any successes that came from Wales doing [things] differently and also learn from any failings that came from Wales doing [things] differently.\"\nThe older people's commissioner for Wales Helena Herklots said a Wales-specific inquiry would be \"useful\" as well as a UK-wide one.\n\"Given the role that the UK government has played in determining many aspects of Wales' response to the pandemic, a UK-wide inquiry would be helpful in examining the questions that people are raising. \n\"However, as many decisions have been made in a devolved context, a Wales-specific inquiry would also be useful in providing additional scrutiny and exploring particular issues in greater detail.\" \nThe Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Group - which has threatened the UK government with legal action unless it launches a judge-led public inquiry - told BBC Wales it was \"right\" that a Wales inquiry is also held.\nA spokesman for the group said: \"We'd welcome inquiries from each part of the UK - they can each provide a specific lens through which to view the failures that got us here.\"\nBut the British Medical Association's Welsh council chair Dr David Bailey said an inquiry should be UK-wide. \n\"Whilst decisions on lockdown and testing have been made at devolved levels, issues that have occurred with the supply of PPE and vaccine testing have mainly occurred at UK level and SAGE and JCVI advice to governments have also spanned across all four nations,\" he said.\n\"Welsh actions have all been dependent on UK policy, it's reasonable to judge independent decisions by nations on their merits but most are inextricably linked and should be assessed in the round.\"\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"We have always made clear that a public inquiry should be held. \n\"However, quite apart from the fact that we are still in the middle of a global pandemic, so much of what has happened in Wales has been linked to the wider UK picture. \n\"There would be little point in holding an inquiry that failed to consider many of these cross border issues.\"\nYou can see more on this story tonight on Wales Live at 22:35 on BBC One Wales."

      "text": "Deaths in the UK have fallen below the five-year average for the first time since the summer.\nExperts say it means the winter wave of Covid deaths has ended and lockdown and the vaccine rollout have saved lives.\nIn the week up to 12 March, 14% of all deaths involved Covid, compared with 44% at the 22 January peak, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show.\nIn January, Covid deaths drove overall mortality in the UK 40% higher than the average seen between 2015 and 2019.\nThere have been more than 145,000 deaths involving Covid in the UK since the first lockdown, a year ago.\nDuring the first wave of the virus, tens of thousands of Covid deaths meant many more people were dying overall than during the same months in previous years.\nThe first lockdown brought cases down - but it took longer for this to translate to a fall in deaths.  \nFollowing this lockdown, and in the warmer weather from late June until the beginning of August, deaths dipped back below the five-year average.\nBut after the first week of August, they again began to rise above levels expected for the time of year.\nAnd they remained above expected levels every week since - with the exception of the week ending 4 September, which was skewed by delays in reporting because of the August Bank Holiday - until the second week in March, which saw them fall 5% below the average.\nThis time we have a tool we did not have previously, though, in the form of vaccines.\nProf Neil Ferguson, director of the Medical Research Council Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, at Imperial College London, said: \"The new ONS data on deaths is encouraging in suggesting the second devastating wave of the pandemic is behind us. \n\"But calling epidemics 'waves' can be misleading in implying a phenomenon which has reached a natural end - that is not the case here. \n\"The rapid decline in deaths we have thankfully seen is entirely because of the lockdown and the rapid rollout of vaccines. \n\"So while I'm optimistic that this we will be able to return to something more like normal in the next few months, we need to remain vigilant and cautious in the pace with which social distancing is relaxed - particularly given the threat still posed by new variants of the virus.\""
