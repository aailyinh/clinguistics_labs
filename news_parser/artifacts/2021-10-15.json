      "title": "ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper strike confirmed during COP26",
      "tags": "COP26,Glasgow,Serco",
      "text": "Scotland's rail network will be hit by strikes during the UN climate summit in Glasgow, a union has confirmed. \nThe RMT said members who work for ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper will stage industrial action during COP26 in an ongoing row over pay.\nScotRail staff will strike from 00:01 on Monday 1 November until 23:59 on Friday 12th November.\nThe summit, which is expected to draw thousands of people to Glasgow, runs from 31 October until 12 November.\nSleeper staff will strike on Sunday 31 October from 11:59 until 11:58 hours on Tuesday 2 November and again for 48 hours on Thursday 11 November from 11:59.\nGMB cleansing workers in Glasgow and Unite's Stagecoach staff have also voted to strike during COP26. \nA spokesman for ScotRail said the \"highly damaging\" strike action was \"extremely disappointing\" as it faced a serious financial crisis in the wake of the pandemic. \nTransport Minister Graeme Dey told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the RMT was in receipt of a \"very fair\" pay proposal.\nBut he added many of its members will have voted for strike action \"unaware of the offer that is now on the table\".\nMr Dey also described the two-year deal, which he said has been backed by the three other unions involved, was \"the best offer that can be made in the circumstances\".  \nIt is the latest stage in a long-running dispute over pay and conditions and proposed cuts to services at the rail operator, which wants to reduce the number of services across Scotland by 300 a day from next May.\nReacting to Mr Dey's comments, Michael Hogg from the RMT union said they would not ballot ScotRail workers on the new deal because \"it is not worthy of consideration\".\nHe said the new pay offer was 4.7% over two years, but there have to be efficiency savings. That would mean workers having to give up some current terms and conditions in order to get a pay rise, a caveat Mr Hogg branded \"unacceptable\".\nThere will be no trains running anywhere in Scotland during COP26 if the strikes go ahead, he confirmed.\nScotRail is currently run by Dutch firm Abellio - but will be taken over by a company owned and controlled by the Scottish government in March next year.\nThe move was announced by the government earlier this year after Abellio was stripped of its contract three years early amid concern over its performance. \nScotRail has been in talks for several weeks with trade unions about pay and conditions. A formal written offer was made to four rail trade unions - Aslef, RMT, TSSA, and Unite the union. \nThe company said it had only survived the pandemic due to emergency taxpayer support of more than \u00a3400m in \"the most serious financial crisis in our history\". \nA spokesman said: \"It's extremely disappointing that the RMT have opted to continue with this highly damaging strike action, particularly when a pay offer, negotiated over several weeks, has been made to the trade unions.\n\"We're seeing customers gradually return to Scotland's Railway, but the scale of the financial situation ScotRail is facing is stark. \n\"To build a more sustainable and greener railway for the future and reduce the burden on the taxpayer, we need to change. All of us in the railway - management, staff, trade unions, suppliers, and government - need to work together to modernise the railway so that it is fit for the future.\"\nTransport Scotland said it welcomed constructive talks between all parties and that a \"significant offer\" has been made by employers since the RMT ballot opened.\nA spokeswoman said: \"We understand that the RMT will now ballot its membership again on the substance of this offer.  We hope that RMT members and the other unions will agree and accept this offer, putting to an end existing and proposed industrial disputes and action.\n\"Rail workers have played their part in keeping the country moving through the pandemic and we are sure that they will see the importance of the moment and the role they can play in showing the best Scotland's Railway has to offer as we welcome world leaders from across the globe to COP26.\"\nMeanwhile, Chris Mitchell of the GMB denied cleansing workers in Glasgow were using the global climate conference as a bargaining chip.\nMr Mitchell claimed his members have been \"put in a corner\" by Cosla despite their heroic efforts during the pandemic.\nAnd he told Good Morning Scotland the current pay offer of \u00a3850 a year would only amount to an extra \u00a36.50 a week, after tax and National Insurance.\nMr Mitchell said he acknowledged the importance of COP26 but added: \"Cosla need to realise there is an emergency on their own door step.\""

      "text": "Delays at UK ports are having a severe impact on retailers, who are warning that customers might not be able find the same range of products this Christmas as they may have in previous years.\nWe talk to four firms to find out how it's affecting them.\nThere is currently a shortage across the country affecting official Harry Potter merchandise, two retailers have told the BBC.\n\"First Brexit hit, and then the pandemic hit. The combination of both, the manufacturers got scared and work stopped and they couldn't ship big containers by sea,\" Elvijs Plugis, co-owner of fandom-themed collectible shop House of Spells, based in Charing Cross, London, says.\n\"A Harry Potter wand used to be \u00a320, now it's going to be \u00a335-\u00a340. All of the shops are running out of stock.\"\nMany of the wands, other official movie replicas and some of clothing merchandise are currently difficult to source, he says. \nMr Plugis added that House of Spells is now trying to focus on other fandoms as well as Harry Potter, although the business is still buying up as many licensed Harry Potter-themed product lines as it can find.\n\"Today at 8am in the morning, we received calls from the official Platform 9 and 3/4 shop [in Kings Cross Station] referring customers to us as they have run out of stock,\" he says.\nTypically, House of Spells makes a 20-30% margin on each wand it sells, but now the shop also has to pay another 25-30% in container shipping costs, as well as up to 30% more on customs charges.\n\"At the moment we have not raised prices - we don't know how long it will be possible though,\" says Mr Plugis.\nLondon Toy Company, which imports Harry Potter toys, as well as designing its own British-themed toys for familiar brands, says it has now sold out of all of its stock of Harry Potter products.\nContainer prices are up 900% for the firm, according to London Toy Company's director Joel Berkowitz.\nThe firm now has 35,000 toys held up at ports, worth a quarter of a million pounds.\n\"We've had to redirect containers shipping around 10,000 toys, which would have gone straight to Felixstowe, to Tilbury Port in London, via France and Belgium,\" he says.\n\"It's adding a 2.5-3 week addition to the timeframe [of when customers will receive products].\"\nLondon Toy Company makes toys for brands such as the London Underground, JCB and several military museums across the UK. \nCurrently, its clients, including retailers like Amazon, Audi, Harrods and Moonpig, are all waiting to receive orders of toys. \n\"We are having to absorb the extra costs as much as we can and take a hit on our margin,\" says Mr Berkowitz. \n\"There's a ceiling for the products that clients are willing to pay, so we're putting only a maximum of 10% on top of the cost of the product.\"\nAlan Simpson, managing director of Toytown, a chain of independent retailers based in Belfast, is urging customers to start their Christmas shopping early this year.\n\"If you're looking for choice, don't expect to come in December and see what you would normally experience in a toy store,\" he tells the BBC.\n\"I have 42 years in business [but] I cannot remember ever having to come through any issues like this that we've been dealing with.\"\nHe says that although Toytown can try to pre-empt some of the price rises to help mitigate them, the problem is \"right across the board\", affecting many retailers.\nMr Simpson uses the example of a toy construction truck: In October 2020, it cost 70p to ship from the Far East to the UK. Today, it costs \u00a37 to ship.\nThe truck currently sells for \u00a315, but he says the price will need to rise soon, as almost half of the retail price is now taken up by shipping costs. \n\"Come January, all suppliers are going to have to increase prices again, having [already] increased them in June, July and August this year,\" he says, stressing that there is likely be an effect on inflation. \n\"They're feeling the impact because they get the product from the same sources that we do.\"\nOther retailers who also rely on products being manufactured on the other side of the world are now gravely concerned, like London-based lighting company Houseof. \nThe firm says it is now being charged \u00a314,000 per container - double the price last year, and seven times the cost compared to prior to the pandemic.\n\"Our containers are now being redirected to the northern ports, as Southampton, Felixstowe and London Gateway are all congested with static empty containers,\" says Houseof co-founder Michael Jones.\n\"This increases our road transport costs significantly.\"\nHe added that Houseof was also having to book road transportation for goods up to five weeks in advance - often before the container even leaves China.\n\"Given that it takes between 60-90 days to produce an order, we are paying a heavy price for slow communication and poor forecasting,\" he says.\n\"Orders with retail partners are level with this time last year, but overall stock reserves are much lower, which will have implications as we enter the 'peak season'.\""

      "tags": "Tonia Antoniazzi,Equality Act ,Welsh government,LGBT,Stonewall",
      "text": "The Welsh government has been accused of being \"dictated to\" by an LGBT charity.\nLabour MP Tonia Antoniazzi said the government promoted an \"ideological culture\" by adopting Stonewall's interpretation of the Equality Act.\nHer comments were in response to a BBC investigation which revealed the Welsh government had adopted Stonewall's interpretation of equality law.\nThe Welsh government said its policy was in the \"spirit of the law\".\nIt added that its inclusive workplace and policies did not disadvantage, undermine or exclude any colleagues. \nProtections for people based on factors including age, disability, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, pregnancy and gender reassignment are enshrined in the Equality Act 2010.\nHowever, in a document sent to Stonewall and seen by the BBC, the term \"gender reassignment\" has been replaced with the term \"gender identity\" in the Welsh government's Equality and Diversity Policy.\nIt is a characteristic not provided for in law, but something Stonewall has been campaigning for. \nIt could mean people with various gender identities, such as non-binary, would be protected in law.\nCritics of Stonewall's interpretation of the law argue that the term gender identity is too broad and it could undermine sex-based rights protected under the legislation. \nMs Antoniazzi said: \"It is astonishing that the Welsh government can so blatantly misrepresent the Equality Act 2010 as dictated to by Stonewall. \n\"They are promoting an ideological culture and rewriting the Equality Act at the same time. To misrepresent the law in this way shows a contempt not only for the law, but also to anyone who wishes to speak up for women or who has concerns around safeguarding.\n\"I'd also like to know what other organisations the Welsh government draws on to test their policies and practices, and what their relationship is with Stonewall and the Senedd.  \n\"This situation is risible, and as a Welsh Labour MP I am deeply disappointed that no minister has been available to respond to the BBC to defend their stance.\"\nMs Antoniazzi also said there was a \"lack of transparency and independence around policy making\".\n\"I would urge [the Welsh government] to provide a safe space for all staff to express their concerns without fear nor favour,\" she added.\nThe Welsh government works with LGBT charity Stonewall when updating its policies and it has been involved with two Stonewall schemes to promote diversity, including the Workplace Equality Index, which is a public ranking of organisations scored by Stonewall.\nDocuments, obtained under Freedom of Information laws by the BBC's Nolan Investigates podcast, revealed what the lobby group was asking organisations to do to improve their ranking on the Workplace Equality Index. \nRobin Allen QC, who specialises in employment and equality law, said there was \"nothing to stop the Welsh government having a more inclusive set of definitions of characteristics that they consider to be important in the way that they develop policies, what they can't do is exclude characteristics from the approach that they take\". \nHe said he believed the Welsh government had been \"persuaded by Stonewall to use the phrase gender identity to try and take, as Stonewall would say, a more modern approach that people's identity, in the general field of gender and sex, is much more fluid than simply being male or female\". \nHowever, he said gender identity \"is not a protected characteristic as defined by the Equality Act 2010\".\nThe Welsh government declined to be interviewed in the podcast, but a spokesman said: \"We acknowledge that the terms gender identity and gender expression are not protected characteristics in the Equality Act 2010, but we use these terms to cover the Equality Act protected characteristic of 'gender reassignment'.\n\"We feel that these terms do not misrepresent the Equality Act in terms of the spirit of the law.\n\"The Equality Act's definition of gender reassignment covers trans status, gender identity and protects non-binary and gender fluid people too, as was recently ruled.\"\nHowever, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), the regulatory body responsible for enforcing the Equality Act 2010, said the term gender identity does not help explain who is covered by the law in terms of the Equality Act, as is suggested by Stonewall and the Welsh government. \nIt added that the Equality Act 2010 \"provides protection against discrimination and harassment related to the protected characteristic of gender reassignment\".\n\"To be protected from gender reassignment discrimination, you do not need to have undergone any specific treatment or surgery,\" EHRC said.\n\"You can be at any stage in the transition process - from proposing to reassign your sex, to undergoing a process to reassign your sex, or having completed it.\"\nThe Welsh government also said it was \"proud to be an inclusive employer where all colleagues are supported to be themselves and reach their full potential\". \n\"Our inclusive workplace and policies do not disadvantage, undermine or exclude any colleagues,\" the spokesman added.\n\"As an inclusive employer, we take part in a variety of workplace benchmarking activities to ensure we learn from best practice in other organisations. Stonewall are one of a number of organisations we draw on to test our policies and practices.\"\nStonewall said: \"All our guidance on the Equality Act, including using the term gender identity, is based on the Equality and Human Rights Commission's Equality Act Code of Practice, which was recently reaffirmed in the High Court.\" \nThe organisation did not provide more details to the BBC when asked about the specifics of the High Court case, or about the EHRC's statement to the podcast.\nThe Nolan Investigates podcast is available on BBC Sounds.

      "title": "Steve Bannon: Congress plans criminal charge for former Trump aide",
      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,Donald Trump,US Congress",
      "text": "A committee investigating the 6 January Capitol riot has said it will pursue criminal charges against former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon next week. \nMr Bannon had been summoned to testify before the congressional panel investigating the riot on Thursday.\nHe did not appear, prompting the head of the committee to schedule a Tuesday vote to hold him in criminal contempt.\nIf convicted, Mr Bannon faces a fine and up to one year in prison. Democrats say he is trying to delay the probe. \nMr Bannon - a former right-wing media executive who became Mr Trump's chief strategist - was fired from the White House in 2017 and was not in government at the time of the January riot.\nBut he has been asked to testify regarding his communication with Mr Trump a week before the incident - as well as his involvement in discussing plans to overturn the election results that saw Joe Biden win the White House.\nMr Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol building in Washington, DC on 6 January in a failed bid to overturn the certification of Mr Biden's victory. Hundreds of Mr Trump's supporters have since been arrested for their actions that day. \nSubpoena documents quoted Mr Bannon as saying \"all hell is going to break loose tomorrow\" on the eve of the riot, which left five dead.\nMr Bannon has repeatedly said he has no plans to appear before the committee.\nHe has argued that executive privilege, which shields some presidential communications, protects his discussions with Mr Trump. Mr Bannon's lawyers say he will continue to resist until a court has ruled on the matter. \nDemocrats argue that Mr Bannon is employing a delaying tactic in an attempt to push back proceedings until after the midterm elections in November 2022, which may change the balance of power in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.\nOn Tuesday, the Democratic-led investigative committee will decide whether to refer the contempt charge for a full House vote.  \nHouse lawmakers would then have to rule on whether Mr Bannon is in contempt. If the Democratic-majority House votes yes, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.\nWhile this latest development is not surprising, with Democrats controlling both Congress and the presidency, this may be a rare instance where a congressional contempt charge has some teeth.\nIt also comes as the Democratic base demand accountability for the Trump administration's actions, calling on their members in Congress to flex their oversight muscles. \nIn August, the House investigating committee asked for records relating to the day's events, including communications from Mr Trump, members of his family, his top aides, his lawyers and other former members of his administration.\nThe committee has also ordered the testimony of Mr Trump's ex-Chief of Staff Mark Meadows; Dan Scavino, Mr Trump's social media manager; and Kash Patel, a former Pentagon chief of staff.\nMr Meadows and Mr Patel were co-operating with the inquiry, committee leaders Democrat Bennie Thompson and Republican Liz Cheney said last week.\nUS media report Mr Trump has asked all four former officials to refuse to comply with the inquiry.\nOn Friday Mr Trump - who has never conceded losing the election to Mr Biden - accused Democrats in Congress of using the committee to \"persecute their political opponents\"."

      "tags": "Schools,Coronavirus testing,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Lateral flow tests (LFTs) are very good at detecting people most likely to spread Covid-19 and positive results should be trusted, say University College London researchers.\nWhen LFTs were introduced, they were criticised for being less accurate than PCR tests, which are analysed in a lab.\nBut the study found rapid tests were \"a very useful public health tool\" for stopping the spread of the virus.\nOne third of people with Covid can spread it while showing no symptoms. \nBased on the UCL research, Prof Irene Petersen, lead study author, said people who get a positive LFT result \"should trust them and stay at home\".\nBut government guidance says people must get a follow-up PCR test after a positive LFT to confirm they have Covid - and they can end their self-isolation when they get a negative result in a PCR test.\nThere have been recent reports of this happening in south-west England, leaving people unsure whether to isolate or not.\nThe UK's Health Security Agency said it was looking into the cause, but there was no evidence of any technical issues with test kits.\nProf Petersen said: \"When [Covid is] more common, there is no need to confirm it with a PCR - it's more likely it is a positive,\" she said.\nWhen the researchers used a new formula for calculating the rapid test's accuracy, they found LFTs were more than 80% effective at detecting any level of Covid-19 infection and likely to be more than 90% effective at detecting who is most infectious when they use the test.\nThis is much higher than previously thought, they say.\nProf Michael Mina, from Harvard School of Public Health, also part of the research team, said the LFTs could \"catch nearly everyone who is currently a serious risk to public health\" when viral loads are at their peak.\n\"It is most likely that if someone's LFT is negative but their PCR is positive, then this is because they are not at peak transmissible stage,\" he said.\nThe rapid tests are widely used in schools, workplaces and for allowing entry to large events to test those with no symptoms. \nSince they were introduced in secondary schools in England in March, NHS Test and Trace figures show 103,409 LFT tests have come back positive, 79,000 were matched with a confirmatory PCR and 69,500 of those were confirmed positive (and 7,647 came back negative).\nThere was much criticism of the rapid tests when they were first trialled in Liverpool last year because they were directly compared to PCR tests, which were often described as the gold standard.\n\"This is like comparing apples and oranges,\" Prof Petersen said.\nLateral flow tests and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests do different things:\nThe UCL peer-reviewed study concludes that criticism of LFTs for low sensitivity \"have reached the wrong conclusions\", \"confused policy-making\" and \"damaged public trust in LFTs\".\nHealth professionals and the public should be aware of what the tests do, said the researchers, writing in Clinical Epidemiology.\nAnd they acknowledge that errors in the way people take the tests or in the way they are processed in the lab could affect results - and these factors were not taken into account in their study.\nThe current government guidance says that if you receive a negative follow-up PCR test result, and this PCR test was taken within two days of the positive LFT, you will be told by NHS Test and Trace that you can stop self-isolating. \nHowever, it states that you must continue to self-isolate if the PCR result is positive, you choose not to take a follow-up PCR or the test was taken more than two days after the positive LFT.\nDr Sophia Makki, incident director for Covid-19 at the UK Health Security Agency, said: \"Around one in three people who have Covid-19 never show any symptoms. \n\"Using LFDs (lateral flow devices) help to find asymptomatic cases who have a high viral load and are most likely to pass on the virus to others.\" "

      "title": "Covid: US opens up to fully vaccinated travellers",
      "tags": "Travel,European Union,United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The US is easing its coronavirus travel restrictions, reopening to passengers from the UK, EU and other nations. \nFrom November, foreign travellers will be allowed to fly into the US if they are fully vaccinated, and undergo testing and contact tracing. \nThe US has had tough restrictions on travel in place since early last year.\nThe move answers a major demand from European allies, and means that families and friends separated by the restrictions can be reunited. \n\"It's a happy day - Big Apple, here I come!\" French entrepreneur Stephane Le Breton told the Associated Press news agency, as he looked forward to a trip to New York City that had been put on hold because of the restrictions. \nWhite House Covid-19 co-ordinator Jeff Zients announced the new rules on Monday, saying: \"This is based on individuals rather than a country-based approach, so it's a stronger system.\"\n\"Most importantly, foreign nationals flying to the US will be required to be fully vaccinated,\" he said. \nUS restrictions were initially imposed on travellers from China in early 2020, and then extended to other countries. \nThe current rules bar entry to most non-US citizens who have been in the UK and a number of other European countries, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil within the last 14 days. \nUnder the new rules, foreign travellers will need to demonstrate proof of vaccination before flying, obtain a negative Covid-19 test result within three days of travelling, and provide their contact information. They will not be required to quarantine. \nOfficials said there would be some exceptions to the new policy, including for children who are not eligible to be vaccinated. \nIt was not immediately clear if the new rules applied only to US-approved vaccines, with Mr Zients saying this would be determined by the US Centers for Disease Control.\nA White House source told the BBC that the question of whether people who have had the AstraZeneca vaccine or 12- to 18-year-olds who have only had one jab would be allowed in under the new rules was a level of \"granular detail\" that was still being worked out, though this would affect millions. \nAmericans who are not fully vaccinated will still be able to enter, but they will need to be tested before their return to the US, and after they arrive home.\nMr Zients said the policy would come into effect in early November, but did not give an exact date. \nThe new rules do not apply to land borders, meaning that restrictions continue to apply to cross-border travel with Canada and Mexico. \nThe easing of travel rules came as a surprise to many, after the US government last week said it was not the right time to lift the restrictions. \nOne British official told the BBC on Monday that the decision had come completely out of the blue. \nFollowing the announcement, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"delighted\". \n\"It's a fantastic boost for business and trade, and great that family and friends on both sides of the pond can be reunited once again,\" he wrote on Twitter. \nGerman Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz also welcomed the change, saying it was \"great news for German and European investments, our exports and transatlantic relations\". \nFor months a joint working party has been looking at ways to relax the travel ban. The work, I'm told, has been detailed and assiduous. \nBut last Friday in Washington next to no one (not even in the Biden administration) was expecting today's announcement. So what's changed? \nThe Biden administration is aware of the growing disquiet among European allies about a range of issues - Afghanistan notably, but in recent days French fury over the Aukus submarine deal. And remember France is America's oldest ally. \nThis week Joe Biden will be meeting not only Boris Johnson, but a whole pile of EU leaders during the UN General Assembly in New York. And all had it on their dance cards to raise the travel ban. \nAccording to one diplomatic source, the US over the weekend just weighed the countervailing forces: annoy some Americans with a policy that could be characterised as being weak on Covid; or continue to alienate your European allies who are growing increasingly irritable. \nWith the data no longer supporting the ban, this weekend came a decision. Out of the blue in one way, but quite logical in another.\nAirline shares rose in response to the new travel rules, with British Airways owner IAG up as much as 10%.\nVirgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss called the move \"a major milestone\" for travel recovery. \nDoug Parker, chairman and CEO of American Airlines, said he welcomed the \"science-based approach\" to lifting travel restrictions.\n\"With the shared goals of health and safety always at the forefront, we're looking forward to welcoming more customers back to easy, seamless international trips for business, for leisure, and to reconnect with family and friends,\" he said. \nTravellers also celebrated the changes. \nPhil White, a British entrepreneur who lives in the US, said the decision would allow him to see his 23-year-old daughter who lives in London for the first time since the pandemic started.\n\"We haven't been able to see our daughter over this time. And that has been very, very, very difficult for us,\" he told AFP news agency.\nHe said he immediately booked a flight for her daughter after the news about the change was confirmed.  \"[A]s a family we're going to be together for Thanksgiving, which is amazing,\" he added.\nThe US has recorded more than 42 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, and over 670,000 deaths.\nIn an interview with BBC World News on Monday, White House coronavirus adviser Dr Anthony Fauci urged more Americans to get vaccinated.

In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "tags": "Kenya,Crime",
      "text": "A mob in western Kenya has killed a self-confessed serial killer who escaped from custody two days ago, police say.\nMasten Wanjala, 20, was traced by villagers to a house in Bungoma town and beaten to death, they say. \nAuthorities had launched a massive manhunt for the fugitive who admitted to killing more than 10 young boys during a five-year period. \nHe also confessed to drugging them and in some cases drinking their blood.\nHe reportedly returned to the home of his parents - who have disowned him - and was subsequently strangled by neighbours who found out he was there, an eyewitness told Kenya's Standard newspaper.\nHe tried to stave off suspicious locals by moving to a nearby house, Bungoma's police commander told the paper. \nIt is thought his family identified the body, although a police spokesperson said they are still doing \"basic verification\" to make sure the deceased is indeed Wanjala, according to Reuters news agency.\n\"We are not sure how he managed to travel all the way from Nairobi to his rural home,\" Musyoki Mutungi said. \"It is the curious villagers who first identified him and went ahead to kill him even before the police could be informed.\" \nThe mother of one of the victims told the BBC she wanted to know why he did what he did.\n\"I would have loved to see him in court, so that I get to know why he did this - why he brutally killed our children and left us with pain,\" Grace Adhiambo said.\nThe badly decomposed body of her teenage son Brian Omondi was one of four recovered by police on the outskirts of the capital Nairobi in July. \nA post-mortem carried out by the government pathologist showed they had been strangled and hit on the head with a blunt object.\nWanjala killed his first victim when he was just 16 years old, a similar age to some of his victims. \nHe posed as a football coach to lure his victims to secluded areas, after which he attacked them.\nIn some cases he took them as hostages for ransom. \nThe killings took place in Nairobi, and areas of eastern and western Kenya. \nThree police officers who were on duty when he escaped on Wednesday have been charged with aiding the escape of a suspect and negligence. \nPolice say they noticed he had disappeared during the morning roll call. There was no sign of a break-in at the prison cell.\nIn a series of tweets, the Kenyan Directorate of Criminal Investigations expressed regret that Wanjala did not face justice. \nIt said \"the law of the jungle as applied by irate villagers prevailed\".\nThere are growing calls for the resignation of Kenya's police chief over the escape, which shocked the nation and and led many on social media to ridicule the police.\nWanjala's killing by mob justice two days later however is a tragic reminder of the deep anger, hate and frustrations that many Kenyans feel for the National Police Service. \nKenyans saw this as an open-and-shut case, which the police bungled. \nAfter more than three months of investigations, Kenyans are asking why was Wanjala never taken to court to face murder charges? \nIt raises questions about Kenya's judicial process - whose wheels often grind slow, and in this case, were completely broken, destroying the hopes for justice for families of the victims. \nAFRICA LIVE: Updates on this and other stories"

      "text": "People will die unless there is an urgent shake-up of NHS care, a former emergency medicine director has warned.\nDr Iain Robertson-Steel said ambulance delays and the lack of resources were the worst he had ever seen.\nThe former Withybush Hospital director, who lives in Solva, Pembrokeshire, has taken two elderly people to hospital himself as there were no ambulances.\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service apologised, saying there had been \"well-documented pressures on our service\" recently.\nDr Robertson-Steel said there was an urgent need to address the crisis: \"In rural areas with long journey times, you have to have an effective ambulance service, so it's important that the numbers shouldn't be reduced.\n\"If we fail to deliver prompt care for coronary disease, strokes and sepsis, lives will be lost unless we reorganise.\n\"It's a stark warning but it's a message that many of my clinical colleagues and I have been putting out for some years - there's no doubt that delayed care costs lives.\"      \nIn one case, a 94-year-old had fallen in his home, knocking himself unconscious on a radiator.\nHe spent more than eight hours lying on the floor due to ambulance delays and was initially helped by Lena Dixon, a volunteer for a social care charity called Solve Care. \n\"We are a charity, we rely on volunteers. We should not have to deal with things that should be done by statutory services,\" she said.\n\"People in this village should be able to feel that, when they need support, they should get it and not have to lie on a floor for eight hours.\"\nMs Dixon said the man, who was very distressed and in a lot of pain, was eventually treated in hospital but remained confused.  \n\"I feel that if it happens to me, I just want to drop dead - I don't want to lie on a floor and wait for something that might not turn up,\" she added.\nDr Robertson-Steel and his wife Lesley, herself a retired nurse, also helped 81-year-old Des Page who was suffering severe chest pains, but was told it would be at least a three-hour wait for an ambulance. \nMr Page said he did not know what would have happened without their help and thinks people in rural areas are being forgotten.\n\"We're half an hour away from the hospital and you've got to depend on an ambulance - it's frightening. I thought waiting that long a time was ridiculous really.\n\"I think there should be more ambulances provided and that the government should put more money into the NHS.\" \nLast week, a report from Health Inspectorate Wales found that long delays for ambulances outside hospitals were having a detrimental impact on the NHS's ability to care for patients. \nThis week, the Army is being drafted in to help, but Dr Robertson-Steel, who was also director of the West Midlands ambulance service, said that was a temporary measure and the problem was not being taken seriously enough.  \n\"We don't need more meetings, more pilot projects, more reports, we actually need an action plan to deliver recovery for the NHS and social care,\" he said. \nA recent proposal to cut the number of ambulances in Pembrokeshire from seven to five has drawn widespread criticism.\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service said a review of resources in Hywel Dda health board, which covers south-west Wales, had been paused in order to ensure the right number of staff and vehicles could meet demand. \nDr Brendan Lloyd, executive medical director at the Welsh Ambulance Service, said: \"We apologise to all of those patients who have had a poor experience of our ambulance service, including the two patients that Dr Robertson-Steel came to the aid of.\n\"Hospital handover delays coupled with staff absence and high levels of demand for our services have significantly hampered our ability to get to patients quickly.\" "

      "text": "More than 40 people were killed and dozens more injured after blasts tore through a Shia mosque during Friday prayers in the Afghan city of Kandahar.\nPictures from inside the Bibi Fatima mosque show shattered windows and bodies lying on the ground, while other worshippers try to help.\nThe mosque was packed with worshippers as the suicide attack took place. \nThe Islamic State group (IS) released a statement saying it was behind the blasts. \nIt said two attackers shot and killed guards before entering the building and blowing themselves up.\n\"The firing started after we ended the prayers,\" a man named Ahmadullah told AFP news agency. \"Then two, three explosions took place. We were thrown towards the window. Many people, martyred [killed] or wounded, were laying there.\"\nFriday prayers are the busiest congregation of the week. At least 15 ambulances were at the scene afterwards, an AFP journalist said.\nTaliban special forces secured the site and asked people to donate blood to help the victims, Reuters reports.\nA regional branch of Islamic State, IS-K, has carried out multiple attacks in the past in Afghanistan and opposes the country's Taliban rulers. \nKandahar is Afghanistan's second largest city and the spiritual birthplace of the Taliban, so an attack in the city by IS-K is seen as significant. \nLast Friday, a suicide attack on another Shia mosque during Friday prayers in the northern city of Kunduz killed at least 50 people. IS-K said it carried out the attack, which was the deadliest since US forces left at the end of August.\nIS-K, a Sunni Muslim group, is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan. \nIt has targeted Afghan security forces, Afghan politicians and ministries, the Taliban, religious minorities including Shia Muslims and Sikhs, US and Nato forces, and international agencies, including aid organisations.\nSunni Muslim extremists have repeatedly targeted Shia Muslims in the past, whom they see as heretics.\nAbout 10% of Afghanistan's population are thought to be Shia Muslims. Many are also part of the Hazara community, the country's third largest ethnic group, who have faced discrimination and persecution for years in Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan.\nEarlier this month, rights group Amnesty International accused the Taliban of murdering 13 Hazaras, something the group staunchly denied.\nThe Taliban took control of Afghanistan after foreign forces withdrew from the country at the end of August following a deal agreed with the US.\nIt came two decades after US forces had removed the militants from power in 2001."

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Welsh government,Newport,Wolverhampton,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "About 4,000 people in Wales may have been wrongly told their Covid-19 tests were negative because of errors at a private laboratory. \nAn investigation found about 43,000 results from England and Wales have been affected by issues at the facility in Wolverhampton. \nIn a statement, Health Minister Eluned Morgan said most wrong results were in the Gwent and Cwm Taf Morgannwg areas.\nSome who received negative results will be asked to retest. \nThe incorrect PCR test results were given between 8 September and 12 October.\nThe 4,000 number equates to about 0.4% of all tests from Wales processed over that period. \nMs Morgan said the Welsh government was made aware last week of reports that a higher than expected number of positive lateral flow tests were resulting in negative PCR tests. \nMost of the affected tests came from the south-west of England. \nA testing facility in Newport, which processes the majority of Welsh samples, was not affected, Ms Morgan added. \nMs Morgan said anyone who received a negative result from the laboratory after 4 October would  be contacted by NHS Test and Trace and asked to take another test. \nClose contacts who are symptomatic will also be advised to self-isolate and take a PCR test. \nSam Linforth, from Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan, said he woke up with a sore throat on 6 October and, after two positive lateral flow tests, took a PCR test in Bridgend that came back negative.\nHowever, he then had another positive result from a lateral flow. \nHe said: \"I called the test and trace helpline and explained what had happened. They seem surprised but came back and said I needed to follow the PCR result and didn't need to isolate.\" \nHe said he felt \"uncertain\" about this advice, so booked a home PCR test kit - which came back positive.\n\"Coming off the phone, I felt confused about what I was supposed to do. Was I being overly cautious? \n\"It didn't feel like it was good advice and went against what I would have naturally chosen to do.\"\nMs Morgan added: \"My immediate concern is the information and support for the Welsh residents impacted and I have asked Public Health Wales to provide additional support and advice to the affected health boards in addition to the UK Health Security Agency communications. \n\"They will also be assessing the potential impact of this incident on the case rates and epidemiology reports for Wales.\"\nThere have been 5.8 million tests taken so far in the pandemic but we have seen record testing in Wales in recent weeks.\nThe highest number of tests authorised in a single day - 34,151 - were processed on 23 September, although numbers have fallen back slightly and there have been an average of 22,600 tests a day in the last week.\nSince mass testing became available in summer 2020, the lab work has been divided between NHS Wales and the private sector, including a network of so-called Lighthouse labs.\nThe private sector has been behind about 79% of recent testing.\nThere is routine testing of thousands of people in care homes and hospitals, as well as those who find themselves with Covid symptoms.\nDemand has swelled, in part due to record numbers of positive lateral flow tests - about 20,700 - over the past six weeks. This comes from school pupils, more people going back to work and going to events, but these lead to follow-up PCR testing.\nIt is estimated 66,200 people have Covid-19 in Wales, according to the latest weekly swab survey by the Office for National Statistics. \nThis is the highest estimate since the swab survey began in August last year.\nThat is the equivalent of one in 45 people or 2.18% of the population.\nThis is an increase on the previous week's estimate that 56,900 people had Covid.\nThe ONS takes thousands of swab samples in Wales each week, so this can pick up people who may not know they have Covid.\nThe highest proportions are estimated to be among school-age children, with 9.7% of 10-year-olds and 11% of 12-year-olds infected.\nWe can also see from latest case rate figures how they have risen in 10 out of 22 local authority areas among the under 25s.\nThe spike in cases in the under 16s appears to be over despite a small rise in the last week again.\nIn the latest week, there were 2,444 positive tests linked to schools - a 36% drop from the cases recorded in the previous week.\nFriday's other Covid-19 figures, released by PHW, showed daily cases were averaging 2,395 - compared to 2,163 the week before.\nIt also reported 15 more deaths from the virus. \nThe deaths go back as far as 1 October, with six deaths occurring on Tuesday. \nThere have been 36 deaths in the last seven days - an average of five deaths a day,\nIt takes the total number of deaths reported by PHW to 6,005, although these figures only include those who have died in Welsh hospitals or care homes after a positive test. \nThe latest ONS data showed there were 8,357 deaths with Covid in Wales up to 1 October. \nWales' seven-day case rate was 531.7 new infections per 100,000 people over the most recent seven-day period. \nTorfaen (709.9) and Cardiff (705.4) reporting the highest rate out of Wales' 22 local authority areas, while Merthyr Tydfil (363) has the lowest.\nThe key indicator for hospitalisations showed there were 484 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on Thursday - including 104 in Cardiff and Vale. \nThe trend is now upwards, from 415 patients a week ago and 14% more patients than two weeks ago.\nBut numbers are still around 28% of those in hospital with Covid at the same point in the second wave"

      "text": "A pay offer to avoid Scotland's rail network being crippled by strikes during COP26 is \"is not worthy of consideration\", a union has said. \nThe RMT said members who work for ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper will stage industrial action during the UN climate summit in Glasgow.\nThe dispute is linked to an ongoing row over pay which has affected Sunday services in recent months.\nScotRail said its latest two-year offer of 4.7% was \"very reasonable\".\nBut Michael Hogg, from the RMT union, said it would not ballot ScotRail workers on a deal he described as \"rotten\" and \"lousy\" as it also involved efficiency savings. \nThat would mean workers having to give up some current terms and conditions in order to get a pay rise, a caveat Mr Hogg branded \"unacceptable\".\nMr Hogg told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme there will be no trains running anywhere in Scotland during COP26 if the strikes go ahead.\nHe added: \"Our representatives do not feel that this offer is worthy of consideration. It's a kick in the teeth to key, essential workers.\"\nOn Thursday, it was announced staff will strike from 00:01 on Monday 1 November until 23:59 on Friday 12 November.\nThe global COP26 summit, which is expected to draw thousands of people to Glasgow, runs from 31 October until 12 November.\nSleeper staff will strike on Sunday 31 October from 11:59 until 11:58 hours on Tuesday 2 November and again for 48 hours on Thursday 11 November from 11:59.\nGMB cleansing workers in Glasgow and Unite's Stagecoach staff have also voted to strike during COP26. \nScotRail operations manager David Simpson told Good Morning Scotland \"a very positive offer\" was made to the union last weekend and he had expected it to be put to the RMT's members.\nBut instead it called a strike, a move he said was \"very frustrating and very disappointing\".\nMr Simpson denied ScotRail had been \"stonewalling\" the union and said the pandemic had prompted more discussion over the last 18 months than ever before.\nHe added: \"Many workers would say 4.7% over two years is anything but a derisory offer and it compares well with other industries.\"\nKathryn Darbandi, managing director for Serco Caledonian Sleeper, said any action during the climate summit would be incredibly damaging.\nShe said: \"We have repeatedly tabled realistic and reasonable offers which we believe should have ended the dispute. \n\"Industrial action during COP26 - when the eyes of the world will be on Scotland - risks both the reputation of rail as an environmentally-friendly and sustainable mode of transport, but also the great progress the entire team at Caledonian Sleeper have made in building back the confidence of our guests.\n\"The RMT's action does not reflect the reality of the financial situation facing all parties in Scotland's railway today, as we seek to rebuild the industry for the future. We need to work together, and we continue to be open to realistic discussions.\" \nTransport Minister Graeme Dey said that the RMT was in receipt of a \"very fair\" pay proposal.\nAnd he told Good Morning Scotland many of its members will have voted for strike action \"unaware of the offer that is now on the table\".\nMr Dey also described the two-year deal, which he said has been backed by the three other unions involved, was \"the best offer that can be made in the circumstances\".  \nBut Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Graham Simpson accused the Scottish government of distancing themselves from the dispute.\nHe said: \"Glasgow is about to take centre stage in a matter of weeks, and the SNP are still claiming they have no idea why rail strikes are continuing.\n\"SNP ministers must work with all parties to find a solution before these persisting strikes cast a shadow over the COP26 conference.\"\nIt is the latest stage in a long-running dispute over pay and conditions and proposed cuts to services at the rail operator, which wants to reduce the number of services across Scotland by 300 a day from next May.\nScotRail is currently run by Dutch firm Abellio - but will be taken over by a company owned and controlled by the Scottish government in March next year.\nThe move was announced by the government earlier this year after Abellio was stripped of its contract three years early amid concern over its performance. \nTransport Scotland said it welcomed constructive talks between all parties and that a \"significant offer\" has been made by employers since the RMT ballot opened.\nA spokeswoman said: \"We understand that the RMT will now ballot its membership again on the substance of this offer. We hope that RMT members and the other unions will agree and accept this offer, putting to an end existing and proposed industrial disputes and action.\n\"Rail workers have played their part in keeping the country moving through the pandemic and we are sure that they will see the importance of the moment and the role they can play in showing the best Scotland's Railway has to offer as we welcome world leaders from across the globe to COP26.\"\nMeanwhile, Chris Mitchell of the GMB denied cleansing workers in Glasgow were using the global climate conference as a bargaining chip.\nMr Mitchell claimed his members had been \"put in a corner\" by Cosla despite their \"heroic efforts\" during the pandemic.\nAnd he told Good Morning Scotland the current pay offer of \u00a3850 a year would only amount to an extra \u00a36.50 a week, after tax and National Insurance was taken off.\nMr Mitchell said he acknowledged the importance of COP26, but added: \"Cosla need to realise there is an emergency on their own door step.\"\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "tags": "David Amess,David Amess death,Southend-on-Sea,Leigh-on-Sea",
      "text": "The killing of Conservative MP Sir David Amess is being treated as a terrorist incident by police.\nSir David was stabbed multiple times at his constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex on Friday.\nThe Metropolitan Police said there was a potential link to Islamist extremism. A 25-year-old British man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel paid tribute to Sir David as a \"man of the people\" who was \"killed doing a job he loved\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer laid flowers at the scene together on Saturday morning.\nMs Patel and Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle also paid their respects outside Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea.\nSpeaking a short time later, Ms Patel said: \"We are all struggling to come to terms with the fact that David Amess has been so cruelly taken away from all of us.\"\nShe said the Southend West MP \"was absolutely there for everyone, he was a much loved parliamentarian, to me he was a dear and loyal friend, but also he was a devoted husband and father\".\nMs Patel, who has asked police forces to immediately review security arrangements for MPs, maintained a balance could be found to allow face-to-face meetings with constituents to continue.\n\"We will carry on, we live in an open society, a democracy,\" she said. \"We cannot be cowed by any individual or any motivation... to stop us from functioning\".\nSir David, 69, had been an MP since 1983 and was married with four daughters and a son. He is the second serving MP to be killed in recent years, following the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in July 2016. \nThe Met said officers are carrying out searches at two addresses in the London area and are not seeking anyone else over the death.\nThe force believes the man, who is in custody in Essex, acted alone but inquiries into the circumstances of the incident are continuing. \nGovernment sources have told the BBC he is a British national who, from initial inquiries, appears to be of Somali heritage.\nBBC security correspondent Frank Gardner reports Whitehall officials are saying the arrested man was not on a database of terror suspects.\nScotland Yard's decision that the killing of Sir David Amess was an act of terrorism confirms that, on the basis of what they know so far, the killer was motivated to use violence to further their cause. \nThere's no public suggestion from investigations at the moment that there is a specific additional threat to MPs - but detectives and colleagues in MI5 will be delving deeply into the life of the suspect to understand how he reached this mindset and whether this was an attack by a \"lone actor\" or someone who is part of a network. \nSecondly, it confirms the initial conclusion that there would need to be more resources thrown at the investigation. \nBehind the scenes a wider range of detectives and support staff will now have been brought into action. If officers have recovered the suspect's mobile phone, they will now be forensically examining its contents to uncover potential evidence of mindset and planning. \nA phone - and any bank cards - will also help detectives track the suspect's movements in the days and weeks before the incident. That in turn leads them to CCTV so they can build a three-dimensional view of his life. \nSir David was holding a constituency surgery - where voters can meet their MP and discuss concerns - at the church on Friday when he was attacked at 12:05 BST.\nThe Met later said the fatal stabbing was being declared a terrorist incident, with the investigation being led by Counter Terrorism Policing. \nPolice added: \"The early investigation has revealed a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism.\"\nOfficers are appealing for anyone with any information or with footage from CCTV, dash cams or video doorbell, to contact them.\nSouthend borough councillor John Lamb, who went to the scene after hearing the MP had been stabbed, said: \"The paramedics had been working on Sir David for over two and a half hours and they hadn't got him on the way to hospital. \n\"We knew it had to be extremely serious and that the worst scenario could occur - we were hoping it wouldn't but it did.\"\nBy Orla Moore & Richard Smith\nThe mood in Leigh-on-Sea, which Sir David represented for decades, is one of bewilderment.\nAs police and global media descend upon the usually quiet Essex town, people have gathered to pay tributes outside the Belfairs Methodist Church where the long-standing MP was attacked.\nResident Audrey Martin remembers him as \"an absolute gentleman\" who took time out to speak to her when she first moved to the area from Scotland.\n\"He just had this aura about him,\" she says.\nAnd constituent Lorraine Migliorini highlights Sir David's work for children and young people with special educational needs.\n\"He was genuinely interested and listened to them which was fantastic,\" she says. \"He got things done.\"\nJulie Everitt, who has co-ordinated a vigil for him, says she would \"always remember him for his genuine smile\" and his passion for animal rights.\n\"He would go on campaigns, he was against the badger cull, he was against trophy hunting and fox hunting,\" she says.\n\"He was a good gentleman, he had a good heart.\"\nRead more from Orla and Richard at the scene here.\nPaying tribute to Sir David on Friday, the prime minister described him as \"one of the kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics\".\nHouse of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle told BBC Two's Newsnight police were contacting all MPs to check on their security and reassure them.\nHe went ahead with his own constituency surgery on Friday evening, saying it was essential MPs retained their relationship with their constituents.\nBut Conservative MP Tobias Elwood - who came to the aid of a stabbed police officer during a terror attack in Westminster in 2017 - told the BBC he would recommend MPs temporarily stop having face-to-face meetings with constituents.\n\"You can move to Zoom... you can actually achieve an awful lot over the telephone,\" he said on Radio 4's World Tonight.\nAnd Kim Leadbeater, the sister of Mrs Cox and MP for Batley and Spen, said her partner had asked her to stand down from her role following Sir David's death.\nA Conservative backbencher for nearly 40 years, Sir David entered Parliament in 1983 as the MP for Basildon. \nHe held the seat in 1992, but switched to nearby Southend West at the 1997 election. \nRaised as a Roman Catholic, he was known politically as a social conservative and as a prominent campaigner against abortion and on animal welfare issues.  \nHe was also known for his championing of Southend, including a long-running campaign to win city status for the town.\nTributes have been paid to Sir David from across politics and within his local community.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he had an \"outstanding record of passing laws to help the most vulnerable\", adding \"we've lost today a fine public servant and a much loved-friend and colleague\".\nFather Jeff Woolnough, parish priest at nearby St Peter's Catholic Church, led a mass on Friday evening in memory of Sir David, who he called \"Mr Southend\".\nHe described him as a \"great, great guy\" and said faith communities had \"lost their greatest supporter\".\nSouthend councillor John Lamb said Sir David was \"a very good, hard working constituency MP who worked for everyone\".\nAnd Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was a \"dark and shocking day\", adding that the country had \"been here before\" with the death of Jo Cox.\nWere you in the area?

It contains a public forum, a library and a dance studio and theatre, as well as open terraces and roof gardens.\nIn a statement, Grafton Architects said they were \"delighted\" that their \"spatial open matrix\" had been selected, noting how they had always \"imagined a place where students would feel at home\".\n\"This building is about people, interaction, light, possibilities,\" they explained.\n\"It is about connecting to the community, the passer-by, an invitation to cross the threshold; a three-dimensional framework with layers of silence and layers of sound.\"\nVice-chancellor Professor Steven Spier said the students and community were \"truly proud\" of their new premises, which he described as \"breathtaking\" and \"innovative\".\nHe said: \"We had an incredibly ambitious brief - to create a space for students that would allow them to benefit from knowing each other, a library to inspire learning, dance studios and a softening of the threshold between gown and town.\"\nLast year's prize was cancelled due to the pandemic, but in 2019 it was won by an eco-friendly council estate in Norwich.\nThis year, Kingston University fended off competition from buildings including housing for key workers and a mosque in Cambridge.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Doctors,NHS,GP",
      "text": "A&E waits have sunk to their worst levels in England since the four-hour target started, with doctors warning the situation is bleak ahead of winter.\nA quarter of patients waited more than four hours for treatment in September - with even longer waits being recorded elsewhere in the UK.\nIt comes as ministers and GPs clashed over demands that practices see more patients face-to-face.\nThe government has handed GP practices \u00a3250m to take on temporary staff.\nBut the British Medical Association said they were \"hugely dismayed\" with the plan, saying it would not solve the problems.\nThe winter rescue package came on the day NHS England released its latest monthly data for hospital performance.\nLack of access to GPs has been cited as one of the reasons for growing pressures on A&Es.\nThe A&E performance in England was the worst performance since 2004, when the four-hour target was brought in. \nEven greater numbers are waiting over four hours in the other nations with four in 10 patients in Northern Ireland taking over four hours to be seen.\nIn England, A&E patients who then went on to be admitted to a ward also faced record-long waits for a bed, so-called \"trolley waits\" - they tend to be the most seriously-ill and frail patients.\nOf the 386,000 who were admitted, more than a quarter waited over four hours for a bed to become free. And more than 5,000 had to wait over 12 hours.\nDr Katherine Henderson, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: \"This data is bleak and is a stark warning of the crisis that we are heading towards this winter.\"\nShe added that emergency departments were \"dangerously\" over-crowded and there were widespread reports of ambulances queuing outside hospital because of the demands being placed on the system.\nThe \u00a3250m funding plan for GPs is part of the extra \u00a35bn Covid fund announced last month to help the NHS through the winter. It comes on top of the \u00a312bn set aside for GP services this year.\nAlongside locum doctors - doctors who stand in for others temporarily - GP practices will be able to use the money to recruit other temporary staff such as physios and podiatrists. Pharmacists are also being encouraged to see people with minor illness to relieve the pressure on GPs.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said the new GP rescue package would help relieve pressure on the whole system.\nOnly 58% of patients were seen face-to-face in August - the first full month following the ending of restrictions.\nThat compares with 54% in January and more than 80% before the pandemic.\nPatients have also complained of long waits on phone lines to book an appointment.\nKevin Fogarty said his 84-year-old mother was initially refused face-to-face contact with a GP, despite having an infection in her leg following a biopsy. \n\"She had not been seen for two years. However, an infection developed in the wound but the GP still wouldn't see her. We had to put pressure on them.\"\nMr Fogarty, 60, said the practice in Somerset eventually agreed to see her in person and she is now getting home visits from a nurse to tend to her wound.\n\"GPs seem to be the only group not getting back to normal services, while the likes of shop workers and everyone else are getting on with it. \n\"Telephone and video calls are helpful as an initial consultation, but the GP must see the patient should they insist or there is a requirement.\"\nAlongside the extra money, social distancing rules are also expected to be relaxed in GP surgeries and responsibility for signing fitness-to-work and fitness-to-drive certificates will be able to be passed on to other staff.\nMr Javid said: \"I'm determined to ensure patients can see their GP in the way they want, no matter where they live.\n\"Our new plan provides general practice teams with investment and targeted support. This will tackle underperformance, taking pressure off staff so they can spend more time with patients and increase the number of face-to-face appointments.\"\nGP surgeries will be named in league tables if they are judged to have failed to provide an appropriate level of \"access\". \nBut Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, said he was \"hugely dismayed\" with the package. \"It offers very little and shows a government out of touch with the scale of the crisis on the ground.\"\nHe said patients would \"continue to suffer\" and find it harder to book appointments.\n\"It is disappointing to see there is no end in sight to the preoccupation with face-to-face appointments.\"\nHe said in-person appointments were still a key feature of GP care but the pandemic had proven phone or video consultations were \"entirely appropriate and appreciated\" by many.\nThe rescue package comes amid the government's ongoing struggle to increase the number of GPs.\nOver the past five years the total - in terms of full-time posts - has fallen despite successive government drives to increase numbers.\nNHS Providers, which represents health bosses, said its members were particularly worried about A&Es alongside mental health and cancer services. \nDeputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said: \"The NHS is fighting fires on multiple fronts as they try to recover care backlogs, increased demand for emergency care, treating patients with Covid and preparing for what is likely to be the most challenging winter yet for the NHS. \n\"In a matter of weeks, we will face our first winter where both flu and Covid are in circulation.\""

      "text": "Clueless actress Stacey Dash has said she \"lost everything\" after becoming addicted to painkiller tablets.\nThe 54-year-old, best known for playing Dionne Davenport in the 1995 high school comedy movie, told US TV she was taking up to 20 Vicodin pills a day at one stage.\nSpeaking on The Dr Oz Show, she said: \"I was taking 18-20 pills a day.\"\n\"That's expensive,\" noted the host, before a tearful Dash replied: \"Yeah, I lost everything.\"\nDash, whose parents also suffered with drug addictions, went on to say she had recently celebrated five years of being sober.\n\"The greatest blessing is that not only have I been able to be honest with myself and become a better person,\" she said.\n\"I've been able to understand my parents and that they did love me, and that they were doing the best they could and they were just sick. They were addicted.\"\nVicodin is a popular brand of prescription drug - a hybrid of the pain medications hydrocodone and paracetamol - used to treat moderate to severe pain.\nIn July, four US drugs giants agreed to pay $26bn (\u00a319bn) to settle claims they helped fuel an opioid addiction crisis. Last month in the UK, new research suggested that the use of opioids for pain relief soared during the pandemic as some patients waited longer for surgery.\nClueless, which starred Alicia Silverstone, alongside Dash, Brittany Murphy and Paul Rudd, was loosely based on Jane Austen's 1815 novel Emma, and set in present-day Beverly Hills. Silverstone plays its central character, a schoolgirl called Cher, who sees herself as a matchmaker who goes on to give her new friend a makeover.\nIn 2016, Dash, who moved from acting into political commentary, defended herself after calling to scrap Black History Month, while discussing the lack of diversity at that year's Oscar nominations on US network Fox.\nShe was criticised on social media for her comments at the time, and responded by saying: \"I don't need a special month or special channel.

We are grateful for all their efforts to keep us safe.\"\nHowever senior doctors have said while military help is welcomed, it will be a short term measure and will \"barely scratch the surface\" of providing the staff that is needed.\nDr Lewis Morrison, chair of BMA Scotland, said: \"It demonstrates that things are on a knife edge in the areas where this is happening - but there are many other places where staff are spread incredibly thinly and close to if not at the same level of pressure.\n\"We need politicians on all sides to be honest with the public about what the NHS can deliver right now and over this expected long winter. \n\"Each passing week and story of a service in crisis underlines the urgent need for a clear workforce plan to address those huge short, medium and long term staffing issues and a plan that focuses firstly and squarely on caring for and retaining the staff we have because recruiting extra people takes time.\"\nThe Scottish Conservative's health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane called the Mr Yousaf's winter plan \"belated\" and said the effects were being \"keenly felt\" by staff.\nHe said: \"We aren't even into the peak winter period, yet my colleagues on the frontline are already well beyond breaking point.\n\"He must now urgently guarantee the support from our military will be maximised at every turn for these health boards. Otherwise a truly terrible winter in our NHS is set to occur on his watch.\"\nBoth the Borders and Lanarkshire health boards have already halted all non-urgent procedures.\nLast month the medical director of NHS Borders urged the public to \"be kind\" to staff facing \"unprecedented challenges\".\nDr Lynn McCallum said they were busier than in the \"busiest winter\"."

      "text": "It's been described as one of the Russian capital's best-kept secrets: Moscow's restaurants are excellent. \nNow the secret is out.\nMichelin has published a Moscow Guide, heaping praise on Russian chefs and serving up its prestigious awards. Seven restaurants received one star. Two were awarded two stars.\n\"Inspectors have been particularly seduced by the high-quality local produce,\" said Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin Guide International Director. \n\"I'm super happy,\" chef Ivan Berezutsky told the BBC. \"It's the favourite moment of my professional life. It's a fantastic moment for Moscow and for Russia.\"\nIvan and his brother Sergey are the twin chefs of Twins Garden. Their restaurant received two stars, plus an extra Green star award for sustainable practices.\nHow times have changed. When I lived in Moscow in the 1980s, eating out was a chore and a challenge. Restaurants had a reputation for surly service, poor choice and less than appetizing fare. I'll never forget the \"Closed for Lunch\" sign often hung on restaurant doors.\nToday the choice of cuisine is mindboggling. Moscow has everything from gastropubs to kosher cafes. Ethiopian, Brazilian, Vietnamese - you name it, you can find it here. Soviet service (thank goodness) is a thing of the past. And food quality is generally very good.  \nMichelin believes that Moscow could become a new culinary destination for tourists and travellers. And if it does? Some think that foreigners flocking here for the food might somehow ease political tensions between Russia and the West.\n\"We are so separate right now, unfortunately,\" says chef Vladimir Mukhin of the White Rabbit restaurant, which received a Michelin star. \"It's like if you have a problem with your wife, but you have breakfast with her at the same table, then you have a future. The table can unite everyone.\"\nThe authorities here are hoping that the Michelin Moscow Guide 2022 will project a more positive image of the Russian capital. \n\"I am proud that Moscow's restaurants have become a calling card for our wonderful city,\" said Moscow's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin at a ceremony near the Kremlin.\nBut while the belief is that a gastronomic calling card can bring in more tourists, there's just one problem.\nAlthough Russia has taken a great leap forward in terms of cafes and restaurants, the picture is less positive in other areas: like the state of democracy and the high level of anti-western rhetoric here. \nIt's things like that which may reduce the appetite of foreign tourists to visit Russia."

      "text": "The autumn rugby internationals should be protected events that have to be shown live on free-to-air terrestrial television, Plaid Cymru has said.\nA deal with Amazon Prime this year ensures no free-to-air live coverage.\nIn 2020, Wales' fixtures were screened live on both Amazon Prime and S4C - this year fans must pay Amazon to do so, with highlights later on S4C.\nThe Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said the current system of \"listed events\" worked well. \nWriting to Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Nadine Dorries, Plaid's Heledd Fychan asked her to give the autumn internationals, as well as Six Nations rugby matches and all Wales' football internationals, Category A status under the 1996 Broadcasting Act.\nThey would then be joining events including the FA Cup Final, the Grand National and Olympic Games.\nOn Wednesday, S4C chief executive Owen Evans told the Senedd's culture committee that the new exclusive Amazon Prime deal, including an option for Welsh language commentary, was a \"retrograde step\".\n\"We in Wales could argue that this is one of the crown jewels, now people will have to pay to watch Wales playing international games over the autumn,\" he said.\nS4C will only show highlights of the games against New Zealand, South Africa, Fiji and Australia, in October and November, an hour after the final whistle.\nMs Fychan wrote that the new arrangements are \"deeply disappointing\", describing rugby as \"not only a widely loved sport in Wales\" but also \"one which forms part of our wider culture and identity\". \n\"The vast majority of Wales' rugby audience watches matches from their home or local pub, not in the stadium, by putting a price on viewing the autumn international series fans are being denied the ability to follow their national team, regardless of their personal circumstances,\" she writes.\n\"Furthermore sport on S4C is often a gateway to the language for many Welsh learners, yet one that will sadly be shut by this retrograde decision.\"\nThe Senedd member warned that the new Amazon deal \"sets a dangerous precedent for the future of sports broadcasting in Welsh\". \n\"Not only have S4C lost the right to broadcast Welsh rugby matches, but it puts in place a model that could be adopted by other broadcasters in the future,\" she said.\n\"Welsh rugby belongs to everyone in Wales - we must not be priced out of our own culture,\" Ms Fychan added.\nA DCMS spokesperson said: \"We believe that the current listed events regime works well and strikes an appropriate balance between retaining free-to-air sports events for the public while allowing rights holders to negotiate agreements in the best interests of their sport.\n\"We're supportive of the positive contribution S4C makes to the Welsh economy and the vital role it plays in promoting the Welsh language.\" \nAmazon has also been asked to comment."

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Cardiff,COP26,Climate change,Queen Elizabeth II",
      "text": "The Queen has appeared to suggest she is irritated by people who \"talk\" but \"don't do\", ahead of next month's climate change summit.\nHer reported remarks were overheard during the opening of the Welsh parliament on Thursday.\nThe monarch, who is due to attend the UN's COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, said she did not know who was coming to the event.\nPrince Charles and Prince William have also spoken of their climate concerns.\nGlobal leaders are meeting in Glasgow between 31 October and 12 November to negotiate a new deal to stall rising global temperatures.\nUS President Joe Biden and members of the G7 nations will be attending COP26. On Friday, after weeks of hesitation, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison also confirmed he will be at the summit. \nBut there are reports China's President Xi Jinping would not be attending, although the country will be represented by its government officials in Glasgow. \nDowning Street said it was up to individual countries to confirm attendances at COP26.\nVideo clips featuring the Queen's conversation during the opening of the Senedd were picked up by the event's live stream camera, according to the Daily Mail.\nThe clips - parts of which are inaudible - show the Queen chatting with the Duchess of Cornwall and Elin Jones, the Senedd's presiding officer.\nThe Queen appears to say: \"I've been hearing all about COP... I still don't know who's coming.\"\nIn a separate clip, she remarks \"we only know about people who are not coming\", before adding: \"It's really irritating when they talk, but they don't do.\"\nMs Jones appears to reference the Duke of Cambridge in her reply to the Queen's remarks, saying she had been watching him \"on television this morning saying there's no point going into space, we need to save the Earth\".\nBy Sean Coughlan, BBC royal correspondent\nThis wasn't a formal intervention from the Queen, but a few private words that were overheard.\nThat her comments about climate change are making headlines shows how unusual it is to hear the Queen's private thoughts on public matters - because her role requires her to stay outside of political debate.\nThis rare insight suggests the 95-year-old Queen remains very engaged with the current issues around the COP26 summit - in a week when Prince Charles and Prince William were also talking about protecting the environment.\nBut it also shows the occupational hazard of being followed everywhere by cameras and microphones. \nAnd in her comments about having \"no idea\" who was coming to COP26, there was also a glimpse of a slightly exasperated host, not sure who was going to turn up for an event. \nPrince William spoke to the BBC's Newscast on Thursday, and suggested entrepreneurs should focus on saving Earth rather than engaging in space tourism.\nHe also warned the COP26 summit against \"clever speak, clever words but not enough action\", saying it was \"critical\" for the world leaders to \"communicate very clearly and very honestly what the problems are and what the solutions are going to be\".\nIn an interview with the BBC's climate editor Justin Rowlatt, the Prince of Wales said he was worried that world leaders would \"just talk\" when they meet, saying: \"The problem is to get action on the ground\"."

      "text": "Waving their hands excitedly in the air, a class of six- and seven-year-old girls eagerly try to get their teacher's attention, each one desperate to be chosen to answer a question about Persian grammar. \nThe Manouchehri primary school in Kabul was among the first to re-open for girls following the US invasion in 2001 and the defeat of the Taliban. Back then, there was just a single room, with pupils sat on a mud floor. \nUnder Taliban rule, beginning in Kabul in 1996, girls weren't allowed to get an education, and female teachers were ordered to stay at home. \nAisha Misbah was one of them. Now she's headteacher and proudly shows off newly built classrooms. \nMany of those she taught have gone on to become doctors, engineers or even teachers at the school, she says. \n\"This is our biggest achievement. Our students are so bright. They're so creative and make such beautiful things that even we get shocked. I hope the Taliban will allow it all to continue.\"\nSince taking over Afghanistan for a second time, the Taliban have permitted girls to go to school. \nFor now, however, only primary school pupils of both genders are attending classes, whilst teachers await the publication of new rules governing secondary schools. \nIn some more rural areas, there have long been reports of Taliban commanders only permitting girls to go to school until they reach the age of puberty. \nThe most recent figures from the World Bank show that about 40% of Afghan girls attend primary school, far more than during the Taliban's previous stint in power but far fewer than in other countries in the region. \nIt's a similar picture in healthcare, where infant and maternal mortality rates have improved but remain shockingly high.  \nThe Taliban insist women will be allowed to work, but some remain sceptical, especially after Taliban officials recently said most women, other than those working in healthcare or education, should stay at home until security improves. \nThe same excuse was given throughout the 1990s to completely prevent women working.\nBut the pupils at Manouchehri face other challenges, too.\nIn the playground, three large tents have been erected, with desks and blackboards. The school is so overcrowded that about half of the pupils have to study outside. \nPleas to the previous government fell on deaf ears, and when non-government organisations offered to help, they were told to give the money to the education ministry first. \nRampant corruption has plagued Afghanistan over the past two decades, and it meant that the billions of dollars of international support didn't always make it to those in need. \nThe education system has helped mould, however, a generation of young Afghan women and men who are vocal in standing up for their views, including challenging the Taliban.\n\"We are not those men and women of 20 years ago,\" one female protester at a demonstration in Kabul tells me, \"who were whipped into submission.\"\nAnother, her voice pulsing with emotion says: \"We are not afraid of death. We are the young generation who will bring forth the buds of peace.\" \nThe new government announced by the Taliban consists entirely of members of the group, all of whom are men. \nMany had served in senior positions during the Taliban's reign during the 1990s, a period marked by a brutal interpretation of sharia law. \nFor many others in more rural areas, where attitudes are more socially conservative, the greater social freedoms some have grown up with in bigger cities since 2001 feel irrelevant when compared with the suffering of living along the frontline.\nFew Afghans have been unaffected by the war, irrespective of their background, but in villages caught along bloody frontlines, many have welcomed the arrival of the Taliban - for at least bringing an end to the violence. \nIf the price of peace is greater cultural authoritarianism, some are more willing to pay it than others.  \nAt a snooker club in Kabul, less than a week after the city was taken over by the Taliban, I meet a group of young men from the city's middle class. \nA mix of students and business owners, speaking on condition of anonymity, they're scathing about the Taliban. \nOne says they look like \"zombies\", worrying they will soon start dictating whether or not men can shave their beards or how they can style their hair, whilst others question how they can trust a group responsible for so many suicide bombings and attacks. \nBut they're also all damning about Afghanistan's political class. \nAshraf Ghani, the former president who fled abroad, \"should be arrested\", they proclaim. \n\"He sold out the future of all young people,\" says one of the group, accusing him of having escaped with millions of dollars - the allegation Mr Ghani denies. \nThey're equally dismissive of those politicians who have stayed in the country but who over the years have often taken part in deeply disruptive political spats. \n\"They weren't trying to solve the problems of ordinary people, but just trying to fill their own pockets and share the wealth with their own relatives.\" \nThe last two presidential elections in Afghanistan ended in standoffs, with widespread allegations of voter fraud. \nNevertheless, however flawed the previous democratic system was, the young men at the snooker club deeply rue its passing. \n\"We've worked hard and are educated. We could've lifted the country up but now we can't do anything to serve it.\" \nOf all the \"gains\" made over the past two decades, the creation of an independent local media is one the principal success stories. \nNews organisations were amongst the freest in the region, despite being violently targeted by militants. \nJournalists did at times face threats from the government.\nFor example, former Vice-President Amrullah Saleh, now a leading figure in the National Resistance Front, once ordered the arrest of those responsible for \"fake news\" about civilian deaths as a result of a 2020 government air strike in Takhar province, in which it's believed 12 children were killed.\nHowever, recent days have raised fears the Taliban will not tolerate coverage they perceive as negative. \nWhilst the group initially claimed they would allow a free press as long as journalists don't breach \"Islamic values\" or the \"national interest\", reporters covering recent, peaceful protests against the group have at times been detained and badly beaten. \nEarlier this week, 22 year-old Taqi Daryabi and a colleague were taken away by the Taliban from a demonstration they had been covering to a police station. \n\"There were around seven to 10 men in one room, they all started kicking me, and beating me with sticks and rubber pipes,\" Taqi told the BBC, his back and face still covered in bruises. \n\"One Talib told me, 'be grateful I didn't cut your head off,'\" Taqi says. \"Now that the Taliban are here, no-one can feel safe. In the past we have seen them kill, kidnap and beat journalists\u2026 they should allow us to work freely.\"  \nThe legacy of American and international intervention in Afghanistan will be deeply contested. \nSigns of the US influence are already fading first. \nAt \"Bush Bazaar\", named after the former American president and famous for selling military gear smuggled out of international bases, most of the flak jackets or rifle scopes on sale are now Chinese replicas. \nWhereas army soldiers or private security guards hired by politically powerful Afghans were once the main customers, now Taliban fighters stroll past the shops. \nOne, Fatih, from the eastern province of Khost, is looking for a new set of boots. He's disappointed, he hoped to buy some that had been made in America, but \"everything is Chinese\". "

      "tags": "Denmark,Norway",
      "text": "A deadly bow and arrow attack in Norway which left five people dead appears to have been an act of terror, Norway's security service (PST) said. \nThe suspect, a 37-year-old Danish citizen named Espen Andersen Brathen, had converted to Islam and there were fears he had been radicalised.\nHowever a motive has not yet been determined.\nHe is accused of killing four women and a man on Wednesday night in the southern town of Kongsberg.\nIn a press release on Thursday (in Norwegian), police said Brathen was due to appear in court on Friday at 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT).\nA police lawyer told public broadcaster NRK he would be assessed by psychiatrists. During a press conference PST head Hans Sverre Sjovold said the suspect had been \"in and out of the health system for some time\".\nResidents have been deeply shaken by the violence.\nFlags were flown at half-mast on Thursday while flowers and other memorials were placed in Kongsberg's main square.\nThe victims were all aged between 50 and 70, regional police chief Ole Bredrup Saeverud told reporters at a Thursday morning news briefing. \nThe attack was first reported at 18:13 (16:13 GMT) on Wednesday. Police confronted the man six minutes later, but he shot several arrows at them and escaped. He was eventually caught about 30 minutes later.\nIt was during this time, between being first approached and then arrested, that the victims were killed, the police chief said.\nA woman was also stabbed at a nearby intersection, witnesses told local media.\nPolice fired warning shots when he was eventually arrested, but it is not clear if officers were armed when they first came across the suspect. Norwegian police do not usually carry guns on them - weapons are stored at police stations or in their patrol cars. \nThe attack was Norway's deadliest since far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik murdered 77 people, most of them teenagers, on the island of Utoya in July 2011.\nThe attacker allegedly launched the assault inside a Coop Extra supermarket on Kongsberg's west side. One of those injured was an off-duty police officer who was in the shop at the time. \nThe officer and another person who was wounded are recovering in hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\nPolice on Thursday said a third person had also been injured, and was taken to the emergency room. \nPolice prosecutor Ann Ir\u00e9n Svane Mathiassen told NRK that from what they could tell all those attacked were \"completely random victims\".\nShe said the police believed the man went into people's homes to kill them during the attack.\nOne witness told local outlet TV2 she had heard a commotion and saw a woman taking cover, then a \"man standing on the corner with arrows in a quiver on his shoulder and a bow in his hand\".\n\"Afterwards, I saw people running for their lives. One of them was a woman holding a child by the hand,\" she added.\nPolice have told Norwegian news agency NTB that the attacker also used other weapons during the incident, without giving more details.\nThe suspect moved over a large area, and authorities cordoned off several parts of the town. \nResidents were ordered to stay indoors so authorities could examine the scene and gather evidence. Police searched surrounding gardens and garages with the help of sniffer dogs.\nKongsberg Mayor Kari Anne Sand said it was a shocking attack in an area where many people lived, and that a crisis team would help anyone affected.\nDescribing the town as \"a completely ordinary community with completely ordinary people\", Ms Sand said everyone had been deeply shaken by \"this very tragic situation\".\nBritish woman Fiona Herland, who has lived in Kongsberg for five years, described the town as \"a very warm, cosy place - nothing happens here.\"\n\"This is absolutely devastating. You can feel the atmosphere here has darkened,\" she told the BBC.\nOfficers took the suspect to a police station in the town of Drammen, where his defence lawyer, Fredrik Neumann, said he was questioned for more than three hours and was co-operating with authorities.\nThe suspect had a Danish mother and Norwegian father, he said. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Danish authorities will work with their Norwegian counterparts on the investigation. \nPolice prosecutor Ann Ir\u00e9n Svane Mathiassen told TV2 that the man lived in Kongsberg and was known to police. \nThe attack came on the final day of then-Prime Minister Erna Solberg's conservative government. On Thursday morning, Labour leader Jonas Gahr Store became Norway's new Prime minister with a centre-left coalition.\nMr Store said it was a \"gruesome and brutal act\".\nNATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, who is from Oslo, said it was \"shocking news\".\nBows and arrows are not classed as illegal weapons in Norway. Buying and owning them is permitted, and owners are not required to register them, although they must be used at designated archery ranges.\nAfter the attack, police officers nationwide were ordered to carry firearms as an extra precaution, but there is \"no indication so far that there is a change in the national threat level,\" the directorate said in a statement (in Norwegian). \nThe PST said the level would remain at moderate.\nAre you in the area?

      "text": "Tributes have been pouring in to Conservative MP Sir David Amess, who has died after being stabbed in his constituency in Essex.\nBoris Johnson - who laid flowers at the scene on Saturday - said he was one of the \"one of the kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics\". \nLabour's Sir Keir Starmer, who went to Essex with the PM, hailed Sir David's \"profound sense of public duty\".\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he was a \"bright light of Parliament\". \nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said they were \"shocked and saddened\" by the death of Sir David, who \"dedicated 40 years of his life to serving his community\".  \nSir David was stabbed whilst holding a constituency surgery, where voters can meet their local MP and discuss concerns.\nA 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after the attack at a church in Leigh-on-Sea. Police are treating the killing as a terrorist incident.\nA Conservative backbencher for nearly 40 years, Sir David entered Parliament as the MP for Basildon following the 1983 general election.\nHe switched seats in 1997, when he was elected MP for nearby Southend West - the Essex constituency he represented until his death. \nHis constituents have spoken of their shock at his killing, with residents choking back tears as they spilled on to the streets after his death.\nFather Jeff Woolnough - a parish priest in Sir David's constituency said the MP had \"that great ability to communicate at all different levels\".\n \"Through that wonderful smile he could placate and just settle an awkward discussion very quickly - it is a great gift.\"\nConservative councillor Kevin Buck said the MP had \"died doing what he loved - meeting the people and helping the people\".\nSpeaking to BBC Essex, Judith Canham, the former deputy chair of the Southend West Conservative Association, said Sir David had a \"photographic memory\".\n\"Sometimes I'd be out canvassing with him and he'd see someone he hadn't seen for a long time and he'd say 'how was your hip operation?'.\"\nDavid Stanley - founder of the children's disability charity the Music Man project which Sir David supported - said his friend \"loved grand ideas and coming up with amazing statements\".\n\"We were going to conquer Broadway, we were going to break a world record - which we later did at the Palladium,\" he said referring to the time the charity performed the largest ever triangle ensemble.\nVirginia Lewis-Jones, the daughter of Dame Vera Lynn, says Sir David was a passionate supporter of a proposed memorial to the late singer.\nShe said he would \"grab it like a terrier\" when he committed himself to campaigning on any issue.\nFellow Tory MP Andrew Rosindell said Sir David was his \"oldest friend\" in Parliament, and he felt \"sick inside at what has happened\".\n\"We've all lost a very special person in our lives,\" he added. \nLabour MP Harriet Harman entered the House of Commons in 1982, one year before Sir David and remembers it as a \"polarised\" time.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Today programme, she said had been \"determined not to have friendly relations with any Conservative MPs, but it was impossible to sustain that with David Amess because he was so friendly and so determined to work with MPs on other causes\".\nMr Johnson said Sir David was \"a fine public servant and a much loved friend and colleague\" who \"believed passionately in this country\".\nThe PM also praised his \"outstanding record\" of campaigning in Parliament, where he was known for his activism on animal welfare. \nMr Johnson's predecessor Theresa May said his death was \"heartbreaking\" and a \"tragic day for our democracy\". \nShe added that Sir David was a \"decent man and respected parliamentarian, killed in his own community while carrying out his public duties\".\nFormer prime minister David Cameron called Sir David a \"thoroughly decent man\" and \"the most committed MP you could ever hope to meet\".\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay said Sir David had built a \"built a reputation for kindness and generosity\" during his decades-long career as an MP. \nSir Lindsay confirmed that MPs would be given time to pay tribute to Sir David in the Commons, when they return from recess on Monday. \nHis predecessor as speaker, John Bercow, said Sir David was a \"wonderful loving human being\" and \"quintessentially a constituency parliamentarian\".\n\"He could talk to and hear from and engage with anybody, from a monarch to the local milk person,\" he added. \nSir David is the second MP to be killed in the past five years, following the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016.\nShe was killed outside a library in Birstall, West Yorkshire, where she was due to hold a constituency surgery.\nJo Cox's sister Kim Leadbeater, who is now the Labour MP for the Batley seat she represented, said she was \"totally shocked to think that something so horrific could happen again to another MP and family\".\nSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Sir David was a \"thoroughly decent man, who was well-liked across parties and the House of Commons.\" "

      "text": "Plans to use ozone machines to disinfect classrooms have been abandoned, the Welsh government has confirmed.\nThe machines are potentially \"highly harmful\" to children, a review found.\nMinisters were previously accused of making a \"spectacular U-turn\" after plans for the machines were paused for a safety review.\nOpposition parties Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives said they welcomed the move.\nWelsh ministers had previously announced they would spend \u00a33.31m on 1,800 new ozone machines developed by Swansea University.\nOn Thursday, the Welsh government said this cash would instead be used in schools and colleges to improve ventilation.\nAt the time Swansea University had defended the safety of the machines.\nThe university said \"extensive testing had taken place over eight months\" within its classrooms \"as well as in three very different school scenarios\".\nHowever, the Welsh government said a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) review concluded that ozone machines are not suitable for use in education settings. \nThe review warned that the gas ozone, which can be used as a disinfectant \"is a highly harmful indoor pollutant which is associated with harm to human health at low concentrations and damages diverse and integral components of indoor environments\".\nIt found that children and those with underlying respiratory conditions were \"particularly sensitive to ozone exposure\" and that the gas \"reacts with a range of compounds present indoors to generate persistent harmful secondary aerosols\".\nThe study also concluded that the evidence for effective ozone disinfection \"is limited in scope and quality\". \nIt said the deployment of an ozone machines would have required \"substantial resources to ensure their safety\".\nA Gwynedd-based GP, Dr Eilir Hughes, said when the initial announcement about the machines was made, he researched the technology, saying: \"I quickly realised it was a very bad idea. I couldn't even think of a single good reason for doing it.\"\nSpeaking to Oliver Hides on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Hughes said he believed it was \"bad potentially for human health\" and also the environment if it leaked.\nDr Hughes also questioned if it would have been the most effective way of stopping the most dominant strains of Covid spreading.\nThe Welsh Conservatives' education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said the Labour policy was \"sadly not thought through\" and that \"educating our young people and keeping them safe has to be the priority\".\nSian Gwenllian, Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman, welcomed the move to \"pull the plug on the controversial and ill-fated ozone machine scheme\", adding the earmarked funding should go towards improving schools' air circulation. \nHowever, the roll out of carbon dioxide monitors in classrooms, colleges and lecture halls in Wales is to be completed by mid-November, Wales' education minister has said.\nThe monitors will notify teachers and lecturers when CO2 levels rise, so they can identify where ventilation needs to be improved. \nWales' Education and Welsh Language Minister Jeremy Miles said the investment for ventilation improvements and carbon dioxide monitor roll out will \"help keep transmission rates low\".\nLaura Doel, director of teaching union NAHT Cymru, said the body is \"pleased that additional funding will be made available to schools\", however Wales' existing measures \"do not go far enough to support schools\".\n\"It is crucial that schools do not end up having to foot the bill to fix ventilation problems,\" she added.\nDavid Evans, the National Education Union Cymru's secretary, welcomed the ventilation investment, saying it was \"critical to ensuring that education can remain open over the winter for as much of the time as possible\"."

      "text": "The rules on the number of deliveries overseas lorry drivers can make in the UK are set to be relaxed in a bid to tackle supply chain problems in the run-up to Christmas.\nUnder the new plans, drivers will be able to make unlimited deliveries or collections within a 14 day period. \nCurrently EU drivers can only make two pick-ups or drop-offs each week.\nIt is hoped the changes will happen by December - but UK drivers fear they might lose work to cheaper EU rivals.\nThe UK's lorry driver shortage - due to a combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors - has affected petrol stations, supermarkets and left containers piled up at Felixstowe Port unable to be moved.\nRetailers have also warned there could be shortages of items such as toys at Christmas, with shoppers urged to buy gifts early.\nLast month, the government announced it would grant up to 5,000 temporary visas for HGV drivers from abroad - but so far only a fraction have been issued. \nAnd the first foreign drivers brought in on the visa scheme may not even arrive for another month, sources have told BBC transport correspondent Carrie Davies.\nBut now ministers are going further, and plan to make temporary changes to cabotage rules, which govern how many jobs a haulier can make in a foreign country.\nIt means foreign HGV drivers that come into the country laden with goods can pick up and drop off items an unlimited number of times for two weeks before they return home.\nThe changes still need to be approved after a one-week consultation - but if passed they will come into force \"towards the end of this year for up to six months\", according to the government.\nIt would mean thousands more HGV deliveries each month, the government said, so more goods - especially food and items that come via ports - can get delivered on schedule.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: \"Having some additional capacity right now... it is a good idea. This is a quick way of doing it. It doesn't require visas, it's just a common sense measure. \n\"It is one of very many things. I don't think it is going to undercut or suppress the market.\"\nMr Shapps said problems with supply chains were a global issue. \nHe added: \"It is very tight but our supply chain is pretty robust. They have worked through coronavirus and they will work through this as well.\"\nBut the haulage industry said the measures would undercut British operators.\nRod McKenzie, from the Road Haulage Association, told BBC's Today programme: \"Well, I spoke to some of our members last night, and they were appalled. 'Ridiculous', 'pathetic', 'gobsmacked' were some of their more broadcastable comments.\n\"The government has been talking about a high-wage, high-skill economy, and not pulling the lever marked 'uncontrolled immigration', and to them this is exactly what it looks like. \n\"Allowing overseas haulage companies and drivers to come over for up to six months on a fortnightly basis to do unlimited work at low rates, undercutting UK hauliers who\u2026 are facing an acute driver shortage, rising costs, staff wages.\n\"So this is about taking work from British operators and drivers and giving it to Europeans who don't pay tax here and pay peanuts to their drivers.\n\"We don't want cabotage [the transportation of goods in one country by operators from another] to sabotage our industry.\"\nThe Unite union has raised the prospect of possible industrial action in protest at what it sees as poor pay and conditions in the industry.\n\"The treatment of drivers across the board has been nothing short of a disgrace,\" said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham.\n\"As the prime minister said recently, the answer to the driver shortage is better wages and improved conditions. This is what we demand. \n\"Now is the time for action not words. It's time for employers to pay workers a proper rate for the job. \n\"Unite will be consulting its members before deciding on next steps, including exploring the options for industrial action.\"\nMr Shapps said the long-term answer to the supply chain issues \"must be developing a high-skill, high-wage economy here in the UK\".\nBut talking about the latest measures, he said: \"The temporary changes we're consulting on to cabotage rules will also make sure foreign hauliers in the UK can use their time effectively and get more goods moving in the supply chain at a time of high demand.\"\nAccording to France's finance minister, the UK is faring worse in the supply chain crisis because it left the single market after Brexit.\n\"We are facing the same situation,\" said Bruno Le Maire at the G7 meeting in Washington. \"But the fact that we are a member of a very important single market helps us facing these bottlenecks.\"\nOn Thursday, the government said it was also giving hundreds of foreign abattoir workers temporary visas, to help fix the shortage of workers in slaughterhouses.\nThe shortage of staff in abattoirs means pigs are not being killed fast enough, and there is not enough space on farms so farmers are having to kill them themselves.\nFarmers have already destroyed 6,600 healthy pigs due to a backlog on farms, the National Pig Association said."

      "tags": "United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The US has said that it will reopen its borders to fully vaccinated travellers from 33 countries on 8 November.\nUnder new rules announced by the White House, vaccinated people who have had a negative test in the 72 hours before travelling will be allowed to enter.\nThe move marks the end of the tough restrictions that have been imposed on travellers since early last year.\n\"This policy is guided by public health, stringent and consistent,\" a White House spokesman said.\nThe new rules will apply to Schengen countries - a group of 26 European nations - as well as the UK, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Ireland, and South Africa.\nThe current rules bar entry to most non-US citizens who have been in the UK, China, India, South Africa, Iran, Brazil or a number of European countries within the last 14 days.\nHowever, the policy has caused controversy, as passengers from 150 other countries, many of whom have struggled with high rates of Covid infection, have continued to enter the US freely. \nOfficials announced that people who have been jabbed with one of the vaccines that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or have been granted an Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization (WHO) will qualify under the system. \nThe Emergency Use aspect will allow travellers who have received the AstraZeneca jab, widely used in the UK, as well as China's Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines, to enter the country. \nIt was also confirmed that travellers will not be required to go into quarantine upon entering the country. \nThe announcement was swiftly celebrated by would-be travellers across the globe.\nAmong them was Kent resident Dan Johnson, who told the BBC he had been unable to visit his father in the US before he died of cancer in March. \n\"I never got to say goodbye and hadn't seen him since 2019 due to the travel restrictions,\" he said.  \"It's been the hardest thing in the world. Lifting the ban feels much too late, but does mean that I can finally visit my step-mum and help her sort dad's belongings.\" \nAnother UK resident, Kate Urquhart, said she would be travel to Los Angeles to see the final concert of American rock band The Monkees' farewell tour in November.\n\"I was almost resigned to not going,\" she said. \"Today's announcement is great news.\"\nFriday's announcement sheds light on the changes first announced back in September. Biden administration officials had initially said the new policy would go into place in \"early November,\" leaving many foreign nationals unsure when to make or adjust their travel plans. \nVirgin Atlantic CEO Shai Weiss welcomed the move and said it reflected the success of the global vaccine rollout. \n\"The UK will now be able to strengthen ties with our most important economic partner, the US, boosting trade and tourism as well as reuniting friends, families and business colleagues,\" she said.  \nThe US has lagged behind many other countries in removing its travel restrictions, prompting friction with a number of its allies.   \nOn Tuesday, US officials announced that restrictions at its land borders with Canada and Mexico for fully vaccinated foreign nationals would also end. \nHowever, unvaccinated travellers will continue to be barred from entering at land borders.

      "tags": "David Amess,David Amess death,Leigh-on-Sea",
      "text": "Conservative MP Sir David Amess died after being stabbed multiple times at his Essex constituency surgery, in what police are treating as a terrorist incident.\nHere's how the attack unfolded and what we know so far. \nThe MP for Southend West was stabbed at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea, in Essex. He was there for one of his regular Friday meetings with his constituents.\nJust 15 minutes before the attack, the 69-year-old was standing on the church steps, chatting and laughing with locals.\nAt about 12:05 BST on Friday, Sir David walked into the church alongside two female members of his staff to meet more constituents.  \nLocal councillor John Lamb said that it was then a man emerged from a small group of waiting constituents and attacked Sir David, stabbing him several times.\nMr Lamb later shared the accounts of Sir David's two assistants. \nHe described how one was in the room with Sir David taking notes. \"All of a sudden there was a scream from her, because the person deliberately whipped out a knife and started stabbing David.\n\"The other lady, who was getting names from people outside, she came running in and saw poor David had been stabbed.\"\nPolice arrived at the scene in Eastwood Road North within minutes where they found the MP with multiple injuries and arrested a man.\n\"We knew it must be very serious because the paramedics had been working on Sir David for over two-and-a-half hours and they hadn't got him on the way to hospital,\" Mr Lamb told the PA news agency.\nAt 14:13 an air ambulance arrived at a nearby sports ground to move him to hospital. However, members of his team began to fear the worst as paramedics remained at the scene. \nShortly before 15:00, Essex Police said Sir David had died.\nAt 13:50 on Friday, Essex Police confirmed a 25-year-old man had been arrested immediately at the scene on suspicion of murder, and that a knife had been recovered. \nWhitehall officials have confirmed to the BBC that the suspect - who is being held at a London police station under the Terrorism Act 2000 - is Ali Harbi Ali, a British national of Somali heritage.\nHe was born in Southwark in south London and grew up in Croydon, and is the son of a former adviser to a previous Somali prime minister and the nephew of the Somali ambassador to China.\nIn his teenage years he was referred to the government's extremism programme Prevent but was never a formal \"subject of interest\" for MI5.\nPrevent is the UK's terrorism-prevention programme, which aims to stop people being radicalised.\nTeachers, members of the public, the NHS and others can refer individuals to a local panel of police, social workers and other experts who decide whether and how to intervene in their lives.\nEngagement in the scheme is voluntary and it is not a criminal sanction. It is thought Mr Ali did not spend long in the programme.\nThe attack has been declared a terrorist incident by police.\nThe early investigation revealed \"a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism\", according to Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command.\nBut it is still not exactly clear why Sir David in particular was targeted, Daniel Sandford, the BBC's home affairs correspondent said.\nAli Harbi Ali was initially detained on suspicion of murder but was further detained under the Terrorism Act late on Friday.\nOn Saturday, detectives were granted a warrant by magistrates to allow them to keep Mr Ali in custody until Friday 22 October.\nThe suspect is still being questioned and has not been charged.\nPolice searches have taken place over the weekend at properties in Lady Somerset Road, in Kentish Town, and Bounds Green Road in north London and Cranmer Road, Croydon.\nA post-mortem examination of Sir David has taken place, the police added.\nAnthony Finch, who was working nearby, told Sky News: \"We arrived to do some work on the adjacent building... and at the point when I was crossing the road I saw an upset lady on the phone saying 'you need to arrive quickly, he's still in the building.'\" \nHe said he had seen armed police, as well as an air ambulance and police helicopter. He told LBC: \"It's very odd and it's very distressing, that's for sure.\"\nLee Jordison, who works for a local butchers and was on the scene shortly after the stabbing, told the BBC everyone in the area was in a state of shock. \n\"Something like this doesn't happen - not in all the years I've been round this way.\"\nSir David, who was married with five children, served as an MP for 38 years, initially in Basildon from 1983, before representing Southend West from 1997.\nRaised as a Roman Catholic, he was known politically as a social conservative and a prominent campaigner against abortion. He was also a committed campaigner on animal welfare issues, and supported a ban on fox hunting.  \nThe 69-year-old was a Brexit supporter and vocal champion for the town he represented, particularly in his long-running campaign to make Southend a city. He launched a new bid last month, after a city status competition was announced to mark the Queen's platinum jubilee next year.  \nWhile he was never a minister, he was a member of numerous Commons committees, including the Health and Social Care and Backbench Business Committees.  \nBorn in Plaistow, east London, in 1952, he went to school in the capital and taught at a school in the city. He was a recruitment consultant before becoming an MP. \nHe was knighted in the 2015 New Year's Honours List for political and public service.\nHis family said in a statement that their hearts had been shattered and \"nobody should die in that way\".\nThey called on people to show kindness and love and \"set aside hatred and work towards togetherness\"."

      "tags": "Sydney,Coronavirus pandemic,Australia",
      "text": "Vaccinated Australian citizens and the parents of residents will be able to visit Sydney from 1 November without the need to quarantine.\nThe move announced by the New South Wales (NSW) state government at first indicated that all tourists and foreign travellers could freely enter.\nBut Prime Minister Scott Morrison later quashed that idea.\nAustralia's borders have effectively been closed since March 2020, making it difficult even for citizens to enter.\n\"We are not opening up to everyone coming back to Australia at the moment,\" Mr Morrison said.\nHe said priority would be given to Australians and family members, after which the nation would then consider migrants, those with work and study visas and the \"challenge\" of tourists.\n\"This is about Australian residents and citizens first,\" Mr Morrison said on Friday.\nThe rights have also been extended to include the parents of Australians, even if they are foreign nationals, allowing Australians to be reunited with their family members who are overseas.\nThe hotel quarantine requirement is able to be removed in NSW thanks to the state's high vaccination rate - nearly 80% fully dosed for the eligible over-12 population, the prime minister said.\nSince the start of the pandemic, Australia has had some of the world's strictest border rules.\nThere have been tight caps on how many people are allowed into the country and entry has almost exclusively been to citizens and permanent residents. Upon arrival, they have had to do mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine at their own cost.\nAustralia's strict border controls have also prevented people inside the country from leaving. That will also end in November, with people able to travel when their state's vaccination rate hits 80%.\nThere was confusion earlier on Friday, when NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet declared that Sydney would be \"reopening to the world\" and all vaccinated international travellers, regardless of their visa or citizenship situation.\nBut this was not granted by the federal government - which is in charge of visas and entries into Australia.\n\"It is for the federal government to decide when the border opens and shuts at an international level,\" the prime minister said.\nNSW authorities were yet to clarify the policy mix-up on Friday.\nSydney only emerged from a 107-day lockdown on Monday but is charging ahead with reopening to the rest of the world. NSW authorities say their state - which is the most populous in Australia - is leading the way for the nation.\nBut travel remains heavily restricted across the country - as state borders remain closed under competing virus containment policies.\nIt is now probable that NSW residents could travel overseas before being allowed to visit another Australian state.\nMr Perrottet acknowledged the discrepancy on Friday, saying: \"I think people in New South Wales will be flying to Bali before Broome [in Western Australia].\" \nQueensland, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have all banned travellers from infected states like NSW and Victoria in a bid to keep their case numbers at zero.\nThose states have not specified when they might reopen.\nAustralia has recorded more than 138,000 infections and just over 1,500 deaths from Covid-19."

      "tags": "COP26,Australia climate,Glasgow,Scott Morrison,Australia",
      "text": "Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison says he will now attend the COP26 UN climate conference after weeks of initial hesitation.\nGlobal leaders will meet in Glasgow next month to negotiate a new deal to stall rising global temperatures.\nMr Morrison drew criticism when he indicated last month that he might skip the meeting.\nAustralia, a large producer of coal and gas, is under pressure to commit to stronger climate action.\nIts climate policies and emissions reductions are ranked among the worst in the OECD.\n\"I confirmed my attendance at the Glasgow summit, which I'm looking forward to attending. It is an important event,\" Mr Morrison told reporters on Friday.\nClimate activists had slated Mr Morrison for not committing to attend, and it was being seen as a diplomatic snub to the UK, a close ally of Australia.\nIn an interview to the BBC, Prince Charles earlier expressed surprise at Mr Morrison's comments, urging leaders to act urgently to combat climate change.\nCOP26 will be held between 31 October and 12 November in Scotland's largest city.\nIt will be the biggest climate change conference since landmark talks in Paris in 2015.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nMr Morrison had cited the challenges of Covid as a reason he might not attend, saying he had already served a great deal of quarantine. \nBut Australia is beginning to make plans to end quarantine requirements.\nMany countries have set ambitious targets to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, but Australia has refused to do so. \nIn poker they call it a \"tell\": a tiny change in a player's behaviour that signals something crucial about the cards they holding.  \nNow, the Glasgow climate conference isn't a poker game. Most world leaders do actually understand the huge risks climate change presents and would prefer to minimise its impact.\nBut they also know doing so could impose real costs on their economies. They would like to see the maximum global action on the issue with the minimum cost to their people.\nAnd for many of them they believe the best way to achieve that is to keep the cards in their hand hidden: to make sure there are no \"tells\".\nDeciding whether or not your leader is going to attend is part of that, it is a way of putting other nations under pressure.\nIt makes it very difficult for the organisers and - to be honest - isn't helpful for negotiations. But it is a fact of global diplomacy. Let's just hope that they decide to play a more open game when the conference begins.\nAustralia has committed to a 26% cut on its 2005 emissions by 2030 - a target frequently criticised as too weak.\nExperts say it needs to commit to a 47% cut by 2030 if it is to meet the UN goal of keeping temperature rise below or within 1.5C.\nAustralia is one of the largest emitters on a per capita basis because its energy grid is still largely reliant on coal power.\nThe conservative government has faced months of pressure, both at home and overseas, to improve its climate policies. It is expected to reveal higher emission targets next week.\n\"The government will be finalising its position to take to the summit. We're working through those issues,\" Morrison said on Friday.\nMany rural parts of Australia are dependent on coal, gas and farming.\nCoal is Australia's second-most lucrative export and it expects demand to continue for at least the next decade.\n\"The plan that I am taking forward together with my colleagues is about ensuring that our regions are strong, that our regions jobs are not only protected but have opportunities for the future,\" Mr Morrison said."

      "tags": "Doctors,NHS,GP",
      "text": "A&E waits have sunk to their worst levels in England since the four-hour target started, with doctors warning the situation is bleak ahead of winter.\nA quarter of patients waited more than four hours for treatment in September - with even longer waits being recorded elsewhere in the UK.\nIt comes as ministers and GPs clashed over demands that practices see more patients face-to-face.\nThe government has handed GP practices \u00a3250m to take on temporary staff.\nBut the British Medical Association said they were \"hugely dismayed\" with the plan, saying it would not solve the problems.\nThe winter rescue package came on the day NHS England released its latest monthly data for hospital performance.\nLack of access to GPs has been cited as one of the reasons for growing pressures on A&Es.\nThe A&E performance in England was the worst performance since 2004, when the four-hour target was brought in. \nEven greater numbers are waiting over four hours in the other nations with four in 10 patients in Northern Ireland taking over four hours to be seen.\nIn England, A&E patients who then went on to be admitted to a ward also faced record-long waits for a bed, so-called \"trolley waits\" - they tend to be the most seriously-ill and frail patients.\nOf the 386,000 who were admitted, more than a quarter waited over four hours for a bed to become free. And more than 5,000 had to wait over 12 hours.\nDr Katherine Henderson, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: \"This data is bleak and is a stark warning of the crisis that we are heading towards this winter.\"\nShe added that emergency departments were \"dangerously\" over-crowded and there were widespread reports of ambulances queuing outside hospital because of the demands being placed on the system.\nThe \u00a3250m funding plan for GPs is part of the extra \u00a35bn Covid fund announced last month to help the NHS through the winter. It comes on top of the \u00a312bn set aside for GP services this year.\nAlongside locum doctors - doctors who stand in for others temporarily - GP practices will be able to use the money to recruit other temporary staff such as physios and podiatrists. Pharmacists are also being encouraged to see people with minor illness to relieve the pressure on GPs.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said the new GP rescue package would help relieve pressure on the whole system.\nOnly 58% of patients were seen face-to-face in August - the first full month following the ending of restrictions.\nThat compares with 54% in January and more than 80% before the pandemic.\nPatients have also complained of long waits on phone lines to book an appointment.\nKevin Fogarty said his 84-year-old mother was initially refused face-to-face contact with a GP, despite having an infection in her leg following a biopsy. \n\"She had not been seen for two years. However, an infection developed in the wound but the GP still wouldn't see her. We had to put pressure on them.\"\nMr Fogarty, 60, said the practice in Somerset eventually agreed to see her in person and she is now getting home visits from a nurse to tend to her wound.\n\"GPs seem to be the only group not getting back to normal services, while the likes of shop workers and everyone else are getting on with it. \n\"Telephone and video calls are helpful as an initial consultation, but the GP must see the patient should they insist or there is a requirement.\"\nAlongside the extra money, social distancing rules are also expected to be relaxed in GP surgeries and responsibility for signing fitness-to-work and fitness-to-drive certificates will be able to be passed on to other staff.\nMr Javid said: \"I'm determined to ensure patients can see their GP in the way they want, no matter where they live.\n\"Our new plan provides general practice teams with investment and targeted support. This will tackle underperformance, taking pressure off staff so they can spend more time with patients and increase the number of face-to-face appointments.\"\nGP surgeries will be named in league tables if they are judged to have failed to provide an appropriate level of \"access\". \nBut Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, said he was \"hugely dismayed\" with the package. \"It offers very little and shows a government out of touch with the scale of the crisis on the ground.\"\nHe said patients would \"continue to suffer\" and find it harder to book appointments.\n\"It is disappointing to see there is no end in sight to the preoccupation with face-to-face appointments.\"\nHe said in-person appointments were still a key feature of GP care but the pandemic had proven phone or video consultations were \"entirely appropriate and appreciated\" by many.\nThe rescue package comes amid the government's ongoing struggle to increase the number of GPs.\nOver the past five years the total - in terms of full-time posts - has fallen despite successive government drives to increase numbers.\nNHS Providers, which represents health bosses, said its members were particularly worried about A&Es alongside mental health and cancer services. \nDeputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said: \"The NHS is fighting fires on multiple fronts as they try to recover care backlogs, increased demand for emergency care, treating patients with Covid and preparing for what is likely to be the most challenging winter yet for the NHS. \n\"In a matter of weeks, we will face our first winter where both flu and Covid are in circulation.\""

      "tags": "UK banking,Cash,UK Finance,Money,Personal finance,Contactless payment",
      "text": "The spending limit on each use of a contactless card has now risen from \u00a345 to \u00a3100 - but not every shop will accept the new payment threshold.\nRetailers say it could take months to update terminals before every shopper can spend up to \u00a3100, without the need to enter a four-digit Pin.\nThe move aims to make purchases such as grocery shopping more convenient.\nBut some warn it could lead to a rise in theft and one bank boss questioned whether shoppers want a higher limit.\nSome 60% of debit and credit card transactions in the UK were contactless in the first seven months of the year. These accounted for a total of 6.6 billion payments with a value of \u00a381bn.\nThe decision to increase the threshold was taken by the Treasury and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the decision would bring convenience for shoppers and a boost to the High Street following Covid lockdowns.\nWhen contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at \u00a310 and designed as an alternative to small change.\nThe limit was raised gradually, to \u00a315 in 2010, to \u00a320 in 2012, and then to \u00a330 in 2015. It was hurriedly increased to \u00a345 last year as the pandemic accelerated a move away from cash.\nAs the limit has increased, so has the frequency of its use. Despite sudden drops of all transactions during national lockdowns, the general trend has been continuing growth. That has come as consumers have been less likely to use banknotes and coins.\nThe huge number of terminals which need to be updated means that Friday marks the first day of a gradual introduction of the new limit.\n\"It may take days, weeks, or even months for some retailers to make the necessary changes in their systems so that the new limit can take effect,\" said Andrew Cregan, payments policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium.\n\"Furthermore, some retailers may choose not to adopt the new contactless limit. As a result, customers will need to take care when making payments to check what the maximum contactless limit is for individual stores.\"\nCampaigners have been concerned that as card and digital payments become more prevalent, it could affect access to cash for those who still rely on it.\nFCA research found that a greater proportion of consumers were finding it difficult to cope with fewer retailers accepting cash during the pandemic. However, it found that eight out of 10 small and medium-sized businesses said they were \"very likely\" to accept cash over the next five years.\nGraham Farrell, professor of crime science at the University of Leeds, has warned about the \"huge increase\" in attractiveness of bag snatches and pickpocketing by teenage thieves, who could then spend more on a stolen card.\nHe co-authored a paper pointing out that these young criminals could then go on to long-term criminal careers.\nA thief will now be able to spend more on an unreported stolen card before a Pin is demanded. FCA guidance suggests a cumulative \u00a3300 needs to be spent on contactless before a purchase is checked by a Pin, up from the previous recommended level of \u00a3130.\nProf Farrell told the BBC a halfway house was needed. \n\"A solution that would balance both sides would be tap-and-Pin. You would have contactless tapping of the card on a machine, without the trouble of putting it in and out of the machine. You would use Pin codes to ensure security, therefore making the theft of the card - as the thieves do not have the Pin - less attractive,\" he said.\nAuthorities have sought to allay any concerns about an increase in fraud, pointing out that there was no rise in the crime after the last increase in the payment limit.\n\"What's more, we have seen no material increase in fraudulent transactions in other countries where the contactless limit increased to the equivalent of \u00a3100 or above,\" a spokesman for the FCA said.\nAustralia and Singapore have contactless limits of the equivalent of about \u00a3100, and Canada's is close to \u00a3150.\nCustomers of a variety of banks can switch off the contactless function, or request a non-contactless card.\nSome - notably Lloyds Banking Group and Starling - will allow customers to set their own contactless limit via the banks' apps.\nAnne Boden, chief executive of Starling Bank, questioned whether consumers really wanted to be able to spend more on Pin-free transactions.\n\"Analysing our spending data we can see that there appears to be little demand for the increased contactless limit and that many would like to retain the same contactless limit or even reduce it,\" she said. \nShoppers can spend more than \u00a3100 without a Pin using payment services on smartphones, although they include in-built security on the devices such as fingerprint authorisation."

She tweeted: \"Women must be listened to.\"\nMeanwhile, West Yorkshire's Labour mayor Tracy Brabin said her thoughts were with Ms Everard's family, who live in York and were Mr Allott's constituents. She tweeted: \"Finally. The right decision.\"\nThe North Yorkshire branch of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), which had earlier said members were \"outraged\" by Mr Allott's comments, also welcomed his resignation.\nIn a tweet, the FBU said: \"Hopefully his resignation will offer some comfort for Sarah Everard's Family and friends and all those affected by his disgraceful comments.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Physicians later confirmed the urological diagnosis.\nMr Clinton served as US president from 1993 until 2001. He was impeached in 1998 for lying to investigators about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. He was acquitted at his Senate trial. \nThe doctors at UC Irvine are in contact with Mr Clinton's medical team in New York, as well as his cardiologist, as the former president has a history of heart issues.\nIn 2004, Mr Clinton had a quadruple bypass surgery and, ten years later, had a clogged artery opened after complaining of chest pains. \nNot long after his second surgery, the ex-president - known for his love of fatty foods - went vegan.

      "text": "New rules allowing travellers returning to England to take lateral flow tests instead of more expensive PCR tests will come into force on 24 October.\nThe government says the changes will take effect in time for families returning from half term breaks.\nFully vaccinated passengers will be told to upload photos of their Covid-19 tests for verification.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would make travel easier and simpler.\nThe travel industry had said it was vital to make the changes to the Covid travel tests in time for the half term holiday.\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said: \"This is great news and we're pleased to get it over the line in time for the crucial half term period, which will be a massive relief to families desperate to get away this autumn.\"\nAlong with last week's reduction of the travel red list and the recognition of vaccinations administered in more foreign countries, the change is \"a major step forward that will support the desperately needed recovery of our sector,\" he said.\nThe changes come as the UK continues to record the highest level of Covid-19 infections and deaths in western Europe, with another 45,066 cases recorded on Thursday - the largest number since late July.\nA further 157 deaths were also recorded.\nPolicy on travel is devolved, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have previously aligned with policy in England, citing the practicalities of the shared border.\nBut Wales criticised replacing PCR tests, which are often described as the gold standard for Covid testing, with lateral flow tests, saying that along with other relaxed measures it would \"considerably increase\" the risk of new variants coming into the country.\nUnder the existing system, PCR tests taken on day two after returning to England can cost about \u00a375 per person.\nWhen the changes come into effect, anyone who receives a positive result from their lateral flow test will be required to self-isolate and to take a free PCR test to confirm it.\nTravellers due to arrive in England from 24 October onwards will be able to order their lateral flow tests from 22 October, when a list of approved providers will be published on the gov.uk website.\nNHS Test and Trace tests - which can be ordered for free - cannot be used for international travel, the government said.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"We want to make going abroad easier and cheaper, whether you're travelling for work or visiting friends and family.\"\nHe said the change was made possible by the high levels of vaccination, which means \"we can safely open up travel as we learn to live with the virus\".\nMr Shapps said: \"Taking away expensive mandatory PCR testing will boost the travel industry and is a major step forward in normalising international travel and encouraging people to book holidays with confidence.\"\nDoes this change come in time for your holiday?

      "tags": "Travel,Department of Health & Social Care,Coronavirus testing,Reality Check,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People who test positive for Covid at home no longer need to take a PCR test to confirm the result.\nMany people are still struggling to get hold of tests due to high demand.\nIf you have no symptoms:\nAcross the UK, if you test positive for Covid with a lateral flow test (LFT), there is no longer any need to book a PCR test to confirm that result. \nYou should report your result online or by calling 119, and self-isolate immediately. You will be contacted by the relevant tracing service so your contacts can be notified.\nYou can leave self-isolation seven days after the date of your first positive test (five full days in England), as long as you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart. \nThe guidance that positive LFTs don't need a confirmatory PCR will remain in place while Covid case levels are high. Under these conditions, the vast majority of people with positive LFT results are extremely likely to have coronavirus. \nPeople who are eligible for the \u00a3500 test and trace payment in England will be asked to take a PCR so they can access financial support.\nClinically vulnerable people in Wales and Northern Ireland are also still advised to take a PCR test after a positive LFT.\nIf you have symptoms:\nIf you have Covid symptoms - a cough, a fever or a loss of taste or smell - you should take a PCR test as soon as possible, and self-isolate while you wait for the result. \nYou must then continue to self-isolate if the PCR test is positive, even if you previously had negative LFT results.\nHowever, if you have already tested positive on a LFT, you should self-isolate and do not need to take a follow up PCR.\nAnyone without Covid symptoms can order LFTs online using their NHS login. \nYou can also collect LFTs from pharmacies, vaccination hubs and test centres. \nYou should report your LFT result online or by calling 119. \nYou can order a PCR test kit to be sent to your home or book an appointment at a walk-in or drive-through test site.\nThe main government website still regularly says no LFTs are available for home delivery, and many pharmacies have limited stock. \nPCR test appointments are also sometimes in short supply across much of the UK, although home PCR kits are generally available. \nAnyone who needs a PCR test is advised to keep checking the website, as slots are released throughout the day.\nAnnouncing the reduction in the self-isolation period for England, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs that LFT supplies had risen sharply from pre-Omicron levels, with 400 million available in January, compared to 120 million in November. \nThe testing rules are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or for 10 days after your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to people under-18s (18 and four months in Scotland; 18 and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test, but don't need to take a confirmatory PCR test. \nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. In Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nAcross the UK, NHS and education staff are asked to test twice a week. Secondary pupils should test twice a week during term time (three times a week in Wales). \nThere is separate testing guidance for prisons and hospital patients, as well as care home staff in Scotland. \nThe government has said it will provide 100,000 critical workers in England with free daily LFTs, initially for five weeks.\nCritical workers deliver essential services such as transport and food distribution, and cannot work from home so are at risk of infection.\nIn addition, everyone is asked to test before socialising with those who are at most risk from Covid, or spending time in crowded settings or places with poor ventilation. \nPeople can also provide a recent negative LFT or PCR result instead of proof of vaccination to enter venues that are covered by Covid passport schemes in place in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nYou may also need to test before or after travelling abroad. You must buy private tests for this - you cannot use free NHS tests. \nLFTs and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests do different things:\nBoth tests involve swabbing your nose and/or throat. LFTs can be done at home, and show results in 20-30 minutes. \nPCR test swabs must be sent to a lab for analysis, with results provided in 24-48 hours, although it can take longer to confirm a particular Covid variant.\nBeing vaccinated against Covid cannot cause you to test positive on either an LFT or PCR test.\nWhen LFTs were first introduced, they were criticised for being much less accurate than PCRs.\nHowever, in October UCL researchers found LFTs were more than 80% effective at detecting any level of Covid-19 infection, which was much higher than previously thought.\nLFT results are also more reliable during a period of high Covid cases, because the small number of false positives is much less significant.

      "text": "There are three main symptoms of coronavirus. \nIf you have any of them, you should get a test.\nPublic Health England says about 85% of people with Covid will have at least one of these symptoms.\nPeople infected with new variants such as Delta may be more likely to have other symptoms, such as headache, sore throat or a runny nose, according to research from the Zoe Covid Study and an ONS survey.\nIf you have any symptoms you should get tested as soon as possible and not leave home for any other reason. \nIt takes five days on average from the moment you're infected for symptoms to show.\nNo - it can affect multiple organs and has several less common symptoms.\nScientists using data on the health of four million people say Covid has six sub-types:\nResearchers think that vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps could be a sign of coronavirus in children.\nSome people who catch Covid develop chilblain-like lesions on their toes or fingers.\nIt can happen to anyone, but is more common in children and teenagers. \nFor some it's painless, but the rash can be very sore and itchy.\nIt appears to be a side effect of the body switching into attack mode to fight off the virus.\nWriting in the British Journal of Dermatology, researchers say they've pinpointed which parts of the immune system are responsible, which should lead to better treatments. \nLots of other viruses have similar symptoms to Covid, including flu. \nPublic Health England says just under half of people who have one of the three main Covid symptoms will not have it.\nIf you have a positive test result you should self-isolate at home for at least 10 days from the time symptoms started.\nMost people will only have mild symptoms, which can be managed with pain relief (like paracetamol), bed rest and fluids.\nYou should not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.\nSince 16 August, people who are double jabbed (or aged under 18) don't have to self-isolate if they're identified as a close contact of a person who tests positive.\nGetting vaccinated is the best way to prevent serious illness, hospitalisation or death from Covid. \nIf you are seriously unwell and you have a medical emergency you should call 999 - this includes feeling so breathless that you can't speak more than a few words.\nIf you're worried your symptoms are getting worse, use the NHS 111 website England, NHS Inform in Scotland or the equivalents in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe main reason people need hospital care is for difficulty breathing where they may be given oxygen.\nThe most seriously ill patients may require ventilation - where patients are sedated and air is pushed into their lungs.\nOlder people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women."

      "tags": "David Amess",
      "text": "The day started out much like every other Friday morning for Sir David Amess. One of Essex's most longstanding MPs, he held meetings with his Southend constituents every second week, in recent years varying the location to meet more of the local residents that relied upon his help. \nThis week he was at the Belfairs Methodist Church in his home town of Leigh-on-Sea. He tweeted on Tuesday about the upcoming event inviting constituents to join him.\nSir David was known for being passionate about his job - and constituents and colleagues spoke of his boundless enthusiasm for his role. These constituency surgeries were at the heart of his political life.\nJust 15 minutes before the attack, the 69-year-old father of five was spotted standing on the church steps, chatting and laughing with locals.\nAt around 12.05pm, accompanied by two female members of his staff and nearing the end of the drop-in event, Sir David entered the church to meet some more constituents, where he may have noticed the inscription: \"All are welcome here: where old friends meet and strangers feel at home.\"\nLocal councillor John Lamb said that it was at this point that the attacker emerged from a small group of waiting constituents and attacked Mr Amess, stabbing him several times. \n\"I'm told that when he went in for his surgery there were people waiting to see him, and one of them literally got a knife out and just began stabbing him,\" Mr Lamb said.\nLee Jordison, who works at the nearby Hicks Butchers, told the PA news agency: \"We could see a police cordon set up... (someone outside) told me a woman had come out screaming on the phone, saying 'someone's been stabbed, please get here soon', he's not breathing'.\"\nPolice arrived on the scene shortly after the stabbing, and arrested a 25-year-old man and recovered the knife used in the attack. At 1.50pm, Essex police confirmed that the man had been arrested in connection with the stabbing. \nOne witness, electrician Anthony Fitch, told Sky News that he had witnessed the man being led from the church and being put in the back of a police car. \n\"We arrived to do some work on the adjacent building... and at the point when I was crossing the road I saw an upset lady on the phone saying 'you need to arrive quickly, he's still in the building,'\" he said. \n\"There were loads of armed police, overhead there was an air ambulance as well as a police helicopter. Obviously wondered what the hell was going on, you don't often see armed police around the local area. \n\"I saw the suspect get put into a police van, get taken away and then they cordoned the whole road and pushed us all down the road.\"\nAt 2.13pm, an air ambulance arrived at the nearby Belfairs sports ground to move Sir David to a hospital. \nHowever, members of his team began to fear the worst, as paramedics remained at the scene rather than moving towards the helicopter. For almost two-and-a-half hours they battled to save his life. \nBut just before 3pm, Essex police confirmed that Mr Amess had died at the scene. \nAs news of his death filtered through, tributes began to pour in from friends, constituents and fellow MPs. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said that Amess was \"one of the kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics\".\nLocal councillor Dan Nelson told the BBC that Sir David had died \"doing what he loved best, and that was to help residents of Southend West\". \nRofique Ali, a local Conservative Party member, described the MP as his best friend in the world.\n\"I have known him for many years, and he was so kind to everyone,\" he said. \"I can't forget David.\"\nAnd resident Melanie Harris left a card at the scene that read: \"What has the world come to? What a senseless waste of a charming, witty and kind and gentle soul who deserved a lot more than to be snatched from life.\"\n\"You were always a pleasure to speak to. Thank you for restoring my faith in politicians.\"\nBy mid-afternoon a full \"Gold\" command meeting was activated by police chiefs back in London - meaning some of the most senior and experienced leaders of major incidents were sitting around the table to work out how to respond. \nJoining the discussions were representatives from the security service, more commonly known as MI5, whose investigators sit side-by-side with detectives on many investigations.\nAnd watching on from government was Home Secretary Priti Patel - a close personal friend of Mr Amess. She said later on Twitter that she was devastated to learn of his death.\nThe conference was an inevitable decision: the killing of an MP is not an everyday occurrence - and the last time it happened, when Jo Cox was murdered in 2016 - it was an act of terrorism by a far-right extremist.\nAs daylight faded, members of the press gathered to hear police announce that an investigation was under way. Senior officers appealed to the public for information. \n\"This is a shocking and utterly despicable attack against somebody who was an outstanding MP and has worked tirelessly for their community for many, many years,\" said police commissioner Roger Hirst.\nHe added that members of Metropolitan Police's specialist Counter Terrorism Command would now try to make sense of an utterly senseless killing. \nBy early evening, investigators - still seeking a motive - had at least established the suspect's identity. A government source told the BBC the man arrested was a British national who, according to initial inquiries, was of Somali heritage.\nMeanwhile, at St Peter's Roman Catholic Church, locals gathered together to remember the man who, for many, was the only MP they had ever known. \nFather Jeffrey Woolnough told the service: \"Have you ever known Sir David Amess without that happy smile on his face? Because the greeting he would always give you was always that happy smile.\"\nAnd he paid tribute to Sir David as a man who carried with him \"that great east-London spirit of having no fear, and being able to talk to people and the level they're at\".\nShortly after midnight, police formally declared the attack a terrorist incident, explaining that their early investigations had revealed a \"potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism\".\nOfficers continued to search two London addresses in connection with the attack, while the suspect remained in custody at an Essex police station."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Italy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Dockers at three big ports have staged protests at the requirement for all Italian workers to show a Covid pass.\nThe Green Pass shows whether you have had the Covid vaccine, recovered from it or had a negative test.\nIt became mandatory for all workplaces on Friday.\nAbout 6,000 workers went on strike outside Trieste port, a maritime gateway for northern Italy, Germany, Austria and central Europe.\nThere was disruption in Genoa and Ancona too, but dockers worked normally in Italy's other major ports at Venice, Palermo, Naples and Gioia Tauro, Ansa news agency reported.\nAbout three million Italian workers are estimated to be still unvaccinated and protests were reported in many of the big cities:\nThe move to make the Covid pass compulsory for workers is among the world's toughest anti-Covid measures.\nA worker without a Green Pass risks being suspended without pay and may be fined up to \u20ac1,500 (\u00a31,270; $1,740).\nThe pass, introduced in June, was already required for teachers and other school workers, for access to bars and restaurants and for leisure venues such as cinemas and football stadiums.\nItaly's coalition government, led by Mario Draghi, is extending it in the hope of avoiding another lockdown.\nTwo-thirds of Italians consider it necessary, according to an Ipsos opinion poll this week.\nHowever, opponents rioted in Rome on 9 October. The far-right Forza Nuova party led violent protesters who vandalised the CGIL trade union building in Rome, during clashes with police. \nOverall more than 85% of Italians aged over 12 have had at least one jab, and officials said a further 1.2 million vaccinations had been carried out in the past week.\n\"It is time to stop the economy, which is perhaps the only way we can show this government that many people are struggling,\" port workers' spokesman Stefano Puzzer told Rai TV. \n\"We will carry on until the Green Pass goes.\"\nMinisters have played down fears of chaos, citing the high rate of vaccination.\nBut disruption could hit the transport sector too, as many lorry drivers are foreigners who are either unvaccinated or have had jabs not recognised by the European Medicines Agency. Umberto Ruggero of Italy's logistics association said 30%-40% of staff might not show up. He spoke of a \"perfect storm\", with the sector already suffering from chronic understaffing.\nDock workers in Trieste had offered to call off their action if the government delayed making the Green Pass obligatory until the end of October, but that was rejected by Rome.\nBusiness lobby group Confindustria strongly supports the Green Pass. Italy was the first European country to suffer a healthcare crisis in the pandemic, and has had more than 130,000 Covid deaths.\nThere are fears that Italy's pharmacies may not cope with the pressure of providing many more Covid tests under the new regime.\nUnions failed to secure free tests for workers - something also demanded by Matteo Salvini's nationalist League, which is in the government.\nThe League's Luca Zaia, governor of the heavily industrialised Veneto region in the north-east, warned that \"we will not be able to grant a swab every 48 hours to all the unvaccinated\".\n\"The business people I am in contact with are extremely worried,\" he said."

      "text": "Former Afghan interpreters for British forces have told the BBC they fear for their lives after the UK blocked their evacuation on security grounds. The move has stunned the group who thought getting out was a done deal. \nSheltering in a hideout on the outskirts of Kabul, Abdul says he is waiting for the day he is found and killed by the Taliban.\nHe is one of 11 Afghan interpreters the BBC has spoken to who have been stopped from relocating to the UK, despite initially being told they were eligible for a move.\nThey received letters saying they were \"eligible for relocation\" to Britain under a government scheme to get former interpreters who had worked for British forces to safety. \nBut the relocation was subject to passing immigration checks - and in the final stages, the Home Office blocked them on national security grounds.\nThey were told their presence in the UK would not be \"conducive to the public good\".\nThe men, whose names have been changed for their safety as they fear retribution from the Taliban, have not been given any details about why they were deemed a threat. They say they have done nothing wrong.\nTheir supporters in the UK are calling for them to be given the opportunity to have their cases reviewed and have criticised the lack of transparency around the decisions.\nWhen officials from the UK's Ministry of Defence told him in July he was eligible to relocate, Abdul was relieved.\nHaving worked in the past with British troops in Helmand, he was worried he would be a target for retribution when the Taliban started taking over Afghanistan.\nHe says he was told to prepare for a flight out of the country within two weeks. He sold most of his possessions, and prepared to quit his job.\nBut on 11 August, as the Taliban closed in on the capital, he received a letter telling him his visa application had been refused on \"national security\" grounds with no right of appeal.\nAbdul, a UN employee who also worked for the British embassy and for the Afghan government after leaving the army, was shocked by the decision.\n\"I have worked with the British embassy. And the UN has zero tolerance for misconduct,\" he says. A UN spokesperson confirmed to the BBC he had passed background checks for his work there as recently as 2019.\n\"I have never engaged in any criminal acts,\" Abdul says. \"But I have worked shoulder to shoulder with British soldiers.\"\nWhile serving with British troops in Helmand Province, a commanding officer praised Abdul's \"loyalty, trustworthiness and complete professionalism\" in a service certificate.\nHe now fears the Taliban will find and kill him, his wife, and his young children.\n\"I'm not even concerned about myself, I am concerned about my children. I'm worried about whether they will come back each day from school,\" he says.\nAfter hearing rumours that Taliban fighters were carrying out door-to-door searches, Abdul fled Kabul in late August with his family. \"I'm trying to do anything to get out of this situation. But we don't know where to go,\" he says.\nAnother rejected interpreter, Sayed, has built a makeshift hideout in the bushes behind his home.\nHe told his relatives to tell anyone who comes to his house that he is away. Once a week, after night falls, he takes a taxi into the city centre to buy food for his family.\nHe has shown the BBC a Taliban death threat he says he received a decade ago. In it, the militants warn he will be sent \"to the depths of hell\" for \"working for the infidels\".\nAfter serving with the British, he worked for a firm contracted to the UN, and later a logistics company. \nHe applied to the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap) - a scheme allowing Afghans who worked for the British military and UK government to be able to move to the UK permanently.\nIn April, he was told he was eligible for a move to the UK.\nBut in August, days before Kabul fell to the Taliban, the Home Office told him he would pose a security threat because of his \"conduct, character and associations\".\nSayed was perplexed. \"What is my sin?\" he asks. \"That I worked shoulder to shoulder with the British? I have no crime, I am not a criminal, I have done nothing wrong.\"\nTo add to the confusion, a fortnight later he received a Ministry of Defence email telling him to go to Kabul airport to be evacuated. But he was unable to make it through the chaos outside.\nAlthough the last Western military flights have left, he is still desperate to flee Afghanistan.\n\"We are still hoping for our fate, the fate of our children,\" he says. \"But I still feel so scared because these people will find me.\"\nThese stories, and those of nine others in a similar situation documented by the BBC, have prompted calls for the rejected cases to be reviewed.\n\"It's deeply, deeply disturbing to us,\" said Col Simon Diggins, formerly Britain's defence attach\u00e9 to Kabul, and now a campaigner for former Afghan staff.\n\"We have no faith in the process. The evidence is not seen. There is no opportunity to challenge the evidence and there's no appeal against it,\" he says.\nThe Home Office did not want to comment on individual cases.\nBut a government spokesperson told the BBC: \"There are people in Afghanistan who represent a serious threat to our national and public security.\n\"That is why thorough checks are taking place by government, our world-class intelligence agencies and others and if someone is assessed as presenting as a risk to our country, we will take action.\"\nThe UK, and other Western nations who are resettling Afghans, have been on high alert for possible abuses of the evacuation process.\nIn August, a person on the UK's no-fly watch list was flown into Birmingham as part of the initial evacuation effort, although they were later not deemed a person of interest.\nAnd in the first half of September, the US government flagged 44 Afghans it had evacuated as security threats, according to the Washington Post. Fifteen of them have now been returned to sites in Europe and the Middle East.\nConservative MP Tom Tugendhat - chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee - has called for clarity on how the decisions had been made.\n\"For every day that passes, the danger rises for the people we've promised to help,\" he said. \"There will be legitimate reasons why some cases are refused, but transparency as far as possible in the decision-making process will be important to avoid urgent cases falling through the cracks.\"\nLabour MP Diane Abbott, who sits on the Home Affairs Committee, said the interpreters should be able to appeal.\n\"Accepting refugees and then denying them is very odd. There may be grounds for this, but at the very least the Home Office has a duty to provide some transparency and to allow appeals.\n\"The people of Afghanistan have been treated very badly by this and previous governments. They must not compound that now by mistreating refugees.\"\nTwo interpreters who were deemed eligible but later blocked by the Home Office did manage to make it out of Afghanistan on Danish military flights.\nOne of them, Ali, who worked with Danish as well as British troops, is now with his family in a city in eastern Denmark.\nAfter being told he was eligible for resettlement to the UK, he sold his house in Helmand Province. \nIn the weeks that followed, he would check his emails first thing each morning, expecting news of a flight out of Kabul. \n\"When I saw the notification on my phone I was really excited,\" he recalls. \"But when I opened the message I was really shocked.\"\n\"I couldn't sleep for four or five days - asking myself why they made this decision,\" he says.\nAli - who later worked for the EU's police mission to Afghanistan - says he has no idea why the UK deemed him a security threat, but why Denmark allowed him to enter the country.\nOthers have not been so fortunate.\nAfter being told in June he was eligible to relocate within weeks, Ahmad took out a $7,000 (\u00a35,000) loan so he could make it to Kabul and travel on to the UK to start a new life.\nBut on 16 August - just a day after the capital fell to the Taliban - he too was told he had been refused entry to the UK. Reading the Home Office letter, he says, was \"the worst moment in my life\".\n\"I asked why many times,\" he says. He wonders if he could have been deemed an extremist because of quotes from the Quran he has shared on Facebook, or because he hails from a Pashtun tribe that has traditionally had ties to the Taliban.\nAhmad decided to flee to Pakistan, taking a desert road to avoid Taliban checkpoints. When he made it to the border post, he managed to convince a Pakistani guard to let him through, claiming he needed medical treatment.\nHe made it to a Pakistani border town, but he is too scared to go outside. He says the Taliban have threatened his family, and he doesn't know what to do next.\n\"When I surrender myself they will torture me, beat me,\" he says. \"Then they will hang me or shoot me.\""

      "tags": "Black Lives Matter,Colonialism,St Asaph,Denbigh,George Floyd death",
      "text": "The future of a statue in the home town of the controversial Victorian adventurer HM Stanley is being put to a public vote.\nResidents in the north Wales town of Denbigh are being asked whether they want it removed.\nStanley became famous after finding missionary Dr David Livingstone in Tanzania in 1871.\nBut his reputation has been tarnished by claims of violence on explorations, and his role in the Congo. \nHe acted as an agent for King Leopold II of Belgium, and was seen as one of the architects who opened up the African region to the West, only for it to be brutally exploited after he had left.\nThe rule of Leopold II is said to have led to the deaths of as many as 10 million Africans, though historians dispute the true number.\nA bronze of Stanley was approved back in 2010 by Denbighshire council, but even then proved divisive.\nAmid widespread protests from the Black Lives Matter movement following the death of George Floyd in the USA, petitions were drawn up calling for the removal of a statue of Stanley in Denbigh and an obelisk honouring him in nearby St Asaph.\nIt was supported by the Bishop of St Asaph, Gregory Cameron, who said Stanley had \"little respect for the natives of Africa\".\nAs a result, Denbigh Town Council agreed to hold a public consultation on the statue, which had been delayed until the October vote due to the pandemic.\nGwyneth Kensler, a local county councillor, has long supported keeping the bronze on display outside the town's library.\n\"The people against Stanley are making all sorts of accusations. They are saying he was racist, he wasn't - he was cruel, he wasn't,\" said Ms Kensler.\n\"You have to put him in his context - the Victorian period. With Leopold - he knew nothing about the atrocities, and condemned them when he did.\"\nShe said the statue should remain where it is, to mark \"Africa's greatest explorer\".\nStanley was born John Rowlands in Denbigh, but abandoned by his mother, and grew up in the workhouse at St Asaph.\nHe emigrated to America when he was 18, fighting in its civil war, before embarking on a career as a journalist and explorer.\nIt was in that role he famously searched for Livingstone, where he claimed he uttered the words \"Dr Livingstone I presume\" on finally finding him.\nBut not everyone shared the view that Stanley should be celebrated without question. \nDenbigh resident Emyr Thomas said the bronze should be moved.\n\"It should be put somewhere, where you can read about it. We need to be able to show the next generation - and our generation - in an appropriate place.\n\"Then people can make their own minds up about it,\" he said.\nDr Marian Gwyn, head of heritage for Race Council Cymru, said the controversy surrounding Stanley was part of his story - and should be discussed.\n\"I'm not trying to defend Stanley, I'm just trying to be honest,\" she said. \"It was a very violent time throughout - not only was that the environment in Africa, it was violent in Europe as well.\"\nShe said many Congolese people still saw Stanley \"as a bit of a hero\" who \"broke the monolithic control of the African chiefs\".\nDr Gwyn added: \"It's a very different story to the one we normally hear. But I think we do need to know a lot more about what Stanley was doing over there.\"\nThe vote in Denbigh takes place in its town hall on Friday and Saturday.\nThe result, and what it means for the future of the statue, will be discussed when the town's council meets at the end of the month."

      "text": "Pregnant women should get a Covid jab after a rise in those without vaccines needing hospital care, Wales' chief medical officer has said. \nDr Frank Atherton said there had been an increase in the number of pregnant women with serious illness from Covid. \nCovid vaccines are recommended for pregnant women by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (RCOG) and Royal College of Midwives (RCM). \nDr Atherton said the jab was \"safe and effective\" in all stages of pregnancy.\nHe said catching Covid during pregnancy carried a \"significant risk\" of hospital admission and pregnant women could be at \"increased risk of severe illness\" compared with the rest of the population, particularly in the third trimester. \nHe added: \"The Covid-19 vaccine can protect mums and babies from avoidable harm. \n\"We now have a lot of worldwide experience to know that the vaccine is safe and effective at all stages of pregnancy - women shouldn't wait, take it as soon as possible whether planning pregnancy or already pregnant.\"\nHe said the vaccine was based on science that has been used safely on pregnant women for many years, including jabs already administered during pregnancy, such as whooping cough and the flu jab. \n\"The Covid-19 vaccine can be given at any time of a pregnancy,\" he said. \n\"I would encourage people to contact their health board if they have not accepted their offer. The latest evidence and medical professionals agree that the vaccine provides the greatest protection from Covid-19.\"\nThe latest Covid figures showed there were 520 people in hospital with Covid in Wales, with an average of 42 admissions each day. \nDr Viki Male, a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales earlier this week vaccines were safe and effective for those already pregnant and people trying to conceive. \nShe said: \"We know that Covid is dangerous during pregnancy, particularly in the second half of pregnancy. If you catch Covid it's more likely that your baby will be born pre-term. It's also more likely that your baby will be stillborn. \n\"So if you're thinking of becoming pregnant, you might want to get the vaccine so you're protected in advance.\"\nShe added there was no evidence Covid vaccines had stopped people from conceiving, including in IVF settings, and that those already pregnant should get vaccinated. \n\"If you're already pregnant we have absolutely loads of data about how safe the vaccines are in pregnancy,\" she said.\n\"There's no increased risk of miscarriage, pre-term birth, stillbirth, the baby being smaller than we expect, or any congenital abnormalities. \n\"We recommend Covid vaccination during pregnancy, we do not recommend getting Covid during pregnancy.\""

      "text": "The government is to allow 800 foreign abattoir workers into the UK on temporary visas, after warnings from farmers of mass culls.\nIt previously said businesses should pay higher wages and invest in skills.\nThe shortage of butchers has already seen farmers destroy 6,600 healthy pigs due to a backlog on farms, the National Pig Association (NPA) said.\nThe government also announced plans to allow thousands more HGV deliveries to address a chronic driver shortage.\nThe meat industry blames the butcher shortage on factors including Covid and Brexit.\nThousands of healthy pigs have been culled since last week, when the tally was about 600.\nLast week, the National Farmer's Union (NFU) warned that pig farmers were \"facing a human disaster\" due to the shortage of butchers.\nIt said that \"empty retail shelves and product shortages are becoming increasingly commonplace and Christmas specialities such as pigs in blankets are already under threat\".\nThe government is temporarily extending its seasonal workers scheme to pork butchers, it said.\nUp to 800 pork butchers will be eligible to apply until the end of the year for six-month visas.\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said: \"A unique range of pressures on the pig sector over recent months, such as the impacts of the pandemic and its effect on export markets, have led to the temporary package of measures we are announcing.\n\"This is the result of close working with industry to understand how we can support them through this challenging time.\"\nThe government added that the temporary visas \"are not a long term solution and businesses must make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce to build a high-wage, high-skill economy, instead of relying on overseas labour\".\nAlongside the temporary visas, the government announced a package of measures for the industry, including:\nIt said there had been \"a suspension of approval to export to China for some UK pork establishments\" and that it was working with the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board to identify other export markets.\nThe extension of visa requirements for butchers follows the announcement of temporary visas for lorry drivers and poultry workers, as the government seeks to limit disruption in the run-up to Christmas.\nBut the first foreign HGV drivers brought in on the new visa scheme may not arrive for another month, sources told BBC transport correspondent Carrie Davies.\nThe visa scheme for HGV drivers to deliver food, opened for applications on Monday.\nThe Home Office has not confirmed the number of visas that have been applied for so far, but several agencies that are recruiting the drivers told the BBC that they were yet to apply for them.\nA chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which the haulage industry has said is due to factors that include Covid and Brexit, has affected businesses including petrol stations and supermarkets.\nThe government announced on Thursday that it planned to temporarily allow lorries from the EU to make more deliveries, as part of efforts to address the shortage.\nAt the moment, EU lorries can only make two \"cabotage\" trips per week.\nCabotage refers to loading or unloading goods in one country when a vehicle is registered in another country.\nThe government wants to relax this rule to temporarily allow EU lorries to make unlimited pick-ups and drop-offs within a two week period."

      "text": "Conservative MP Sir David Amess has died after being stabbed multiple times at his constituency surgery in Essex.\nPolice said a 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after the attack at a church in Leigh-on-Sea.\nThey recovered a knife and are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. A counter-terrorism team will lead the investigation.\nBoris Johnson has spoken of his shock and sadness at the loss of \"one of the kindest\" people in politics.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has asked all police forces to review security arrangements for MPs \"with immediate effect\", a Home Office spokesman said.  \nSir David, 69, had been an MP since 1983 and was married with five children. He is the second serving MP to be killed in the past five years, following the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016. \nShe was killed outside a library in Birstall, West Yorkshire, where she was due to hold a constituency surgery.\nThe investigation into the attack will be led by the Metropolitan Police's specialist Counter Terrorism Command, who will determine whether it was a terrorist incident.\nA government source told the BBC the man arrested was a British national who, according to initial inquiries, is of Somali heritage.\nThe prime minister said Sir David had an \"outstanding record of passing laws to help the most vulnerable\".\n\"David was a man who believed passionately in this country and in its future. We've lost today a fine public servant and a much-loved friend and colleague,\" said Mr Johnson. \nMs Patel said the killing \"represents a senseless attack on democracy itself\", adding that \"questions are rightly being asked about the safety of our country's elected representatives\".\nSpeaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who spoke to the home secretary on Friday, also said MPs' security would have to be examined. He said Sir David's death would \"send shockwaves across the parliamentary community and the whole country\". \nHe told BBC Two's Newsnight that police were contacting all MPs to check on their safety and reassure them.\nSir Lindsay said he went ahead with his constituency surgery as normal on Friday evening and said it was essential that MPs were able to retain their relationship with their constituents.\n\"We have got to make sure that democracy survives this,\" he said.\nSir David, who represented Southend West, was holding a constituency surgery - where voters can meet their MP and discuss concerns - at Belfairs Methodist Church in Eastwood Road North.\nEssex Police Chief Constable BJ Harrington said they had received reports of a stabbing shortly after 12:05 BST and within minutes, officers had found Sir David with multiple injuries. \nPolice and paramedics \"worked extremely hard\" to save him but he died at the scene, Mr Harrington said.\nPolice have appealed for anyone who saw the attack, or who has footage from CCTV, dash cams or video doorbell to contact them.\nSouthend councillor John Lamb told the BBC that Sir David moved his surgeries to different locations around the constituency \"to meet the people\" and said the attack was \"absolutely dreadful\".\n\"We've lost a very good, hard working constituency MP who worked for everyone,\" he said.\nA Conservative backbencher for nearly forty years, Sir David entered Parliament in 1983 as the MP for Basildon. \nHe held the seat in 1992, but switched to nearby Southend West at the 1997 election. \nRaised as a Roman Catholic, he was known politically as a social conservative and as a prominent campaigner against abortion and on animal welfare issues.  \nHe was also known for his championing of Southend, including a long-running campaign to win city status for the town. \nFather Jeff Woolnough, parish priest at nearby St Peter's Catholic Church, told the BBC: \"Sir David was a great, great man, a good Catholic and a friend to all.\n\"He's died doing that, that's the remarkable thing. He's died serving the people.\"\nHe led a mass at the church on Friday evening in memory of Sir David, describing him as \"Mr Southend\".  \n\"Have you ever known Sir David Amess without that happy smile on his face?\" he asked. \"He carried that great east London spirit of having no fear and being able to talk to people and the level they're at. Not all politicians, I would say, are good at that.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was a \"dark and shocking day\", adding that \"we have, heartbreakingly, been here before\" with the death of Jo Cox.\n\"We will show once more that violence, intimidation and threats to our democracy will never prevail over the tireless commitment of public servants simply doing their jobs,\" he said.\nWe expect the MPs we elect to see us in person, not to hide behind Parliament's ornate gates and wood-panelled walls.\nThat demand is met gladly by the vast majority of MPs.\nBut, increasingly, the job has been accompanied by abuse, intimidation - and risk for MPs and their staff.\nOne member of the cabinet told me today: \"Everyone has had a threat... everyone has had frightening moments.\"\nDealing with harassment, coping with security concerns and reporting those concerns to the police, is sadly routine in politics in the 21st Century.\nIt is inevitable in the coming days that there will be calls for a kinder atmosphere at Westminster, and cooler heads in real life, and online.\nIt is not, however, inevitable that anything at all will change.\nSir David wrote about the impact on MPs of Mrs Cox's murder and a machete attack on Nigel Jones MP in 2000, which led to the death of his aide Andy Pennington, in his diaries published last year. \nReferring to that machete attack, he said: \"We all make ourselves readily available to our constituents and are often dealing with members of the public who have mental health problems, it could happen to any of us.\"\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was \"a truly terrible day for British politics but most importantly of all our prayers are with all the people who loved David\".\nFlags around Parliament and at 10 Downing Street are being flown at half-mast.\nArchbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the MP's death was \"agonisingly painful\" for those who knew him.\n\"The murder of an MP, in the course of caring for their constituents, is a deep blow to this country, its citizens and everyone who desires a peaceful and flourishing democracy,\" he said.\nThe Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, said Sir David \"carried out his vocation as a Catholic in public life with generosity and integrity\".\nFlowers were left near the scene of the killing, with tributes describing Sir David as \"kind and thoughtful\" and \"such a gentleman\".\n\u2022 When they are in Parliament, MPs are well protected by a specialist armed police department called Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection\n\u2022 For most MPs there is not the same close protection when they are in their constituencies\n\u2022 Parliament offers MPs and their staff guidance on security, including tips on how to run a safe constituency surgery, suspicious post and home security\n\u2022 Parliament will pay for MPs to have some security measures installed - such as security alarms and shutters\n\u2022 After the murder of Jo Cox in 2016, the spending on MPs' security rose from \u00a3170,576 in 2015/16, to \u00a34.5m two years later\nWere you in the area?

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Wolverhampton,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The head of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has ordered an investigation into why it took a month to identify a laboratory giving incorrect Covid test results.\nDr Jenny Harries said it was \"not clear yet\" what went wrong at the private lab in Wolverhampton.\nAbout 43,000 people in England and Wales may have been wrongly told their Covid-19 test was negative.\nTesting at the lab has been suspended and those affected are being contacted.\nQuestions are also being raised around how the lab won a multi-million pound government contract. \nConcerns were flagged when people had positive lateral flow tests (LFTs) but negative follow-up PCR results from the lab between 8 September and 12 October. Most of those affected live in south-west England.\nThe error could mean thousands of people infected with Covid were wrongly told to stop isolating, and may have infected others.\nDr Harries, chief executive of the UKHSA and head of NHS Test and Trace, said local public health teams had been querying tests over the last few weeks, but it was only in the last few days that the problem was pinpointed.\n\"It is the location of the laboratory, combined with the geography and the time period, that has allowed us to understand this now,\" she said.\n\"I want to make sure if there are any further problems with other laboratories we can absolutely spot them as quickly as possible.\"\nDr Harries said she would conduct \"a serious incident investigation\" to make sure it doesn't happen again.\nAll samples from the lab, where Immensa Health Clinic Ltd runs the testing operations, are now being sent to other labs.\nUKHSA said all other labs were working normally and there were no technical issues with the test kits themselves.\nGovernment records show that Immensa, which was founded in May 2020 just months after the start of the pandemic, has been awarded contracts for Covid testing by the Department of Health valued at \u00a3181m. \nIt is connected to another company, Dante Labs, which provides genetic sequencing and other laboratory services from offices in Wolverhampton and Cambridge. \nIt also sells private PCR Covid tests to travellers, and is one of 20 companies being investigated by the UK competition watchdog over concerns it may have unfairly treated customers.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said people \"should not be concerned\" by the lab's suspension.\n\"We're looking into what went wrong with that particular testing centre, but it doesn't affect the overall numbers,\" he said.\nOnly a few thousand out of the 43,000 affected by the wrong result could potentially still be infected now and they will be contacted first, by text and email, to recommend they have another test.\nProf Alan McNally, from the University of Birmingham, told the BBC he was \"astonished\" by the revelation and could not work out how so many tests could be incorrect. \n\"It comes down to quality control and quality assurance, oversight and management,\" he said. \n\"I cannot fathom the failings that would lead to this level of false negative results.\" \nThe UKHSA said about 400,000 samples had been processed by the privately-run lab and it estimated 43,000 people may have been given incorrect negative test results, with 4,000 of those from Wales. Some may also be in the south-east of England and scattered across the country.\nGraham Loader, from Newbury, says his family have had three positive LFTs, all followed by negative PCR tests taken at the testing site at Newbury Showground in West Berkshire.\nHe said each time the family got a positive LFT but negative PCR test, they assumed the LFTs must have been at fault. \n\"I think we just blamed the LFTs because they were a bit basic,\" he said.\n\"I thought they must be detecting something from a cold and be an error.\"\nHis wife, a school teacher, had felt a bit unwell but didn't have the classic symptoms of coronavirus. \nShe had a negative PCR test but took some time off as a precaution, despite being advised she did not need to.\nMr Loader, who coaches a boy's football team, thought he had come down with a cold.\nHe added: \"I completely trusted the PCR, so I feel bad for all the people I've been in contact with.\"\nDr Will Welfare, public health incident director at UKHSA - which replaced Public Health England, said: \"As a result of our investigation, we are working with NHS Test and Trace and the company to determine the laboratory technical issues which have led to inaccurate PCR results being issued to people. \n\"We have immediately suspended testing at this laboratory while we continue the investigation.\"\nHe said the public should remain confident in using both kinds of test, and continue to get a follow-up PCR test after a positive LFT.\nThe company said it was \"fully collaborating\" with health officials on the matter and added it had already analysed more than 2.5 million samples for NHS Test and Trace.\nMany coronavirus testing sites in England and Wales are likely to be affected by the lab errors, including one at Newbury Showground used by the Loader family.\nOn Thursday evening West Berkshire council told people who had received a negative result at the site between 3 and 12 October, to book another test.\nFor several weeks, there have been widespread reports in the south-west of England of people testing positive with LFTs, but then later testing negative after a PCR test.\nScientists had called for the issue to be looked into quickly, with one study suggesting positive LFT results were very accurate and should be trusted.\nHave you been contacted by NHS Test and Trace and been asked to take another Covid test?

      "text": "A judge has ruled that security cameras and a Ring doorbell installed in a house in Oxfordshire \"unjustifiably invaded\" the privacy of a neighbour.\nDr Mary Fairhurst claimed that the devices installed on the house of neighbour Jon Woodard broke data laws and contributed to harassment.\nThe judge upheld both these claims.\nMr Woodard now faces a substantial fine. He claimed he installed the devices in good faith as a deterrent against burglars.\nThe origin of the row stems from an invitation from Mr Woodard to his neighbour Dr Fairhurst to have a tour of his home renovations, during which she claimed he showed off his new security system. \nThe judgment reads that Dr Fairhurst was \"alarmed and appalled\" to notice that he had a camera mounted on his shed and that footage from it was sent to his smartphone.\nA series of disputes about the cameras followed, which resulted in Dr Fairhurst moving out of her home.\nIn the judgement it was found that the Ring doorbell captured images of the claimant's house and garden, while the shed camera covered almost the whole of her garden and her parking space. \nJudge Melissa Clarke found that audio data collected by cameras on a shed, in a driveway and on the Ring doorbell was processed unlawfully. She noted that at the time it was not possible to turn off the audio recording facility - that happened in an update in 2020.\nShe said that she found the audio data that could capture conversations \"even more problematic and detrimental than video data\".\n\"Personal data may be captured from people who are not even aware that the device is there, or that it records and processes audio and personal data,\" she said in her judgement.\nThat, she said, was in breach of UK data laws - both the UK Data Protection Act and UK GDPR.\nAmazon, which made both the doorbell and the cameras, said that customers must \"respect their neighbours' privacy, and comply with any applicable laws when using their Ring device.\"\n\"We've put features in place across all our devices to ensure privacy, security and user control remain front and centre - including customisable privacy zones to block out 'off-limit' areas, motion zones to control the areas customers want their Ring device to detect motion, and Audio Toggle to turn audio on and off.\"\nBut the judge added: \"Even if an activation zone is disabled so that the camera does not activate to film by movement in that area, activation by movement in one of the other non-disabled activation zones will cause the camera to film across the whole field of view.\"\nThe Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC: \"Lots of people use domestic CCTV and video doorbells. If you own one, you should respect people's privacy rights and take steps to minimise intrusion to neighbours and passers-by.\"\nBut it added: \"In the vast number of cases, there are no issues.\"\nHannah Hart, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy, said: \"Whilst this case doesn't set a legal precedent, it does continue an ongoing conversation about our changing attitude towards domestic surveillance - and how normalised it has become in our communities.\n\"The fact remains that anyone with a Ring doorbell can turn their area of the neighbourhood into a surveillance space due to its video recording functionality and audio processors which are able to pick up sound 40 feet away. \n\"This means a small number of residents can effectively transform public spaces into surveillance hotbeds, and even share their recordings with police.\" "

      "text": "About 43,000 people in England and Wales may have been wrongly told their Covid-19 test was negative because of errors at a private laboratory.\nTesting at the Wolverhampton lab has been suspended following an investigation by NHS Test and Trace.\nThe head of the UK Health Security Agency has ordered an investigation into why it took a month to identify the failures.\nThose still infectious are being asked to take another Covid test.\nConcerns were raised when people had positive lateral flow tests, but negative follow-up PCR results from the lab between 8 September and 12 October - most affected live in the South West of England.\nThe error could mean thousands of people infected with Covid were wrongly told to stop isolating, and may have infected others.\nProf Alan McNally, from the University of Birmingham, told the BBC he was \"astonished\" by the revelation and could not work out how so many tests could be incorrect. \nJenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and head of NHS Test and Trace, said it was \"not clear\" what went wrong. \n\"We are doing a detailed investigation with them, working on the actual processes within the laboratory - but the important thing of course is that we have suspended all of their services.\" she said.\nThose who are still infectious - estimated to be a few thousand people tested in the past week or so - will be contacted first, by text and email, to recommend they have another test, Dr Harries said.\nLateral flow tests (LFTs) are rapid tests widely used by schools and workplaces to find people with no symptoms who are infected and can spread the virus.\nPCR tests, which are sent off to a lab to be analysed, detect the virus several weeks after infection and trigger contact tracing. After a positive LFT, official guidance is to take a PCR to confirm Covid-19. \nSome false negatives are expected, because no test is 100% perfect, but reports of this happening appeared to be unusually high in certain areas over the past few weeks.\nThe UKHSA said around 400,000 samples had been processed by the privately-run lab and it estimated 43,000 people may have been given incorrect negative test results, with 4,000 of those from Wales. Some may also be in the South East and scattered across the country.\nGraham Loader, from Newbury, says his family have had three positive lateral flow tests, all followed by negative PCR tests taken at the testing site at Newbury Showground in West Berkshire.\nHe said each time the family got a positive lateral flow test but negative PCR test, they assumed the LFTs must have been at fault. \n\"I think we just blamed the LFTs because they were a bit basic,\" he said.\n\"I thought they must be detecting something from a cold and be an error.\"\nHis wife, a school teacher, had felt a bit unwell but didn't have the classic symptoms of coronavirus. She had a negative PCR test but took some time off as a precaution, despite being advised she did not need to.\nMr Loader, who coaches a boy's football team, thought he'd come down with a cold.\nHe added: \"I completely trusted the PCR, so I feel bad for all the people I've been in contact with.\"\nAll samples from the lab, where Immensa Health Clinic Ltd runs the testing operations, are now being sent to other labs.\nGovernment records show that Immensa, which was founded in May 2020 just months after the start of the pandemic, has been awarded contracts for Covid testing by the Department of Health valued at \u00a3181 million. \nUKHSA said all other labs are working normally and there are no technical issues with the test kits themselves.\nDr Will Welfare, public health incident director at UKHSA - which replaced Public Health England - said: \"As a result of our investigation, we are working with NHS Test and Trace and the company to determine the laboratory technical issues which have led to inaccurate PCR results being issued to people. \n\"We have immediately suspended testing at this laboratory while we continue the investigation.\"\nHe said the public should remain confident in using both kinds of test, and continue to get a follow-up PCR test after a positive LFT.\nThe company said it was \"fully collaborating\" with health officials on the matter and added it had already analysed more than 2.5 million samples for NHS Test and Trace.\nWe have been hearing about this for the past couple of weeks - anecdotally - from GPs.\nThey reported patients getting in touch, saying they were unwell, had all the symptoms, had tested positive on a lateral flow, and then had gone to get the confirmatory PCR and it was negative.\nGPs were rather suspicious of this - it seemed to be largely around the South West of England.\nThe problem is with the laboratory in question, not the testing sites.\nBut 8 September - the date from which the UK Health Security Agency says results have been affected - goes back a little way.\nSo the question is, who knew what and when?\nIf you got infected in September and got a false result on your PCR, the infection will have almost certainly worn off by now.\nBut some, who maybe tested in the last week or so, whose results went to that lab, will need to be contacted.\nIt does raise question marks over how some of these labs are run.\nMany coronavirus testing sites in England and Wales are likely to be affected by the lab errors, including one at Newbury Showground in West Berkshire.\nOn Thursday evening the local council told people who had got a negative result at the site between 3 and 12 October, to book another test.\nWest Berkshire Council said it had been told by the government that a number of other sites nationally may have been affected.\nFor several weeks, there have been widespread reports in the South West of England of people testing positive with lateral flow tests, but then later testing negative after a PCR test.\nScientists had called for the issue to be looked into quickly, with one study suggesting positive lateral flow test results were very accurate and should be trusted."

      "tags": "Lebanon,Beirut",
      "text": "Funerals have been held in Lebanon for some of those killed in heavy fighting in the capital Beirut on Thursday.\nSeven were killed and dozens injured when gunfire broke out during a protest by Shia Muslim groups against the judge investigating last year's huge blast at the city's port.\nHezbollah, which organised the protest, said demonstrators were fired on by gunmen on rooftops.\nThey blamed a Christian faction, although the group denies the charge.\nHuge tension surrounds the inquiry into the port explosion that killed 219 people in August 2020.\nSwathes of the city were devastated by the blast, but no one has yet been held accountable.\nHezbollah and its allies have said the investigating judge is biased, but the victims' families support his work.\nThe protest began outside the Palace of Justice - the main court building - with hundreds of people arguing the investigation had become politicised and demanding the removal of Judge Tarek Bitar. It then quickly escalated.\nHeavy gunfire erupted in the streets as the crowd passed through a roundabout in the central Tayouneh-Badaro area.\nLocal residents had to flee their homes as men armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers - believed to have been members of Shia and Christian militias - exchanged fire in the streets.\nAt a nearby school, teachers instructed young children to lie face down on the ground with their hands on their heads, a witness told Reuters news agency.\nThe clashes continued for several hours before calm was restored. \nHospital and military sources said some of those killed had been shot in the head. They included a woman who was hit by a stray bullet while inside her home.\nBy Anna Foster, BBC News, Beirut\nThe streets around Tayouneh are still thickly carpeted with shattered glass after hours of gun and rocket fire. \nSome families who live there left their homes last night in case violence flared again. \nPresident Aoun said it wasn't acceptable for arms to return as communication between the Lebanese parties. But these divisions run deep. \nShia politicians accuse the presiding judge Tarek Bitar of bias. \nBut families of those who died in the port blast died back him, saying MPs are trying to evade justice. \nFor now there's an uneasy truce. But all sides are waiting to see what direction the investigation will now take, and whether its outcome might be swayed. \nLebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea condemned the violence and appealed for calm. \n\"The main cause of these developments lies in the presence of uncontrolled and widespread weapons that threaten the citizens at any time and in any place,\" he tweeted.\nMr Mikati called on everyone to \"calm down and not be drawn into sedition for any reason whatsoever\".\nThe army said it had deployed troops to search for the assailants, and warned that they would \"shoot at any gunman on the roads\". It later said it had arrested nine people \"from both sides, including a Syrian\".\nEarlier on Thursday, a court dismissed a legal complaint brought by two former government ministers and Amal MPs - Ali Hassan Khalil and Ghazi Zaiter - whom Judge Bitar had sought to question on suspicion of negligence in connection with the port explosion.\nThe two men, who deny any wrongdoing, accused the judge of bias.\nFamilies of the victims had condemned the complaint, which caused the inquiry to be suspended for the second time in three weeks. \nThey have accused the country's political leadership of trying to shield itself from scrutiny.\n\"Keep your hands off the judiciary,\" they warned the cabinet on Wednesday after ministers allied to Hezbollah demanded that Judge Bitar be replaced.\nThe port blast last year happened after a fire detonated 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a combustible chemical widely used as agricultural fertiliser, that had been stored unsafely in a port warehouse for almost six years.\nSenior officials were aware of the material's existence and the danger it posed, but failed to secure, remove or destroy it."

      "text": "A lost walker survived two nights in the Cairngorms while a helicopter and mountain rescue teams searched for him. \nDavid Wightman spent an exhausting weekend alone and exposed to the elements after becoming separated from his walking companion, Colin Marshall.\nWhen Mr Marshall managed to raise the alarm, a major search and rescue operation was launched. \nMr Wightman, 62, was eventually found by students who shared their food with him before he was airlifted to safety.\n\"I just have a huge debt to all of these people. It's been quite a humbling experience,\" he told BBC Scotland's The Nine.\nThe pair were walking in the Ben Macdui area, heading to Corrour bothy, when they lost one another in poor weather on Friday. \n\"I lost visibility,\" Mr Wightman, from near Southend-on-Sea in Essex, said. \"My mistake at that point was not shouting or whistling, in the certainty in my mind that I knew which way he'd gone. \n\"It's the most stupid mistake to make of course. From that point onwards we were both on our own.\"\nHe eventually decided to find somewhere to keep warm and sheltered from the wind.\n\"I had some very good luck that the average temperature for October for the Cairngorms was up\", he said. \"I had waterproof clothing on and my bag was serving as a reasonable windbreak on a slab of granite that I found.\n\"I was able to get through 12 hours of darkness and stay reasonably warm. There were some quite severe shivering fits in the middle of the night. I kept my head torch on in case there was anything coming out to look, but [there was] no sign of any search that night.\n\"Not knowing what the situation was with my friend I could only keep my fingers crossed he actually got to shelter. I now know that he did do that.\"\nWhen Mr Marshall raised the alarm, Braemar, Cairngorm and Aberdeen mountain rescue teams were called out, alongside police and search and rescue dogs.\nMr Wightman described the following day - Saturday - as a \"total disaster\".\nHe recalled: \"When I powered on my phone it told me I only had 15% left. The phone died, and the charger didn't work because moisture had got in it.\"\nHe made it to the valley floor of the River Dee, but faced another night in the open.\nAt one point, he spotted the helicopter and its searchlights. He waved his poles and got his bright orange cover out, but he was not spotted.\n\"I know now, and... this would have saved me an awful lot of heartache and grief, that if you have a torch, even in the daylight, shine it,\" he said.\n\"Having waved goodbye to the helicopter, that for me was the lowest point of the whole experience, I then saw in the distance some granite boulders. I tucked myself in as best as possible for another 12 hours.\"\nThe following morning he made it to a meeting point of two valleys - he was exhausted and his morale was low. \nBut then he heard voices from the opposite side of the river, shouting: \"Are you David Wightman?\"\nThere were four students from Aberdeen University who had heard that search teams were looking for him.\n\"From that point the relief was just enormous - I knew this was going to be OK\", he said. \nThey escorted him to shelter, made cups of tea, and lit a fire.\n\"They shared their food, peanut butter out the jar - stick your hand in, don't worry - beef jerky, apples, have whatever you like,\" Mr Wightman said.\n\"It's the kindness of strangers - just restored my faith in human nature.\"\nThey used a piece of silver foil to attract the attention of the helicopter searching overhead.\nHe was flown off the hill, and reunited with Mr Marshall, and then his family.\nAsked if he would one day return to the Cairngorms, Mr Wightman said: \"I love the environment so I could be tempted for sure.\n\"There are things I would do differently given what has happened. It's a wonderful part of the world.\""

      "tags": "UK banking,Cash,UK Finance,Money,Personal finance,Contactless payment",
      "text": "The spending limit on each use of a contactless card has now risen from \u00a345 to \u00a3100 - but not every shop will accept the new payment threshold.\nRetailers say it could take months to update terminals before every shopper can spend up to \u00a3100, without the need to enter a four-digit Pin.\nThe move aims to make purchases such as grocery shopping more convenient.\nBut some warn it could lead to a rise in theft and one bank boss questioned whether shoppers want a higher limit.\nSome 60% of debit and credit card transactions in the UK were contactless in the first seven months of the year. These accounted for a total of 6.6 billion payments with a value of \u00a381bn.\nThe decision to increase the threshold was taken by the Treasury and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the decision would bring convenience for shoppers and a boost to the High Street following Covid lockdowns.\nWhen contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at \u00a310 and designed as an alternative to small change.\nThe limit was raised gradually, to \u00a315 in 2010, to \u00a320 in 2012, and then to \u00a330 in 2015. It was hurriedly increased to \u00a345 last year as the pandemic accelerated a move away from cash.\nAs the limit has increased, so has the frequency of its use. Despite sudden drops of all transactions during national lockdowns, the general trend has been continuing growth. That has come as consumers have been less likely to use banknotes and coins.\nThe huge number of terminals which need to be updated means that Friday marks the first day of a gradual introduction of the new limit.\n\"It may take days, weeks, or even months for some retailers to make the necessary changes in their systems so that the new limit can take effect,\" said Andrew Cregan, payments policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium.\n\"Furthermore, some retailers may choose not to adopt the new contactless limit. As a result, customers will need to take care when making payments to check what the maximum contactless limit is for individual stores.\"\nCampaigners have been concerned that as card and digital payments become more prevalent, it could affect access to cash for those who still rely on it.\nFCA research found that a greater proportion of consumers were finding it difficult to cope with fewer retailers accepting cash during the pandemic. However, it found that eight out of 10 small and medium-sized businesses said they were \"very likely\" to accept cash over the next five years.\nGraham Farrell, professor of crime science at the University of Leeds, has warned about the \"huge increase\" in attractiveness of bag snatches and pickpocketing by teenage thieves, who could then spend more on a stolen card.\nHe co-authored a paper pointing out that these young criminals could then go on to long-term criminal careers.\nA thief will now be able to spend more on an unreported stolen card before a Pin is demanded. FCA guidance suggests a cumulative \u00a3300 needs to be spent on contactless before a purchase is checked by a Pin, up from the previous recommended level of \u00a3130.\nProf Farrell told the BBC a halfway house was needed. \n\"A solution that would balance both sides would be tap-and-Pin. You would have contactless tapping of the card on a machine, without the trouble of putting it in and out of the machine. You would use Pin codes to ensure security, therefore making the theft of the card - as the thieves do not have the Pin - less attractive,\" he said.\nAuthorities have sought to allay any concerns about an increase in fraud, pointing out that there was no rise in the crime after the last increase in the payment limit.\n\"What's more, we have seen no material increase in fraudulent transactions in other countries where the contactless limit increased to the equivalent of \u00a3100 or above,\" a spokesman for the FCA said.\nAustralia and Singapore have contactless limits of the equivalent of about \u00a3100, and Canada's is close to \u00a3150.\nCustomers of a variety of banks can switch off the contactless function, or request a non-contactless card.\nSome - notably Lloyds Banking Group and Starling - will allow customers to set their own contactless limit via the banks' apps.\nAnne Boden, chief executive of Starling Bank, questioned whether consumers really wanted to be able to spend more on Pin-free transactions.\n\"Analysing our spending data we can see that there appears to be little demand for the increased contactless limit and that many would like to retain the same contactless limit or even reduce it,\" she said. \nShoppers can spend more than \u00a3100 without a Pin using payment services on smartphones, although they include in-built security on the devices such as fingerprint authorisation."

      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann,GP",
      "text": "The Department of Health is making up to \u00a35.5m available to support GP services in Northern Ireland over winter.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said he recognised the importance of people being able to access GP services.\nThe funding will be used to improve technology and accessibility, and support patient care.\nMr Swann said that services across health and social care were facing \"a challenging winter\".\nHe has allocated \u00a33.8m to support additional patient care during this time and up to \u00a31.7m to further improve telephone and computer technology. \nHe added that GP feedback showed that patients were presenting with more complex needs, making it difficult for GPs \"to see all the people they would wish to\".\nDepartment of Health figures show that GP practices are currently carrying out almost 200,000 consultations on a weekly basis.\nThe health minister said that GP practices have been open throughout the pandemic and will continue to use both face-to-face appointments and alternative consultation options for patients.\nHe said work was taking place to improve access to primary care for patients, including exploring how telephone systems could be better used to support services.\nHe added that consideration was also being given to ways to better deal with routine requests, such as repeat prescriptions to release capacity.\n\"This work is part of a wider programme to help improve patient access to services, which includes the wider rollout of primary care multi-disciplinary teams, and work to reform the out-of-hours service.\n\"I am committed to ensuring that we have a GP workforce that is supported, motivated and sustainable and that continues to provide quality care to patients when they need it.\"\nHe said work was taking place on a review of GP trainee places, to make sure there were \"enough GPs to meet our primary care needs into the future\".\nLondonderry GP Dr Nicola Duffy said she had asked the Department of Health to be allowed to see more patients in person. She said they were currently restricted by policy.\nShe told BBC Radio Ulster 's Talkback programme that she was not allowed to see patients \"without social distancing, wearing a mask, regardless of whether I am vaccinated or not\".\n\"That is to protect the vulnerable patients that are using the health centre that I work in,\" she said. \n\"I am ready, my colleagues are ready. Could someone higher than me fix this, so we can get back to seeing our patients?\"\nDr Alan Stout, chair of the British Medical Association of Northern Ireland, said he hoped the funding would help some of the immediate pressures that GPs were facing, \"as well as beginning to address some of the more systemic and complex issues, including the number of GP trainee places available\".\n\"General practice has not closed and never closed,\" he said.\n\"Consultation rates and the number of patients contacting their surgery continue to be high and the current system is struggling to cope.\n\"All of our staff are feeling the pressure and we recognise that the difficulty in access and delays in seeing your GP cause frustration to patients.\"\nBut will the extra money help to resolve the current difficulties many patients are facing when trying to get a face-to-face GP appointment?\nDr Laurence Dorman, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners Northern Ireland (RCGPNI), said the \u00a35.5m was \"very welcome\" and would mean \"extra surgeries and extra colleagues\" to help meet patients' needs. \nHowever, he said it was \"short-term\" funding and what was really needed is longer-term financial support and more GPs to join the workforce. \n\"At the moment, there's no point putting an extra phone line into our surgery if we don't have a GP at the end of those lines to meet the needs of our patients,\" he explained.\nDr Dorman also warned that Covid-19 continues to pose safety concerns in GP waiting rooms, particularly for vulnerable patients who need to attend surgeries for treatment.\n\"We're still in the middle of a pandemic and we have to work the way we do to meet infection control standards,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. \n\"We simply not like hairdressers and shops - we have sick patients coming into our buildings.  We have patients who are taking blood tests, chemotherapy and we must be able to protect them,\" he said.\n\"We are seeing out patients face-to-face when it's appropriate and safe to do so, but we are still in a pandemic, we need our patients to work with us.\"\n\"But if our patients need seen face-to-face, absolutely then their family doctor will do that.\"\nAs well as his RCGPNI role, Dr Dorman works in a GP surgery in Kilkeel, County Down. \nAddressing complaints over the number of in person appointments being made available, he argued that GPs were working \"harder than ever\".\nDr Dorman said the GP workforce was \"tired and exhausted\", adding that \"some of the negative criticism is really demoralising\". \nHe argued that the increase in telephone consultations during the pandemic meant that family doctors were treating more patients than they had ever done before and were often able to provide a \"same-day\" service.\nHe said GP services were undergoing an \"overall transformation\" like many parts of the health service, in an attempt to tailor services to patients' needs.\n\"This new way of working is actually suiting and working very well for some patients,\" he added. \nDr Dorman said that pre-Covid, most patients frequently faced a two-week wait for a GP appointment, most of which were face-to-face.\n\"That didn't suit a lot of patients, particularly patients who worked, patients who had caring commitments, so these new ways of working which are going right across the health care system, right through to outpatients and so on, are important and necessary.\""

Reporters and people laying flowers have gathered on this normally quiet residential street of semi-detached houses, flats and tall trees.\nA police cordon surrounds the church, police cars line the road. The mood is quiet and sombre.\nEverybody is shocked that something so unexpected and devastating can happen here - and in a church.\nBut above all, they talk of an MP always willing to listen to them, to help them and to be part of their community.\nThat community has been left stunned by the events of the past few hours and people have come forward to pay tribute to his work as a local MP, at pains to emphasise that he was a kind man.\nResident Melanie Harris left flowers at the scene. She said they were \"a small gesture to show we care\".\nShe also left a card that read: \"What has the world come to? What a senseless waste of a charming, witty and kind and gentle soul who deserved a lot more than to be snatched from life. \n\"You were always a pleasure to speak to. Thank you for restoring my faith in politicians.\"\nMohamad Imani, who is a member of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, a coalition of Iranian dissident groups which is calling for regime change in the country, said he was \"shocked\" by Sir David's death.\nMr Imani said the MP had been a \"great friend\" of the NCRI and a \"hero for human rights\".\nHe said he had met him several times in Parliament and travelled with him to conferences in Paris, France and Tirana, Albania.\n\"I have a lot of memories with him, always laughing and joking,\" he said. \"He was a very kind man and a great human.\"\nStephen Aylen, who was a local councillor for 25 years, said: \"He was very involved, a proper MP.\n\"For this to happen, what can I say?\"\nAlysha Codabaccus, 24, said: \"This kind of thing just doesn't happen around here. This is a nice quiet area, it happened in a church, there's a school just up the road.\n\"It's something completely out of the blue, it's just really shocked us all and this should not have happened.\"\nKevin Buck, a Conservative Southend councillor, who worked with Sir David for 10 years, said he was \"shocked and numb\".\n\"I just can't believe he was with us here this morning, and not here now.\n\"He was a remarkable MP because he was a remarkable man - kind, compassionate and caring.\"\nParish Priest Kevin Hale said the community was \"absolutely shocked and appalled\" and it was \"hard to believe\".\n\"Sir David was a neighbour of ours, a good friend of the parish, a frequent visitor, a familiar face in the area and a great supporter of everything in the community,\" he said.\n\"We're all so utterly appalled. Our hearts and our prayers go out profoundly to his wife and children.\"\nRay Howard, a Conservative councillor in Canvey Island for 51 years, and who canvassed for Mr Amess, spoke of his deep upset.\n\"He didn't want to become a minister, he didn't want to go higher, he just wanted to be good constituency man, and what a good man and parliamentarian he has been.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "New rules allowing travellers returning to England to take lateral flow tests instead of more expensive PCR tests will come into force on 24 October.\nThe government says the changes will take effect in time for families returning from half term breaks.\nFully vaccinated passengers will be told to upload photos of their Covid-19 tests for verification.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would make travel easier and simpler.\nThe travel industry had said it was vital to make the changes to the Covid travel tests in time for the half term holiday.\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said: \"This is great news and we're pleased to get it over the line in time for the crucial half term period, which will be a massive relief to families desperate to get away this autumn.\"\nAlong with last week's reduction of the travel red list and the recognition of vaccinations administered in more foreign countries, the change is \"a major step forward that will support the desperately needed recovery of our sector,\" he said.\nThe changes come as the UK continues to record the highest level of Covid-19 infections and deaths in western Europe, with another 45,066 cases recorded on Thursday - the largest number since late July.\nA further 157 deaths were also recorded.\nPolicy on travel is devolved, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have previously aligned with policy in England, citing the practicalities of the shared border.\nBut Wales criticised replacing PCR tests, which are often described as the gold standard for Covid testing, with lateral flow tests, saying that along with other relaxed measures it would \"considerably increase\" the risk of new variants coming into the country.\nUnder the existing system, PCR tests taken on day two after returning to England can cost about \u00a375 per person.\nWhen the changes come into effect, anyone who receives a positive result from their lateral flow test will be required to self-isolate and to take a free PCR test to confirm it.\nTravellers due to arrive in England from 24 October onwards will be able to order their lateral flow tests from 22 October, when a list of approved providers will be published on the gov.uk website.\nNHS Test and Trace tests - which can be ordered for free - cannot be used for international travel, the government said.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"We want to make going abroad easier and cheaper, whether you're travelling for work or visiting friends and family.\"\nHe said the change was made possible by the high levels of vaccination, which means \"we can safely open up travel as we learn to live with the virus\".\nMr Shapps said: \"Taking away expensive mandatory PCR testing will boost the travel industry and is a major step forward in normalising international travel and encouraging people to book holidays with confidence.\"\nDoes this change come in time for your holiday?

Mr Avery could also see 15 years of probation and a $10,000 (\u00a37,308) fine.\nThe gun was kept unsecured inside a children's backpack that was left on the floor of the couple's bedroom, according to Altamonte Springs police. \nThey said the toddler took the weapon, moved behind the mother and fired a single shot.\nOne of Lynn's co-workers on the Zoom video call first phoned in the 11 August incident to emergency responders. She reported hearing a loud noise and seeing Lynn fall backward. \n\"One of the girls passed out...She has the camera on. Her baby is crying in the back,\" the co-worker said in a call released by police to local media.\nWhen Mr Avery returned home, he found his girlfriend bleeding on the floor.

He could be heard performing CPR as he waited for help to arrive. \nFirst responders attempted to aid the 21-year-old, but she was pronounced dead at the scene. \n\"Your decisions have consequences,\" Altamonte Springs police officer Roberto Ruiz said in a news conference on Tuesday.\n\"You have a responsibility as a gun owner to take care of those firearms.\"\nNeither of the couple's two children, who were both at home during the incident, were injured.

      "tags": "Conservative Party,David Amess,David Amess death,Leigh-on-Sea",
      "text": "Sir David Amess was one of Parliament's characters: fun, friendly, unconventional and outspoken.\nHis broad grin and boyish enthusiasm were fixtures in the House of Commons chamber for nearly 40 years. \nHe never scaled the heights of government, choosing to dedicate his career to his beloved Essex and the causes he cared about most. The 69-year-old was one of those rare MPs who earned cross-party respect for the conviction he brought to his opinions and campaigns. They ranged from passionate support of Brexit to animal rights - and anything that brought Essex up in the world. \nHe always took his work seriously, but himself rarely.\nHe was stabbed to death while in his constituency surgery in the seaside town of Leigh-on-Sea, an attack that has stunned his constituents and colleagues from across the political spectrum. \nSir David burst on to the political scene as the new MP for Basildon in 1983, the embodiment of what was known then as Essex Man, the archetypal aspirational voter who helped deliver a landslide victory for Margaret Thatcher that year. \nWith an East End accent and relatively humble origins, he gained a high profile on TV and radio, and triumphed against the odds in the 1992 general election when he unexpectedly held on to his seat.\n\"My colleagues and supporters, go out and rejoice and celebrate!\", he declared.\nFrom that moment on David Amess was cheered by his Conservative colleagues every time he rose to his feet in Parliament, where he would rarely pass up the chance to mention Basildon. \nHe held the seat until 1995 when he realised the seat would be lost to Labour after boundary changes and switched his loyalty and devotion to nearby Southend West. For years he campaigned for Southend to become a city, mentioning it virtually every week in Parliament - he retweeted a BBC Essex tweet along these lines just a day before his death.  \nSir David - who was married with five children - was also a devout Catholic. \nHe was socially conservative: he supported capital punishment and opposed abortion. He was an early Eurosceptic. He was also a strong supporter of animal rights, including a fox hunting ban, and he campaigned against fuel poverty, advocated tackling obesity and raised awareness of endometriosis, a painful gynaecological condition that some women suffer.\nAlthough for many years he was a parliamentary aide to the former cabinet minister, Michael Portillo, he never held ministerial office; he was too unorthodox for that. \nDeputy prime minister Dominic Raab paid tribute to \"a great common sense politician and a formidable campaigner with a big heart, and tremendous generosity of spirit - including towards those he disagreed with\".\nThe SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said he was \"a thoroughly decent man\".\nHis loss will be felt keenly in his Southend West constituency. Trembling with emotion Father Jeff Woolnough, parish priest of St Peter's Catholic church in Eastwood Road North, Leigh-On-Sea, told the BBC Sir David was a \"great, great man, a good Catholic and a friend to all\". \nBorn in Plaistow in 1952, he went to school in London and did many things before turning to politics.\nHe taught at a school in London before embarking on a career as a recruitment consultant. He did attract unwelcome publicity in 1997, when he was the victim of satirist Chris Morris on his Channel 4 show Brass Eye, when he was shown with other well-known figures condemning Cake, a made-up drug. Sir David said Channel 4 should feel \"shame\" for the programme, as it came soon after the case of his then-constituent 18 year old Leah Betts, who died after she took ecstasy.\nHe was one of those MPs who used Parliament to sponsor bills, to sit on committees, to form alliances, so that he could shape law from the backbenches.\nAs an animal welfare specialist, he led campaigns to ban cages for game birds and end the transport of live animals for export - and was a patron of the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation. Sir David was what they call an old school parliamentarian - the epitome of a constituency MP who died serving those he was so proud to represent. "

      "text": "The Taliban have banned hairdressers in Afghanistan's Helmand province from shaving or trimming beards, saying it breaches their interpretation of Islamic law.\nAnyone violating the rule will be punished, Taliban religious police say.\nSome barbers in the capital Kabul have said they also received similar orders.\nThe instructions suggest a return to the strict rulings of the group's past tenure in power, despite promises of a milder form of government.\nSince taking power last month, the Taliban have carried out harsh punishments on opponents. On Saturday, the group's fighters shot dead four alleged kidnappers and their bodies were hung in the streets of the western city of Herat.\nIn a notice posted on salons in southern Helmand province, Taliban officers warned that hairdressers must follow Sharia law for haircuts and beards.\n\"No one has a right to complain,\" the notice, which was seen by the BBC, read.\n\"The fighters keep coming and ordering us to stop trimming beards,\" one barber in Kabul said. \"One of them told me they can send undercover inspectors to catch us.\"\nAnother hairdresser, who runs one of the city's biggest salons, said he received a call from someone claiming to be a government official. They instructed him to \"stop following American styles\" and not to shave or trim anyone's beard.\nDuring the Taliban's first stint in power from 1996 to 2001, the hardline Islamists banned flamboyant hairstyles and insisted that men grow beards.\nBut since then, clean-shaven looks have become popular and many Afghan men have gone to salons for fashionable cuts.\nBut the barbers, who have not been named to protect their safety, say the new rules are making it hard for them to make a living.\n\"For many years my salon was somewhere for young people to shave as their wish and look trendy,\" one told the BBC. \"There is no point continuing this business.\"\n\"Fashion salons and barbers are becoming forbidden businesses,\" another said. \"This was my job for 15 years and I don't think I can continue.\"\nAnother barber in Herat said that although he had not received an official order, he had stopped offering beard trims.\n\"Customers don't shave their beards [because] they don't want to be targeted by the Taliban fighters in the streets. They want to blend in and look like them.\"\nDespite slashing his prices for a cut, his business has dried up. \"Nobody cares about their style or hair fashion,\" he said."

      "tags": "Scottish government,ScotRail,Rail travel,RMT,Strike action,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "ScotRail engineers have said they will take strike action that will \"severely disrupt\" the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.\nIt is the latest stage in a long-running dispute over pay and conditions and proposed cuts to services at the rail operator, which wants to reduce the number of services across Scotland by 300 a day from next May.\nUnions and management are due to meet again on Tuesday afternoon, when a fresh offer is expected to be made to workers. \nScotRail is currently run by Dutch firm Abellio - but will be taken over by a company owned and controlled by the Scottish government in March of next year.\nThe move was announced by the government earlier this year after Abellio was stripped of its contract three years early amid concern over its performance. \nThe Unite union said on Monday that about 250 engineers - who maintain and repair ScotRail's fleet of trains - would stage a series of 24-hour strikes in the coming weeks.\nSeveral of the dates clash with the climate summit, which will see world leaders come to Glasgow from 31 October until 12 November. \nThe union said it had been left with no choice due to what it described as the \"reckless\" actions of Abellio ScotRail management and its failure to make a \"meaningful\" pay offer. \nThe company has previously rejected a number of demands, including a \"substantial\" pay increase, greater flexibility of holidays, and no compulsory redundancies.\nAnd unions have questioned why ferry workers can be given a 4.8% pay increase but rail workers cannot. \nA number of rail depots, workplaces and stations will be impacted by the strikes, including Glasgow Queen Street and Glasgow Central, Edinburgh Waverley and Perth.\nUnite's industrial officer, Pat McIlvogue, accused ScotRail of having attempted to spin out and delay talks over pay in an attempt to \"avoid the national embarrassment\" of having strike action during COP26.\nBut he said this had now \"backfired\" - and predicted that the conference and other events would be severely disrupted by the industrial action.\nHe also called on the Scottish government to intervene in the dispute.\nConductors who are members of the RMT union voted in March to take strike action in a dispute about overtime pay, which centres around conductors being paid less than drivers for working on rest days. \nThat industrial action is still ongoing and has wiped out the vast majority of ScotRail services on a Sunday for the past six months - with neither side in the dispute showing any sign of backing down.\nScotRail said it was facing a \"stark\" financial situation in the wake of the pandemic, and said everyone needed to work together to modernise the railway so it is fit for the future. \nAnd it said it would continue to engage with trade unions to find an agreement on pay and conditions.\nAbellio ScotRail recorded losses of \u00a364.5m in the financial year to March 2020 - before the full impact of the pandemic hit - and has been receiving emergency funding from the government since then to help it cope with the massive reduction in passenger numbers. \nThe rail operator says it wants to introduce a new timetable in May of next year that would see it run 2,100 services on a weekday rather than the 2,400 that were running before Covid.\nThe figure is slightly higher than the reduced number of about 2,000 daily services that have been running during the pandemic.\nScotRail says it had been providing \"significantly more seats\" than were required by passengers on several routes across the country before the pandemic - with only about a quarter of seats taken on the average day.\nIt said most passengers would not see any great change to services at their station, and insisted that the new timetable will help to improve the punctuality and reliability of services.\nScotRail added: \"Returning to a pre-pandemic timetable would result in trains operating 26 million more vehicle miles each year for little customer benefit.\n\"As well as increased emissions, that would increase ScotRail costs to the taxpayer by \u00a330m to \u00a340m each year.\"\nUnions believe that cutting rail services will also result in jobs being lost, and argue that the move is incompatible with the Scottish government's aim of encouraging more people to use public transport. \nThey have also warned that the cuts will hit vulnerable people, particularly the elderly and disabled, hardest, and have claimed that the country only has \"six months to save Scotland's railways\".\nThe main rail unions - the RMT, Aslef, TSSA and Unite - say the Scottish government has the powers to block the cuts to services now, despite not formally taking over ScotRail for another six months.\nThey say this is because the government is already effectively managing the ScotRail franchise under emergency powers that were introduced in April of last year to ensure trains continued to run throughout the Covid pandemic.\nThe four unions recently held a joint protest outside the first minister's Bute House residence, with RMT general secretary Mick Lynch saying the government \"cannot evade responsibility\" over the proposed cuts. \nHe added: \"\u200eWith COP26 just weeks away, it beggars belief that the Scottish government is happy to preside over massive cuts to rail services, despite this being a sustainable and low carbon form of transport. \n\"This will do nothing to make Scotland a 'net zero nation' and will just push more people into cars.\"\nTransport Minister Graeme Dey said that the government had been encouraging the unions and ScotRail management \"for many months\" to come to a resolution in the dispute. \nAnd he called on both sides to \"step back from some of the rhetoric\" and instead focus on coming to an agreement. \nSpeaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme on Tuesday, he said spending on Scotland's railways was about \u00a31bn before the pandemic but was now more than \u00a31.5bn.\nHe said this was not sustainable, so efficiency savings would have to be made.\nAnd he said he hoped that the unions would view the new offer from ScotRail \"in the spirit in which it is being made\", and that they would consider settling the dispute.

      "text": "Ikea, the Swedish furniture giant, says it expects the disruption to global supply chains to continue for at least another year.\nChief executive Jesper Brodin said while there had been some improvement, there was still congestion at ports which has led to supply problems.\n\"We need to live with disturbances for the year to come,\" he said.\nThe owner of Poundland has also predicted that pressure from supply chain problems will last into 2022.\nAndy Bond, chief executive of PepCo, which owns Poundland, said that its shipping costs had soared. \"There are some times where we have had to pay 10 times our normal rates,\" he said.\n\"That's not to say every day but that has been the impact.\"\nMr Bond said the retailer had good levels of stock for Christmas and did not expect to increase prices to cope with rising shipping costs. But he said: \"I think that we see the next 12 months remaining challenging.\"\nMr Brodin, chief executive of Ingka, which operates the majority of Ikea's stores, told the BBC that the UK and other countries were suffering with \"congestion in ports and disturbances in supply chains\".\n\"There is no easy fix to any of this even if people are working hard across not only Ikea but also across the world,\" he said.\nLast month, Ikea said it was struggling to supply 10% of its stock, or around 1,000 product lines including mattresses, to its 22 stores in the UK and Ireland amid the continuing shortage of HGV drivers.\nMeanwhile, earlier this week, it emerged that the key British commercial port of Felixstowe was suffering from logjams of shipping containers because of the busy Christmas period and a deficit of lorry drivers to shift them. \nIkea has been forced to purchase additional shipping containers and charter vessels to address product shortages. \nA spokeswoman for Ikea told the BBC last month: \"We have also sent goods by train from China to Europe and we have invested in temporary intermediate warehouses in China, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, and Thailand to support production.\"\nMr Brodin said: \"One thing we have learned is it is difficult to predict. You need to be on it every day and find the best solutions.\n\"At the same time from a realistic point, we need to live with disturbances for the year to come but things will gradually get better, I'm sure.\" \nOn Wednesday, shipping giant Maersk told the BBC it was re-routing some of its biggest ships away from the Port of Felixstowe, due to a logjam of shipping containers.\nLars Mikael Jensen, head of global ocean network at Maersk, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Drive programme that some of its largest 20,000-container ships were waiting outside Felixstowe, the UK's biggest container port, for between four to seven days.\n\"We've taken those measures because we saw, because of the big ships, there is a limit to how many berths they can call in Felixstowe, and because its slower, it took longer to handle every ship,\" he said.\n\"Instead of wasting time waiting, we progressed to the next stop, and arranged that the boxes are relayed from that port rather than wait for a week and then discharge.\"\nBut on Thursday afternoon, the BBC understands that Maersk apologised to the government for the comments, which led to widespread concern about Felixstowe's capacity to receive and process goods.\nThe BBC has seen details of a conversation between the government and the shipping company. \nIt's understood that Maersk told the government that Lars Mikael Jensen, head of Maersk's east-west network, had said in a press briefing that Felixstowe was experiencing congestion.\nMr Jenson had mentioned that one ship was diverted to Rotterdam where the cargo was offloaded to a smaller ship. \nMaersk said that there is not a specific plan to divert ships from Felixstowe now or in the near future and that traffic is managed dynamically. The company also said they are making decisions for other European ports. \nMaersk is also understood to have said that they are bringing in 25% more boxes to the UK between July to September, than the same period last year. \nIkea revealed that, over the year to 31 August, sales rose by 6.3% to \u20ac37.4bn (\u00a331.6bn).\nMr Brodin said that when the Covid pandemic first hit last year, the group was forced to speed up a plan to invest in a strategy to meet customer needs and take on \"the new competition\", in particular ramping up its online operation. \nHe said that what the company had planned as a two-year transformation was rolled out in two months. \nMr Brodin said dealing with the pandemic \"is definitely a challenging time in so many ways\". \nHe said the increase in annual sales was the one he was \"most proud of\" during his 25 years with the company. \n\"We have experienced the demand on life at home like never before in every market, since, of course, people have been in the same situation - confined to the four walls of their home.\" "

He's like our eldest son in a way. And it's just great when we see each other.\"\nHe added: \"We play each other music and we cheer each other up when we're down in the dumps and it's a lovely thing.

He later killed three more young men the same way.\nDet Sgt Martin O'Donnell did not know of a previous allegation of drug rape against Port in similar circumstances.\nThe Met Police officer told the hearing he did not search the national police database for information on Port.\nThere was also a delay in inspecting Port's computer, which would have shown detectives a frequent search history about raping and drugging young men.\nGiving evidence at Barking Town Hall in east London, where inquests are being held into the deaths of Port's four victims, Det Sgt O'Donnell said: \"It's just a huge failure not to have obtained that information.\"\nPort had initially been arrested on suspicion of raping a man in December 2012, but the case was dropped when the complainant said he did not support a prosecution.\nBut Mr O'Donnell did not update the Crime Reporting Information System (CRIS), which logs progress in an investigation for colleagues to see.\nHe told the hearing: \"It feels like a fairly significant mistake of mine not to include it in that document.\n\"It's a terrible mistake that I did not put it in there.\"\nThe inquest previously heard Port repeatedly changed his account over Mr Walgate's death - initially telling emergency services he chanced upon the aspiring fashion designer slumped by the communal entrance to his flat on 19 June 2014, to later admitting he agreed to meet the young escort for sex.\nAndrew O'Connor QC, counsel to the inquest, said: \"Stephen Port lied to police about his dealings with Anthony, there were suspicions his death was caused by drugs, and you have a detailed account that he (Port) forced drugs on him (the rape complainant) on more than one occasion.\"\nMr O'Donnell replied: \"Yes, you're absolutely right, that should have gone on that report.\"\nThe inquest hearings are looking at whether the victims' lives could have been saved had police acted differently.\nMr Walgate, 23, Gabriel Kovari, 22, Daniel Whitworth, 21, and Jack Taylor, 25, were all found dead near Port's flat in Barking.\nPort, now 46, was found guilty at the Old Bailey in 2016 of the four murders and sentenced to a whole-life order.

      "tags": "Scottish government,NHS Scotland,Vaccination,Intensive care,Coronavirus pandemic,Pregnancy",
      "text": "More than 20% of women admitted to intensive care for Covid-19 since May 2021 were pregnant or had recently given birth, a study has found.\nA Scottish Intensive Care Audit Group report said 42 had been admitted since 18 May 2021, compared with 25 in the first two waves of the pandemic.\nThe number has gone up despite overall intensive care numbers reducing.\nThe Scottish government said vaccines were the best way to protect against the risks of Covid in pregnancy.\nThe Scottish Intensive Care Audit Group (SICAG) report found that no deaths of pregnant women following ICU treatment had been reported up to 19 September 2021.\nThe report counts pregnant women admitted to ICUs and women who were admitted within six weeks of giving birth. Admission to high dependency units, used for managing high risk pregnancies, were not included in the figures.\nIn the first two waves of the pandemic in Scotland, between 1 March 2020 and 17 May 2021, 1,850 Covid patients were admitted to ICU, according to SICAG.\nOf this number, 630 were women and about 4% of them were pregnant or had recently given birth.\nSince 18 May 2021, 189 women have required intensive care treatment for Covid-19 and 22.2% of them have been pregnant.\nDr Sarah Stock, a consultant in maternal and foetal medicine, said it was still uncertain what had caused the rise.\n\"It could be because a much lower proportion of pregnant women are vaccinated, or it could be because pregnant women are particularly susceptible to severe disease from the Delta variant that has predominated during the third wave - but we don't know for sure yet,\" she said.\nBut Dr Stock, who is co-leading a study into Covid-19 in pregnancy at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland there was \"really strong evidence\" that pregnant women were more likely than other women to be admitted to hospital and intensive care.\n\"We also know that although we've had no deaths in Scotland yet, data from around the world and in particular the United States has shown higher mortality rates with Covid-19 in pregnancy than in non-pregnant women,\" she said.\nThe consultant said there was also evidence Covid-19 led to higher premature birth rates and probably caused more stillbirths as well.\n\"Being pregnant affects your response to infections. We know that pregnant women are more susceptible to viruses - and this is probably what we're seeing with Covid-19.\"\nThe SICAG study's authors said they had found \"very few\" critical care admissions among pregnant women during the first and second waves of the pandemic.\nThe report continued: \"Wave three has seen increased numbers of pregnant women being admitted to hospital with moderate to severe Covid-19 symptoms requiring critical care.\n\"The majority of patients were pregnant on admission to critical care and 30% were admitted after delivery.\"\nMost of the women lived in the most deprived areas of Scotland, the report added.\nThe report also found that none of the women who required treatment in intensive care were fully vaccinated at the time of admission.\nA separate report by Public Health Scotland (PHS), published on 6 October, found vaccine take-up among pregnant women in Scotland was low across all age groups.\nPHS estimates that of the 77,679 women who were pregnant between December 2020 and August 2021, about 18% received at least a first dose.\nThe over-40s have achieved the best level of vaccine coverage so far at 26.5%. The figure drops to 7% in the under-19s.\nAlthough younger age groups were vaccinated later in the roll-out programme, general coverage in all age groups apart from 12-17 year olds in August was above 70%.\nDr Pat O'Brien, vice president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said a number of factors could be influencing the increase in ICU admission figures.\nFor example, he said an increase in birth rates this year could lead to higher numbers in ICU, as a proportion of all pregnant women will always become severely ill from Covid-19.\nBut he told BBC Scotland the \"key message\" was for pregnant women to make sure they were vaccinated.\n\"There is still a significant number of pregnant women being admitted to ICU with Covid. That's obviously bad for the woman, but it's also bad for the baby,\" he said.\n\"All of this is preventable by a vaccine that is perfectly safe to take in pregnancy.\"\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"It is clear from the report that unvaccinated people are considerably more likely to require ICU treatment, so it remains vital that everyone who is eligible takes up the offer of vaccination, as this will protect the NHS and save lives.\n\"This includes pregnant women, as vaccination is the best way of protecting against the risks of Covid in pregnancy.\""

      "text": "Three months after losing twins in early pregnancy, the pain is still raw for Claire Dalles.\n\"We went from being told we were going from a couple to a family of four and within 21 weeks going back to just being the two of us,\" she said.\n\"It was devastating. I felt numb, like someone had put me in a boxing ring and knocked me out.\n\"It's your baby and it exists the minute you see on the pregnancy test that you are pregnant. It's the imagination, the fantasy of that life, what you will do, how much you will love that baby, what will become of it, how much your life will change and whether it is one week or 24 weeks the loss is just as horrible.\"\nClaire is just one campaigner calling for paid leave for parents who lose a baby early in pregnancy. \nCurrently, parents who lose a baby after 24 weeks are entitled to bereavement leave, but those who lose a baby before are not.\nThe Scottish government offers three days paid leave for parents in the public sector who suffer miscarriage. But because the matter is devolved to Westminster, it can't be imposed on the private sector without UK government legislation.\nClaire's story is heartbreaking.\n\"We found out we were expecting twins at an early stage because I had a pain in my right side. A scan showed that I was expecting two babies, which we were so happy about.\n\"When we went for the normal 12-week scan, one twin had disappeared. It's the vanishing twin syndrome. We were warned about it because apparently it happens quite a lot. \n\"I didn't physically feel anything. I don't know exactly when it happened, so for me it feels like it happened on the day of the 12-week scan because that's the day I found out. \n\"I was told my second twin was perfectly healthy, everything was fine.\"\nAt her 20-week scan, Claire was given the devastating news that the remaining twin - a boy - had no kidneys, no bladder and no stomach. Claire also did not have enough amniotic fluid because the fluid is built up by the baby's urine.\nShe was told all of this was not compatible with life and was given the choice to continue with the pregnancy knowing that she would most likely lose the baby before term. If the baby was to be born, he would only live a few hours because his lungs would not be developed.\n\"My biggest concern was if my baby was feeling pain,\" said Claire. \"We were told at this stage he was not feeling pain because the nervous system was not developed. So we decided to terminate the pregnancy while the baby was not feeling pain, because that was the only thing we could give our baby.\" \nClaire lost both her babies within 21 weeks. She said that since the loss was classed as a miscarriage, she felt like her babies didn't matter and were not seen as real people.\nHaving to deal with her grief and be expected to work right away was difficult.\nShe said: \"You already have a lot to deal with. You have your own pain, the pain of your partner and every single thing feels like a battle in those early days. If on top of that you have to worry about how you are going to be perceived or dealt with at work and battle against someone to get what should be yours to begin with, it is just horrible and adds to the pain and the struggle.\"\nIn Baby Loss Awareness week, SNP MP Angela Crawley has renewed her proposal that the UK government give affected parents\u00a0the legal right to take three days paid leave. \nThe Lanark and Hamilton East MP's aim is to see the loss of a baby recognised at any stage of pregnancy and to increase the length of leave.\nShe told the BBC: \"I recognise that three days is often nowhere near enough to compensate or to allow parents time to grieve that loss.  I would welcome seven or 14 days, akin to the current existing bereavement law. \n\"But, as a starting point, this private member's bill would be putting on the legislative or statutory footing the three days paid leave for those parents.\"\nNicola Welsh from baby loss support charity Held in our Hearts agrees something has to be done for those whose babies did not reach 24 weeks..\nShe said: \"That could be someone who has lost a baby at 22 weeks and yet we are expecting them to go back to work, or have to go and get a sick line.\n\"That is just devastating, to think of somebody who has just had a labour and is still physically recovering and absolutely still emotionally recovering and they find themselves in a GP surgery where they are not sick, they're sad.\"\nStacey Macdonald was lucky her company recognised her loss. Her employers \"bent over backwards\" to help her, guaranteeing two weeks protected leave after delivery. \nIt was not the same for her husband Kevin.\n\"Unfortunately, I was not in as privileged a situation with my work. it wasn't quite as smooth. I did get paid leave off but it was sick leave as there is no policy in place for baby bereavement.\"\nCross-party support is growing for the proposed legislation. \nMs Crawley's private members' bill is to have its first full debate in December."

      "tags": "Policing,Domestic abuse,Yvette Cooper",
      "text": "Victims of alleged domestic abuse are seeing their cases dropped at a rapidly increasing rate, according to data obtained by the BBC.\nThe time limit to charge common assault - including instances of domestic violence - is six months.\nNearly 13,000 cases were dropped in England and Wales over five years after the authorities hit that limit.\nCampaigners say women are being denied justice and the police and prosecutors should be given more time.\nThe new figures relate to common assault cases - which includes things like a push, threatening words or being spat at - and which are normally dealt with at magistrates court.\nBut three-quarters of all domestic abuse cases - including sexual assaults - are closed early without the suspect being charged, according to a report by HM inspector of constabulary.\nAnd just 1.6% of rape allegations in England and Wales result in someone being charged, something the government has said it is \"deeply ashamed\" about.\nVictims of domestic common assault are sometimes reluctant to come forward and the cases can be complex - which is why campaigners say the police should be given more time to investigate them.\nA government spokesman said all allegations should be investigated and pursued where possible, and money had been invested to support victims of such crimes during the pandemic.\nBut Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said it was another example of the criminal justice system failing to understand violence against women and girls.\n\"This is a shocking fact that thousands of cases a year  - and getting worse - are just being timed out,\" she told BBC News. \n\"There are so many reasons why victims and survivors of domestic abuse might not be able to report an assault straight away. But then to be told that the perpetrator is just going to be let off because they've run out of time is completely wrong. That is why the law needs to change.\"\nThe six-month time limit is meant to keep the criminal justice system moving - but campaigners are calling for it to be extended to two years in instances of domestic violence.\nErica Osakwe, who founded Victims Too, was encouraged to report her abuse to police on leaving her relationship, but was later told no charges could be brought because the police had failed to properly file the initial report and the time limit had expired. \nShe said: \"There was a pit in my stomach that didn't leave me for weeks or months. I felt like they took me for a joke. I wasn't taken seriously. It didn't seem like they've valued my story.\n\"To me, six months isn't enough time to even fathom that sort of experience and allow someone to get the support they need before coming forward.  \n\"This six months not only applies to victims of abuse but also applies to the police as well to get it done. The police might not be able to gather the evidence they need in the six months to even get that prosecution charge.\"\nMs Osakwe and campaign group Refuge are backing moves by Ms Cooper to amend the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill currently making its way through Parliament.\nFigures obtained by the BBC using Freedom of Information from 30 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales, reveals a huge increase in allegations of common assault involving domestic abuse - but a fall in the number of charges being brought.\nFrom 2016-17 to 2020-21 there were at least 12,982 cases of common assault that were flagged as involving domestic abuse in which no-one was charged due to the time limit. \nThere has been a 159% increase in the number of times common assaults flagged as involving domestic abuse have not been charged because of this time limit.\nThe data was not broken down by gender, and covers both men and women.\nBetween 2016-17 and 2020-21 the total number of common assaults flagged as instances of domestic abuse increased by 71% from 99,134 to 170,013. \nIn the same time period, the number of these common assaults that resulted in charges being brought fell by 23%.\nA government spokesman said: \"All allegations should be investigated and pursued rigorously through the courts where possible, and there is no time limit on reporting crimes such as bodily harm or those that add up to coercive behaviour.\n\"We have invested millions into vital services to support victims throughout the pandemic, and continue to urge anyone at risk of harm to come forward and get the help they need.\n\"Perpetrators of domestic abuse do untold damage and we sympathise with any victim whose life has been affected by such acts.\"\nLouisa Ralfe, the lead for domestic abuse at the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: \"We know there are many reasons why victims may not immediately report offences, particularly in cases of domestic abuse where victims can face coercion and other barriers to coming forward.\n\"We are supporting the Home Office in their analysis of this issue and we will continue to work with them and the Crown Prosecution Service to understand the scale and ensure that every victim is able to achieve the justice they deserve.\""

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "India is set to reopen its borders to overseas travellers as it relaxes Covid-related restrictions amid a drop in daily infections. \nStarting Friday, the country will grant tourist visas to travellers arriving on chartered flights.\nThe facility will be extended to those arriving on commercial flights from 15 November.\nForeign tourists who land in India on Friday will be the first to come into the country in 19 months. \nNo tourist visas have been issued since March 2020 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's  government shut the country's borders to rein in the coronavirus pandemic. In the past few months though, some visas for diplomats and foreign business officials have been reinstated.\nThe decision to allow foreign tourists, announced earlier this month, comes at a time when India's daily Covid cases have been falling. \nThe country has been recording about 20,000 daily positive infections - down from a peak of 400,000 daily cases during a devastating second wave that swept India in April and May. More than 70% of the population has received one dose of the vaccine.\nHowever, experts and government officials continue to warn against complacency, saying that popular tourist destinations could act as Covid \"super spreaders\" of a third wave of infection which, they say, is inevitable. \nThe easing of restrictions on foreign travel also coincides with the onset of India's peak travel season, sparking hopes of revival of the beleaguered tourism industry. \nWith its rich geography and history, India offers a large number of tourist attractions such as the Taj Mahal monument, temples and forts, the snowy mountain peaks of the Himalayas and the white sandy beaches in the west and south.\nAccording to government data, India attracted just 2.74 million foreign tourists last year - down from 10.93 million in 2019 - as the pandemic upended lives and businesses.  \nTourism contributes almost 7% to India's GDP and is also responsible for millions of jobs in the hospitality sector. With the economy struggling like never before, India cannot afford to lose out on the precious foreign exchange that tourism brings.\nUnder the new guidelines, all tourist visas issued before 15 October will be invalid. This means that travellers coming to India will have to get fresh visas. \n\"All due protocols and norms relating to Covid-19 as notified by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare from time to time, shall be adhered to by the foreign tourists, carriers bringing them into India and all other stakeholders at landing stations,\" the government said in an official release. \nHowever, the authorities are yet to spell out the testing, vaccination, and quarantine rules for travellers.

      "text": "A Banksy artwork which shredded itself at a previous auction has sold for a record \u00a316m.\nLove is in the Bin was what remained of the artist's live destruction of his piece Girl with Balloon, which sold for \u00a31m in 2018.\nIt went under the hammer at Sotheby's in London on Thursday, selling for \u00a316m - vastly over its \u00a34-6m guide price.\nIncluding a buyer's premium, the purchaser paid \u00a318.5m in total.\nThe sale, which saw nine bidders battle for around 10 minutes, beats the previous record of \u00a316.8m set for Banksy in March. \nAfter closing bidding, auctioneer Oliver Barker joked he was relieved that the artwork was \"still there\".\nBefore opening the bidding, Mr Barker said that the painting became an \"unexpected piece of performance art\" when it shredded in the same auction room after being sold to a \"private European investor\" three years ago.\nOpening bids at \u00a32.5m, its price tag hit \u00a310m within minutes as numerous offers were placed.\nBidding then gradually climbed to a record \u00a315m as the race progressively narrowed down between fewer bidders.\nThere were a few tentative moments after bidder Nick Buckley Wood, representing a private investor, waited to see if anyone would outdo his client's \u00a316m offer.\nA shake of the head from his rival finally indicated they were out of the running.\nMr Barker said: \"At \u00a316m ladies and gentlemen we are selling the Banksy at Sotheby's.\n\"You were here for this fantastic moment.\"\nHe then drew laughter from the audience after saying: \"I can't tell you how terrified I am to bring down this hammer.\"\nIn keeping with his irreverent guerrilla style, Love is in the Bin saw Banksy poke fun at the art world.\nSotheby's contemporary art chairman Alex Branczik said the stunt \"did not so much destroy an artwork by shredding it, but instead created one\".\n\"Today, this piece is considered heir to a venerated legacy of anti-establishment art,\" he added, labelling it as \"the ultimate Banksy artwork and a true icon of recent art history\".\nBack in 2018, moments after the hammer fell at the auction, alarms sounded and the canvas dropped through a hidden shredder built into the bottom.\nThe unnamed European woman who bought the piece said: \"At first I was shocked, but I realised I would end up with my own piece of art history.\"\nFormer BBC arts editor Will Gompertz wrote at the time that he believed Love is in the Bin would go on to be seen as \"one of the most significant artworks of the early 21st Century\".\n\"It is not a great painting that can be compared to a late Rembrandt, or a sculpture to sit alongside Michelangelo's David, but in terms of conceptual art emanating from [Marcel] Duchamp's Dadaist sensibility, it is exceptional,\" he added.\n\"It was brilliant in both conception and execution.\"\n\"What is Love is in the Bin?\" he asked. \"Is it a painting? Or, is it now a piece of conceptual art? Or should it be classified as a sculpture? Or is it rubbish?  \n\"Who decides? Who knows? Duchamp would say it is up to you to decide.\"\nThe piece had been on permanent loan to the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart museum in Germany since March 2019.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Stonewall\u2019s influence on BBC and Ofcom revealed",
      "tags": "Ofcom,LGBT,Stonewall",
      "text": "The extent of the influence of LGBTQ charity Stonewall in public bodies across the UK has been revealed in a BBC investigation.\nGovernments, Ofcom and the BBC have had their impartiality questioned after involvement in the lobby group's diversity schemes.\nA number of high profile organisations have left Stonewall's schemes in recent months amid growing controversy about the influence of the group on public policy.\nStonewall says it works for LGBTQ equality and that it is \"deeply disappointing\" that this can still be thought of as controversial.\nStonewall operates two schemes which have come under scrutiny in recent months. The \"Diversity Champions\" programme is a service Stonewall provides to employers for a fee, to advise them on diversity and inclusion. The Workplace Equality Index is a public ranking of organisations, which is scored by Stonewall, and does not require a fee to enter.\nThe Nolan Investigates podcast sought information on the schemes under Freedom of Information (FOI) laws. The information contained within the documents revealed what the lobby group was asking organisations to do to improve their ranking on the Workplace Equality Index. \nSome organisations, including the BBC, refused to release the information on the grounds that it could \"have a detrimental impact on the commercial revenue of Stonewall\".\nStonewall declined to take part in the series.\nThe documents reveal that the media regulator Ofcom submitted rulings it had made against broadcasters to Stonewall's Workplace Equality Index, which awards points to organisations based on how well they are performing on LGBTQ equality.\nOfcom had initially defended the relationship with Stonewall, saying it only related to internal staffing issues, before leaving the Diversity Champions Scheme in August. \nHowever, Ofcom continues to submit information to the Workplace Equality Index. Stonewall scores companies and public bodies based on how well they believe they are performing on LGBTQ equality.\nFor three consecutive years, the lobby group asked Ofcom to show evidence of work they had done to \"promote LGBT equality in the wider community\". Ofcom cited examples of action they had taken in response to complaints about TV programmes including Harry Hill's TV Burp and local radio stations.\nIn 2019, Ofcom told Stonewall \"we have ruled on two instances where transphobic comments made in programmes breached the code\". One such case referred to a radio presenter who said he would be uncomfortable with his six-year-old daughter changing in an environment where the changing rooms were not segregated based on sex, and described a \"transfeminine person\" as \"him, her, him, it\" - for which he had apologised on air.\nThe regulator also cited a 2016 judgement on a re-run of Harry Hill's TV Burp on the UKTV television channel Dave, in which the programme parodied a Channel 4 documentary called The Pregnant Man. Ofcom had found the programme was in breach of its broadcasting code.\nOfcom did not release the feedback it received from Stonewall.\nOfcom told the Nolan Investigates podcast that there was no conflict of interest in its relationship with Stonewall, despite \"stepping back\" from Stonewall's Diversity Champions Scheme after considering whether there was a conflict of interest. \nOfcom said: \"Broadcast standards decisions are made by the Broadcast Standards team within Ofcom, wholly independently from any third parties. Our participation in the Stonewall Equality Index has no bearing whatsoever on any of our broadcasting standards decisions.\"\nOfcom will continue to submit to Stonewall's Workplace Equality Index scheme, saying it \"is an effective way for employers to measure their progress on LGBTQ+ inclusion in the workplace\".\nThe BBC did not release the information requested by Nolan Investigates around its submission to Stonewall's schemes.\nHowever, the programme has raised questions about how close the BBC's Diversity and Inclusion department was to Stonewall. Diversity and Inclusion deals with internal staffing issues at the BBC.  \nConcerns have been raised for some time from senior BBC editorial figures about the risks of the relationship with Stonewall.\nStonewall played a central role in an internal BBC \"LGBT Culture and Progression report\" by \"identifying strengths and weaknesses\" for the BBC with regards to LGBT diversity and practices. \"Weaknesses\" included the absence of an Allies programme. Allies programmes are set up with training from Stonewall when the organisations are Diversity Champions.\nIn January 2020 the BBC told staff they would \"be working closely with Stonewall over the coming months in preparation for next year's [Stonewall] index\".\nThe podcast reveals that a senior figure in the Diversity and Inclusion department described Stonewall as \"the experts in workplace equality for LGBTQ+ people\" in internal correspondence, in response to questions about the BBC's Allies scheme. \nConcerns have been expressed about Stonewall being regarded as \"the\" experts, given the diversity of opinion among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people over Stonewall's policies.\nThe department runs an \"Allies training\" course, which was set up in conjunction with Stonewall, to provide guidance to staff. In an Allies training meeting, BBC trainers used language and material around sex and gender which is contested. The \"genderbred person\" - a graphic used by groups like Stonewall to explain sex and gender issues - was presented to staff, with no alternate views presented.\nThe Nolan Investigates podcast understands that the Diversity and Inclusion department had a role in the drafting of the latest BBC News style guide around issues of sexuality and gender. The style guide sets a standard for the language used by BBC News, often in contested areas. \nThe document defines homosexuality as \"people of either sex who are attracted to people of their own gender\". This is similar to the definition used by Stonewall, and different from the standard dictionary definition, in that it defines attraction as based on gender rather than sex. \nThese definitions are at the centre of a fierce debate over sex and gender issues. The document was ultimately signed off by BBC News.\nSam Smith, an investigative journalist who left the BBC recently after working there for 25 years, told the podcast she thinks that some people within the BBC are frightened to speak out to say what they really think about Stonewall. \nShe also believes the relationship has had an effect on the corporation's output.\n\"How can it not have a chilling effect when it is writ large across the BBC that we are a [Stonewall] champion. I can't think of anything else that the BBC has done that's in the same ball park.\"\nShe says: \"The trouble is the impartiality element of this, for people who do not agree with Stonewall's campaigning position on the gender identity issue, it is not nice for an organisation to align itself with Stonewall and Stonewall's mission\".\nShe said she had queried the BBC's use of \"political\" and \"campaigning\" language but was told \"the BBC had checked this with Stonewall and Stonewall were fine they were fine with it and therefore the BBC was fine with it\".\nThe BBC did not take part in the podcast. In a statement, they said that the BBC \"acts independently in all our aspects of our operations, from HR policy to editorial guidelines and content\".\n\"We are not a member of Stonewall, we do not take legal advice from Stonewall and we do not subscribe to Stonewall's campaigning. The charity simply provides advice that we are able to consider.\n\"As a broadcaster, we have our own values and editorial standards - these are clearly set out and published in our editorial guidelines. We are also governed by the Royal Charter and the Ofcom broadcasting code.\"\nIn a statement, Stonewall told the Nolan Investigates podcast: \"It is completely normal and appropriate for charities to engage with public sector organisations to advocate for their beneficiaries to improve public policy. It is also completely normal and appropriate for charities to support public sector organisations through service provision.\n\"We are proud of work to support public sector organisations to create an inclusive workplace for their LGBTQ+ employees. Our guidance to employers supports them to understand the needs of their LGBTQ+ employees and create an inclusive workplace culture through their policies and wider activity.\"\nThe Nolan Investigates podcast also examines changes in the language used by governments across the UK after Stonewall requested changes, and looks at the advice provided by Stonewall to public bodies. \nCorrection 18th October 2021: An earlier version of this article included a picture caption which said that Stonewall had been campaigning for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights since 1989, which we have amended to make clear that Stonewall has campaigned for trans equality since 2015.\nThe Nolan Investigates podcast is available on BBC Sounds"

      "tags": "China,Apps,Apple",
      "text": "Apple has taken down one of the world's most popular Quran apps in China, following a request from officials.\nQuran Majeed is available across the world on the App Store - and has nearly 150,000 reviews. It is used by millions of Muslims.\nThe BBC understands that the app was removed for hosting illegal religious texts.\nThe Chinese government has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. \nThe deletion of the app was first noticed by Apple Censorship - a website that monitors apps on Apple's App Store globally.  \nIn a statement from the app's maker, PDMS, the company said: \"According to Apple, our app Quran Majeed has been removed from the China App store because it includes content that requires additional documentation from Chinese authorities\".\n\"We are trying to get in touch with the Cyberspace Administration of China and relevant Chinese authorities to get this issue resolved\". \nThe company said it had close to one million users in China.\nThe Chinese Communist Party officially recognises Islam as a religion in the country. \nHowever, China has been accused of human rights violations, and even genocide, against the mostly Muslim Uyghur ethnic group in Xinjiang. \nEarlier this year the BBC reported that Uyghur imams had been targeted in China's Xinjiang crackdown.\nApple declined to comment, but directed the BBC to its Human Rights Policy, which states: \"We're required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex issues about which we may disagree with governments.\"\nHowever, it is not clear what rules the app has broken in China. Quran Majeed says it is \"trusted by over 35 million Muslims globally\".\nLast month, both Apple and Google removed a tactical voting app devised by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. \nRussian authorities had threatened to fine the two companies if they refused to drop the app, which told users who could unseat ruling party candidates.\nChina is one of Apple's biggest markets, and the company's supply chain is heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing. \nApple chief executive Tim Cook has been accused of hypocrisy from politicians in the US for speaking out about American politics, but staying quiet about China.\nMr Cook criticised Donald Trump's ban of seven Muslim-majority countries in 2017.\nHowever, he is also accused of complying with the Chinese government over censorship - and not publicly criticising it for its treatment of Muslim minorities.\nThe New York Times reported earlier this year that Apple takes down apps in China if deemed off limits by the Chinese government. Topics that apps cannot discuss include Tiananmen Square, the Chinese spiritual movement Falun Gong, the Dalai Lama, and independence for Tibet and Taiwan.\nBenjamin Ismail, project director at Apple Censorship, said: \"Currently Apple is being turned into the censorship bureau of Beijing.\n\"They need to do the right thing, and then face whatever the reaction is of the Chinese government.\"\nAnother popular religious app, Olive Tree's Bible app, was also taken down this week in China. The company told the BBC they had removed the app themselves. \n\"Olive Tree Bible Software was informed during the App Store review process that we are required to provide a permit demonstrating our authorization to distribute an app with book or magazine content in mainland China,\" said a spokesperson.\n\"Since we did not have the permit and needed to get our app update approved and out to customers, we removed our Bible app from China's App Store.\"\nOn Friday, The Mac Observer reported that Audible, the Amazon owned audiobook and podcast service, removed its app from the Apple store in mainland China last month \"due to permit requirements.\"\nOn Thursday, Microsoft said it was shutting down its social network, LinkedIn, in China, saying having to comply with the Chinese state had become increasingly challenging.\nThe decision was made after the career-networking site faced questions for blocking the profiles of some journalists."

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPeople who got a negative Covid test result from swabs taken at Newbury Showground between 3 and 12 October are being told to book another test, amid fears they were mistakenly given the all-clear. West Berkshire Council says some PCR tests resulted in false negatives. The BBC has been told the problems - now fixed - related to one specific lab, rather than the site, but the council says it's been informed \"a number of sites nationally may have been affected\". \nNew rules allowing travellers returning to England to take lateral flow tests instead of more expensive PCR tests will come into force on 24 October, in time for many families returning from half-term breaks. The government says NHS tests cannot be used for overseas travel but fully vaccinated passengers arriving in England from that date will be able to order tests from approved providers and upload photos of results for verification. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have previously aligned with policy in England.\nWith retail supplies suffering due to a lorry-driver shortage exacerbated by the pandemic and Brexit, ministers plan to ease rules limiting the number of deliveries EU hauliers can make after arriving in the UK. They say a six-month relaxation to allow unlimited pick-ups and drop-offs within a fortnight could mean thousands more deliveries each month. But the Road Haulage Association says its members will be frustrated at the plans. \nMore than 20% of women admitted to intensive care for Covid-19 since May were pregnant or had recently given birth, according to a study. A Scottish Intensive Care Audit Group report says 42 have been admitted since 18 May, compared with 25 in the first two waves of the pandemic, despite overall intensive care numbers reducing. None were reported to have died, up to 19 September 2021.\nThe UK has pledged to donate 80 million coronavirus vaccine doses to an alliance distributing them across poorer nations.

      "tags": "United States",
      "text": "US real estate heir Robert Durst, subject of HBO crime documentary series The Jinx, has been sentenced to life in prison for killing his best friend.\nDurst was found guilty of killing Susan Berman in 2000 to stop her talking to police about his wife's disappearance.\nThen aged 55, she was found shot in the head in her Beverly Hills home. Police believe he killed two others as well. \nIn a victim impact statement in court, Berman's son told Durst \"you murdered the person I was\" when he killed her. \nProsecutors called Durst, 78 - who appeared in the Los Angeles court for his sentencing - a \"narcissistic psychopath\". Durst has denied killing his friend.\nHis sentence for first-degree murder excludes any possibility of parole, meaning he will now very likely die in prison. \nThe crime carries special circumstances, the jury decided, including murder while lying in wait, and murder of a witness.\nDurst's lawyers told the judge on Thursday that he intends to appeal his conviction. Durst himself spoke to the judge only once to say \"yes\" when asked if he was waiving his right to appear at a future hearing.\u00a0\nSusan Berman was a crime writer and daughter of a Las Vegas mobster, and had acted as a spokeswoman for Durst when he became a suspect in his wife's disappearance.\nBerman's cousin, Denny Marcus, told the judge on Thursday: \"I was robbed\u2026 of an absolutely extraordinary, unforgettable brilliant person whose life was savagely taken from her.\"\nSareb Kaufman, who considers Berman his mother as she had been dating his father, said: \"I have not had one day off in 21 years from the absolute destruction, grief and pain this has caused me.\" \n\"I have lost everything many times over because of him... I have lost and sacrificed more than anyone could possibly know,\" he continued. \n\"My mother's murder and the events of the last 40 years will never leave me. Are you satisfied, Bob?\"\nDurst's wife Kathleen McCormack, a medical student, went missing in 1982 and is presumed dead. \n\"The only hope of redemption you have is to help find Kathy,\" Mr Kaufman added, calling on Durst to reveal the location of McCormack's body. \nNew York prosecutors are considering pressing new charges against him in her case, according to US media. \nProsecutors have argued that Durst actually murdered three people - the third being an elderly neighbour, Morris Black, who discovered Durst's identity in 2001 while he was hiding out in Texas and pretending to be a mute woman.\nDurst was acquitted of murdering Mr Black, successfully arguing he had killed him on the grounds of self-defence before cutting up the body.\nDurst is an estranged member of one of New York's wealthiest and most powerful real estate dynasties. His brother Douglas Durst, who testified at the trial, told the court: \"He'd like to murder me.\"\nAt the end of The Jinx series, Durst is heard muttering to himself: \"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\" \nHours before the last episode aired in March 2015, authorities arrested Durst in New Orleans for Ms Berman's murder. Jurors were played the clip during the trial. "

      "title": "Easy On Me: Is Adele's comeback single a hit or a miss?",
      "tags": "Music,Adele",
      "text": "After a slow-burning PR campaign, Adele's first new music in six years has arrived.\nEasy On Me, a spare and emotional piano ballad, was released at midnight UK time, offering fans the first glimpse of her \"divorce album\", entitled 30.\nThat will be her follow-up to massively successful albums 19, 21 and 25.\nEasy On Me sees Adele explaining her decision to walk away from her marriage in 2019, while asking her son and ex-husband for understanding.\n\"I changed who I was to put you both first,\" she sings, \"but now I give up\".\nThat moment, so naked and unvarnished, sends shivers down your spine.\nAdele's voice is full of regret, but also resolve. \nIn the accompanying music video, director Xavier Dolan chooses this moment to transition from black and white to full colour - making clear that this is the sound of a woman who has dismantled her entire world, realising that she needn't feel guilty for putting herself first.\nAdele addresses the chorus, \"go easy on me\", to herself as much as her family - and she accepts it's too soon for them to see her point of view.  \n\"I had good intentions / And the highest hopes / But I know, right now / It probably doesn't even show.\"\nThe song was apparently the first track written for Adele's forthcoming album, and dates back to the year of her separation. The immediacy of those emotions is apparent in her vocal, simultaneously strong and vulnerable. \nBut there's also a generosity to the song. Adele is reaching out to the people she's hurt, but Easy On Me is also a big woolly blanket wrapped around the loneliness and pain of anyone who's been through a core-shaking break-up.\nIt's already proved to be a hit. Just under 300,000 people tuned in to watch the video premiere on YouTube. Within 12 hours it had been streamed 12 million times.\nThe single comes just five weeks before her new album  - which was first teased in a global marketing campaign that saw the number 30 projected on to buildings and billboards in Brazil, Mexico, Dubai, Italy, Germany, Ireland, the US and the UK.\nFans correctly guessed the release date of 19 November when Taylor Swift moved her forthcoming album forward by a week, apparently to avoid a clash with Adele.\nLike her previous three albums the title is a reference to a specific age in Adele's life. \nThirty is the age at which she married her long-term partner, Simon Konecki, and then left him.\nThe star has said the album was recorded to help her eight-year-old son understand their divorce the following year.\n\"I wanted to explain to him through this record, when he's in his 20s or 30s, who I am and why I voluntarily chose to dismantle his entire life in the pursuit of my own happiness,\" she told Vogue magazine.\n\"It made him really unhappy sometimes. And that's a real wound for me that I don't know if I'll ever be able to heal,\" she added.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 2's Zoe Ball, the singer said the album \"was bloody hard work to make\". \n\"I was singing things I didn't even realise I was feeling or thinking,\" she said, adding that it was important for her to share those emotions with the world.\n\"I feel like I can't unlock a door for my own mental health and take the key with me. I've got to leave it in the door for everyone else - and I'm in a strong place now where I feel like I can put that vulnerability out. \nIn a separate interview with BBC Radio 1's Greg James, she admitted that her friends hadn't been too impressed by Easy On Me when she played them the demo.\n\"I sent a snippet of it, as I was writing it, to three of my closest friends,\" she said. \n\"One didn't like it, one was like, 'keep trying', and the other was like, 'I'm busy working'. So that was the perfect response.\"\nOnce it was finished, however, \"they loved it\".\n\"And I don't do any music in my time off. It's not a muscle that I exercise - writing or singing,\" she added. \n\"So most of the time, even just for my best friends and my manager, their first reaction, no matter what the song is, is, 'it's just nice to hear you sing'.\"\nWhile Easy On Me is very much a traditional Adele ballad, there have been hints that the rest of the album will showcase a more experimental side to Adele's music.\nAccording to Vogue, one track features her vocals \"sampled and resampled over a hypnotic beat\", that is reminiscent of electro-pop act Goldfrapp.\nShe has also worked with London-based producer Inflo - responsible for the retro R&B sounds of Michael Kiwanuka and Little Simz - as well as the Oscar-winning composer of the Black Panther score, Ludwig G\u00f6ransson.\nRadio 2 DJ Jo Whiley, who has been played a handful of the songs, said there are \"all kinds\" of sounds and genres on the album.\n\"There's one that I listened to and it just made me feel incredibly sad,\" she added. \"She really does pour her heart out and her voice, I think, has never sounded better.\n\"I was really surprised by the heights that she reaches - and the power and the resonance within her voice is amazing.\"\nThe music world meanwhile has been reacting to Adele's long-awaited return, with Canadian star Drake alerting his Instagram followers to the fact that \"one of my best friends in the world just dropped a single\". \nSolo star and former Fifth Harmony member Normani declared: \"Adele oh Adele I love uuuuuuuu.\"\nElsewhere, Clueless film star Alicia Silverstone posted a humorous video on TikTok of her preparing to drown her sorrows while listening the London singer's latest heartfelt offering.\nHowever it sounds, 30 is certain to be a shot in the arm for the UK music industry. \nOnly one British album released since the start of 2020, Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia, has sold the 300,000 copies required to be awarded a platinum disc.\nIt took her 10 months to achieve that feat. By contrast, Adele's last album, 25, went platinum in its first 24 hours.\nIt went on to become the UK's 14th best-selling album of all time, with sales in excess of 3.6 million.\nSony, her new record label, will be hoping to match those sorts of sales heights - although the CD market has declined precipitously since 2015; and Adele's streaming numbers don't yet match those of her peers.\nShe currently has 22 million monthly listeners on Spotify, compared to Ed Sheeran's 75 million and Taylor Swift's 46.5 million.\nNew music will undoubtedly boost those figures, however, even if Adele faces stiff competition from Sheeran, Swift, Abba and Coldplay, who will all release new material in the coming weeks.\nMartin Talbot, chief executive of the Official Charts Company, described the pile-up as an \"embarrassment of riches\" that is almost unprecedented for the music retail sector - but he predicted Adele would emerge on top.\n\"It would be a brave man who predicted anything other than 30 being the biggest album of this Christmas,\" he told the BBC.\n\"And, with certifications now also reflecting streams, as well as traditional physical and download sales, it is in with a strong chance of going platinum in its first week.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The Department of Health is making up to \u00a35.5m available to support GP services in Northern Ireland over winter.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said he recognised the importance of people being able to access GP services.\nThe funding will be used to improve technology and accessibility, and support patient care.\nMr Swann said that services across health and social care were facing \"a challenging winter\".\nHe has allocated \u00a33.8m to support additional patient care during this time and up to \u00a31.7m to further improve telephone and computer technology. \nHe added that GP feedback showed that patients were presenting with more complex needs, making it difficult for GPs \"to see all the people they would wish to\".\nDepartment of Health figures show that GP practices are currently carrying out almost 200,000 consultations on a weekly basis.\nThe health minister said that GP practices have been open throughout the pandemic and will continue to use both face-to-face appointments and alternative consultation options for patients.\nHe said work was taking place to improve access to primary care for patients, including exploring how telephone systems could be better used to support services.\nHe added that consideration was also being given to ways to better deal with routine requests, such as repeat prescriptions to release capacity.\n\"This work is part of a wider programme to help improve patient access to services, which includes the wider rollout of primary care multi-disciplinary teams, and work to reform the out-of-hours service.\n\"I am committed to ensuring that we have a GP workforce that is supported, motivated and sustainable and that continues to provide quality care to patients when they need it.\"\nHe said work was taking place on a review of GP trainee places, to make sure there were \"enough GPs to meet our primary care needs into the future\".\nLondonderry GP Dr Nicola Duffy said she had asked the Department of Health to be allowed to see more patients in person. She said they were currently restricted by policy.\nShe told BBC Radio Ulster 's Talkback programme that she was not allowed to see patients \"without social distancing, wearing a mask, regardless of whether I am vaccinated or not\".\n\"That is to protect the vulnerable patients that are using the health centre that I work in,\" she said. \n\"I am ready, my colleagues are ready. Could someone higher than me fix this, so we can get back to seeing our patients?\"\nDr Alan Stout, chair of the British Medical Association of Northern Ireland, said he hoped the funding would help some of the immediate pressures that GPs were facing, \"as well as beginning to address some of the more systemic and complex issues, including the number of GP trainee places available\".\n\"General practice has not closed and never closed,\" he said.\n\"Consultation rates and the number of patients contacting their surgery continue to be high and the current system is struggling to cope.\n\"All of our staff are feeling the pressure and we recognise that the difficulty in access and delays in seeing your GP cause frustration to patients.\"\nBut will the extra money help to resolve the current difficulties many patients are facing when trying to get a face-to-face GP appointment?\nDr Laurence Dorman, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners Northern Ireland (RCGPNI), said the \u00a35.5m was \"very welcome\" and would mean \"extra surgeries and extra colleagues\" to help meet patients' needs. \nHowever, he said it was \"short-term\" funding and what was really needed is longer-term financial support and more GPs to join the workforce. \n\"At the moment, there's no point putting an extra phone line into our surgery if we don't have a GP at the end of those lines to meet the needs of our patients,\" he explained.\nDr Dorman also warned that Covid-19 continues to pose safety concerns in GP waiting rooms, particularly for vulnerable patients who need to attend surgeries for treatment.\n\"We're still in the middle of a pandemic and we have to work the way we do to meet infection control standards,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. \n\"We simply not like hairdressers and shops - we have sick patients coming into our buildings.  We have patients who are taking blood tests, chemotherapy and we must be able to protect them,\" he said.\n\"We are seeing out patients face-to-face when it's appropriate and safe to do so, but we are still in a pandemic, we need our patients to work with us.\"\n\"But if our patients need seen face-to-face, absolutely then their family doctor will do that.\"\nAs well as his RCGPNI role, Dr Dorman works in a GP surgery in Kilkeel, County Down. \nAddressing complaints over the number of in person appointments being made available, he argued that GPs were working \"harder than ever\".\nDr Dorman said the GP workforce was \"tired and exhausted\", adding that \"some of the negative criticism is really demoralising\". \nHe argued that the increase in telephone consultations during the pandemic meant that family doctors were treating more patients than they had ever done before and were often able to provide a \"same-day\" service.\nHe said GP services were undergoing an \"overall transformation\" like many parts of the health service, in an attempt to tailor services to patients' needs.\n\"This new way of working is actually suiting and working very well for some patients,\" he added. \nDr Dorman said that pre-Covid, most patients frequently faced a two-week wait for a GP appointment, most of which were face-to-face.\n\"That didn't suit a lot of patients, particularly patients who worked, patients who had caring commitments, so these new ways of working which are going right across the health care system, right through to outpatients and so on, are important and necessary.\""

      "title": "Mark Hankinson: Top huntsman guilty of encouraging illegal fox hunting",
      "tags": "Fox hunting,Sherborne",
      "text": "A senior fox hunter has been found guilty of encouraging and assisting people to evade the ban on fox hunting.\nRecordings of Mark Hankinson, a director of the Master of Foxhounds Association, speaking to around 100 senior hunters in two private webinars in August 2020 were leaked online.\nThe prosecution argued he was giving advice on how to avoid the law.\nThe defence said he was advising what to do if saboteurs disrupt legal hunts.\nAt Westminster court Deputy Chief Magistrate Tan Ikram said \"I am sure that the defendant through his words was giving advice on how to illegally hunt with dogs.\"\n\"In my judgement he was clearly encouraging the mirage of trail laying to act as cover for illegal hunting,\" he added.\nMr Hankinson was fined \u00a31,000 along with a contribution of \u00a32,500 towards legal costs.\nThe Masters of Foxhounds Association said it was considering an appeal of the verdict. \n\"We will be setting up a review which will be conducted to ensure that hunts are in a position to offer reassurances to all landowners and other stakeholders that hunts are operating within the law,\" said Chairman of the Masters of Foxhounds Association Andrew Osborne.\nThe videos of Mr Hankinson, from Sherborne, Dorset came to light when they were leaked to anti-hunting groups and then posted online.\nFox hunting was made illegal in the Hunting Act 2004. Many organisations instead turned to trail hunting which involves laying a scent for hounds to chase instead of a live animal.\nThe trial at Westminster Magistrates Court took place over three days in September. Clips of the video recordings were played in court.\nThe case rested on the context of the advice Mr Hankinson gave in the webinars.\nIn the recordings he told participants \"if you've got saboteurs out with you in any shape or form we need to have clear, visible, plausible trail laying being done throughout the day.\"\n\"It's a lot easier to create a smokescreen if you've got more than one trail layer operating.\"\nMr Hankinson told the court that when he said \"smokescreen\" he was giving advice on laying dummy trails to confuse potential saboteurs and allow legitimate hunting to continue.\nDuring the trail Mr Hankinson's barrister Richard Lissack QC asked him what message he sought to send. Mr Hankinson replied that the law \"must be adhered to, there's no question of it.\"\nMr Lissack QC argued in his closing submission that Mr Hankinson had carried out his role \"strictly, properly and unapologetically.\"\nProsecuting barrister Gregory Gordon said in his closing submission that Mr Hankinson was offering advice on how to hunt illegally \"behind a smoke screen of trail hunting\". \n\"His words were clear, his advice was capable of encouraging hunts to commit illegal hunting, and his intention was to encourage illegal hunting,\" Mr Gordon said.\nOn Friday Deputy Chief Magistrate Tan Ikram concluded: \"Mr Hankinson's advice that trail laying needed to be \"plausible\" was only necessary if it was a \"sham and a fiction\"\"\n\"It wasn't just bad language as he suggested, there was a clear and common thread throughout the two separate webinars.\" \n\"A specific aggravating factor was that you were speaking to large number of people. Your words potentially had an impact throughout the whole country.\"\nFollowing the police investigation into Mr Hankinson, a number of organisations withdrew their permission to allow hunts to cross their land. That included the National Trust, Forestry England, the Lake District National Park and Natural Resources Wales.\nThe court verdict is likely to lead to a review of this position. A motion to permanently ban trail hunting on National Trust land will be debated this month.\nIf extensive areas of land prohibit trail hunting then it's \"difficult to see\" how the sport could be sustained, suggests social anthropologist Prof. Gary Marvin of Roehampton University.\n\"One of the different things about fox hunting to pheasant hunting is that it's extensive, it goes across many people's lands. If those areas become fragmented, then it's impossible,\" he explains.\n\"Or you run a trail around a very small area, and it becomes unexciting for people. They aren't going to pay money to gallop around a couple of farmer's fields,\" he adds. \nAccording to the Countryside Alliance, approximately 40,000 people are regularly involved in hunting each year, including those who follow mounted on horseback and those who follow on foot or in a car.\nBetween 2010 and 2020 there were 384 successful prosecutions under the Hunting Act reveal Ministry of Justice figures."

      "tags": "Xi Jinping,China,COP26",
      "text": "UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been warned by officials that China's President Xi Jinping is unlikely to attend the COP26 climate summit in November. \nUK government sources confirmed a report in The Times that Mr Johnson had been advised the Chinese leader was not expected to come. \nHowever Chinese officials reportedly have not entirely ruled out a change of plans.\nCOP26 takes place in Glasgow from 31 October to 12 November.\nLeaders from around the world will meet to discuss how to minimise global temperature rises caused by human activity.\nPresident Xi's attendance at COP26 has long been in doubt. It is thought he has not left China since early 2020.\nGovernment sources said Chinese officials had not been definitive about the President's travel plans and they accepted it was possible Xi could change his mind and come at the last minute to surprise the summit. \n\"They want to be seen as green leaders so I wouldn't rule it out,\" one Whitehall source said. \nDiplomats said China often announced President Xi's travel plans at the last minute. One said: \"We never give up hope. And we are continuing to make the case for his personal attendance.\"\nIn September, Chinese officials told Italian diplomats that President Xi did not plan to attend a meeting of G20 leaders in Rome on October 30 which immediately precedes the COP26 summit. They cited China's Covid regulations as the reason. \nWestern diplomats said there were genuine concerns among Chinese officials at being able to protect Mr Xi from Covid outside China. \nOn 19 September, the UK COP President Alok Sharma told the BBC's Andrew Marr show there was uncertainty about President Xi's attendance: \"The issue of whether President Xi Jinping is going to come, that's not yet been confirmed.\"\nOn Friday, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed he would attend the conference. He drew criticism for suggesting last month that he might skip the meeting.\nAustralia, a large producer of coal and gas, is ranked poorly for its climate policies and emissions reductions. One report put it last for climate action out of 193 UN member nations. \nThe country is under pressure to commit to stronger and faster change.\nPresident Xi might not be the only world leader who skips the summit.\nNo major leader - aside from Pope Francis, who said he had hoped to go, but recently underwent colon surgery - has said they definitely won't be attending the COP26 summit in November.\nBut some have expressed doubts about attending - including leaders from some of the world's biggest carbon emitters.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that he may not attend \"due to the pandemic situation\".\nRussia has set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 70-75% of 1990 levels by 2030.\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and President Narendra Modi of India are yet to confirm their attendance, after missing the last summit.\nAt the last COP meeting in 2019, the heads of the world's top five emitters - China, India, Japan, US and Russia - all failed to attend."

      "tags": "UK government,Port of Felixstowe,UK economy,Freight transport,Haulage",
      "text": "The rules on the number of deliveries overseas lorry drivers can make in the UK are set to be relaxed in a bid to tackle supply chain problems in the run-up to Christmas.\nUnder the new plans, drivers will be able to make unlimited deliveries or collections within a 14 day period. \nCurrently EU drivers can only make two pick-ups or drop-offs each week.\nIt is hoped the changes will happen by December - but UK drivers fear they might lose work to cheaper EU rivals.\nThe UK's lorry driver shortage - due to a combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors - has affected petrol stations, supermarkets and left containers piled up at Felixstowe Port unable to be moved.\nRetailers have also warned there could be shortages of items such as toys at Christmas, with shoppers urged to buy gifts early.\nLast month, the government announced it would grant up to 5,000 temporary visas for HGV drivers from abroad - but so far only a fraction have been issued. \nAnd the first foreign drivers brought in on the visa scheme may not even arrive for another month, sources have told BBC transport correspondent Carrie Davies.\nBut now ministers are going further, and plan to make temporary changes to cabotage rules, which govern how many jobs a haulier can make in a foreign country.\nIt means foreign HGV drivers that come into the country laden with goods can pick up and drop off items an unlimited number of times for two weeks before they return home.\nThe changes still need to be approved after a one-week consultation - but if passed they will come into force \"towards the end of this year for up to six months\", according to the government.\nIt would mean thousands more HGV deliveries each month, the government said, so more goods - especially food and items that come via ports - can get delivered on schedule.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: \"Having some additional capacity right now... it is a good idea. This is a quick way of doing it. It doesn't require visas, it's just a common sense measure. \n\"It is one of very many things. I don't think it is going to undercut or suppress the market.\"\nMr Shapps said problems with supply chains were a global issue. \nHe added: \"It is very tight but our supply chain is pretty robust. They have worked through coronavirus and they will work through this as well.\"\nBut the haulage industry said the measures would undercut British operators.\nRod McKenzie, from the Road Haulage Association, told BBC's Today programme: \"Well, I spoke to some of our members last night, and they were appalled. 'Ridiculous', 'pathetic', 'gobsmacked' were some of their more broadcastable comments.\n\"The government has been talking about a high-wage, high-skill economy, and not pulling the lever marked 'uncontrolled immigration', and to them this is exactly what it looks like. \n\"Allowing overseas haulage companies and drivers to come over for up to six months on a fortnightly basis to do unlimited work at low rates, undercutting UK hauliers who\u2026 are facing an acute driver shortage, rising costs, staff wages.\n\"So this is about taking work from British operators and drivers and giving it to Europeans who don't pay tax here and pay peanuts to their drivers.\n\"We don't want cabotage [the transportation of goods in one country by operators from another] to sabotage our industry.\"\nThe Unite union has raised the prospect of possible industrial action in protest at what it sees as poor pay and conditions in the industry.\n\"The treatment of drivers across the board has been nothing short of a disgrace,\" said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham.\n\"As the prime minister said recently, the answer to the driver shortage is better wages and improved conditions. This is what we demand. \n\"Now is the time for action not words. It's time for employers to pay workers a proper rate for the job. \n\"Unite will be consulting its members before deciding on next steps, including exploring the options for industrial action.\"\nMr Shapps said the long-term answer to the supply chain issues \"must be developing a high-skill, high-wage economy here in the UK\".\nBut talking about the latest measures, he said: \"The temporary changes we're consulting on to cabotage rules will also make sure foreign hauliers in the UK can use their time effectively and get more goods moving in the supply chain at a time of high demand.\"\nAccording to France's finance minister, the UK is faring worse in the supply chain crisis because it left the single market after Brexit.\n\"We are facing the same situation,\" said Bruno Le Maire at the G7 meeting in Washington. \"But the fact that we are a member of a very important single market helps us facing these bottlenecks.\"\nOn Thursday, the government said it was also giving hundreds of foreign abattoir workers temporary visas, to help fix the shortage of workers in slaughterhouses.\nThe shortage of staff in abattoirs means pigs are not being killed fast enough, and there is not enough space on farms so farmers are having to kill them themselves.\nFarmers have already destroyed 6,600 healthy pigs due to a backlog on farms, the National Pig Association said."

      "tags": "Fuel",
      "text": "A litre of petrol sold at UK forecourts has reached its highest level since September 2012, at 140.22p on average, according to RAC data.\nDrivers are paying on average 22% more to fill up their petrol tanks than this time last year, the RAC said.\nDiesel prices are also surging and are now just 4p off their April 2012 highs.\nThe bad news for drivers follows the temporary closures of many UK forecourts after they ran out of fuel.\nBut it's global oil prices, rather than supply chain disruption, that the RAC thinks is the main driver of higher prices at the pump. A barrel of crude oil has doubled in the past year.\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said the government should consider cutting the level of VAT on motor fuel \"to help hard-pressed drivers\".\nAverage petrol prices are just 2p off their record high from April 2012 of 142p per litre, says the RAC.\nHowever, AA spokesperson Luke Bosdet said it will likely be diesel, currently at 143.42p a litre, that breaks its record price first.\n\"Unless we see a slight reversal in wholesale prices, we can expect in the next couple of weeks a rise of 3-5p per litre and that would put diesel above its 2012 high,\" he said.\nMr Bosdet said the global surge in gas prices was also driving up the cost of diesel because heating oil \"comes from the same part of the barrel\" and - since it was an alternative for gas - had seen increased demand."

He was caught on Thursday as he was trying to go \"to a neighbouring country to evade justice\", the police said.\nEarlier in the day, he \"rammed his getaway vehicle into a lorry... as he desperately escaped our dragnet\", a statement on Twitter added.\nMr Rotich is now being questioned.\nOn Thursday, Athletics Kenya - the sport's governing body in the country - suspended all athletics competitions for two weeks as a mark of respect for Ms Tirop. \n\"We just lost a great talent. She was such a strong woman and committed to what she was doing,\" Julius Yego, Kenya's former athletics captain, told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme. \nDuring her career, Ms Tirop had success as both a junior - winning 5,000m bronze at world championships in 2012 and 2014 - and as a senior, winning the World Cross Country championships in 2015. \nIn August, she finished fourth in the 5,000m final at the Tokyo Olympics and in 2017 and 2019 she won the 10,000m bronze at the World Athletics Championships.\nIn September, she broke the women-only 10km road-race record by 28 seconds in Germany, setting a new time of 30 minutes and one second."

      "text": "A Belfast businessman is to seek a court order aimed at forcing the Democratic Unionist Party to end its boycott of of most cross-border ministerial meetings.\nOn Monday, the High Court ruled the DUP's boycott was \"unlawful\".\nBut on Friday two ministerial meetings were cancelled after the DUP's Edwin Poots failed to show.\nBusinessman Sean Napier said he was seeking the court order as a \"guardian of the Good Friday Agreement\".\nMr Napier, who mounted the High Court challenge earlier this week, said the agreement was not an \"a la carte\" treaty.\n\"It has been there for us, it has kept peace here and it's imperative it is properly implemented in all its parts,\" he said.\nMr Napier added: \"It is very important in what it has done for the greater good of the people here. I think it is my duty to be its guardian.\"\nDUP First Minister Paul Givan said no meetings were planned for Friday as he had not agreed the agendas.\nNorthern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon and the Republic of Ireland's environment minister logged on, but her DUP ministerial colleague Edwin Poots did not.\nHe was also a no show in a meeting with Junior Minister Declan Kearney and Irish Minister Darragh O'Brien.\nMr Napier's solicitor Paul Farrell said the DUP must explain their position the ministerial meetings.\n\"I don't understand that a meeting that takes place today with accompanying ministers is not a meeting,\" he said.\n\"I think whatever we receive next week by way of response from DUP ministers will have to explain that. I cannot understand when a meeting is not a meeting.\"\nThe DUP boycott of most North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings was announced by party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson last month.\nThe NSMC is the main body for cross-border co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nIt is attended by ministers from both sides of the border who oversee joint working in areas such as trade, food safety and agriculture.\nThe DUP is refusing to attend in protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe protocol is part of the Brexit deal agreed in 2019 and was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nBut unionists say it creates a barrier to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and undermines the latter's position in the UK. \nThe NI minister Ms Mallon said the boycott must end.\nShe had been due to discuss cross-border aquaculture with her counterparts.\n\"It is astounding following this week's High Court ruling that Jeffrey Donaldson is overseeing a deliberate and unlawful boycott of the north-south institutions,\" she said.\n\"It shows only disdain for the rule of law but utter contempt for the people we represent.\"\nOn Thursday, ministers attended a NSMC meeting on health issues.  \nThe DUP said this was in line with its position.\nWhen asked on Thursday whether the DUP would continue its boycott, Sir Jeffrey told BBC Radio Foyle \"our position remains as it has been\".\nSinn F\u00e9in junior minister Declan Kearney said that \"this inaction by Minister Edwin Poots and the executive office is a serious failure to comply with the law and the ministerial code which require ministers to participate in meetings of the NSMC\".\nHe added: \"These institutions are about joining up services across the island and delivering on important issues which impact on people's lives such as health, education and millions of pounds in funding.\u00a0\n\"It's time the DUP put ordinary people's interests first by ending this illegal boycott of vital government business and get back to work on behalf of everyone in our society.\""
