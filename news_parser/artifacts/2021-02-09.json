      "text": "Fishermen are to rename two of their biggest exports in a bid to attract British consumers after post-Brexit difficulties selling to the EU.\nMegrim sole is to be sold as Cornish sole, with spider crab being rebranded as Cornish King crab.\nIt is being driven by the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation (CFPO) after research with chefs and consumers.\nPaul Trebilcock from the CFPO said: \"There is something about the names that has negative connotations.\"\nBoth species primarily rely on exports to Europe, which he explained that \"in the current climate is not a pleasant experience\".\n\"The two species are particularly under-loved in this country but really popular with some of our export markets.\"\nEach year about 1,000 tonnes of megrim sole is brought into Newlyn, Cornwall's biggest fish market, with 98% exported. \nAbout 85% of spider crab is exported, mainly to Spain.\nTrade has been disrupted this year by the extra paperwork and border checks required after Brexit.\nMr Trebilcock said: \"Our investigation revealed that simply by calling it Cornish sole, straight away more people were willing to to try it and were more interested in finding out where it came from.\"\nJohnny Murt, a shell fisherman off Padstow, said: \"It can only be a good thing.\"\n\"It is a hard sell but if the rebranding can just get people to taste it, they will immediately realise just how good spider crab is,\" he said.\nChef Jack Stein agreed and said spider crab and megrim sole were both \"good value and delicious\". \nHe said spider crab was very sustainable with \"amazing quality meat and there is just so much of it in the summer\" but lots of it was sold in the EU. \nSimilarly megrim sole had a \"lovely taste\" similar to plaice, he said.\n\"With a bit of a rebrand and a bit of a publicity drive we might be able to eat more of it in this country,\" he added.\nFollow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "title": "Covid in Wales: Early voting proposed if Senedd election delayed",
      "tags": "Welsh government,Welsh Parliament election 2021,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Voting in the Senedd elections could take place over two days or longer if the polls are delayed from 6 May.\nThere are no plans to delay the election, but Senedd members are discussing a new law to allow a postponement of up to six months.\nThe Welsh Government has now amended it to allow for early voting, which is used in the US and elsewhere.\nBut the UK government says early voting would be unnecessary and would require additional resources.\nWelsh ministers say the UK government's view and coinciding elections for police and crime commissioners means it would be \"impossible\" to hold early voting on the original election date.\nInstead, the Welsh Government has amended the emergency legislation on an election delay, allowing it to propose extra polling days if an election is delayed and the commissioner elections are not held at the same time.\nSenedd members approved the change on Tuesday, ahead of a vote on the full legislation on Wednesday.\nWelsh ministers say the election should take place on 6 May, but argue the legislation is needed if it is not safe to hold the election at that time, because of Covid.\nBut the UK government has not suggested that its own elections set for the date would be moved, and last week confirmed the PCC polls will go ahead as planned.\nIt potentially means the Senedd election could be delayed but the PCC elections would continue to be held on the same day.\nUnder the amended law, extra days for voting would need to be held in the seven days ahead of the new election date.\nA spokesman for the Welsh Government said: \"We strongly support measures to make voting easier, particularly given the circumstances caused by the pandemic and would have favoured putting in place early voting - as happens in many countries across the world - for the Senedd election on 6 May. \n\"This proved impossible, given the fact that on current plans, the Senedd election and the PCC elections will take place on the same day and the UK government - which is responsible for the PCC elections - opposes early voting.\n\"The amendment would enable Welsh voters to benefit from the opportunity to cast their ballot on more than one day if the election were to be postponed and was not held concurrently with the PCC elections.\"\nThe UK government said it had confirmed that the PCC elections in Wales will go ahead on 6 May.\nIts delivery plan for the elections said early voting was \"unnecessary given voters can already vote early by post, and the additional resources required to staff early polling stations would make the elections harder to deliver given Covid-19 staffing pressures\".\n\"Local authorities are able to contact all clinically extremely vulnerable people in their areas to make them aware of the options to use a proxy or postal vote and they will be supported in their efforts by targeted communications from the Electoral Commission.\"\nSenedd members voted the amendment into the election bill on Tuesday afternoon - 37 for, 13 against, with 1 abstention - during a series of votes on proposed changes to the bill.\nJulie James, presenting the amendment, said early voting would \"encourage more voters to participate, but also make the election safer by spreading footfall from one day to several\".\nThe Welsh Conservatives voted against the idea - Conservative Senedd member Mark Isherwood said an election held over multiple days \"raises security concerns over the integrity of the election\", including over how ballot boxes would be secured.\nPlaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said early voting could be a way of enabling people to cast their vote during the pandemic.\nPlaid supported the amendment, but Mr ap Iorwerth said there was a \"lot of work to be done\" on on how it would be delivered.\nConservatives say they will abstain on the bill after their amendments were rejected.\nThe Tories said the election should only be postponed if Wales is in alert level 4 - the most serious level of coronavirus restrictions. \nBut the proposal was voted down, as was an attempt to stop the election being delayed beyond 9 September.\nFinal votes on the legislation will be held on Wednesday, which would also enable a delay to the dissolution of the Welsh Parliament - the date at which the institution formally breaks up.\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies, said: \"Barring any dramatic change in circumstances, I have every confidence that election officials across Wales will also be able to carry out a safe and secure Senedd election, learning from the vast number of elections that have taken place around the globe during the pandemic.\n\"The Welsh Labour Government should now focus all energy on ensuring the people of Wales are able to have their say on the future of our country on 6 May.\"\nA Plaid Cymru spokeswoman said \"urgent clarity\" was needed on what is \"legally permitted in terms of campaigning activity against each alert level\".\nShe also called for the publication of \"pre-dissolution and dissolution period guidance with the requirement for any postponement proposal to be initiated by the first minister by 7 April at the latest\".

      "tags": "Llanelli,Pets,RSPCA,Dogs,Nia Griffith,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A claim \"dognappers\" threatened to stab a dog owner out for a walk is being investigated by police.\nFormer amateur boxer James Cosens said he fought off two attackers as he would not hand over his 20-week-old collie Rosie while out for a walk last Friday.\nThe 29-year-old father and pub landlord was on Millennium Coastal Path near Llanelli in Carmarthenshire when he was threatened by two men.\nDyfed Powys Police is investigating the \"extremely rare\" incident.\nIt comes as police warn that dog theft has risen during the Covid lockdowns because prices of animals have increased - with the RSPCA saying criminals have even impersonated their officers in an attempt to steal pets.\nMr Cosens said his dog Rosie ran up to the two strangers at the Morfa Berwig Nature Reserve near Bynea - and one of them picked her up and said: \"I am taking your dog. If you try to take her back I will stab you.\"\nThe former light-heavyweight amateur fighter, who moved to the area with wife Samantha and toddler Jacob last August, said he used his boxing skills to fend off the attackers.\nMr Cosens said that despite the threats of the attackers, he did not see any weapons - and rescued Rosie after a \"struggle\".\nHe posted details of the attack on social media to warn others - and Mr Cosens has contacted his local MP Nia Griffith.\nHe is concerned as not everyone in the same situation would be able to defend themselves.\n\"I think they're probably more used to targeting the vulnerable - the elderly, children maybe,\" Mr Cosens said.\n\"But they saw a young pup and thought it's worth the risk to have a go and take her.\nPolice said the men were described as one being in his 40s, around 6ft tall, of stocky build, and wearing light blue jeans and a dark puffer jacket and the other in his 20s, around 5ft 6in tall, and wearing similar clothing.\n\"We are aware that news of this incident is causing a high level of concern among dog owners in Llanelli and the surrounding area, some of whom are now fearful of walking their pets,\" said Insp Shaun Bowen of Dyfed-Powys Police.\n\"The incident in Bynea is at present isolated in terms of an individual being targeted while walking their dog, and we have received no further reports.\n\"We urge people to continue to take their usual safety measures while not reacting out of fear, but please do report any incidents or suspicious behaviour to us.\"\nPolice have warned that organised criminals are turning to dog theft amid a rise in demand for puppies during lockdown - saying 2020 was one of the \"worst ever\".\n\"Dog theft can be a devastating crime for families and causes considerable distress to owners,\" said Ms Blackman, of the National Police Chiefs Council.\n\"Whilst it is still a very rare crime, it's sadly something we have seen increasing recently.\n\"During the coronavirus pandemic, criminals have adjusted their activities and are taking advantage of the big demand for pets over the lockdown period.\n\"The cost of a puppy has considerably increased over the past year making this a lucrative market for organised criminals to exploit.\"\nShe warned pet owners to be careful posting pictures of their new puppy on social media, and for buyers to consider where the animal had come from.\nSome criminals are also pretending to be from animal charities in a bid to steal pets from people.\n\"It's really quite shocking and very worrying to hear people are impersonating RSPCA officials as a means to gain access to their beloved pets,\" said Dr Jane Tyson of the RSPCA.\nShe reassured the public that personnel from the RSPCA will \"always wear an identity badge and a branded uniform\".\nDr Tyson advised owners not to leave their dog unattended - either outside a shop or inside a car - and ensure gardens are secure.\nAccording to the Dogs Trust, there was a 62% year-on-year increase in the number of enquiries from people looking to adopt a rescue dog in 2020. \nAt the start of January, there were more than 1,000 adverts for dogs on three of the largest classified websites - a 59% year-on-year increase.\nThe charity said it is also seeing huge increases in puppy prices, as sellers capitalise on demand.\"Demand for dogs is at an all-time high,\" said Dogs Trust's chief executive Owen Sharp.\nIn October, MPs debated two petitions, signed by almost 300,000 people, urging the government to make pet theft a specific offence - and the Dogs Trust has called for tougher sentences.\n\"Current sentencing does very little to deter thieves and does not take into consideration how devastating it can be to have your dog taken from you,\" added Mr Sharp.\n\"At the very least, a community order or custodial sentence being given, rather than a fine.\""

      "tags": "Grenfell Tower fire,Grenfell Tower Inquiry",
      "text": "The company that made Grenfell Tower's cladding would \"by default\" sell flammable materials to construction projects, including high-rise buildings, a sales manager has said.\nDeborah French told the public inquiry into the June 2017 west London blaze that Arconic could have sold a fire-retardant product.\nBut she said it saw the UK market as preferring a slightly cheaper version, albeit with a greater fire risk.\nSeventy-two people died in the fire.\nThe first phase of the Grenfell Inquiry concluded that cladding put on the tower block during refurbishment fuelled the fire.\nStatements from a series of Arconic managers shown to the inquiry on Tuesday said the \"UK was generally a 'PE market'\" - PE referring to polyethylene, which is used as the core material of the panel and is highly flammable.\nCombustible cladding is the major cause of the building safety crisis now affecting millions of flat owners. \nGiving evidence, Ms French, the company's UK sales manager, said a type of product called Reynobond PE panels were 4 to 5 euros cheaper per square metre than the fire-retardant version.  \nIn June 2014, she sent an email listing large construction projects to which she was hoping to sell cladding sheets.\nThey include a major development, Pendletons in Salford, Greater Manchester, on which Reynobond PE was used, as well as towers in Swansea and London. \nSmaller projects listed by Ms French included Grenfell Tower, which was listed as awaiting an order for cladding, with just the colour to choose.\nShe told the inquiry \"the discussions never came up about requiring anything other than a PE core\". \nWhen asked by inquiry lead barrister Richard Millett QC if Arconic would \"by default sell them PE\", she replied: \"That's right, yes.\"\nMs French said it was \"very, very, very rare\" for customers to ask about fire safety. \n\"It was not something that was discussed,\" she said. \"The majority of what I dealt with was colours, availabilities and those types of things.\"\nSales of Reynobond PE cladding were encouraged by a certificate issued by the independent British Board of Agrement. \nIt said that the flammable panels \"may be regarded\" as meeting a British fire performance standard known as Class 0. \nHowever the cladding had not passed the relevant British laboratory test, and had failed several of the European tests on which the certificate was based. \nMr Millett asked Ms French: \"If you were selling that product based on claims made about its fire performance [...] do you agree that you would be tending to mislead buyers?\"\n\"Yes, I wouldn't knowingly have done that, but inadvertently I would have been,\" she said. \nMs French insisted throughout her evidence that she was not a technical expert and passed detailed questions on to a technical manager, Claude Wehrle, based in France.  \nMr Wehrle is one of three potential witnesses to the inquiry who have refused to give evidence on legal advice that, if they did so, they could incriminate themselves under a law in France.\nThe so-called French Blocking Statute prevents its citizens taking part in some foreign legal cases.\nAll three worked for Arconic. Mr Wehrle and fellow potential witness Gwenaelle Derrendinger live in France, while the third, Peter Froehlich, is based in Germany.\nMr Millett said \"the refusal of these witnesses to come and give evidence is unreasonable\". \nThe inquiry was also told that Arconic refused to disclose documents to the inquiry and only did so following a criminal European Investigation Order requested by the Metropolitan Police.\nThe police force is investigating potential corporate manslaughter, fraud, and breaches of health and safety law. \nMs French will continue giving evidence on Wednesday.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

The next day is day one of self-isolation.\nYou can leave self-isolation after five full days if you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart.\nYou can take the first on day five. If it's negative, you can take another test 24 hours later on day six. If this is also negative - and you don't have a temperature - you can immediately end isolation. \nThe rules apply whether or not you are vaccinated.  \nThe current self-isolation regulations run out on 24 March.\nThe prime minister has told MPs he does not expect to renew the rules and said they could end sooner - if Covid data allows.\nHe said that \"as Covid becomes endemic\" (in other words, constantly present) the government will \"replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others\". \nThis would be similar to advice for other infectious diseases such as flu. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid also said he was \"optimistic\" the government would shortly be able to \"remove all restrictions around Covid\".\nIt is not clear whether the rest of the UK would follow suit. \nIn Scotland and Wales you must self-isolate for at least seven days as soon as symptoms appear.\nPeople without symptoms who have a positive LFT result should also self-isolate immediately. They don't need to take a PCR test, although clinically vulnerable people in Wales are advised to do so.\nYou can end self-isolation after two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart - the first no earlier than day six. If you don't have a temperature, you can stop self-isolating after the second negative test, on day seven.\nIf the day six test is positive, you can take two further tests on subsequent days.\nThe guidance applies whatever your vaccination status.\nAnyone leaving self-isolation is \"strongly advised\" to limit close contact with people in crowded or poorly-ventilated spaces. \nThey should work from home and minimise contact with people at higher risk from Covid.\nThe rules about self-isolation after contact with someone with Covid are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or until 10 days since your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to under-18s (18 years and four months in Scotland; 18 years and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test.\nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. \nIn Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nSelf-isolation means staying at home and not going out.\nAdults shouldn't go to work and children shouldn't go to school. \nYou should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to deliver supplies.\nNo-one from outside your household should come inside, unless to deliver essential care.\nIf you have symptoms or test positive, you should: \nPeople on a low income who are told to isolate may be entitled to some financial help:"

      "text": "People aged 70 or older in England who have not yet had their coronavirus vaccine but would like to are being asked to contact the NHS. \nA national booking system can be accessed online or people can call 119 free of change between 7am and 11pm. \nAt a Downing Street news briefing, deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam urged people to get the vaccine \"without delay\". \n\"Protect yourself against the clear and present danger,\" he said.\nHe said the vaccines worked very well against the \"immediate threat\" of the Kent variant of coronavirus circulating in the UK.\nHe assured the public that the South African variant - which has undergone some changes that might impact vaccines to some extent - is not the UK's most dominant variant and there was \"no reason to suggest it will catch up or overtake our current virus in the next few months\".\nSome 147 cases of the South Africa variant have been found in the UK.\nCoronavirus is mutating and some of the new versions of the virus appear to be changing in ways that could ultimately affect existing vaccines.\nThat may sound worrying, but experts are confident that the current ones in use still work very well and will protect against severe illness.\nScientists have been running lots of tests and those suggest that despite the vaccines being a less than perfect match for some of the new variants, such as the South Africa one, they do plenty for what matters most - saving lives.\nFindings already show the Oxford-AstraZeneca offers good protection against the Kent variant of coronavirus that is the most common variant circulating in the UK.\nAnd data on the South Africa variant with a similar type of vccine, made by pharmaceutical company Janssen, suggest protection against severe Covid-19 is maintained.\nScientists are working to update vaccines to make sure they keep up with the virus as it continues to change.\nThis is something the world is very used to for flu vaccines, which can be updated every year.\nVaccines can be tweaked in a matter of weeks or months if necessary.\nDoctors want to ensure everyone in an eligible group has had the chance to be immunised.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said \"we will not rest\" until all of those in at risk groups have been offered the vaccine. \nUntil now the NHS has asked people to wait until they are contacted for vaccination to help ensure that those who are most vulnerable are protected first. \nPeople over 70 in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are being advised that they will be contacted by the NHS with an appointment. \nMore than 12 million people have already received a first dose and many who have not yet booked an appointment are receiving follow up letters and phone calls this week to encourage them to take up the offer of a vaccine. People can choose a time slot and location for their appointment. \nSo far: \nHealth and social care workers, who are also among the top four priority groups for vaccination, should speak to their employer about arranging their jab if they have not yet had one.\nDr Nikki Kanani, a GP and medical director for primary care at NHS England, said: \"If you are aged 70 and over, and haven't yet received your vaccine, please come forward and make an appointment as soon as you can. \n\"The vaccine is safe, simple, and will offer you and those around you crucial protection against this virus.\"\nIt comes as: "

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),China,Wuhan,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "International experts investigating the origins of Covid-19 have all but dismissed a theory that the virus came from a laboratory in China.\nPeter Ben Embarek, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) mission, said it was \"extremely unlikely\" that the virus spread from a lab leak in the city of Wuhan.\nHe said more work was needed to identify the source of the virus.\nThe investigation could now focus on South East Asia, one expert said. \nThe WHO team are currently at the end of their investigation mission. \nWuhan, in China's central Hubei province, is the first place in the world that the virus was detected in 2019. Since then, more than 106 million cases and 2.3 million deaths have been reported worldwide.\nDr Embarek told a press conference the investigation had uncovered new information but had not dramatically changed the picture of the outbreak.\nExperts believe the virus is likely to have originated in animals before spreading to humans, but they are not sure how.\nDr Embarek said work to identify the origins of Covid-19 pointed to a \"natural reservoir\" in bats, but it was unlikely that this happened in Wuhan.\nHe said identifying the animal pathway remained a \"work in progress\", but that it was \"most likely\" to have crossed over to humans from an intermediary species.\nThe experts also said there was \"no indication\" that the virus was circulating in Wuhan before the first official cases were recorded there in December 2019.\nLiang Wannian, an expert with China's Health Commission, said Covid-19 could have been in other regions before it was detected in Wuhan.\nThe team called for further investigation into the possibility of \"cold chain\" transmission, referring to the transport and trade of frozen food. \nDr Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, said the focus on where the origins that led to Covid-19 might be, could be shifted to South East Asia. \n\"We've done a lot of work in China and if you map that back it starts to point towards the border and we know that there is very little surveillance on the other side in the whole region of South East Asia,\" he told the BBC's John Sudworth in Wuhan. \n\"China is a very big place and South East Asia is a very big place. The supply chains to the Huanan seafood market were extensive, they were coming in from other countries, they were coming in from various parts of China, so to really trace that back it's going to take some work.\"\nHe added that the focus should now be on those supply chains. \nThe WHO mission began in January, following months of negotiations with Beijing. The experts' visit was closely-monitored by the Chinese authorities.\nIt was unlikely that the expert group, in its politically-charged mission, would be able to pinpoint the source of the pandemic in China a year after it began. But, after visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they have closed the lid on a controversial theory that coronavirus came from a lab leak or was made by scientists. \nTheir search for clues also included a visit to the now-famous wet market in Huanan - selling fish, meat and live wild animals - that was linked to some of the first human cases. \nThe team say the virus may have jumped from animals to humans, but they don't have the proof yet. \nPossible carriers include bats and pangolins, but tests so far have yet to find convincing evidence for this. Another line of investigation is whether the virus could have spread through imported frozen food. The hunt for the origin will continue. \nSpeculation about the Wuhan Institute of Virology - one of China's top virus research labs - began last year and was propagated by former US President Donald Trump.\nIn April, US state department cables came to light suggesting that embassy officials were worried about biosecurity there.\nThe office of the US national intelligence director said at the time that while the virus was not man-made or genetically modified, officials were investigating whether the outbreak began through contact with animals or through a laboratory accident.\nBut Dr Embarek said a visit to the laboratory during the mission showed it was \"very unlikely\" that anything could have leaked out.\nHe said the laboratory theory was \"not in the hypotheses that we will suggest for future studies\"."

      "tags": "Space exploration",
      "text": "The United Arab Emirates is celebrating its first mission at Mars.\nIt has put a probe called Hope in orbit around the planet, making it only the fifth spacefaring entity to do so after the US, the Soviet Union, Europe and India.\nThe spacecraft, which left Earth seven months ago, had to make a braking manoeuvre to be sure of being captured by Mars' gravity.\nUAE scientists can now look forward to studying the planet's atmosphere.\nTheir satellite carries three instruments that will observe, among other targets, how neutral atoms of hydrogen and oxygen - remnants from Mars' once abundant water - leak into space. \nIn the process, Hope will return spectacular, high-resolution, full-disk images of the planet.\nTuesday marked the most critical phase in the mission.\nHope had been approaching Mars at over 120,000km/h (relative to the Sun) and needed to execute a precise 27-minute burn on its braking engines to scrub some of that speed or risk skipping off into ever deeper space.\nThe manoeuvre, performed by six thrusters on the probe, commenced at about 19:30 GST (15:30 GMT), with confirmation received at Earth some 11 minutes later - the delay being the time it took for radio signals to traverse the 190-million-km separation between Mars and Earth.\nThe official announcement on the burn's completion when it came was calm, and the applause relatively restrained. Perhaps it was the relief speaking after a nerve-shredding wait for the positive telemetry. \n\"Mars orbit insertion was the most critical and dangerous part of our journey to Mars, exposing the Hope probe to stresses and pressures it has never before faced,\" said Omran Sharaf, the Hope mission's project director at the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre\n\"With this enormous milestone achieved, we are now preparing to transition to our science orbit and commence science data gathering.\"\nThe past few days have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm for Hope and its mission, with public monuments, buildings and heritage sites across the federation all lit up in red.\nDubai's Burj Khalifa, the tallest human-made structure on Earth, had been flashing a countdown to Tuesday's big moment.\nHope is regarded as a triumph for a small gulf nation that dared to think seven years ago that it could inspire the next generation by launching the first Arab interplanetary space mission. \n\"We wanted to arrive at Mars; (I'm) really grateful, and it's like a weight of seven years has been lifted from my shoulders,\" said Her Excellency Sarah Al Amiri, UAE minister of state for advanced technology and chair of the UAE Space Agency.\n\"On arriving at Mars. I'm now truly looking forward to the scientific discoveries. And I truly hope this mission will impact an entire generation to strive to do things that are even bigger,\" she told BBC News.\nHope is now running in an initial ellipse around Mars that comes as close as 1,000km from the planet and goes out to almost 50,000km. Over the course of the next few weeks, this will be trimmed to a 55-hour, 22,000km-by-43,000km orbit that is inclined to the equator by about 25 degrees.\n\"It depends on what that initial orbit looks like but we would need around three manoeuvres to get into our science orbit,\" said propulsion engineer Ayesha Sharafi.\nThis path is very different to those of previous satellites which have tended to operate with greater proximity to Mars to facilitate high-resolution imagery of the surface and communications with landed robots.\nBut it's from this high perch that Hope plans to carry out some novel research. It's going to trace how energy moves through the atmosphere from the very bottom to the very top. \nA key influencer in this respect is dust which can on occasions blow up into storms that envelop the entire planet.\n\"Dust plays a hugely important role in the Martian atmosphere. There are a few places on Earth where the atmosphere can be that dusty, but they're localised and maybe for short times,\" explained Prof David Brain, a University of Colorado at Boulder planetary expert who is working with the UAE team.\n\"Dust absorbs a lot of energy; it can become very warm and radiate energy. And so when you're talking about energy transport, dust is a much larger part of the big picture at Mars.\"\nHope is leading a wave of missions to Mars this February.\nOn Wednesday, it will be the turn of China with its Tianwen-1 orbiter. Like Hope, it must complete a braking manoeuvre to be captured by the planet's gravity.\nTianwen-1 is carrying a rover that will be despatched to the surface, most likely in May.\nNext week, on Thursday 18 February, the Americans will arrive at Mars with another of their big rovers. The Perseverance robot is being aimed at a crater that once held a giant lake. It will look for signs of fossilised life. "

      "text": "Bitcoin has hit record highs for a second day after Elon Musk's car company Tesla said it had bought about $1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn) of the cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin rose above $48,000 (\u00a334,820) before falling back, but it remains about 25% higher than a week ago.\nSome investors took Tesla's move as a signal that Bitcoin would become a mainstream financial asset.\nHowever, there was some criticism about a green car firm investing in such an energy intensive currency.\nBitcoin currently uses more energy than Argentina every year, according to analysis from the University of Cambridge.\nProduction of the cryptocurrency, known as \"Bitcoin mining\", needs energy-hungry computer hardware and ever-greater amounts of processing power.\nMike Butcher, an editor at news website Techcrunch, tweeted: \"Tesla: Sells carbon credits to buy Bitcoin, which requires as much energy (not always Green energy) as a small country to mine.\"\nBitcoin is a form of digital money. This means it doesn't have a physical form. Instead, units of digital currency are traded over a computer network.\nIt operates over a global network with thousands upon thousands of nodes - a machine within a network like a computer or some other device - which together process and store transactions.\nExplaining its investment on Monday, Tesla said that it wanted to maximise returns on cash lying dormant in the company's accounts. It also expects to accept payment for its electric cars in Bitcoin in future. \nThe moves sparked market interest which carried on into Tuesday.\nShares of companies that provide trading platforms for Bitcoin and the technology to mine the cryptocurrency have surged in China, South Korea and Australia, and big computer chip-making firms such as SK Hynix also rose.\nThe cryptocurrency has already risen in value by 62% this year, on top of a 300% rally in 2020, as investors search for alternative assets at a time when interest rates in many countries are at record lows.\nBitcoin has had some interest from big investment firms, including Blackrock, which recently changed a handful of investment mandates to allow some of its funds to invest in the currency.\nHowever, central banks remain sceptical about the cryptocurrency. In October, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey cautioned over Bitcoin's use as a payment method, saying it lacked \"intrinsic value\" unlike cash or gold. \nSome institutional investors are also wary of the price volatility of Bitcoin.\nRobert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth, said: \"The average institutional investor is shaking their head.\n\"For these folks who are believers in cryptocurrency, [Tesla's investment] gives them another layer of support that crypto is the future.\"\nBut Bitcoin scepticism does not mean that central banks and regulators are against digital currencies per se.\nIn China in particular regulators are starting to embrace issuing their own digital currencies for everyday use."

      "tags": "NHS,Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The use of ten million surgical gowns, bought by the UK government, has been suspended for frontline NHS staff because of how the items were packaged.\nSterile gowns were bought for \u00a370m from a US firm last year, but safety concerns were raised when they arrived in one layer of protective packaging.\nThe contract had not requested double packaging, as used in sterile settings.\nThe government says all PPE is quality assured, but Labour has called for an inquiry into the awarding of contracts.\nThe BBC has been investigating the purchase of PPE - or personal protective equipment - for NHS staff since the beginning of the pandemic. It has already been revealed how millions of face masks bought by the UK government cannot be used in the NHS as intended.\nMany of the contracts dated back to last Spring, when the government was scrambling to deal with PPE shortages in hospitals and care homes at the beginning of the pandemic.\nHowever, officials at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) continued to sign large PPE contracts after the first wave of infections was over, in a bid to avoid a repeat of shortages.\nOne of those contracts was a \u00a370m deal, signed in June, for the supply of 10.2 million sterile surgical gowns from a US firm called Saiger LLC.\nThe BBC understands Saiger delivered the gowns on time but their use was suspended because of concerns about the way they were packaged.\nA court document obtained by the BBC shows NHS infection control experts were concerned the gowns were only single wrapped, when in their view they should have been double wrapped if they were to be used in sterile care settings.\nThe document shows there was no requirement - either in the government's published specifications or in its contract with Saiger - for the gowns to be double wrapped.\nThe gowns came from the same firm that paid millions of pounds of UK taxpayer cash to a Spanish businessman to source PPE for the NHS.\nLast November, the BBC revealed Gabriel Gonzalez Andersson was paid $28m (\u00a321m) in UK government cash by Saiger to find PPE as part of two deals.\nFor his work on the \u00a370m contract for the surgical gowns - which was separate to those earlier deals - he was in line to be paid a further $16m (\u00a312m).\nHowever, documents filed in a US court allege that he then stopped doing any work for Saiger, leaving the firm \"scrambling\" to fulfil its contracts by other means. It's not clear whether Mr Andersson received any of the money for this deal.\nThe parties have since agreed for the legal action to be dismissed.\nIn response, Saiger said: \"The government could not have been clearer that we delivered the goods in accordance with the contracts and to the technical specifications requested, that we delivered them on time, and that we delivered them at good value.\"\nThe government's decision to award the \u00a370m contact for the gowns is currently being challenged in a separate case in the English courts by the campaigning organisation, the Good Law Project.\nJolyon Maugham, the project's director, said the government needed to know what it was buying. \"It should be buying from those who are experienced in the complicated business of supplying medical-quality PPE.\n\"And it also needs to be keeping a careful check on the prices it is paying so that intermediaries aren't able to make tens and tens of millions at public expense.\"\nYou can listen to File of 4's Unmasked: Stories from the PPE frontline on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday 9 February or on BBC Sounds.\nThe government is also facing questions over contracts it signed for millions of face masks, which now can't be used as intended in the NHS.\nIn April, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) signed a contract with Pestfix - a small Sussex-based family firm - for \u00a3168m to supply three types of mask. They included FFP3 particle filtering masks.\nThe BBC has found 17 million FFP3 masks supplied to the Department of Health by Pestfix will not be used as intended because they failed testing.\nThe masks came with ear loops, which the government says now should not be used because of safety concerns. It stopped the use of masks with ear loops in May last year, following discussions with the safety watchdog.\nHowever, the government had already bought millions of masks with ear loops. Pestfix told the BBC these masks never entered the NHS supply chain.\nThe BBC has also seen an internal document prepared by the safety watchdog showing another type of FFP3 mask - this time with headstraps on - put forward by Pestfix also failed tests.\nThe document says \"headstraps on several samples snapped\" and \"nosebands fell off on nearly all samples from the first batch\".\nPestfix said these were alternative, prototype masks that were provided as a potential replacement. The firm said DHSC did not proceed with the product.\n\"We are proud of our role in sourcing PPE from Chinese manufacturers to help meet massive shortages in the NHS during the pandemic, with 94% of the 282 million items of PPE we supplied meeting contracts standards,\" the company said.\n\"Pestfix is working with the government and the Chinese manufacturers responsible for the small percentage of items that did not enter the NHS supply chain to ensure the best possible result for taxpayers.\" \nHowever, Labour's shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves has called for an inquiry into the awarding of PPE contracts.\n\"This area of procurement is one of the ways in which this government has really let people down, particularly our frontline workers during the course of the pandemic,\" she said.\n\"There should be an inquiry, a rapid review right now into the lessons that we can learn because if we learn lessons we can save lives, and this virus isn't going away.\"\nIn a statement, DHSC said PPE is only distributed in the NHS if it meets the relevant standards: \"We have been working tirelessly to deliver PPE to protect our health and social care staff on the frontline, with over 7.6 billion PPE items delivered so far.\"\nFollow Phil on Twitter."

It is going to require a different spirit, probably, from the EU, but I am sure we are going to see that and some of this subside as we go forward.\""

They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to the place where they plan to self-isolate. \nThe new testing policy comes amid concern about new variants entering the country that are more resistant to existing vaccines.\nEarly trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine suggest it offers \"minimal protection\" against mild disease from the South Africa variant. There have been 147 cases of the variant have found in the UK.\nProf Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the results were \"expected\" because the virus is \"introducing mutations... to allow it to still transmit in populations where there's some immunity.\"\n\"As long as we have enough immunity to prevent severe disease, hospitalisations and death, then we're going to be fine in the future in the pandemic,\" he said.\nOn Monday, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said the South African variant did not appear to have a \"transmissibility advantage\" over the one first identified in Kent, which has spread across the UK.\nIt was therefore unlikely to \"overrun\" the Kent variant, he told Monday's coronavirus briefing. \nFrom 15 February, UK residents and Irish nationals arriving from certain countries will have to quarantine in hotels.\nPassengers will have to stay in their rooms for 10 nights, with security guards accompanying if they go outside.\nThe rules will apply to UK nationals and residents arriving from 33 \"red list\" Covid-19 hotspots - mostly in South America and Africa - where it's feared Covid variants may have already spread. Passengers will be expected to pay for the cost of the accommodation.\nNon-UK travellers who have been in these countries in the 10 days before travelling are banned from entry.\nAll travellers - including British nationals - must self-isolate for 10 days when they get to the UK.\nThe \"test to release scheme\" - where travellers from non-red list countries can leave home isolation after a negative test on day five - will remain under the new testing rules.\nPassengers will be expected to use the gold-standard and more expensive PCR tests.\nDerek Jones, chief executive of luxury travel company Kuoni, welcomed the testing plan. \n\"As we have said all along, a robust testing regime is the way to open up travel again but it has to replace or at least shorten quarantine,\" he said.\nIt comes as Prof Van-Tam warned it was too soon to say to what extent people could begin to start planning summer holidays.\nSpeaking at Monday's coronavirus briefing, he said: \"The more elaborate your plans are for summer holidays, in terms of crossing borders, in terms of household mixing, given where we are now, I think we just have to say the more you are stepping into making guesses about the unknown at this point,\" he said.\n\"I can't give people a proper answer at this point because we don't yet have the data. It is just too early to say.\"\nLockdown rules mean people must only travel abroad for essential reasons. These are the same as the \"reasonable excuses\" for domestic travel, including:\nPeople leaving England will soon have to make a declaration on why they need to travel, which will be checked by carriers prior to departure.\nHave you recently travelled into the UK? What was your experience at the UK border?\nIn other developments:\nSpeaking about the new testing plans, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said it was \"important the government continues to take the necessary steps to protect people and save lives\". \nHe added: \"Enhancing our testing regime to cover all arrivals while they isolate will provide a further level of protection and enable us to better track any new cases which might be brought into the country, and give us even more opportunities to detect new variants.\""

      "text": "Heavy snowfall and temperatures as low as -16.7C led to warnings of \"tough\" driving conditions in parts of Scotland. \nThe Met Office forecast of up to 20cm (8in) of snow in parts of central Scotland. An amber weather warning expired at 21:00.\nTransport Scotland said Covid rules meant people should not be travelling unless it was for essential purposes.\nThe temperature dropped to -16.7C in Altnaharra in Sutherland overnight.\nIt was the lowest temperature recorded in the UK since December 2010.\nThe previous low of 2021 so far was -13C at Braemar.\nThere has been widespread disruption across Scotland, including:\nScotRail said heavy snowfall had caused \"significant disruption\" on its Edinburgh to Glasgow routes. \nThe rail company tweeted that it had a \"bumpy start\" to the day as road conditions delayed staff travelling to work.\nNetwork Rail said it was working to fix a number of points failures, particularly in the Central Belt, and urged people to check before they travelled. \nThe amber weather warning initially covered Clackmannanshire, Falkirk, Fife, Perth and Kinross, Stirling, West Lothian, East Dunbartonshire, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire.\nIt was later extended to include Dundee and southern Angus, Edinburgh, the Lothians and northern Borders.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said all Covid vaccinations were going ahead as planned despite the travel difficulties.\nHowever, the Caird Hall vaccination centre in Dundee had to close early on Tuesday evening due to the poor weather conditions.\nNHS Tayside said the vaccination team would contact the remaining people to rearrange their appointments and apologised for any inconvenience caused.\nThere is also a yellow warning of snow in place for much of the rest of Scotland until late on Wednesday night. The warning extends from Shetland and down the east coast of Scotland.\nTransport Scotland said road temperatures, including wind chill, dropped to -18C overnight at Bannockburn.\nSpokesman Stein Connolly said: \"There were temperatures of -7C and -8C throughout the country last night so we had challenges everywhere.\n\"We've got all the operating companies working in a multi-agency response team - working very closely with the Met Office - and we will be working all day today until we get clear of this.\"\nBear Scotland said snow showers across the network were \"making driving conditions tough\". \nMidlothian Council said it had redeployed 80 staff from other departments to help clear paths and pavements. \nSome parts of Scotland had already seen heavy snowfalls.\nDepths of 26cm (10in) were recorded at Aboyne in Aberdeenshire, 18cm (7in) at Aviemore and 15cm (6in) at Loch Glascarnoch, near Garve, in the Highlands on Monday morning.\nBraemar Mountain Rescue Team has been helping engineers from energy company SSEN restore supplies in Upper Deeside in Aberdeenshire following power and communication failures caused by heavy snow.\nThe wintry conditions are associated with cold air from Russia and Eastern Europe.\nThe weather has been nicknamed the Beast from the East Two, following the 2018 Beast from the East which brought widespread snow to Scotland."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson says he is \"very confident\" in the Covid vaccines being used in the UK, amid concerns about the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab's effectiveness against the South Africa variant.\nThe vaccines are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against serious illness, the PM said. \nA small study found the Oxford jab gave \"minimal protection\" against mild disease from the South Africa variant.\nBut scientists are confident it will protect against serious disease.\nSome 147 cases of the South Africa variant have been found in the UK.\nHowever, the Oxford vaccine has shown to provide good protection against the so-called Kent variant, which remains the dominant strain in the UK.\nThe prime minister said: \"We're very confident in all the vaccines that we're using.\n\"It's important for people to bear in mind that all of them, we think, are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against serious illness and death, which is the most important thing.\"\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, told a Downing Street briefing that initial data from Pfizer-BioNTech, Novavax and Janssen - all of whose vaccines the UK has ordered - suggested they had a \"substantial effect at reducing serious illness\".\nHe said the latest study of the Oxford vaccine in South Africa did not change his view that the Oxford vaccine would be \"rather likely\" to have an effect on severe disease.\nProf Van-Tam said headlines about the study have been \"a bit scary\" but his advice to anyone \"on the edge\" about whether they should wait to get vaccinated would be: \"Do not delay, have the vaccine that will protect you against the current threat.\"\n\"Early data\" suggested the South Africa variant did not have any advantage over the Kent variant, so it was unlikely to become dominant in the UK in the short term, he said.\n\"There is no reason to think the South Africa variant will catch up or overtake our current virus in the next few months.\"\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are currently being rolled out in the UK, where nearly 12.3 million people have been given a first dose according to the latest figures - almost one in four adults.\nAnother 14,104 confirmed cases were reported on Monday and a further 333 deaths were recorded within 28 days of a positive test, bringing the total to 112,798. But the numbers in hospital remain higher than the previous peak in April last year, at 29,326.\nMr Johnson said the vaccines \"remain a massive benefit to our country\" and he has \"no doubt that vaccines generally are going to offer a way out\".\n\"Yes we're doing everything we can to contain new variants but we're also increasingly confident that science, medicine, is gaining the upper hand over coronavirus and all its variants,\" he added.\nDr Katherine O'Brien, director of immunisation at the World Health Organization, said it was \"really plausible\" that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might still have a a \"meaningful impact\" on the South African variant, especially in preventing serious illness and death.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS would issue booster jabs against variants if necessary, and had placed a new order for 50 million doses with vaccine company CureVac.\nThe deal is intended to rapidly develop vaccines, including using the mRNA technology already deployed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, in the UK \"so we will be prepared for whatever the future might bring\", Mr Hancock said.\nApproving revised vaccines for booster shots would take \"a matter of weeks rather than a matter of months\", Prof Van-Tam added.\nMr Hancock also said the government had ordered 20 million more rapid tests so it could expand workplace testing to all businesses with more than 50 employees in sectors that are currently open.\nViruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising.\nThe mutations seen in South Africa change the part of the virus that the vaccines target.\nIt means all the vaccines that have been produced so far are likely to be affected in some way.\nTrials for Novavax and Janssen vaccines that were carried out in South Africa showed less effectiveness against this variant. Both are currently before the UK regulator.\nTherefore the news about the Oxford-AstraZeneca does not come out of the blue.\nThe fact it now only has \"minimal\" effect according to reports is concerning - the other vaccines showed effectiveness in the region of 60% against the South African variant.\nBut we should be careful about rushing to judgement. The study was small so there is only limited confidence in the findings.\nWhat is more, there is still hope the vaccine will prevent serious illness and hospitalisation.\nWhat this once again illustrates is the pandemic is not going to end with one Big Bang. Vaccines are likely to have to change to keep pace with the virus.\nProgress will be incremental. But vaccines are still the way out of this - and as things stand they remain very effective against the virus that is dominant in the UK.\nIn South Africa, where the variant - known as 501.V2 or B.1.351 - accounts for 90% of new coronavirus cases in the country, the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been put on hold awaiting further advice.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the South Africa variant is the \"single biggest risk\" in the pandemic at the moment, but added that the government was taking too long to introduce controls at the border, \"leaving a back door open at a vital stage in the battle against the virus\".\nMr Johnson said border controls could play a greater role against new variants once infection rates are further reduced in the UK.\nDr Mike Tildesley, an infectious disease expert who advises the government, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that \"it's very possible\" the South Africa variant could already be quite widespread in the UK.\nThe \"surge testing\" taking place in certain areas in England \"really needs to be effective\" to halt its spread, he said, but \"sadly we may be in a similar situation to the Kent variant\", which eventually spread across the whole country.\nAdditional surge testing is taking place in a number of areas in England where the South Africa variant has been found, including parts of Surrey, Bristol, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Walsall, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. \nOn Monday evening the Department of Health announced that surge testing would also be deployed in parts of the M14, M15 and M16 postcode areas in Manchester.\nSouth Africa's suspension of the rollout of the vaccine is only \"temporary\" at this stage and the \"context is a little bit different\" to the UK where the Kent variant is the dominant strain, he added.\nThe new study of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, involved about 2,000 people who were on average 31 years old.\nA spokesman for the pharmaceutical company said it had not yet been able to properly establish whether the jab would prevent severe disease and hospitalisation caused by the South Africa variant because those involved in the study had predominantly been young, healthy adults.\nBut the company expressed confidence the vaccine would offer protection against serious cases, because it created neutralising antibodies similar to those of other coronavirus vaccines."

      "text": "A suspected crime boss has confirmed he is still involved in \"planning multiple world title fights\" in boxing.\nDaniel Kinahan insisted that allegations of criminality are part of \"a campaign\" against him.\nHis continued involvement at the top of the sport was revealed last week by BBC One's Panorama, leading to calls for tighter regulation. \nMr Kinahan has no criminal convictions, but was named in Irish courts as the head of a prominent drug cartel.\nThe suspected gangster helped set up boxing management business MTK Global - but it was announced last year he was stepping away from the sport.\nHowever, the company told Panorama that he still advises some of its boxers, and Mr Kinahan himself has now issued his own statement, telling Talksport that he was innocent, and that he continued to work at the very top of the sport.\n\"I have dedicated myself to my work in boxing for over 15 years. I am proud to say today that I have helped organise over a dozen major world title fights,\" Mr Kinahan said. \n\"I continue to be involved in planning multiple record-breaking and exciting world title fights.\"\nMr Kinahan said he believed that his success in the world of boxing \"has led to an increase in the campaign against me\".\n\"I am not a part of a criminal gang or any conspiracy. I have no convictions,\" he said.\nMr Kinahan's role in world boxing caused an outcry in June last year when it emerged he had been working as a personal adviser to world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury ahead of a much-anticipated \u00a3200m mega-fight later this year with fellow British champion Anthony Joshua. \nPanorama asked Fury whether Mr Kinahan was still his personal adviser, but he did not respond.\nThe BBC team that produced the programme has received an unspecified threat from unnamed criminal elements since it was broadcast, but Mr Kinahan has denied being involved.\n\"Last week it was inferred that I had threatened a reporter. I have full respect for journalism. I have worked with journalists and I value their role,\" he said in his statement. \n\"I have never threatened a reporter or journalist or asked anyone to do that for me. I never have and I never would.\"\nLast week Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told the BBC that the film had raised \"very worrying allegations\". \nThe British Boxing Board of Control has said it is powerless to stop Kinahan advising boxers as it does not regulate such roles and he is not licensed with them. \nEddie Hearn - who promotes Joshua - said he anticipated \"no impact\" on the fight with Fury, and insisted that no sponsors or broadcasters had expressed concern to him since the programme was aired. Last year, the Irish government called on broadcasters to boycott the planned world title fights.\nLawyers for MTK Global told Panorama that while Mr Kinahan \"provides some personal advice to a number of boxers managed by MTK Global\", he had never owned, controlled or been an employee of the company. \nMr Kinahan's lawyers also told the programme he has no criminal convictions and the allegations about him running a violent cartel are false and have no evidential basis.\n\"He is proud of his record in boxing to date. He has operated on the basis of honesty and with a commitment to putting fighters' needs first,\" they said.\n\"Mr Kinahan is a successful and independent adviser in the boxing industry in his own right. It is a matter of public record that he has exited the business of MTK.\""

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Dido Harding,Apps,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The NHS Covid-19 app has told 1.7 million people in England and Wales to self-isolate to date.\nHealth ministers have also revealed they believe it has prevented about 600,000 cases of the disease.\nIn a further disclosure, internal data indicates that about 16.5 million people are currently actively using its contact-tracing tool.\nThat figure is 24% below the app's latest download tally, which is the government's preferred measure.\nThe discrepancy is likely to be down to people uninstalling the app, turning off its contact-tracing capabilities, or simply failing to have activated it in the first place.\nEach handset actively taking part sends a digital \"heartbeat\" once a day to the Amazon computer server involved, allowing the current usage figure to be calculated.\nAnd while the number of total downloads has slowly grown from 20.2 million to 21.7 million over the past two months, the number of phones pinging the server has been more or less flat.\nThis represents the first detailed data released about the app's use since it was made widely available to people in England and Wales in September. \nScotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar have their own separate apps.\nBaroness Dido Harding, executive chair of the NHS Test and Trace programme, had been under pressure to release the figures for months, and the BBC unsuccessfully attempted to obtain some of the figures via a Freedom of Information request in November.\nThe intention in releasing the data now is to reassure the public that the app can save lives, and in doing so encourage more people to both install it and follow its advice ahead of lockdowns being eased.\n\"People who are not following the app's instructions are risking themselves and their colleagues and their families,\" Baroness Harding told the BBC.\n\"The more you follow the instructions of the app, the fewer outbreaks you'll have in your workplace and the safer it will be.\"\nA spokeswoman added that these instructions include circumstances in which it is recommended to pause the contact-tracing function.\nThe app uses Bluetooth logs to retrospectively warn users if they were at high risk of contagion from someone infected with the virus, who was recently in their vicinity.\nAlerts can be served within 15 minutes of an infected person approving use of their positive test result. But the system's decentralised nature means neither the person who triggered the warning, nor the authorities, can identify who receives the notifications.\nSome anonymised data is, however, collected. \nFor the first time, it has been revealed that:\nScientists from The Alan Turing Institute and Oxford University worked to provide further analysis of the app's impact\nThey estimate that 594,000 cases have been averted because of the technology.\nAnd they forecast that for every additional 1% of the population that uses the app, the number of Covid cases should fall by 2.3%.\nThe academics have benefited from the fact that the app was retooled in October to take account of the tier system introduced at the time in England, which operated on a local authority basis.\nThis allowed anonymised usage data to be compared between two neighbouring council areas where the spread of the pandemic was similar, but uptake of the app differed.\nThe researchers took account of other factors - including poverty levels - to calculate the degree to which suppression of the virus's spread could be linked to the app.\nHowever, they acknowledge that they cannot be certain that usage of the app caused all of the effects being attributed to it. And while they are publishing their work, it has yet to be peer-reviewed.\nEven so, the firm involved in developing the app said confidence was growing that it is indeed making a difference. \n\"The data suggests that we have made a dent in the overall infection rate,\" Wolfgang Emmerich, chief executive of Zuhlke UK, told the BBC.\n\"What we really have to do now, particularly as we're preparing to come out of lockdown, is to drive that adoption rate back up and to get people to switch [the app] back on again.\"\nMr Emmerich also revealed that his team had put plans to extend the app to older iPhone models on the back burner, in order to prioritise other new features, but declined to say what they are.\nSoon after the NHS Covid-19 app was launched last September, we learned one important piece of data - that over 20 million people had downloaded it. \nThat was a pretty good result compared with take-up of similar apps elsewhere, but what we didn't know until now was something far more important - did it work? \nNow these figures do appear to show that plenty of people have been pinged by the app and sent into isolation. \nMore impressively, research appears to show that in areas where take-up of the app was high, the infection spread more slowly than in places where it was lower. \nBut other scientists will want to drill down for themselves into whether other factors were at play in the link between high take-up and low infection rates. \nPlus the private nature of the app means there are some key questions that can't be answered:\nStill, using a Bluetooth app to trace people who might be infected with Covid-19 was always an experiment with an untested technology.\nAnd the scientists who have been working on this project for many months now feel they've proved that it has made a significant contribution to the fight against the virus."

He thought he screwed up beyond repair,\" Mr Kearns said in the interview, in which he said his son had \"just needed a little help\".\nHis parents say an email from Robinhood, received the day after his death, clarified that trading restrictions had been lifted and the trade resolved. \nThe lawsuit, filed in California state court, said the loss had been covered by other options in his account and accuses Robinhood's \"misleading communications\" of leading to \"panic and confusion\".\nThe wrongful death lawsuit accuses Robinhood of unfair business practices and negligent infliction of emotional distress, US media report.\nIn a statement to the BBC, Robinhood said they have made improvements to their \"options offering\" since June including how they display buying power and providing more educational materials and revised experience requirements for users.\n\"In early December, we also added live voice support for customers with an open options position or recent expiration, and plan to expand to other use cases,\" a spokesperson said. \"We also changed our protocol to escalate customers who email us for help with exercise and early assignment. \n\"We remain committed to making Robinhood a place to learn and invest responsibly,\" they added.\nWhere to get help\nFrom Canada or US: If you're in an emergency, please call 911.

      "text": "Current and former editors of Britain's leading newspapers have expressed concern over the government's handling of Freedom of Information requests. \nIn an open letter, they have called for an investigation into a Cabinet Office unit - the Clearing House. \nIt is alleged to have profiled journalists and blocked FOI requests. \nThe government says it \"remains fully committed to its transparency agenda\", having \"routinely\" disclosed information \"beyond its obligations\".\nThe letter marks a rare show of unity by Britain's press, and comes after the website openDemocracy in November published a report showing response rates to FOI requests were at their lowest level since the Freedom of Information Act became law 20 years ago. \nThe Act was meant to give the public much greater access to information held by the authorities.  \nThe report also alleges that although the government is not meant to know who has made a request, when it is sent to a unit in the Cabinet Office, known as the Clearing House, this often is not the case.  \nNow the editors, and several former editors, of the Times, Sunday Times, Guardian, Financial Times, Telegraph and Daily Mirror, have signed a strongly worded letter. \nIt calls for an investigation into the Clearing House, new measures to speed up Freedom of Information, and a bolstering of the Information Commissioner's Office, which oversees the process. \nSeparately, openDemocracy is working with law firm Leigh Day on a legal bid to force the Cabinet Office to reveal full details of how the Clearing House operates. \nJohn Witherow, editor of the Times, described the alleged current process as a \"disgrace\", and said it was \"a fundamental right of a free people to be able to see and scrutinise the decisions made on their behalf\".\nGuardian News and Media's editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, said the government's handling of FOI's was \"at odds with its global commitments to press freedom\", as she called for a \"clear commitment\" to greater transparency and a well-funded information commissioner.\nIn a statement the government said a small Cabinet Office team \"helps ensure a consistent approach to requests for information\".\n\"This is especially important for complex FOI requests where we must balance the need to make information available with our legal duty to protect sensitive information and national security,\" it said.\nThe statement said it had released \"more proactive publications than ever before\", but it said the coronavirus pandemic \"has had an impact on how quickly public authorities are able to respond to FOI requests\".\nPerhaps one of the best known revelations was the scandal over MPs' expenses that erupted in 2009 following a series of Freedom of Information Act requests.\nIt led to prison terms for five Labour MPs and two Conservative peers, and a slew of others had to repay money.\nBut since it came into force in 2005, the FOI Act has been a useful tool for journalists - as well as campaigners and members of the public - for a huge variety of stories, including:\nRead more: 10 things we found out because of Freedom of Information"

      "text": "Travel company Tui has said it expects to run 80% of its normal capacity for this summer, with 2.8 million customers already booked for its holidays.\nThe statement follows optimism from other travel firms that the industry is set for recovery as coronavirus vaccination programmes advance.\nDespite the upbeat mood, summer bookings for 2021 are down 44% so far compared with last year, the firm said.\nBoss Fritz Joussen said the UK market had \"a special significance\" for Tui.\n\"We see an impressive pace and ambitious targets for vaccinations there.\"\nHe added: \"We should do everything we can to quickly return to basic freedoms and make travel possible again.\"\nAverage prices for holidays are 20% higher than for summer 2019.\nAlthough demand for breaks appears to be building, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said on Monday it was \"too early to say\" whether people would be able to have holidays as normal this summer.\nTui's predictions for the summer season came in a trading statement that underlined the scale of the collapse in the tourism market due to Covid curbs.\nThe firm's winter bookings fell 89% compared with a year ago, with November and December hardest hit.\nIncome in the three months to the end of 2020 fell 87.8% year-on-year, from \u20ac3.86bn (\u00a33.4bn) to \u20ac468.1m.\n\"With strict cost discipline and the realignment of the group, which is being driven forward at full speed, we succeeded in reducing the loss in the past quarter,\" Mr Joussen said.\n\"As expected, customers will book their summer holidays much later this year than in normal years. However, demand remains strong, people want to travel - this is shown by the already good number of bookings for the summer.\"\nTui also disclosed that it had agreed a third coronavirus financing package with banks, shareholders and the German government's Economic Stabilisation Fund, created to support companies hit by coronavirus.\nThis raised \u20ac1.8bn, including \u20ac500m from shareholders in a rights issue, which it hopes will tide it over until conditions improve.\n\"The travel sector has been hammered by the global coronavirus pandemic, with revenues falling off a cliff-edge as travel restrictions have scuppered any holiday plans for consumers,\" said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor.\n\"Investors will be eager to see if vaccinations can give the business the shot in the arm it desperately needs, having already secured three bailouts from the German government. \n\"Regardless, Tui needs to reduce its costs and take advantage of the millions of consumers desperate to go on holiday as soon as the restrictions are eased.\" "

      "text": "A graffiti marriage proposal which became a symbol of a city has been removed by developers.\nJason Lowe's public display of affection was spray-painted on a bridge at Park Hill, Sheffield, in 2001.\nHis bid to woo girlfriend Clare Middleton formed part of the city skyline, inspired a track by singer Yungblud and appeared on a t-shirt worn by Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner.\nUrban Splash said the graffiti was removed for \"essential repair work\".\nSam Feeley, who lives in one of the renovated flats, said he noticed the writing - I Love You Will U Marry Me - had been removed on Sunday. \nDescribing it as \"a piece of Sheffield history\", he said: \"It means a lot to the people of the city, so I was quite surprised to see it had gone.\"\n\"I would class it as a piece of artwork and famous artwork fades over the years.\n\"[Leonardo] da Vinci paintings fade and people touch them up and restore them, I wouldn't see why this isn't any different really.\"\nAlthough Mr Lowe and his girlfriend never married, his romantic gesture has formed part of the city's skyline since, with many considering it an \"iconic\" piece of history. \nIn a BBC radio documentary, Mr Lowe explained how he braved his fear of heights to make a public show of proposing to Ms Middleton, who he had had been dating for a year.\nHe said: \"You used to be able to see it from the Odeon cinema.\n\"I took her there, she thought she was going to see a film and I said: 'I've got something to show you'. I told her to look up and she read it.\n\"She said 'yeah'. She thought I was mad.\"\nThe pair split up three months later and Ms Middleton died in 2007 from cancer. \nWhen Urban Splash started renovation of the flats in 2008, they decided to immortalise Mr Lowe's words.\nNeon lights were placed over the writing and it formed part of the developer's marketing campaign. \nYungblud, real name Dominic Harrison, from Doncaster, described the graffiti as \"a quirky act of romance\" in his song I Love You, Will You Marry Me.\nAlex Turner, lead singer of Sheffield band Arctic Monkeys, has also worn the slogan on a T-shirt during gigs.\nSurriya Falconer, speaking on behalf of the developers, said there were \"some structural issues\" which meant the words had to be removed so a coating could be put on the bridge.\nShe said Mr Lowe would be involved in deciding upon a replacement and the meaning would \"continue to be celebrated\".\n\"I understand people may feel a sense of loss but we're talking about new futures and celebrating a piece of history.

      "text": "All international passengers will soon have to test negative for Covid-19 before travelling to the UK.\nPeople arriving by plane, train or boat, including UK nationals, will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are in.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said travellers \"can't board... without having that negative test\".\nBut even with a negative test, arrivals from countries not on the travel corridor list must still quarantine.\nMr Shapps said the government was \"very keen\" to set up compulsory testing now because of the new variant of the virus circulating in South Africa, which he said was \"causing great concern with the scientists\". \n\"They're not sure whether, for example, the vaccine will be able to deal with it in the first place, and we're very, very keen to keep it out,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\nThe new variant prevalent in South Africa has got some potentially concerning changes that experts are closely monitoring. While it is extremely unlikely the mutations would render vaccines useless, scientists are doing tests to make sure immunisation will still work well.\nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked in a matter of weeks or months to be a better match if necessary, experts say.\nIt comes after a further 1,162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Thursday - the second consecutive day of more than 1,000 recorded fatalities. There were also 52,618 new cases.\nThe R number - the average number of people that one infected person will infect - is now between one and 1.4, scientists have estimated.\nAmid the surge in cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to offer \"hundreds of thousands\" of Covid vaccines per day in England by 15 January. On Friday, a third vaccine - made by Moderna - was approved for use in the UK.\nUnder the new rules - which are expected to come in from next week - anyone who arrives in the UK and has not got proof of a negative test could face an immediate \u00a3500 fine.\nBut there will be exemptions for:\nAll passengers arriving from countries not on the government's travel corridor list must still self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their test result.\nMr Shapps told LBC the testing rule will come into force \"likely on Wednesday or Thursday next week\", and details of how to get tests abroad will be published on the gov.uk website.\nThe rule will be UK-wide, although Northern Ireland said it had only \"agreed in principle\" and was working to solve any policy and operational issues.\nNon-essential travel abroad is not currently allowed in the UK, after lockdowns were brought in.\n\"All in all, the thought of an idyllic holiday 'away from it all' has been about as far from the truth as possible,\" says Rob Howard, who is is currently on holiday in Tenerife.\nHe flew out before Christmas and - after deciding to extend his holiday by a week and rebooking a cancelled flight - is due to fly back next Wednesday.\nReacting to the news that he will now likely need to take a Covid test before travelling, Rob, from Nuneaton, says: \"We are going to be expected to self isolate for 10 days so what is the point of this?\" \nMeanwhile, freelance MOT tester Matthew Auty, who lives in Normandy in France but works in Portsmouth during the week, says he's unhappy about the potential cost.\n\"These restrictions are reasonable for tourist travel but they are unfair for people in my position,\" he says.\nFigures from the aviation industry have urged the government to lift the rules as quickly as possible.\n\"This measure will destroy any confidence in forward bookings for air travel and for ferries, and it will essentially close off the UK,\" said Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary.\nHe called for the government to set an \"end date\" for the rules, adding: \"The real solution to this is vaccination, not artificial travel restrictions.\n\"Boris Johnson has told us he will have vaccinated the 14 million high risk categories by the middle of February. What we need Grant Shapps to do today is confirm then that this ridiculous pre-arrival testing will then be removed by the middle of February.\"\nThe boss of Heathrow, John Holland-Kaye, said of the rule: \"If this will help, then so be it.\"\nBut he called it a \"really belt and braces approach\", adding: \"We have always argued for pre-departure testing as an alternative to quarantine... now we're going to have both\".\n\"And it can only be a temporary measure, very few people will travel with this in place,\" he added to BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nTim Alderslade, the chief executive of the industry body Airlines UK, said the move should be \"a short-term, emergency measure only\".\n\"Once the rollout of the vaccine accelerates, the focus must be on returning travel to normal as quickly as possible\", he added, including \"removing the need to quarantine or test\".\nLabour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the new measures were \"necessary\" but highlighted that the opposition party \"has been calling for a comprehensive strategy on testing for international travel since April\".\nIt comes after England banned travellers from countries near South Africa to stop the spread of the new local Covid variant.\nThe latest travel curbs come as all of the UK is under strict Covid rules, with lockdowns in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland - meaning there is very little international travel.\nAt a Downing Street press conference on Thursday, the prime minister confirmed almost 1.5 million people in the UK had now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, but warned there would likely be \"lumpiness and bumpiness\" as the rollout continued.\nThe government has set a target to offer vaccination slots to the top four priority groups - including all over-80s - by 15 February.\nAre you currently abroad?

      "tags": "Travel,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All travellers entering the UK will be required to take two coronavirus tests while quarantining in an attempt to prevent variants entering the country.\nArrivals will be required to get a test on days two and eight of their 10-day quarantine period, whether they are isolating at home or in a hotel.\nThe Department of Health said the move would enable authorities to track new cases more effectively.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock will set out more details in the Commons later. \nIt is in addition to the current rules which require travellers arriving in the UK - whether by boat, train or plane - to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry.\nThis test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling, and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to \u00a3500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks.\nTravellers must provide contact details and their UK address. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to the place where they plan to self-isolate. \nThe new testing policy comes amid concern about new variants entering the country that are more resistant to existing vaccines.\nEarly trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine suggest it offers \"minimal protection\" against mild disease from the South Africa variant. There have been 147 cases of the variant have found in the UK.\nProf Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the results were \"expected\" because the virus is \"introducing mutations... to allow it to still transmit in populations where there's some immunity.\"\n\"As long as we have enough immunity to prevent severe disease, hospitalisations and death, then we're going to be fine in the future in the pandemic,\" he said.\nOn Monday, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said the South African variant did not appear to have a \"transmissibility advantage\" over the one first identified in Kent, which has spread across the UK.\nIt was therefore unlikely to \"overrun\" the Kent variant, he told Monday's coronavirus briefing. \nFrom 15 February, UK residents and Irish nationals arriving from certain countries will have to quarantine in hotels.\nPassengers will have to stay in their rooms for 10 nights, with security guards accompanying if they go outside.\nThe rules will apply to UK nationals and residents arriving from 33 \"red list\" Covid-19 hotspots - mostly in South America and Africa - where it's feared Covid variants may have already spread. Passengers will be expected to pay for the cost of the accommodation.\nNon-UK travellers who have been in these countries in the 10 days before travelling are banned from entry.\nAll travellers - including British nationals - must self-isolate for 10 days when they get to the UK.\nThe \"test to release scheme\" - where travellers from non-red list countries can leave home isolation after a negative test on day five - will remain under the new testing rules.\nPassengers will be expected to use the gold-standard and more expensive PCR tests.\nDerek Jones, chief executive of luxury travel company Kuoni, welcomed the testing plan. \n\"As we have said all along, a robust testing regime is the way to open up travel again but it has to replace or at least shorten quarantine,\" he said.\nIt comes as Prof Van-Tam warned it was too soon to say to what extent people could begin to start planning summer holidays.\nSpeaking at Monday's coronavirus briefing, he said: \"The more elaborate your plans are for summer holidays, in terms of crossing borders, in terms of household mixing, given where we are now, I think we just have to say the more you are stepping into making guesses about the unknown at this point,\" he said.\n\"I can't give people a proper answer at this point because we don't yet have the data. It is just too early to say.\"\nLockdown rules mean people must only travel abroad for essential reasons. These are the same as the \"reasonable excuses\" for domestic travel, including:\nPeople leaving England will soon have to make a declaration on why they need to travel, which will be checked by carriers prior to departure.\nHave you recently travelled into the UK? What was your experience at the UK border?\nIn other developments:\nSpeaking about the new testing plans, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said it was \"important the government continues to take the necessary steps to protect people and save lives\". \nHe added: \"Enhancing our testing regime to cover all arrivals while they isolate will provide a further level of protection and enable us to better track any new cases which might be brought into the country, and give us even more opportunities to detect new variants.\""

      "tags": "Welsh government,Welsh Parliament election 2021,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Voting in the Senedd elections could take place over two days or longer if the polls are delayed from 6 May.\nThere are no plans to delay the election, but Senedd members are discussing a new law to allow a postponement of up to six months.\nThe Welsh Government has now amended it to allow for early voting, which is used in the US and elsewhere.\nBut the UK government says early voting would be unnecessary and would require additional resources.\nWelsh ministers say the UK government's view and coinciding elections for police and crime commissioners means it would be \"impossible\" to hold early voting on the original election date.\nInstead, the Welsh Government has amended the emergency legislation on an election delay, allowing it to propose extra polling days if an election is delayed and the commissioner elections are not held at the same time.\nSenedd members approved the change on Tuesday, ahead of a vote on the full legislation on Wednesday.\nWelsh ministers say the election should take place on 6 May, but argue the legislation is needed if it is not safe to hold the election at that time, because of Covid.\nBut the UK government has not suggested that its own elections set for the date would be moved, and last week confirmed the PCC polls will go ahead as planned.\nIt potentially means the Senedd election could be delayed but the PCC elections would continue to be held on the same day.\nUnder the amended law, extra days for voting would need to be held in the seven days ahead of the new election date.\nA spokesman for the Welsh Government said: \"We strongly support measures to make voting easier, particularly given the circumstances caused by the pandemic and would have favoured putting in place early voting - as happens in many countries across the world - for the Senedd election on 6 May. \n\"This proved impossible, given the fact that on current plans, the Senedd election and the PCC elections will take place on the same day and the UK government - which is responsible for the PCC elections - opposes early voting.\n\"The amendment would enable Welsh voters to benefit from the opportunity to cast their ballot on more than one day if the election were to be postponed and was not held concurrently with the PCC elections.\"\nThe UK government said it had confirmed that the PCC elections in Wales will go ahead on 6 May.\nIts delivery plan for the elections said early voting was \"unnecessary given voters can already vote early by post, and the additional resources required to staff early polling stations would make the elections harder to deliver given Covid-19 staffing pressures\".\n\"Local authorities are able to contact all clinically extremely vulnerable people in their areas to make them aware of the options to use a proxy or postal vote and they will be supported in their efforts by targeted communications from the Electoral Commission.\"\nSenedd members voted the amendment into the election bill on Tuesday afternoon - 37 for, 13 against, with 1 abstention - during a series of votes on proposed changes to the bill.\nJulie James, presenting the amendment, said early voting would \"encourage more voters to participate, but also make the election safer by spreading footfall from one day to several\".\nThe Welsh Conservatives voted against the idea - Conservative Senedd member Mark Isherwood said an election held over multiple days \"raises security concerns over the integrity of the election\", including over how ballot boxes would be secured.\nPlaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said early voting could be a way of enabling people to cast their vote during the pandemic.\nPlaid supported the amendment, but Mr ap Iorwerth said there was a \"lot of work to be done\" on on how it would be delivered.\nConservatives say they will abstain on the bill after their amendments were rejected.\nThe Tories said the election should only be postponed if Wales is in alert level 4 - the most serious level of coronavirus restrictions. \nBut the proposal was voted down, as was an attempt to stop the election being delayed beyond 9 September.\nFinal votes on the legislation will be held on Wednesday, which would also enable a delay to the dissolution of the Welsh Parliament - the date at which the institution formally breaks up.\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies, said: \"Barring any dramatic change in circumstances, I have every confidence that election officials across Wales will also be able to carry out a safe and secure Senedd election, learning from the vast number of elections that have taken place around the globe during the pandemic.\n\"The Welsh Labour Government should now focus all energy on ensuring the people of Wales are able to have their say on the future of our country on 6 May.\"\nA Plaid Cymru spokeswoman said \"urgent clarity\" was needed on what is \"legally permitted in terms of campaigning activity against each alert level\".\nShe also called for the publication of \"pre-dissolution and dissolution period guidance with the requirement for any postponement proposal to be initiated by the first minister by 7 April at the latest\".

That is not so surprising in itself, but shareholders would also have noted the projected increase in capital spending, which will rise to \u00a3700m in the coming year. \nOcado is spending heavily not only on technology, but also new warehouses. Shares in Ocado have always priced in the promise of future profits, and today's numbers made that promise seem that much further off.\nOcado said in its full year statement on Tuesday: \"The pandemic has accelerated the rate of channel shift to online.\n\"Online grocery market share in the UK has nearly doubled over the last year to 14%, according to Kantar. Similar trends are observable in the United States as well as many other countries around the world.\"\nRoss Hindle, from research firm Third Bridge, said: \"These are not just results, these are remarkable results. Ocado couldn't have asked for better trading conditions.\n\"The M&S partnership has, so far, proved positive for Ocado, with management highlighting that access to M&S products is now higher than the benchmark Waitrose set.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon,Travel,Michael Matheson,Hotels,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Everyone arriving in Scotland on an international flight from next Monday will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days.\nThe Scottish government said it would be \"block booking\" 1,300 rooms at six hotels near the country's airports.\nThe \u00a31,750 cost of the stay will have to be borne by passengers themselves.\nA similar scheme will operate in other parts of the UK, but unlike Scotland, only flights from countries on a \"red list\" will be covered. \nTransport Secretary Michael Matheson said on Tuesday there were approximately 1,600 Scottish arrivals in the last week of January, and numbers fell to 730 in the first week of February. \nHe said: \"The number of travellers coming to Scotland directly is reducing and I expect these restrictions to reduce arrivals yet further. \n\"These measures will be backed with criminal offences as usual. The stronger approach we are taking are necessary and appropriate.\"\nMr Matheson confirmed that an online booking system, run by the UK government, would go live on Thursday.\nPeople travelling to Scotland will then be required to use the portal to book and pay for a quarantine hotel room if they are arriving from Monday.\nThe \u00a31,750 charge for the room includes mandatory Covid tests on day two and day eight following arrival for one person - any additional travellers will incur supplemental costs. \nA welfare fund will be developed for people struggling to meet these charges, Mr Matheson added.\nHe said anyone who breaches the measures could face criminal charges including culpable and reckless conduct. \nA spokesman for AGS Airports, which owns Aberdeen International and Glasgow Airports, said: \"Bar two oil and gas related flights at Aberdeen, there are no other international flights at our airports, so these latest measures will have no impact as the damage had already been done. \n\"We've stated previously that we understand the need for emergency measures, however, we urgently need to work with government on developing a recovery plan for our sector which has been at a standstill for almost one year.\"\nIn England, the policy only applies to people travelling from \"red list\" countries. \nIn theory, that means travellers from other countries could avoid quarantine in Scotland by flying to an English airport, then crossing the border into Scotland by road or rail. \nMr Matheson said he had urged the UK government to \"match the comprehensive approach\" in Scotland.\nElite athletes are currently exempt from travel restrictions however Mr Matheson said the criteria would be strengthened, to only permit travel for athletes and coaches preparing for the Olympics and Paralympics.\nA small number of arrivals will not be required to isolate at all, including essential supply chains for goods coming into Scotland, foreign diplomats and essential defence activities.\nThe BBC has approached a number of hotel groups asking whether rooms have been booked for international travellers required to quarantine.\nA commissioning document was sent out to hotels last week with details of how they can bid to be involved in the quarantine system and what they would need to provide. \nThe BBC understands governments will book three and four star accommodation with the capacity to provide meals and laundry services.\nFirms have submitted their proposals and await news on whether bids have been successful in order to bring in staff and reopen buildings, some of which have been closed for months.\nPremier Inn said it was not one of the 16 hotels so far part of the UK government hotel quarantine scheme.\nIntercontinental Hotels Group, which owns Holiday Inn, Hotel Indigo and Crowne Plaza brands, declined to comment as did CitizenM, Millennium Hotels, Macdonald Hotels and Travelodge.\nRadisson Hotel Group said it had \"consistently supported\" local governments and \"provided quarantine services at select properties for travellers and front-line workers\".\nIt added that its safety protocol and \"enhanced operating procedures\" meant it had \"all the necessary measures in place to support and implement quarantine services quickly and safely\".\nAccor, which owns the Ibis, Novotel and Mercure brands, also suggested it may take part in the scheme.\nA spokesperson for the firm said discussions were \"well under way\" with the government and hotels  \"ready to support the call for quarantine in order to enable safe travel\".\nOYO Hotels, which operates venues near Edinburgh and Prestwick airports, said it was \"ready to work with the government\" to provide accommodation in line with the new protocols.\nHilton, Marriott, Best Western, Jurys Inn, and Leonardo Hotels have also been contacted but have yet to give a response."

      "tags": "The Supremes,Music",
      "text": "Mary Wilson, who co-founded The Supremes and remained a member of the group until they split up, has died at the age of 76.\nThe singer passed away at her home in Henderson, Nevada, her publicist Jay Schwartz announced, but he did not confirm the cause of death.\nThe Supremes were known for hits such as Baby Love and You Can't Hurry Love.\nThe group was founded in Detroit as The Primettes in 1959, when Wilson was 15 years old. \nLead singer Diana Ross tweeted: \"My condolences to Mary's family, I am reminded that each day is a gift, I have so many wonderful memories of our time together. The Supremes will live on, in our hearts \ud83d\udc95.\"\nThe founder of Motown Records, Berry Gordy, said in a statement: \"I was extremely shocked and saddened to hear of the passing of a major member of the Motown family, Mary Wilson of the Supremes.\n\"The Supremes opened doors for themselves, the other Motown acts, and many, many others... I was always proud of Mary. She was quite a star in her own right and over the years continued to work hard to boost the legacy of the Supremes. Mary Wilson was extremely special to me. She was a trailblazer, a diva and will be deeply missed.\"\nVocalist Patti LaBelle, who rose to fame alongside Wilson in the 60s, added: \"I am deeply saddened by the passing of the beautiful Mary Wilson! She was a legend and an icon and what she contributed to the world cannot be overstated. I send my deepest condolences and prayers to her family, loved ones and fans\u2764.\"\nAcademy award-winning actress Viola Davis posted: \"RIP Mary Wilson! Godspeed \ud83d\udc9b.\" \nSinger Beverley Knight said: \"Mary Wilson along with Florence Ballard and Diana Ross changed the game permanently. Hit after hit after hit, on regular rotation to this day. A Supreme Titan may have left us but that legacy will never be surpassed.\"\nIn recognition of her ground-breaking influence with the group, the foundation of late civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King tweeted in tribute.\nA funeral for Wilson will be held privately due to Covid-19 restrictions, her family said, but a celebration of her life will take place later this year. \nWilson was an original member of the group alongside Diana Ross, Florence Ballard and Barbara Martin.\nMartin left the group before they became successful, and The Supremes continued as a trio. The Supremes became Motown's most successful act of the 1960s scoring 12 number one singles in the US.\nTheir first number one was 1964's Where Did Our Love Go, which was soon followed by Baby Love, Come See About Me and Stop! In the Name of Love.\nBaby Love was the only single to reach number one in the UK, but several of their singles hit the top 10 including You Keep Me Hangin' On and You Can't Hurry Love.\nIn 1967, Ballard was replaced by Cindy Birdsong and Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross and the Supremes.\nThree years later, Ross left to pursue a solo career. After her departure, Wilson was left as the only original member of the group.\nWilson continued performing with Cindy Birdsong and Jean Terrell as the \"new\" Supremes, better known today as the \"70s Supremes\".\nThe group disbanded following Wilson's 1977 departure.\nWilson became a New York Times bestselling author in 1986 with the release of her autobiography, Dreamgirl: My Life As a Supreme.\nThe Supremes were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.\nInterest in the group's legacy was renewed after the release of the film Dreamgirls in 2006, which starred Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and Jennifer Hudson.\nThe movie was based on the story of The Supremes, although Wilson said it did not depict their true story.\nIn 2019, Wilson took part in Dancing With The Stars, the US version of Strictly Come Dancing.\nJust two days before her death, Wilson uploaded a video on YouTube announcing that she was working on releasing new solo material.\nPaul Stanley of Kiss tweeted: \"I was just on a Zoom call with her Wednesday for about an hour and never could have imagined this. So full of life and great stories. Absolutely shocked. Rest In Supreme Peace Mary.\"\nBroadcaster Tony Blackburn said: \"So sorry to hear the wonderful Mary Wilson has passed away. She was a very great singer and a very nice person. R.I.P.\" \nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Ocado,Retailing,Supermarkets",
      "text": "The grocery landscape worldwide is changing \"for good\", online supermarket Ocado has said, after a year in which the global pandemic forced many people to buy online for the first time.\nOcado's comments came as it reported a 35% jump in sales over the past year.\nAmid rocketing demand the UK-based firm, which is 21 years old this year, narrowed losses from \u00a3214.5m to \u00a344m.\nThe company said many customers were saying they were unlikely to revert to pre-crisis shopping habits.\nOcado's chief executive, Tim Steiner, said he wanted to \"pay tribute to the remarkable work of our colleagues in exceptionally challenging circumstances\".  \nLockdown has thrown up challenges for all supermarkets and Ocado itself has struggled to deliver smoothly at all times. \nThe firm, which previously delivered for Waitrose, had to cancel some orders when its new partnership with Marks & Spencer launched on 1 September, angering customers.\nThat move was its most notable in the UK, but Ocado has been expanding around the world, spurred by demand for its advanced technology and robot-operated warehouses.\nIt has tie ups with Kroger in the US, Casino in France and Aeon in Japan, and is also planning three new warehouses in the UK this year, which will boost capacity by 40%.\nOcado has been one of the best-performing shares in the FTSE 100 in the past year, roughly doubling in value since last March. \nIt is in the perfect position to benefit from the restrictions put in place to control the coronavirus, with shoppers clamouring for online deliveries in order to avoid a trip to the supermarket. \nThese results - for the 12 months to the end of November, so not including the most recent national lockdown in England - show grocery sales up 35% to \u00a32.2bn. \nYou might have thought that jump in sales would have sent the shares up, but in fact they were down - 4% - in early trading.\nInvestors have looked past the headline sales number to see another pre-tax loss for the year  - \u00a344m. That is not so surprising in itself, but shareholders would also have noted the projected increase in capital spending, which will rise to \u00a3700m in the coming year. \nOcado is spending heavily not only on technology, but also new warehouses. Shares in Ocado have always priced in the promise of future profits, and today's numbers made that promise seem that much further off.\nOcado said in its full year statement on Tuesday: \"The pandemic has accelerated the rate of channel shift to online.\n\"Online grocery market share in the UK has nearly doubled over the last year to 14%, according to Kantar. Similar trends are observable in the United States as well as many other countries around the world.\"\nRoss Hindle, from research firm Third Bridge, said: \"These are not just results, these are remarkable results. Ocado couldn't have asked for better trading conditions.\n\"The M&S partnership has, so far, proved positive for Ocado, with management highlighting that access to M&S products is now higher than the benchmark Waitrose set.\""

      "text": "A computer hacker gained access to the water system of a city in Florida and tried to pump in a \"dangerous\" amount of a chemical, officials say.\nThe hacker briefly increased the amount of sodium hydroxide (lye) in Oldsmar's water treatment system, but a worker spotted it and reversed the action.\nLye is used in small amounts to control acidity but a large amount could have caused major problems in the water.\nOldsmar Mayor Eric Seidel said: \"There's a bad actor out there.\"\nNo arrests have yet been made and it is not known if the hack was done from within the US or outside.\nA computer controlling Oldsmar's water treatment system was remotely accessed on Friday.\nA plant operator saw an attempt to access the system in the morning but assumed it was his supervisor, the Tampa Bay Times reported.\nBut another attempt was made early in the afternoon and this time the hacker accessed the treatment software and increased the sodium hydroxide content from 100 parts per million to 11,100 ppm.\nThe operator immediately reduced the level to normal.\nSodium hydroxide is the chief ingredient in liquid drain cleaners. It is very corrosive and can cause irritation to the skin and eyes, along with temporary loss of hair.\nSwallowing it can cause damage to the mouth, throat and stomach and induce vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea.\nPinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said: \"I'm not a chemist. But I can tell you what I do know is... if you put that amount of that substance into the drinking water, it's not a good thing.\"\nBut he added: \"At no time was there a significant adverse effect on the water being treated. Importantly, the public was never in danger.\"\nThe Oldsmar plant provides water to businesses and about 15,000 residents.\nThe remote access programme to the water system has been temporarily disabled.\nAnalysis by Joe Tidy, cyber reporter\nImagine the horror as this worker watched their own mouse cursor being moved around the screen by an invisible hand. Then seeing it click open and adjust the electronic dials to poison the water.\nPerhaps more terrifying is that this isn't the first time it's happened.\nIn 2016, a security report from Verizon detailed a similar attack on another unnamed US water facility. And in 2020 there were multiple unsuccessful hacks on Israeli water supplies.\nThis latest attack in Florida will do nothing to calm cyber-security experts who've been warning for years that so called \"critical national infrastructure\" facilities are being targeted.\nWater, electricity, nuclear plants and transport are being probed for weaknesses all the time not just because of the potential for mass disruption but also because they are often running on out-of-date and vulnerable IT systems. \nSo far all attacks on water supplies have been averted.\nBut as Mayor Seidel put it in his press conference, this is an event that \"puts everyone on notice: these types of bad actors are out there and this is happening\"."

      "text": "Elon Musk's car firm Tesla has said it bought about $1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn) of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin in January and expects to start accepting it as payment in future.\nThe news caused the price of Bitcoin to jump 17% to $44,220, a record high.\nTesla said it was trying to maximise returns on cash that is not being used in day-to-day running of the company.\nIt comes days after Mr Musk added \"#bitcoin\" to his Twitter profile page, which drove up the price.\nHe removed it days later, but has continued talking up Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, which jumped 50% after his endorsement. \nIn a stock market filing, Tesla said it \"updated its investment policy\" in January and now wanted to invest in \"reserve assets\" such as digital currencies, gold bullion or gold exchange-traded funds.\nIt said it had already bought $1.5bn of Bitcoin and could \"acquire and hold digital assets\" in the future.\n\"Moreover, we expect to begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis,\" it said. \nMr Musk said a week ago in a tweet that Bitcoin was \"on the verge\" of being more widely accepted among investors.\nSome analysts said Tesla's investment could be a game-changer for the cryptocurrency.\n\"I think we will see an acceleration of companies looking to allocate to Bitcoin now that Tesla has made the first move,\" said Eric Turner, vice-president of market intelligence at cryptocurrency research firm Messari.\n\"One of the largest companies in the world now owns Bitcoin and by extension, every investor that owns Tesla, or even just an S&P 500 fund, has exposure to it as well.\"\nBut Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, warned that Bitcoin was a \"very volatile\" cryptocurrency.\n\"Tesla is now starting to take on big [foreign exchange] risk - this may not worry a lot of investors, but some conservative types might be concerned,\" he said.\nBitcoin, which has hit record highs in recent months after a rollercoaster ride over the past decade, has also drawn support from major financial institutions this year.\nThe world's biggest money manager, Blackrock, recently changed a handful of investment mandates to allow some of its funds to invest in the currency.\nHowever, central banks remain sceptical of digital currencies.\nIn October, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey cautioned over Bitcoin's use as a payment method.\n\"I have to be honest, it is hard to see that Bitcoin has what we tend to call intrinsic value,\" he said. \"It may have extrinsic value in the sense that people want it.\"\nMr Bailey added that he was \"very nervous\" about people using Bitcoin for payments, pointing out that investors should realise its price was extremely volatile."

      "tags": "Impeachment of Donald Trump,US Capitol stormed,Donald Trump",
      "text": "The second impeachment trial of Donald Trump begins on Tuesday as Senate leaders agreed a rapid timetable. \nThe former president is charged with \"inciting insurrection\" in a speech to supporters ahead of the deadly riot at the US Capitol on 6 January.\nDemocrats say they have \"overwhelming\" evidence of his guilt while his defence team claim rioters acted independently. \nThe defence call the trial \"absurd and unconstitutional\" and its legality of it will be a focus on Tuesday.\nMr Trump is the only US president in history to have been impeached twice and one of only three to have been impeached at all.\nIf convicted, he could be barred from holding office again. But a two-thirds of the 100-seat senate is required to convict - Democrats hold 50 seats and there is little sign enough Republicans will join them. \nIn a pre-trial statement released on Monday, Mr Trump's lawyers argued the trial is unconstitutional because Mr Trump has left office and is now a private citizen.\nThe nine \"impeachment managers\" - Democrats from the House of Representatives who will lay out the case for prosecution - dispute this, saying he should be accountable for actions as president. \nBoth sides will have four hours to tackle this constitutional question on Tuesday, with a vote expected at the end of the day on whether to proceed.\nSenate leaders agreed a framework for the trial on Monday.\n\"All parties have agreed to a structure that will ensure a fair and honest Senate impeachment trial of the former president,\" US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.\nIf Tuesday's constitutional vote passes - and it is expected to - opening arguments will begin on Wednesday afternoon with both sides allowed up to 16 hours each for presentations.\nThese arguments are expected to run through until the weekend when senators will get a chance to ask both sides questions.\nIt is unclear if the impeachment managers will then extend the timetable by requesting witnesses be called or subpoenaed - though Mr Trump has already declined to voluntarily testify. \nLawmakers on both sides are said to favour a quick trial, amid an ongoing effort to have President Joe Biden's coronavirus relief package approved.\nWith the speedy timetable, it is thought a Senate vote on whether to convict Mr Trump or not could come as early as Monday.\nDemocrats say Mr Trump's repeated refusal to concede last November's presidential election to Joe Biden - as well as the fiery rhetoric he used addressing supporters - encouraged the riot on 6 January where five people died.\nThey have called for Mr Trump to be disqualified from ever running for office again.\n\"His incitement of insurrection against the United States government - which disrupted the peaceful transfer of power - is the most grievous constitutional crime ever committed by a president,\" they said on Monday. \nHouse managers are expected to use Mr Trump's words and footage from the day to show that \"the furious crowd\" was \"primed\" for violence. \nMr Trump's legal team argue Mr Trump was simply exercising his First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and have described the trial as \"political theatre\" and a \"brazen political act\". \nThey also argued in their pre-trial brief that FBI documents had shown that the riot was planned days in advance therefore Mr Trump's words cannot have incited it. \nWhat questions do you have about the impeachment trial?\nThe impeachment process can be confusing.

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks",
      "text": "The EU's threat to restrict vaccine exports to Northern Ireland has opened a \"Pandora's Box\" regarding post-Brexit arrangements, Michael Gove has said.\nHe told MPs an urgent \"reset\" was needed to the Northern Ireland protocol governing checks on GB-NI trade.\nThe agreement was \"not working\" and NI businesses and families were suffering too much \"disruption and interference\". \nWhile the UK did not want to \"ditch\" it, it \"reserved the right\" to do what it must to protect Northern Ireland. \nUnionist parties in Northern Ireland have called for the protocol - which came into force on 1 January - to be scrapped, saying it has created a border down the Irish Sea and threatened NI's place within the UK.\nThe protocol was designed to avoid checks along the border between Northern Ireland - which unlike the rest of the UK is continuing to follow many of the EU's rules - and the Republic of Ireland, a member of the EU.\nBut after checks were introduced on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain, some exporters have scaled back deliveries or stopped fulfilling orders altogether, blaming the additional paperwork and costs involved.\nAnd following last month's vaccine row, graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border appeared in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland, while some staff involved in inspecting goods were stood down over security fears.\nCabinet Office minister Mr Gove said the EU's threat to invoke Article 16 of the protocol to control shipments of vaccines from the continent to Northern Ireland - amid concerns of a shortage in Europe - had been a mistake.\nThe European Commission, he said, owed its members an explanation why it didn't follow the dispute mechanism procedures in the protocol and consult with other member states, particularly Ireland, before acting. \nAsked by Tory MP David Jones whether the \"bad blood\" between the two sides would cause long-term damage, Mr Gove said it would be \"better\" if the EU revoked the regulation in place allowing it to invoke Article 16 in future.\n\"The Pandora's Box has been opened and that is concerning,\" he told the European Scrutiny Committee. \n\"One of the consequences of opening that Pandora's Box has been the unfortunate effects we referred to on the ground in Northern Ireland.\" \nAsked by a number of Conservative MPs whether the EU's actions were a reasonable cause for the UK to seek to suspend the protocol or to axe it entirely, Mr Gove said while it was not functioning smoothly, it could be \"made to work\".\nWhile he said progress in the Joint EU-UK Committee on the protocol's implementation had not been as fast as he had liked, he hoped for better in talks with his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in London on Thursday. \n\"There are disruptions and difficulties faced by Northern Ireland citizens in their daily lives,\" he said. \"They can be resolved within the context of the protocol. We don't need to ditch it.\n\"But as the prime minister has spelt out, if we can't make progress in resolving those issues, then the UK government has to reserve its rights.\""

      "text": "Everyone arriving in Scotland on an international flight from next Monday will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days.\nThe Scottish government said it would be \"block booking\" 1,300 rooms at six hotels near the country's airports.\nThe \u00a31,750 cost of the stay will have to be borne by passengers themselves.\nA similar scheme will operate in other parts of the UK, but unlike Scotland, only flights from countries on a \"red list\" will be covered. \nTransport Secretary Michael Matheson said on Tuesday there were approximately 1,600 Scottish arrivals in the last week of January, and numbers fell to 730 in the first week of February. \nHe said: \"The number of travellers coming to Scotland directly is reducing and I expect these restrictions to reduce arrivals yet further. \n\"These measures will be backed with criminal offences as usual. The stronger approach we are taking are necessary and appropriate.\"\nMr Matheson confirmed that an online booking system, run by the UK government, would go live on Thursday.\nPeople travelling to Scotland will then be required to use the portal to book and pay for a quarantine hotel room if they are arriving from Monday.\nThe \u00a31,750 charge for the room includes mandatory Covid tests on day two and day eight following arrival for one person - any additional travellers will incur supplemental costs. \nA welfare fund will be developed for people struggling to meet these charges, Mr Matheson added.\nHe said anyone who breaches the measures could face criminal charges including culpable and reckless conduct. \nA spokesman for AGS Airports, which owns Aberdeen International and Glasgow Airports, said: \"Bar two oil and gas related flights at Aberdeen, there are no other international flights at our airports, so these latest measures will have no impact as the damage had already been done. \n\"We've stated previously that we understand the need for emergency measures, however, we urgently need to work with government on developing a recovery plan for our sector which has been at a standstill for almost one year.\"\nIn England, the policy only applies to people travelling from \"red list\" countries. \nIn theory, that means travellers from other countries could avoid quarantine in Scotland by flying to an English airport, then crossing the border into Scotland by road or rail. \nMr Matheson said he had urged the UK government to \"match the comprehensive approach\" in Scotland.\nElite athletes are currently exempt from travel restrictions however Mr Matheson said the criteria would be strengthened, to only permit travel for athletes and coaches preparing for the Olympics and Paralympics.\nA small number of arrivals will not be required to isolate at all, including essential supply chains for goods coming into Scotland, foreign diplomats and essential defence activities.\nThe BBC has approached a number of hotel groups asking whether rooms have been booked for international travellers required to quarantine.\nA commissioning document was sent out to hotels last week with details of how they can bid to be involved in the quarantine system and what they would need to provide. \nThe BBC understands governments will book three and four star accommodation with the capacity to provide meals and laundry services.\nFirms have submitted their proposals and await news on whether bids have been successful in order to bring in staff and reopen buildings, some of which have been closed for months.\nPremier Inn said it was not one of the 16 hotels so far part of the UK government hotel quarantine scheme.\nIntercontinental Hotels Group, which owns Holiday Inn, Hotel Indigo and Crowne Plaza brands, declined to comment as did CitizenM, Millennium Hotels, Macdonald Hotels and Travelodge.\nRadisson Hotel Group said it had \"consistently supported\" local governments and \"provided quarantine services at select properties for travellers and front-line workers\".\nIt added that its safety protocol and \"enhanced operating procedures\" meant it had \"all the necessary measures in place to support and implement quarantine services quickly and safely\".\nAccor, which owns the Ibis, Novotel and Mercure brands, also suggested it may take part in the scheme.\nA spokesperson for the firm said discussions were \"well under way\" with the government and hotels  \"ready to support the call for quarantine in order to enable safe travel\".\nOYO Hotels, which operates venues near Edinburgh and Prestwick airports, said it was \"ready to work with the government\" to provide accommodation in line with the new protocols.\nHilton, Marriott, Best Western, Jurys Inn, and Leonardo Hotels have also been contacted but have yet to give a response."

      "title": "Covid variants: Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights?",
      "tags": "Travel,Reality Check,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There are more than 40 countries on the government's red list, which has the strictest travel restrictions.\nOne is India, where a new mutation of coronavirus first identified in the country has spread to the UK. This has been linked to international travel. It has been classified as a \"variant of concern\" and more than 3,400 cases of it have been found in the UK.\nBut despite this and the discovery in the UK of other variants identified abroad, the government has never banned international travel altogether - unlike some countries.\nA traffic light system has been introduced for travel, with countries classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests.\nRed list countries (which include India, Pakistan, Brazil and South Africa) are those the UK government says are at the highest risk from Covid, and should not be visited \"except in the most extreme of circumstances\".\nIf you have been in one, you can only enter the UK if you are a UK or Irish national, or UK resident.\nYou must be tested negative for Covid-19 before departure and self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved quarantine hotel.\nDirect flights from many red list countries to the UK are banned but some are allowed. These include flights from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kenya. The government says this is to avoid potential disruption to critical freight and British nationals seeking to return home.\nOn one day (19 May), Reality Check counted 4 direct flights from India to Heathrow.\nCoronavirus variants originally found in Brazil, South Africa and India are believed to be more transmissible, and there are concerns vaccines may not be quite as effective against them.\nBritish and Irish citizens who have been in these countries are allowed to return to the UK and - until mid-February - were trusted to self-isolate at home and could take public transport to get there. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had moved \"as fast as we could\" to introduce quarantine hotels, describing them as a \"very tough regime\". The measures began on 15 February 2021, after weeks of speculation.\nLabour said there had been a lack of a \"comprehensive\" border system. \nThe Civil Aviation Authority said that in February 2021, 50,000 passengers travelled between India and the UK, which is an average of just under 900 a day in each direction. \nThe country was placed on the red list on 23 April and there has been criticism that it should have been added earlier.\nJust under half of people with the India variant of concern in England had been travelling, according to a 13 May briefing from Public Health England. It said that about one third of the cases were in London and a quarter were in the North West of England.\nPositive tests from passengers arriving in the UK are automatically sent for genome sequencing, which identifies new variants.\nBut there is concern that by the time a variant has been identified, it may already have spread in the UK.\nThe debate over whether to shut UK borders stretches back to the start of the pandemic.\nBetween January and March 2020, the UK introduced some measures to try to protect itself from the new virus.\nQuarantine was imposed on 273 people travelling from Wuhan in China, where the first outbreak was seen. Others from \"high-risk countries\" including China, Iran and Northern Italy were asked to voluntarily isolate for 14 days.\nAn inquiry into the pandemic suggested it was understandable the government \"did not consider it practical or effective simply to restrict flights\" at that time, partly because there were so many British residents trying to get home.\nBut these self-isolation requirements were withdrawn on 13 March 2020 - 10 days before the UK went into the first lockdown.\n\"The government's failure to have proper quarantine measures in place in March as the infection was spreading fast was a grave error and meant Covid spread faster and reached more people,\" Yvette Cooper, chair of the committee of MPs behind the inquiry said. \nOne study found the virus was introduced to the UK \"well over a thousand times in early 2020\", with a third of transmission chains brought in from Spain, followed by 29% from France, neither of which faced any restrictions. China accounted for just 0.4% of imported cases.\nAt the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised against travel bans, saying they were \"usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact\".\nIn April 2021, the WHO said it would update its \"risk-based guidance\" on Covid and international travel.\nThe Home Office said the committee behind the inquiry was \"incorrect in their assertions\".\nIt said keeping borders open helped businesses maintain international connections, boosted the economy and meant people could still travel for essential reasons. \nIt argued that by mid-March 2020 there was \"significant transmission\" in the UK and any extra travel restrictions at that time would have had a \"very marginal\" impact.\nAt a meeting in February 2020, the government advisory committee Sage suggested that cutting the number of infections entering the UK by half would only delay the epidemic by five days. \nThe scientists estimated that a 95% reduction in imported cases, which would have required \"draconian\" travel restrictions, would have pushed things back by a month.\nBut at its meeting in January 2021, Sage said: \"No intervention, other than a complete, pre-emptive closure of borders, or the mandatory quarantine of all visitors upon arrival in designated facilities, irrespective of testing history, can get close to fully preventing the importation of cases or new variants.\""

      "tags": "Poverty,Food banks,Child poverty,Hartlepool,Parenting",
      "text": "The boot of the red car lifts up to reveal a sea of plastic bags. Inside each one are the essentials for bringing up young children: nappies, wipes, baby food and shampoo, as well as sanitary items for their mums - all free to those in need. \nWithin a minute or two, the first customer arrives. Soon followed by another, and another. Since the first lockdown, on every Thursday Emilie de Bruijn runs this \"baby bank\" out of the back of her car in Hartlepool. \nCovid has put paid to the indoor space she used in normal times. It's also increased demand amongst families now suffering real and deepening hardship.  \nHer parking spot is beside a church which doubles up as a food bank. On the freezing Thursday we visited, almost 100 people queued in the cold for several hours for the food parcels on offer there. Among them were parents with pushchairs and young children, who stepped out of the queue to collect some baby basics before rejoining it as it crept towards the church door.\n\"It's just getting harder and harder,\" Emilie told me. \"We are increasingly finding people who have been furloughed or laid off work coming to us and saying, 'I'm so sorry. I never thought I'd see myself in this position. Can you help me?'\"\nEmilie recalls how one mother got in touch to ask for help after being put on furlough since the end of her maternity leave.\n\"She cried on her doorstep because I gave her nappies, wipes and winter clothes for her child. I went away with a lump in my throat.\"\nA report from London-based baby bank charity Little Village and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, seen first by BBC Newsnight, outlines the scale, depth and persistence of poverty in families with children aged under five across the UK.  \nIt finds one-third (34%) of these children live below the poverty line - meaning their family lives on less than 60% of the median household income in the UK.\nThat equates to 1.3 million under-fives, according to the analysis. Two in five of these families have seen a reduction in their earnings as a result of the ongoing Covid crisis.\nLondon has the worst rates of poverty in the UK for children in this age group. The North East of England runs the capital a close second, which doesn't surprise Kay - one of Emilie's regulars. \nKay moved to Hartlepool from London in search of cheaper rents and a better life for her young children. She's worked in supermarkets but is now a single parent with four children, aged between seven months and seven years old. Struggling on benefits, and after housing costs, Kay's left with around \u00a3600 for the month. \n\"That's got to pay your gas, your electric, your water, your council tax and any other bills that may pop up,\" she says. \"And your food. So within a week my money's gone. \n\"I've gone without meals, without clothes. I have one meal a day providing my children have three. It's basic chicken nuggets and chips, fish fingers and chips. The diets are really poor because the money's not there to buy fresh food, to cook fresh meals.\"\nLittle Village founder Sophia Parker, who wrote the report, says Covid had made things \"much worse\" for families who were already struggling.\n\"People have used up savings. People have gone to their families and friends and borrowed what they can,\" she says. \"As a result, we're seeing families who are falling into rent arrears. We're seeing families who are having to rely on high-cost loans.\n\"We're just very worried about where this is going to land for families that are already in a difficult situation.\"\nRachel, not her real name, is a trained nursery practitioner who spent six months in a refuge after fleeing an abusive relationship. \nShe now lives in cramped temporary accommodation with her three-year-old son and nine-month-old daughter. She is employed for a few hours a week by Little Village, but relies for now on universal credit.  \n\"When we came out of the refuge, I looked for full-time work but I couldn't make it pay because of childcare costs,\" she tells me. \"My rent is so high, after bills I'm left with \u00a310 a month for us to live on. I don't drink, smoke or buy clothes. \n\"If my son is invited to a child's birthday party, I die, as I know I have to say no. I can't afford a present. It's very embarrassing to keep asking for help. Little Village did our Christmas. Otherwise there would have been nothing under the tree. \n\"The pandemic has made things more expensive.  We're always home, so electric and gas costs more. Food shopping online costs more too. My children are my reason for everything. But I can't see a way out. I am stuck in a trap.\"\nThe government said it was committed to \"making sure every child gets the best start in life, and this is central to our steadfast determination to level up opportunity across the country\".\nA spokesman said it had targeted its support to families most in need by raising the living wage and spending hundreds of billions to safeguard jobs.\n\"Additionally, we have boosted welfare support by billions, introduced the \u00a3170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme to help children and families during the coldest months, and in April we will be increasing the value of our Healthy Start vouchers by over a third to help those in need with young children.\""

      "text": "Extra Covid tests are taking place across England and Scotland in areas where new variants have been found.\nThis is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage.\nIncreased testing and enhanced contact tracing is carried out in very specific locations - local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets.\nSome of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not have Covid symptoms.\nThe testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants.\nSurge testing is currently taking place in areas of England where the new Delta variant - first identified in India - is spreading fastest.\nEast\nNorth West\nWest Midlands\nSouth East\nSurge testing is also currently being carried out in specific and targeted locations within the following local authority areas:\nLondon\nSouth East\nNorth West\nYorkshire and the Humber\nTargeted community testing is also taking place in various health board areas across Scotland. \nScientists have identified a number of \"variants of concern\" - these are  newly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. \nAlso, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines.\nThe Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). \nThe variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming system which uses Greek letters instead. \nThe PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test \nPeople tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. \nThis involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis.\nIt is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result.\nThe lateral flow test \nThis also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes.\nWherever you are in the UK, if you have symptoms you should book a free test online. You will be sent to a testing site or have a testing kit sent to your home. \nIf you have problems booking, call 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland. \nAnyone in England can now get free lateral flow tests each week - even if they do not have symptoms. These can be ordered online, by calling 119, or can be collected from test centres and pharmacies. \nAnyone in Scotland can also order free lateral flow tests online, or collect them from test centres.\nAnyone who gets a positive result test must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. NHS Test and Trace will tell their contacts to isolate if necessary.\nSelf-isolating means not leaving home for exercise or even to buy food, medicines or other essentials.\nPeople in England who fail to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to \u00a310,000.\nAnyone on a low income who has been told to self-isolate can claim a \u00a3500 payment."

      "tags": "The Troubles,Northern Ireland Assembly",
      "text": "Stormont's Executive Office is under a legal duty to fund a pension for people badly injured in the Troubles, Northern Ireland's Court of Appeal has ruled.\nThe scheme is due to open for applications next month but it is not clear who will fund the payments.\nStormont and Westminster have been engaged in a long-running row about who is responsible.\nOn Tuesday, the Court of Appeal said it was giving the parties four weeks to find a solution.\nIt said if that was not possible the case would be relisted to include Stormont's Department of Finance as an additional notice party.\nA spokesperson for the department said Finance Minister Conor Murphy had been pressing Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis to meet him about the pension since September.\nA UK government spokesperson said Mr Lewis had \"always been clear\" that the responsibility for funding the scheme lay with the Stormont Executive.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt is understood the NI secretary has agreed to meet Stormont ministers and has asked for more detail about estimated costs and wider spending plans.\nThe pension scheme was initially approved at Westminster when devolution in Northern Ireland had collapsed.\nSince power-sharing returned in January 2020, estimates from Stormont for the cost of the scheme have been suggested to run to as high as \u00a3800m.\nThe executive argues that Westminster should help fund it, as it is a UK-wide scheme and people injured outside Northern Ireland will be able to apply.\nLast year, a judge ruled that the Executive Office was acting unlawfully in delaying Troubles pensions, following a legal challenge from some victims.\nTuesday's appeal was brought by Brian Turley, one of those known as the Hooded Men, who were detained and subjected to special interrogation methods by the British military in the early-1970s.\nIn the ruling, Northern Ireland's Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan said there was a legal duty on the Executive Office regarding the funding, to ensure payments could be made.\nHe backed submissions that there is no discretion involved but said the court expressed \"no view\" on the political dispute between the Stormont Executive and Northern Ireland Office.\nSpeaking after the hearing, Mr Turley said the judgement confirmed there were \"no justifiable reasons\" for delaying the payments to victims.\n\"The need to keep taking cases to court to obtain what I am entitled to is another form of torture,\" he said.\nAlan McBride from Wave Trauma Centre told BBC Newsline that he was \"disappointed\" that it had been left to the courts system to make progress with the scheme.\n\"It is up now to the executive and Northern Ireland Office to sit down around the table like mature adults and sort this out once and for all.\"\nDUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster said the ruling was \"reassuring\" for victims and that she looked forward to payments being issued.\n\"Whilst the payments will be made from the Northern Ireland Executive, there is a strong argument that the government should be increasing the NI budget accordingly to fund the pension,\" she added.\nSinn F\u00e9in's Linda Dillon said her party was committed to ensuring payments were made as quickly as possible, but insisted the executive alone does not have the resources to deliver it.\nStormont's Justice Minister Naomi Long said she hoped Stormont and Westminster could agree a resolution.\nChair of Stormont's Executive Office Committee, the SDLP's Colin McGrath said it was \"welcome\" that a four-week deadline had been set.\n\"While the British government clearly must meet their financial commitments to this scheme, the public row between the Secretary of State and Finance Minister is unedifying and also serves to re-traumatise victims and survivors,\" he said.\nUlster Unionist assembly member (MLA) Doug Beattie described the ruling as the \"latest abject failure\" in supporting the needs of Troubles victims.\n\"The Executive Office has not only a moral obligation but now a legal one to provide the funding to this scheme and end the uncertainty for those who have spent years suffering as a result of injuries caused by no fault of their own,\" he said.\nThe scheme is due to run for two or three decades and payments are to be backdated to 2014, the year in which it was first agreed.\nLast August, Stormont's Department of Justice was designated to administer the scheme.\nBut in January, the Department of Finance did not set aside funding for payments in the draft budget for 2021-22, only the administrative cost of the pension.\nThe legislation came on to the statute book in January 2020. To qualify, applicants must have an injury which is severe and permanent and caused by no fault of their own.\nThat can be physical injury, such as a loss of limbs, or psychological, caused by being present at a bombing, for example.\nThe scheme covers violence related to the Northern Ireland Troubles between 1966 and 2010, including incidents in Great Britain and Europe.\nNon-UK residents injured outside the UK cannot apply - such as victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings carried out by loyalists in 1974.\nPeople will get between \u00a32,000 and \u00a310,000 a year for the rest of their lives.\nUpon their death, a spouse or carer, will get the payments for a further 10 years.\nThe scheme is a recognition that criminal injuries awards from decades ago were largely inadequate."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "News the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has only a limited effect against the South African variant of coronavirus has caused understandable concern.\nIt is the vaccine many people in the UK are being given.\nAnd the news comes just days after scientists warned the variant may be circulating in this country.\nBut what actually is the significance of this? \nViruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising.  In fact, it can be expected to continue.\nAs more people build up immunity - either through vaccination or exposure to the virus - there is going to be selection pressure on the virus, favouring changes that allow it to escape human defences. \nThe changes seen in South Africa are an example of this. And it means all the vaccines produced so far are likely to work less well against this variant.\nSome of the trials for the Novavax and Janssen vaccines, which reported last month, were in South Africa when the variant was circulating widely.\nThey showed the vaccines worked less well against it than other versions of the virus. Although, they were still about 60% effective at stopping people developing symptoms.\nWhat has caused particular concern with these Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine results, however, is the vaccine appeared to have just a \"minimal\" impact, maybe only around 22%.\nThe finding is based on a small study, involving fewer than 2,000 people, with an average age of just over 30. \nSo there can be only limited confidence in it. But it clearly raises very real questions. \nHowever, there is hope the vaccine would still be very effective at preventing serious illness and hospital admissions.\nThe most important thing to remember is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine remains highly effective against the type of virus dominant in the UK. \nAnd the same is true for the other vaccine being used in the UK, produced by Pfizer-BioNTech.\nThere have been fewer than 150 cases of the South African variant detected in the UK.  \nAdmittedly, there are bound to be more out there - only 5-10% of positive cases are checked for mutations as requires extensive lab work and so cannot be done for every case.\nBut there are no signs it is widespread and extra testing has been ordered in the places where there are signs the variant may be spreading to try to contain it.\nProf Jonathan Van Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, believes this will be effective in the short-term, mainly because the South African variant does not have an advantage over the more transmissible UK variant at the moment.\nThe developments once again illustrate the pandemic is not going to end with a big bang. It is going to be incremental.  \nThe key mutation in the South African variant that helps it evade immunity - E484 - has already been replicated in the virus circulating in the UK. \nBut there is nothing to suggest this is anything more than a few isolated cases - it has been detected in Liverpool and Bristol.\nNonetheless it is a strong signal this is the route the virus will go down as immunity builds in the population. \nThe good news is that it is relatively easy to tweak the vaccines to make them more effectiv.\nLast week, the Oxford-AstraZeneca team said if necessary it could be ready for the rollout of a new vaccine in a matter of months.\nThe idea would be to offer repeat, booster vaccinations much as we do each year for the flu.\nUnderstandably, questions are now being asked about what this means for lockdown and restrictions.\nSome say tough restrictions need to continue because of the threat of mutations. \nBut UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has always been clear we ultimately have to learn to live with the virus.\nIt will remain a \"residual threat\" for quite some time, he says, arguing the goal is to \"de-risk\" it to the point where the level of serious illness and death becomes tolerable and the pressure on the NHS is eased. \nSo, given the vaccines remain highly effective against the dominant form of virus circulating in the UK, the opportunity for a major relaxation of the rules should still present itself. \nThe significance of the latest news may be less than the scary headlines suggest."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Fully jabbed travellers arriving in the UK from France have to quarantine, because of the Beta variant. \nThe government is concerned jabs may not work as well against the variant. \nFrench authorities say most cases are from the overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte, rather than mainland France.\nBeta, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, has some significant genetic changes that experts are studying. It was first identified in South Africa.\nAll viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into new versions or variants.\nThese tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive. \nMost are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some variants can make the virus more infectious or threatening to the host - humans. \nSome of the changes Beta has undergone involve the virus's spike protein - the part that gains the virus entry into human cells. It is also the bit that vaccines are designed around, which is why experts are concerned about these particular mutations.\nBeta, along with a few other variants of coronavirus, such as Delta and Alpha, have been labelled \"variants of concern\". These have some worrying changes experts want to keep a very close eye on.\nBeta carries a mutation, called N501Y, which appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. \nAnother mutation, called E484K, could help the virus dodge a person's immune system, and may affect how well vaccines work. \nThere is no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people.\nAs with the original version, the risk is still highest for elderly people and those with significant underlying health conditions.\nVaccines are designed around original Covid, rather than new variants. \nThere is some evidence they are less effective at stopping Beta infections.\nBut experts say they should still work to stop severe illness. \nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to provide a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary.\nA trial of a new version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, designed against Beta, has begun in the UK.\nSome of the other Covid vaccines are also being updated. \nThe Beta variant has been identified in more than 50 countries around the world. \nSo far, the UK has recorded just over 1,000 cases of Beta. That's a tiny fraction of all Covid cases. Another variant, called Delta, currently makes up more than 99% of Covid seen in the UK. \nSouth Africa has reported higher cases of Beta.\nWhen it was first identified in the UK, the government recommended surge testing in the community in some regions to help stop the spread. \nA system of foreign travel restrictions has also been introduced to minimise the chance of UK travellers spreading Beta as well as other variants of concern. \nAlthough adults who were fully jabbed in the UK now no longer need to quarantine on return from amber list countries, double vaccinated travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to self-isolate for ten days. \nThey will also have to take two PCR tests to ensure they are not infectious. \nUK scientists are tracking variants, including Beta, to learn more and are providing genomic sequencing help to other countries so that they can do the same.

      "text": "Extra hours of academic learning - as well as sport, music and drama - will be needed to help England's pupils make up ground following the pandemic, the new education catch-up tsar says.\nSir Kevan Collins told the BBC it was important to \"act quickly\" on making arrangements for the summer and he said that summer schools \"had promise\".\nSir Kevan said the most disadvantaged had lost up to seven months' progress.\nBut he also stressed that children were \"amazingly resilient\".\nIn his first media interview, he said the youngest children would \"need to learn to play together\" and to develop the language and social skills needed for school life.\nThe government is considering options including shorter summer holidays, summer schools and extended school days, with initial catch-up plans due to be announced in late February.\nAs well as lost learning, the mental health of children has been one of the major concerns of the Covid-19 pandemic, Sir Kevan says.\nHe says the response must not just be about adding extra hours of study, but that children's broader needs must be taken into account.\n\"I think we need to think about the extra hours not only for learning, but for children to be together, to play, to engage in competitive sport, for music, for drama because these are critical areas which have been missed in their development.\"\nBut he stressed that \"we're going to have to ask teachers to increase learning time for children\"  and to go back over earlier content children might have missed. \n\"If you're going to secondary school in the next couple of years, it's vital you're reading at the level you will need.  \n\"We need to step in to support children in some of these critical areas of learning.\"\nSir Kevan told the BBC it was not for him to tell schools what to do and he said trusting teachers would be at the heart of his approach.\nHis first task will be to oversee the existing \u00a31.3bn catch up programme in England's schools, including the national tutoring programme.\nNajeem, a Year 10 pupil from the City of Leicester College, is receiving some extra tuition from one of the companies approved for the programme, My Tutor.\nNajeem's school is in an area of Leicester which has been badly effected by Covid-19.\nThe whole city spent extra time in lockdown last year and some pupils had to self-isolate several times on top of that.\n\"I'm really happy that I have tuition, especially because I can freely ask questions that I need help or I'm struggling with - it's really helped me a lot.\n\"In maths I was struggling on a few questions. I asked my tutor if she could help and now I'm doing good on it.\"\nHis father, Najibullah, is pleased with the tutoring as a short term solution.\n\"Tutoring has boosted his confidence and he is a lot better and feels a lot freer to ask questions.\"\nBut he says a longer plan is also needed.\n\"They have missed not only on education but also on social interaction and how to become resilient - they are definitely need a long term plan - one year out of education can affect ten years.\"\nNajeem's tutor, Annabelle Hondier says it can be very challenging for children to keep up with schoolwork if they are on their own at home.\n\"I've noticed that a lot of them are really, really keen to make progress in their learning and to catch up.\"\nHarriet Hurdley-Lees, assistant head teacher at the school, which has 1,700 pupils aged 11 to 18, wants to see long-term thinking, with schools able to make their own decisions.\n\"To have any extra forced onto the school, rather than us choosing what we want, the things we think will help our particular cohort, would not be helpful.\"\nThe impact of the pandemic will be rippling through schools for years to come. \nIt is likely for example that the content of GCSEs in 2022 will have to be slimmed down to match what teenagers have actually been able to learn, Sir Kevan says.\nHe agrees a long term plan is needed, but says the pandemic has also shown how well schools have embraced innovation.\nTechnology would continue to have a greater role in education, he added.\nSir Kevan was, until recently head of the Education Endowment Foundation, which examines evidence for what works in education."

      "text": "Travellers having to stay in quarantine hotels in England will be charged \u00a31,750 for their stay, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced.\nThe measures, which come into force on Monday, apply to UK and Irish residents returning from 33 red list countries.\nThose who fail to quarantine in a government-sanctioned hotel for 10 days face fines of up to \u00a310,000.\nMeanwhile, all travellers arriving into Scotland from abroad by air will have to go into quarantine hotels. \nPeople travelling from red list countries to Wales and Northern Ireland will be required to book and pay for quarantine in England, as neither destination currently has any direct international flights.\nTravellers arriving into England who lie on their passenger locator forms about visiting a red list country face a fine of \u00a310,000 or up to 10 years in jail.\nIt comes as the UK reported another 12,364 confirmed cases of coronavirus and a further 1,052 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - bringing that total to 113,850. More than 12.6 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine.\nDelivering a statement in the Commons, Mr Hancock said 16 hotels have been contracted for the programme, with 4,600 rooms secured.\nThe health secretary also confirmed a new \"enhanced testing\" regime for all travellers arriving into the UK would begin on Monday, with two tests required during the quarantine process.\nThey will be required to get a test on days two and eight of their 10-day quarantine period, whether they are isolating at home or in a hotel. The tests, conducted by NHS Test and Trace, will cost travellers \u00a3210.\n\"People who flout these rules are putting us all at risk,\" the health secretary told MPs.\nAirlines and travel companies will be legally required to make sure travellers have signed up for the new measures before they depart, with fines for companies and passengers if they fail to comply, he said.\nThe penalties include a \u00a31,000 fine for travellers who fail to take mandatory tests and a \u00a32,000 fine for failing to take the second mandatory test - along with a 14-day extension to quarantine.\nFailing to quarantine in a designated hotel carries a fine of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000.\nAsked when the travel rules would be relaxed, Mr Hancock said: \"We want to exit from this into a system of safe international travel as soon as practicable and as soon as is safe.\"\nPassengers required to stay in a quarantine hotel will need to reserve a room online in advance using a booking system that opens on Thursday.\nThe \u00a31,750 fee for an individual includes the hotel, the cost of transport and testing. The additional rate for one extra adult or a child aged over 12 is \u00a3650, and for a child aged five to 12 it is \u00a3325.\nThese travellers will only be allowed to enter the UK through a \"small number of ports that currently account for the vast majority of passenger arrivals\", Mr Hancock added.\nResponding to Mr Hancock's statement, Labour's shadow health secretary said the public wanted the government to \"go further\" on border quarantine measures.\nJonathan Ashworth told the Commons: \"Our first line of defence is surely to do everything we can to stop (new variants) arising in the first place. That means securing our borders to isolate new variants as they come in. \n\"He's announced a detailed package today but he hasn't announced comprehensive quarantine controls at the borders.\"\nMr Hancock later said the red list was kept \"under review\". \nAnnouncing Scotland's tougher measures, which apply to arrivals from all countries, Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the \"targeted, reactive approach\" of the UK government was \"no longer sufficient\" to deal with the threat from coronavirus.\nWelsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said he also wanted to see \"a stronger set of defences at our borders\" and said the UK government's measures were \"the bare minimum of what needs to be done\".\nEnforcement fines and prison sentences over quarantine breaches are still \"under review\" in Wales. A Welsh government spokesperson also said the country was working to determine when it will need its own quarantine hotels, if the red list expands or if international flights resume. \nAlthough the 4,600 rooms secured so far in England would only allow for around one Boeing 747's worth of passengers per day, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said discussions were under way to add more capacity. \nShe told BBC Radio 4's World at One that separate security teams contracted by the government would be responsible for enforcing the quarantine, while hotel staff focused on giving people the \"best possible experience in what are very difficult circumstances\".\nThe \u00a31,750 fee includes three meals, tea, coffee and water, Ms Nicholls said, but other items will be available at an extra cost through room service.\nTravellers arriving in the UK - whether by boat, train or plane - are already required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry.\nThis test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling, and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to \u00a3500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks.\nThey must also provide contact details and their UK address. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to the place where they plan to self-isolate. \nAll travellers - including British nationals - must self-isolate for 10 days when they get to the UK.\nThe \"test to release scheme\" - where travellers from non-red list countries can leave home isolation after a negative test on day five - will remain under the new testing rules.\nPassengers will be expected to use the gold-standard and more expensive PCR tests.\nLockdown rules mean people must only travel abroad for essential reasons. These are the same as the \"reasonable excuses\" for domestic travel, including:\nPeople leaving England will soon have to make a declaration on why they need to travel, which will be checked by carriers prior to departure.\nThe new measures come after England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, warned it was too soon to say to what extent people could begin to start planning summer holidays.\nSpeaking at Monday's Downing Street coronavirus briefing, he said: \"The more elaborate your plans are for summer holidays, in terms of crossing borders, in terms of household mixing, given where we are now, I think we just have to say the more you are stepping into making guesses about the unknown at this point,\" he said.\n\"I can't give people a proper answer at this point because we don't yet have the data. It is just too early to say.\"\nAfter the announcement of the travel rules, aimed at preventing the spread of new variants of coronavirus, government advisers designated another \"variant of concern\" - a version of the virus which was revealed last week to have been found in Bristol.\nIt's not surprising that officials are adding this new version of coronavirus to their \"variants of concern\" list. \nTargeted testing is already under way to spot any new cases linked to the 21 that have already been found, mostly in the south west of England.\nThis new incarnation of the virus is the Kent variant \"plus\". It has the same N501Y mutation as the one that triggered lockdown - a genetic change that scientists say lets the virus spread more easily. But it also has an extra mutation called E484K.\nE484K is what experts are worried about for vaccine efficacy. It is also seen in the South Africa and Brazil variants of concern. \nA cluster of another variant in Liverpool is different again. It has got the E484K mutation but is an iteration of an earlier version of the pandemic virus rather than the Kent one.\nInevitably, more variants will continue to emerge. The challenge is to make sure vaccines are a good match to keep us ahead in this race against the virus. \nHave you recently travelled into the UK? What was your experience at the UK border?"

      "text": "The government has been hit by a backbench rebellion over plans to ensure Britain's future trade partners are not committing genocide. \nMPs backed a government proposal to give select committees a greater role in examining allegations of genocide. \nBut a number of Tory MPs rebelled and the government saw its working majority of about 80 slashed to just 15. \nThose pressing the UK to take a tougher stance on human rights abuses in China have vowed to carry on the fight. \nA total of 31 Conservative MPs voted against the government on Tuesday, several accusing ministers of playing \"appalling\" parliamentary games to avoid defeat.\nMPs were expecting to vote on a plan to give British courts the right to decide if a country is committing genocide. \nBut the government, which opposed the plan, used a procedure to prevent a vote and instead backed a separate move giving Parliament greater say.\nThis passed by 318 votes to 303 but peers will seek to overturn this and re-insert a clause empowering British courts into the Trade Bill when it returns to the House of Lords later this month. \nThe government was heavily defeated on the issue in the Lords last month and independent peer Lord Alton has said he will resurrect his amendment in the hope MPs will get the chance to vote on it.\n\"Denying them that right makes a mockery of democracy,\" he said.\nMPs were prevented from having their say on it on Tuesday after ministers used a parliamentary procedure to lump it together with a Labour proposal which required ministers to determine whether a prospective trade partner has committed crimes against humanity.\nDowning Street argues it's \"common practice\" to package certain amendments together during parliamentary ping-pong but developments have undoubtedly provoked anger on the Conservative backbenches. \nSome MPs view what's happened as pure \"parliamentary chicanery\" on what is a very important and emotive issue. \nAnd, looking to the longer term, there are claims that the episode has \"hardened\" attitudes against the government, a government, it's said, that had been getting \"very twitchy\" on the numbers following a big whipping operation. \nAnother backbencher described that operation as \"heavy, full-on stuff\" and an exercise which had revealed the extent of a potentially \"stonking\" rebellion. \nWhat's more, it appeared that some newer MPs were gearing up to rebel for the first time. That is a habit any government doesn't want its backbenchers to get into. \nA number of Conservative MPs criticised the government's tactics, Nusrat Ghani saying \"she was appalled at the parliamentary games being played over such a grave issue\".\nThe UK, she said, should not be \"using its newfound post-Brexit freedoms to trade with states which commit and profit from genocide...Britain is better than that\".\nTrade Minister Greg Hands said a committee could trigger a Commons debate and vote if it decided there were \"credible reports\" that genocide had been committed by a state with which the UK was negotiating a trade deal. \n\"This approach rightly puts Parliament, not the courts, in the driving seat on the issue of who generates a debate in Parliament,\" he told MPs.\nBut former Conservative leader Sir Ian Duncan Smith said there was a reason why matters of huge public importance, such as public inquiries into tragedies and scandals, were overseen by judges.\n\"I have my own differences with judges but when we need an impartial taking of evidence and a judgement, we turn not to select committees but judges. Why do we do that?\n\"One, because we assume they are impartial. Two because they are trained to take evidence and deal with evidence. We are not here.\"\nAnd Labour's Emily Thornberry accused the government of \"shameful, shabby and shifty\" behaviour.\nCampaigners want British courts to hear genocide cases so that persecuted minorities, such as the Uighurs in Xinjiang, China, can have their situation considered by a court of law.\nA legal opinion by senior barristers at Essex Court Chambers has already concluded there was a \"very credible case\" that the Chinese government was committing genocide against the Uighurs."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

      "text": "Police in Myanmar have fired rubber bullets during a demonstration in the capital Nay Pyi Taw, as thousands defied a ban on protests.\nWater cannon and tear gas have also been used against protesters, and one woman is in hospital with a critical head injury.\nNews agencies quoted doctors as saying they had seen wounds from live bullets.\nProtesters are standing against a military coup that removed the elected government last week.\nA ban on large public gatherings and night-time curfews has been instigated in some cities, with military leader Min Aung Hlaing warning that no-one is above the law.\nThe demonstrators are demanding the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, along with senior leaders of her National League for Democracy Party (NLD). She was arrested when the military seized power and declared a year-long state of emergency on 1 February.\nTuesday was the fourth consecutive day of protests. In the evening, the NLD said its party headquarters in Yangon had been \"raided and destroyed\" by the military.\nIn its first acknowledgement of the protests, Myanmar's state TV said police had also been injured while trying to disperse \"aggressive\" protesters. It said a police truck was destroyed in the city of Mandalay.\nYangon resident Nelly, 18, (not her real name), described the scenes outside her house as \"total chaos\". \n\"My biggest fear is our safety, because there are lots of people on the roads protesting but there is also a lot of violence from police officers. We don't know when we'll be shot at or when they will arrest us,\" she told BBC Outside Source on World Service radio. \nEarlier on Tuesday, police began using water cannon against protesters in Nay Pyi Taw - but the crowd refused to retreat.\n\"End the military dictatorship,\" people yelled. Some threw projectiles at police, witnesses said.\nWarning shots were eventually fired into the air, before rubber bullets were fired at protesters. \nAccording to BBC Burmese, who spoke to an unnamed medical officer from a Nay Pyi Taw hospital, one woman suffered a serious head injury and another demonstrator had chest injuries. It is not yet clear how exactly they were wounded.\nReuters news agency spoke with a doctor who said X-rays indicated live ammunition had been used against the woman.\nAFP also quoted an emergency room doctor who believed the military was using live rounds, citing injuries to a 23-year-old man and a 19-year-old.\n\"We believe they are actual bullets because of the wounds and their injuries,\" the doctor said. \nOn social media, footage and photographs were widely circulated which purported to show the critically injured woman being shot. The footage showed a woman in a motorbike helmet collapsing. Pictures showed what appeared to be a blood-stained helmet. The BBC has not verified this.\nThe United Nations voiced \"strong concern\" over Tuesday's bloodshed. \"The use of disproportionate force against demonstrators is unacceptable,\" said Ola Almgren, the UN resident co-ordinator and humanitarian coordinator in Myanmar, also known as Burma.\nThere have been numerous unconfirmed reports of police officers crossing over to join protesters. In some areas, police also allowed demonstrators through their barricades. \nPrevious protests against the country's decades-long military rule, in 1988 and 2007, saw demonstrators killed.\nNyein Chan Aye, BBC Burmese, Yangon\nThe regime's warnings drew bigger crowds in Yangon on Tuesday - estimated at more than 100,000 people. \nDemonstrators gathered early and were joined by celebrities. \n\"Police are for the people\" and \"Soldiers are not supposed to kill civilians\", chanted protesters.\nThe biggest crowds were near Yangon University and in the city centre, which have become meeting points for demonstrators. Authorities blocked the intersection of Hledan Junction and University Avenue with water cannon, and clashes nearly broke out between students and police. \nPeople in Yangon are angry that security forces used rubber bullets and injured a number of people in Nay Pyi Taw. But protesters peacefully headed home as night curfews began. \nThe military, on the other hand, appears to have used the curfew to raid NLD HQs in Yangon on Tuesday. Locals who witnessed the raids and a member of the NLD told BBC Burmese that security forces broke down doors by force. No NLD members were present in the building.\n\"We come here well aware of the ban over gatherings of more than five people,\" one young male protester in Yangon told BBC Burmese.\n\"However, we come out because we have to protest until the president and Mother Suu are freed,\" he added, referring to leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has not been heard from since being placed under house arrest.  \nA female protester, who also did not want to be named, said: \"Young people have their future, so we can't tolerate this... We will keep on fighting until we get our president and Mother Suu back, whatever it takes.\" \nShe said young protesters wanted to avoid confrontations with military.\nEven though Ms Suu Kyi's record on human rights has previously been criticised internationally, she remains very popular in the country. Her win in the 2020 election was confirmed by various overseas monitoring bodies. \nOn Monday, Gen Min Aung Hlaing gave his first televised address since the coup. He insisted the seizure of power was justified due to \"voter fraud\", accusing the electoral commission of failing to investigate irregularities over voter lists in November's election.\nThe commission had said there was no evidence to support claims of widespread fraud. \nMs Suu Kyi and various senior leaders from the NLD, including President Win Myint, were detained on 1 February. \nGen Min Aung Hlaing promised new elections overseen by a new \"reformed\" election commission, and said the military would hand power to the winner.\nHe also said his rule would be \"different\" from what was effectively a 49-year military grip on power that ended in 2011.\nHe spoke of achieving a \"true and disciplined democracy\", a phrase that drew scorn from some opponents of the coup on social media.\nOn Tuesday, New Zealand announced that it would be suspending all high-level contact with Myanmar and imposing a travel ban on its military leaders. \nIt was the first major international move to isolate Myanmar's military since it took power.\nThe US also called for freedom of expression to be upheld. \"We strongly condemn violence against demonstrators,\" a spokesman for the state department said."

      "tags": "Mars,United Arab Emirates,Space exploration",
      "text": "History beckons for the United Arab Emirates as it seeks on Tuesday to place a probe around Mars.\nThe Hope spacecraft, launched from Earth seven months ago, is about to reach the decisive moment in its long journey - orbit insertion.\nCurrently moving at over 120,000km/h (75,000mph), it must fire its braking engines for 27 minutes to be sure of being captured by the planet's gravity. \nSuccess would enable Hope to begin its mission to study Mars' climate.\n\"We're entering a very critical phase,\" said project director, Omran Sharaf. \"It's a phase that basically defines whether we reach Mars, or not; and whether we'll be able to conduct our science, or not.\n\"If we go too slow, we crash on Mars; if we go too fast, we skip Mars,\" he told BBC News.\nHope is the first of three missions to arrive at the Red Planet this month. On Wednesday, the Chinese Tianwen-1 orbiter will also try to make it into orbit, while the Americans turn up on the 18th with another big rover.\nFor Hope, everything rides on Tuesday's orbit insertion manoeuvre. In the past couple of months, engineers have trimmed the spacecraft's trajectory so that it reaches the planet at precisely the right moment in space and time to begin the braking burn.\nMission control at the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Center (MBRSC) in Dubai will have some data streaming back on the performance of Hope's thrusters, but there is nothing anyone can do to intervene if something goes awry.\nMars and Earth are presently separated by 190 million km, meaning it would take a radio command fully 11 minutes to reach the probe - too long to make a difference. Hope must rely on autonomy to complete the manoeuvre.\n\"It's definitely going to be nerve-racking; just thinking about it gives me goose-bumps,\" said propulsion engineer Ayesha Sharafi. \"But we do have a fault-protection system in place that can compensate for any problems that might happen during the burn, so I think we're in a good position for Mars obit insertion to happen successfully.\"\nThe confirmation signal that the braking burn has started should be received at Earth just after 19:40 Gulf Standard Time (15:40 GMT). This will come through the US space agency's (Nasa) Deep Space Network of radio dishes.\nHope carries roughly 800 kilos of fuel. About half this mass will be consumed by the six thrusters involved in the 27-minute-long manoeuvre.\nShortly after the engines shut down, the spacecraft will disappear behind Mars as its trajectory bends into the planned initial orbit. Once again, there will be an anxious wait at the MBRSC while the team hangs on Nasa's dish network re-acquiring Hope's signal.\nIf Tuesday's efforts are successful they will be rewarded with some fascinating science in the months ahead. \nHope can be described as a kind of weather or climate satellite for Mars.\nMore specifically, it's going to study how energy moves through the atmosphere - from bottom to top, at all times of day, and through all the seasons of the year.\nIt will track features such as lofted dust which on Mars hugely influences the temperature of the atmosphere.\nIt will also look at what's happening with the behaviour of neutral atoms of hydrogen and oxygen right at the top of the atmosphere. There's a suspicion these atoms play a significant role in the ongoing erosion of Mars' atmosphere by the energetic particles that stream away from the Sun.\nThis plays into the story of why the planet is now missing most of the water it clearly had early in its history.\nTo gather its observations, Hope will take up a near-equatorial orbit that stands off from the planet at a distance of 22,000km to 44,000km.\nThis means we will get spectacular images of the whole of the Red Planet on a routine basis.\n\"Any image we got of Mars would be iconic but I just can't imagine what it's going to feel like to get that first full-disk image of Mars, once we're in orbit,\" said Sarah Al Amiri, the Emirati minister of state for advanced technology and chair of the UAE Space Agency. \n\"And for me also, it's getting that science data down and having our science team start analysing it and finding artefacts that haven't been discovered before.\"\nThe excitement across the nation is palpable. Buildings are being lit up in red. The UAE is banking on this mission being an inspiration to its youth and Arab youth in general to take up STEM subjects in school and at higher education levels.\nThe mission was initiated six years ago to come to fruition at the time of the UAE's golden jubilee (The federation was founded on 2 December 1971). Having only recently started (2009) flying satellites at Earth, the nation didn't have the full skill-set to mount an interplanetary mission.\nThe Emiratis therefore approached a number of US research institutions to engage them in a mentoring role. The American institutions include the University of Colorado at Boulder; Arizona State University; and the University of California, Berkeley.\n\"It's been fun on a personal level, it's been fun on a technical level, and seeing everybody's personal abilities grow has been tremendously fulfilling,\" said Pete Withnell, the Hope programme manager at Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics.\n\"There are now personal friendships that will go forward long after this mission.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Pfizer,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Dido Harding,Apps,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The NHS Covid-19 app has told 1.7 million people in England and Wales to self-isolate to date.\nHealth ministers have also revealed they believe it has prevented about 600,000 cases of the disease.\nIn a further disclosure, internal data indicates that about 16.5 million people are currently actively using its contact-tracing tool.\nThat figure is 24% below the app's latest download tally, which is the government's preferred measure.\nThe discrepancy is likely to be down to people uninstalling the app, turning off its contact-tracing capabilities, or simply failing to have activated it in the first place.\nEach handset actively taking part sends a digital \"heartbeat\" once a day to the Amazon computer server involved, allowing the current usage figure to be calculated.\nAnd while the number of total downloads has slowly grown from 20.2 million to 21.7 million over the past two months, the number of phones pinging the server has been more or less flat.\nThis represents the first detailed data released about the app's use since it was made widely available to people in England and Wales in September. \nScotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar have their own separate apps.\nBaroness Dido Harding, executive chair of the NHS Test and Trace programme, had been under pressure to release the figures for months, and the BBC unsuccessfully attempted to obtain some of the figures via a Freedom of Information request in November.\nThe intention in releasing the data now is to reassure the public that the app can save lives, and in doing so encourage more people to both install it and follow its advice ahead of lockdowns being eased.\n\"People who are not following the app's instructions are risking themselves and their colleagues and their families,\" Baroness Harding told the BBC.\n\"The more you follow the instructions of the app, the fewer outbreaks you'll have in your workplace and the safer it will be.\"\nA spokeswoman added that these instructions include circumstances in which it is recommended to pause the contact-tracing function.\nThe app uses Bluetooth logs to retrospectively warn users if they were at high risk of contagion from someone infected with the virus, who was recently in their vicinity.\nAlerts can be served within 15 minutes of an infected person approving use of their positive test result. But the system's decentralised nature means neither the person who triggered the warning, nor the authorities, can identify who receives the notifications.\nSome anonymised data is, however, collected. \nFor the first time, it has been revealed that:\nScientists from The Alan Turing Institute and Oxford University worked to provide further analysis of the app's impact\nThey estimate that 594,000 cases have been averted because of the technology.\nAnd they forecast that for every additional 1% of the population that uses the app, the number of Covid cases should fall by 2.3%.\nThe academics have benefited from the fact that the app was retooled in October to take account of the tier system introduced at the time in England, which operated on a local authority basis.\nThis allowed anonymised usage data to be compared between two neighbouring council areas where the spread of the pandemic was similar, but uptake of the app differed.\nThe researchers took account of other factors - including poverty levels - to calculate the degree to which suppression of the virus's spread could be linked to the app.\nHowever, they acknowledge that they cannot be certain that usage of the app caused all of the effects being attributed to it. And while they are publishing their work, it has yet to be peer-reviewed.\nEven so, the firm involved in developing the app said confidence was growing that it is indeed making a difference. \n\"The data suggests that we have made a dent in the overall infection rate,\" Wolfgang Emmerich, chief executive of Zuhlke UK, told the BBC.\n\"What we really have to do now, particularly as we're preparing to come out of lockdown, is to drive that adoption rate back up and to get people to switch [the app] back on again.\"\nMr Emmerich also revealed that his team had put plans to extend the app to older iPhone models on the back burner, in order to prioritise other new features, but declined to say what they are.\nSoon after the NHS Covid-19 app was launched last September, we learned one important piece of data - that over 20 million people had downloaded it. \nThat was a pretty good result compared with take-up of similar apps elsewhere, but what we didn't know until now was something far more important - did it work? \nNow these figures do appear to show that plenty of people have been pinged by the app and sent into isolation. \nMore impressively, research appears to show that in areas where take-up of the app was high, the infection spread more slowly than in places where it was lower. \nBut other scientists will want to drill down for themselves into whether other factors were at play in the link between high take-up and low infection rates. \nPlus the private nature of the app means there are some key questions that can't be answered:\nStill, using a Bluetooth app to trace people who might be infected with Covid-19 was always an experiment with an untested technology.\nAnd the scientists who have been working on this project for many months now feel they've proved that it has made a significant contribution to the fight against the virus."

People can choose a time slot and location for their appointment. \nSo far: \nHealth and social care workers, who are also among the top four priority groups for vaccination, should speak to their employer about arranging their jab if they have not yet had one.\nDr Nikki Kanani, a GP and medical director for primary care at NHS England, said: \"If you are aged 70 and over, and haven't yet received your vaccine, please come forward and make an appointment as soon as you can. \n\"The vaccine is safe, simple, and will offer you and those around you crucial protection against this virus.\"\nIt comes as: "

      "tags": "Tourism,Travel,Coronavirus testing,Travel & leisure industry,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All UK travel corridors, which allow arrivals from some countries to avoid having to quarantine, have now closed.\nTravellers arriving in the UK, whether by boat, train or plane, also have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry.\nThe test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to \u00a3500.\nAll passengers will still be required to quarantine for up to 10 days.\nThe isolation period can be cut short with a negative test after five days in England, but it does not apply in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.\nThe government has said the travel corridor closure will be in force until at least 15 February.\nUnder the new rules, travellers arriving from the Falklands, St Helena and Ascension Islands are exempt. \nThose arriving from some Caribbean islands are exempt until 04:00 GMT on Thursday 21 January.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC'S Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that Public Health England would be stepping up checks on travellers who must self-isolate.\nHe said enforcement checks at borders would also be \"ramped up\" and added that asking all arrivals to self-isolate in hotels was a \"potential measure\" the government was keeping under review.\nPassengers arriving into London's Heathrow airport on Monday said they had been met with \"substantial\" queues at passport control and one couple complained they had \"felt unsafe\" due to what they described as poor social distancing.\nAndy Hart, from London, who had arrived into the UK from Nairobi, said: \"We felt that even though everyone was masked they were far too close together.\n\"It took an hour and 10 minutes. I've been flying 30 times a year for 20 years. I mean, once or twice have I ever seen it [airport queues] like this. How can this happen during Covid times?\"\nMeanwhile on Sunday, the government announced that a financial support scheme for airports in England would open this month in response to the new travel curbs.\nAviation minister Robert Courts said the aim was to provide grants of up to \u00a38m per applicant by the end of this financial year. The scheme was first announced in November but without a start date.\nIndustry groups have warned there was only so long airports could \"run on fumes\", following the announcement of the new quarantine rules.\nEasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the closure of the travel corridors will not have a \"significant impact\" on his airline in the short term as flight numbers were already limited due to the pandemic.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the minimum number of days arrivals must wait to take a negative test releasing them from quarantine could be reduced from five days to three days.\nKaren Dee, chief executive of trade body the Airport Operators Association, said she supported the decision to close the travel corridors but stressed the need for \"a clear pathway out\".\nA ban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde also came into force on Friday, having been imposed over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil.\nNew variants causing concern have previously been identified in the UK and South Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations.\nScientists fear the variants seen in South Africa and Brazil may interfere with the effectiveness of vaccines and evade parts of the immune system.\nThe travel industry has said closing the travel corridors was understandable due to the health emergency, but warned it would deepen the crisis for the sector.\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said the system had been \"a lifeline for the industry\" last summer but \"things change and there's no doubting this is a serious health emergency\". He said he assumed the government would remove the latest restrictions as soon as it was safe.\n\"We've had no revenue now effectively for 12 months, give or take a few months in the summer last year. If we're going to have an aviation sector coming out of this we need to open up in the summer,\" he told the BBC.\nThe Department for Transport has said it is supporting the travel industry with an extension to the furlough scheme until the end of April, business rates relief and tax deferrals.\nWith all parts of the UK under strict virus rules amid high levels of infection, only essential travel is permitted.\nOn Sunday, another 671 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were reported in the UK, and a further 38,598 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus.\nAre you due to travel back to the UK from overseas?

      "text": "Bitcoin has hit record highs for a second day after Elon Musk's car company Tesla said it had bought about $1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn) of the cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin rose above $48,000 (\u00a334,820) before falling back, but it remains about 25% higher than a week ago.\nSome investors took Tesla's move as a signal that Bitcoin would become a mainstream financial asset.\nHowever, there was some criticism about a green car firm investing in such an energy intensive currency.\nBitcoin currently uses more energy than Argentina every year, according to analysis from the University of Cambridge.\nProduction of the cryptocurrency, known as \"Bitcoin mining\", needs energy-hungry computer hardware and ever-greater amounts of processing power.\nMike Butcher, an editor at news website Techcrunch, tweeted: \"Tesla: Sells carbon credits to buy Bitcoin, which requires as much energy (not always Green energy) as a small country to mine.\"\nBitcoin is a form of digital money. This means it doesn't have a physical form. Instead, units of digital currency are traded over a computer network.\nIt operates over a global network with thousands upon thousands of nodes - a machine within a network like a computer or some other device - which together process and store transactions.\nExplaining its investment on Monday, Tesla said that it wanted to maximise returns on cash lying dormant in the company's accounts. It also expects to accept payment for its electric cars in Bitcoin in future. \nThe moves sparked market interest which carried on into Tuesday.\nShares of companies that provide trading platforms for Bitcoin and the technology to mine the cryptocurrency have surged in China, South Korea and Australia, and big computer chip-making firms such as SK Hynix also rose.\nThe cryptocurrency has already risen in value by 62% this year, on top of a 300% rally in 2020, as investors search for alternative assets at a time when interest rates in many countries are at record lows.\nBitcoin has had some interest from big investment firms, including Blackrock, which recently changed a handful of investment mandates to allow some of its funds to invest in the currency.\nHowever, central banks remain sceptical about the cryptocurrency. In October, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey cautioned over Bitcoin's use as a payment method, saying it lacked \"intrinsic value\" unlike cash or gold. \nSome institutional investors are also wary of the price volatility of Bitcoin.\nRobert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth, said: \"The average institutional investor is shaking their head.\n\"For these folks who are believers in cryptocurrency, [Tesla's investment] gives them another layer of support that crypto is the future.\"\nBut Bitcoin scepticism does not mean that central banks and regulators are against digital currencies per se.\nIn China in particular regulators are starting to embrace issuing their own digital currencies for everyday use."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson says he is \"very confident\" in the Covid vaccines being used in the UK, amid concerns about the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab's effectiveness against the South Africa variant.\nThe vaccines are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against serious illness, the PM said. \nA small study found the Oxford jab gave \"minimal protection\" against mild disease from the South Africa variant.\nBut scientists are confident it will protect against serious disease.\nSome 147 cases of the South Africa variant have been found in the UK.\nHowever, the Oxford vaccine has shown to provide good protection against the so-called Kent variant, which remains the dominant strain in the UK.\nThe prime minister said: \"We're very confident in all the vaccines that we're using.\n\"It's important for people to bear in mind that all of them, we think, are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against serious illness and death, which is the most important thing.\"\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, told a Downing Street briefing that initial data from Pfizer-BioNTech, Novavax and Janssen - all of whose vaccines the UK has ordered - suggested they had a \"substantial effect at reducing serious illness\".\nHe said the latest study of the Oxford vaccine in South Africa did not change his view that the Oxford vaccine would be \"rather likely\" to have an effect on severe disease.\nProf Van-Tam said headlines about the study have been \"a bit scary\" but his advice to anyone \"on the edge\" about whether they should wait to get vaccinated would be: \"Do not delay, have the vaccine that will protect you against the current threat.\"\n\"Early data\" suggested the South Africa variant did not have any advantage over the Kent variant, so it was unlikely to become dominant in the UK in the short term, he said.\n\"There is no reason to think the South Africa variant will catch up or overtake our current virus in the next few months.\"\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are currently being rolled out in the UK, where nearly 12.3 million people have been given a first dose according to the latest figures - almost one in four adults.\nAnother 14,104 confirmed cases were reported on Monday and a further 333 deaths were recorded within 28 days of a positive test, bringing the total to 112,798. But the numbers in hospital remain higher than the previous peak in April last year, at 29,326.\nMr Johnson said the vaccines \"remain a massive benefit to our country\" and he has \"no doubt that vaccines generally are going to offer a way out\".\n\"Yes we're doing everything we can to contain new variants but we're also increasingly confident that science, medicine, is gaining the upper hand over coronavirus and all its variants,\" he added.\nDr Katherine O'Brien, director of immunisation at the World Health Organization, said it was \"really plausible\" that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might still have a a \"meaningful impact\" on the South African variant, especially in preventing serious illness and death.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS would issue booster jabs against variants if necessary, and had placed a new order for 50 million doses with vaccine company CureVac.\nThe deal is intended to rapidly develop vaccines, including using the mRNA technology already deployed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, in the UK \"so we will be prepared for whatever the future might bring\", Mr Hancock said.\nApproving revised vaccines for booster shots would take \"a matter of weeks rather than a matter of months\", Prof Van-Tam added.\nMr Hancock also said the government had ordered 20 million more rapid tests so it could expand workplace testing to all businesses with more than 50 employees in sectors that are currently open.\nViruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising.\nThe mutations seen in South Africa change the part of the virus that the vaccines target.\nIt means all the vaccines that have been produced so far are likely to be affected in some way.\nTrials for Novavax and Janssen vaccines that were carried out in South Africa showed less effectiveness against this variant. Both are currently before the UK regulator.\nTherefore the news about the Oxford-AstraZeneca does not come out of the blue.\nThe fact it now only has \"minimal\" effect according to reports is concerning - the other vaccines showed effectiveness in the region of 60% against the South African variant.\nBut we should be careful about rushing to judgement. The study was small so there is only limited confidence in the findings.\nWhat is more, there is still hope the vaccine will prevent serious illness and hospitalisation.\nWhat this once again illustrates is the pandemic is not going to end with one Big Bang. Vaccines are likely to have to change to keep pace with the virus.\nProgress will be incremental. But vaccines are still the way out of this - and as things stand they remain very effective against the virus that is dominant in the UK.\nIn South Africa, where the variant - known as 501.V2 or B.1.351 - accounts for 90% of new coronavirus cases in the country, the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been put on hold awaiting further advice.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the South Africa variant is the \"single biggest risk\" in the pandemic at the moment, but added that the government was taking too long to introduce controls at the border, \"leaving a back door open at a vital stage in the battle against the virus\".\nMr Johnson said border controls could play a greater role against new variants once infection rates are further reduced in the UK.\nDr Mike Tildesley, an infectious disease expert who advises the government, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that \"it's very possible\" the South Africa variant could already be quite widespread in the UK.\nThe \"surge testing\" taking place in certain areas in England \"really needs to be effective\" to halt its spread, he said, but \"sadly we may be in a similar situation to the Kent variant\", which eventually spread across the whole country.\nAdditional surge testing is taking place in a number of areas in England where the South Africa variant has been found, including parts of Surrey, Bristol, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Walsall, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. \nOn Monday evening the Department of Health announced that surge testing would also be deployed in parts of the M14, M15 and M16 postcode areas in Manchester.\nSouth Africa's suspension of the rollout of the vaccine is only \"temporary\" at this stage and the \"context is a little bit different\" to the UK where the Kent variant is the dominant strain, he added.\nThe new study of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, involved about 2,000 people who were on average 31 years old.\nA spokesman for the pharmaceutical company said it had not yet been able to properly establish whether the jab would prevent severe disease and hospitalisation caused by the South Africa variant because those involved in the study had predominantly been young, healthy adults.\nBut the company expressed confidence the vaccine would offer protection against serious cases, because it created neutralising antibodies similar to those of other coronavirus vaccines."

      "tags": "Race and ethnicity,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Black people in England have been no more likely than white people to die of Covid-19 in the second wave of the pandemic, official data shows.\nDuring the first wave, people belonging to ethnic minorities experienced higher death rates than white people.  \nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that, for black people, this gap had closed.\nBut Bangladeshi and Pakistani people still experienced three times the risk.\nResearchers from the ONS, University of Oxford, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and University of Leicester said widespread reports that people belonging to ethnic minorities were disproportionately affected by Covid-19 may have raised awareness.\nBut for South Asian people, particularly from Bangladeshi and Pakistani backgrounds, the raised mortality rate remained \"alarming\". \nThe study used official data on 28.9 million people aged between 30 and 100 living in private households in England between the first wave (from January until the end of August 2020) and the second wave (from September to the end of December 2020).\nIn the first wave, people from a black African background had the highest age-standardised Covid-19 mortality rates - with the rate for black African men almost five times higher than the rate for white British men.\nBut in the second wave, black people were not at higher risk of dying than white people, as they had been during the first wave.\nThe researchers said this showed \"ethnic inequalities in Covid-19 mortality can be addressed\".\nHowever, South Asian people had up to about a five-times greater risk of death with coronavirus compared with white British people - ranging from a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of dying for Pakistani men to 1.6 times higher for Indian women. \nThe findings were presented in a preprint but have not been formally published yet.\nA number of different factors have been suggested for why some ethnic groups have been hit harder than others by the pandemic:\nThese factors will be different for different groups - but they also appeared to change during the pandemic. \nDuring the first wave, \"geographical factors explained a large proportion of the differences in Covid-19 mortality,\" said the team, lead by Vah\u00e9 Nafilyan at the ONS and Nazrul Islam at the University of Oxford.\nIn other words, people from minority ethnic groups were more likely to live in areas harder hit by the virus.\nBut this was not the case in the second wave - and even after they adjusted for factors like health status, income and deprivation, the risk of dying of Covid remained \"substantially higher\" for people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani backgrounds.\nThis suggested, the paper said, that \"focusing on treating underlying conditions, although important, may not be enough in reducing the inequalities in Covid-19 mortality.\" \nIt said \"a focused public health policy as well as community mobilisation and a participatory public health campaign involving community leaders may help reduce the existing and widening inequalities.\""

      "tags": "Aung San Suu Kyi,Myanmar coup ,Myanmar",
      "text": "The leader of the coup in Myanmar has made his first TV address, seeking to justify the action amid mass protests.\nMin Aung Hlaing said November's election, won in a landslide by the party of detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, had been unfair.\nThe military has begun to impose restrictions in some areas, including curfews and limits to gatherings.\nHuge protests were held on Monday for a third straight day, along with a nationwide strike, to oppose the coup.\nOne demonstrating doctor - who did not want to be named - told the BBC: \"Today, we, professionals - especially civil servant professionals such as doctors, engineers and teachers - came out to show that we are all together in this. Our objective is the same - to make the dictatorship fall.\" \nThe general's speech drew angry opposition, with images on social media showing people banging pots and pans in protest in front of television screens.\nThe military seized power last week and declared a year-long state of emergency in Myanmar, also known as Burma, with power handed over to Gen Min Aung Hlaing. \nMs Suu Kyi and senior leaders of her National League for Democracy Party (NLD), including President Win Myint, have been put under house arrest.\nThe US state department said on Monday it had tried to meet Ms Suu Kyi but its requests had been rejected. The US said it stood by the people of Myanmar in their right to assemble and protest peacefully.\nAn Australian economic adviser to Ms Suu Kyi, Sean Turnell, has also been detained and on Monday his family posted a statement on Facebook calling for his immediate release.\nGen Min Aung Hlaing's speech focused more on the reasons for the coup and less on threats to protesters.\nHe said the electoral commission had failed to investigate irregularities over voter lists in the November election and had not allowed fair campaigning.\nThe commission had said there was no evidence to support claims of widespread fraud.\nGen Min Aung Hlaing, wearing green military uniform, promised new elections and to hand power to the winner. A new \"reformed\" election commission would oversee it.\nHe also said his rule would be \"different\" from what was effectively a 49-year military grip on power that ended in 2011 and which saw brutal crackdowns in 1988 and 2007.\nHe spoke of achieving a \"true and disciplined democracy\", a phrase that drew scorn from some opponents of the coup on social media.\nHe also told citizens to \"go with the true facts and not to follow feelings of your own\".\nThe general did not issue direct threats to protesters, saying only that no-one was above the law. \nBut some areas have seen clampdowns, with parts of Yangon and second city Mandalay, along with other areas, under a 20:00 to 04:00 curfew and with gatherings limited to groups of five or less.\nEarlier, a broadcast on state TV warned \"action must be taken, according to the law... against offences that disturb, prevent and destroy state stability, public safety and the rule of law\".\nPhil Robertson, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said: \"For a military coup government that has trampled all over democracy and the rule of law, it's absurd for them to claim they have any right to 'legal action' against peaceful protesters.\"\nTens of thousands gathered on Monday in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, for the strike, with other cities such as Mandalay and Yangon also reporting significant numbers, according to BBC Burmese. The protesters include teachers, lawyers, bank officers and government workers.\nOnline there had been calls asking workers to skip work to protest. \"This is a work day, but we aren't going to work even if our salary will be cut,\" one protester, 28-year-old garment factory worker, Hnin Thazin, told news agency AFP.\nAnother protester, Hnin Hayman Soe, told the BBC she had joined the protest alongside her children, nieces and nephews. \"We can see many young people can't accept the military junta. We can even see teenagers here,\" she said. \nA few injuries have been reported, but no violence. However, a water cannon was activated in Nay Pyi Taw to disperse crowds. A video appears to show protesters rubbing their eyes and helping one another after being soaked.\nKyaw Zeyar Oo, who took the video, told the BBC two vehicles had sprayed protesters with \"no prior warning\", while \"the crowd was peacefully protesting in front of [the police]\".\nThe BBC's Nyein Chan Aye, in Yangon, says Buddhist monks, members of the minority Muslim community, top footballers and film and music stars have all been joining the anti-coup protests, which he says are expected to become more organised in the coming days.\nBy BBC Reality Check\nGen Min Aung Hlaing has referred to discrepancies in the voter rolls as justification for the coup.\nThe Myanmar army says it has uncovered more than 10 million examples of irregularities on the voter lists, including duplicate entries or individuals registered without national identification numbers.\nBut the country's election commission has rejected the claims.\nIndependent observers acknowledge there may have been mistakes on the lists, but claims of deliberate fraud have not been supported by evidence.\nThe US-based Carter Center, which had more than 40 observers visiting polling stations on election day, said voting had taken place \"without major irregularities being reported\".\nThere were safeguards to stop people voting twice, such as indelible ink on fingers. The election commission also pointed to strict Covid restrictions preventing travel, making it extremely hard to vote in multiple locations.\nThe earlier warning broadcast on state television that action would be taken against wrongdoers was the first shot across the bows from the military junta. \nIn the last outbreak of anti-military protests in 2007, the official warning was given just two days before the soldiers moved in, opening fire with live rounds and killing dozens. \nThat was a different era, with no social media, no mobile phones and little internet. This time the protests are being live-streamed on Facebook, despite an official order to local telecom companies to block it and other popular apps. \nIs the military ready to incur even greater unpopularity and use lethal firepower again to enforce its will? \nThe omens are not good. The generals who seized power appear to believe they acted correctly in deposing Aung San Suu Kyi, even warning today that it is the protesters who are threatening democracy with their \"lack of discipline\", and not the army with its coup."

      "text": "The maker of popular video game Cyberpunk 2077 has been hacked in a ransomware attack.\nCD Projekt Red said hackers had accessed its internal network, digitally scrambled some of its data servers and tried to blackmail it.\nThe perpetrators claim to have stolen source code for several of the firm's games which they said they would leak unless a payment was made.\nBut the Polish games company said it would not negotiate.\nIn a statement on Twitter, CD Projekt Red posted a copy of the ransom note which said the hackers had copied code from Cyberpunk 2077, Gwent, and Witcher 3, including an unreleased version of the latter.\n\u201cWe have also dumped all of your documents relating to accounting, administration legal, HR, investor relations and more!\u201d the note added.\n\"Dumping\" means copying the information to an external source.\n\u201cIf we will not come to an agreement, then your source codes will be sold or leaked online and your documents will be sent to our contacts in gaming journalism,\u201d read the note, giving a deadline of 48 hours.\nSource code is the human-readable version of a computer program before it is transformed for use. Releasing it could make it easier for people to write hacks for the titles or even publish their own altered versions, as well as reveal some of their development secrets.\nIn a statement, posted by the game developers on Twitter, it said it has secured its \u201cIT infrastructure and begun restoring the data\u201d from back-ups.\n\u201cWe will not give in to the demands or negotiate with the actor,\u201d it said, adding that no personal data had been compromised in the breach.\nThe company has informed law enforcement and data protection authorities, while it investigates the issue.\nThis is the latest in a series of bad news for the developers after the release of Cyberpunk 2077 was delayed several times, only for users to then experience glitches in the game.\n\"This will be frustrating for users of the game, but as consumers are generally very sympathetic when something like this happens,\" said Louise Shorthouse, senior gaming analyst at Ampere Analysis. \n\"This comes after a string of recent ransomware attacks on games companies, including Capcom and Ubisoft late last year.\n\"Fixes and updates for Cyberpunk 2077 may take a backseat for a while, as mitigating the effects of the ransomware attack becomes the priority.\"\nThis probably couldn't have come at a worse time for the embattled games studio.\nHowever, its response has been extraordinary and is already being praised by the cyber-security world. \nIn one Tweet, the company has demonstrated a new gold standard response to dealing with ransomware.\nThe company is being transparent about the attack but also says it is not negotiating with the cyber-criminals and instead relying on well-managed back-up systems.\nCD Projekt Red has even released a screen grab of the ransom note which will be invaluable for researchers.\nIt doesn't sound like much and there will be questions about how the firm was able to be breached in the first place.\nBut in a world of empty press releases and companies secretly paying criminals huge ransoms, CD Projekt Red has shown what can and, in the eyes of many, should be done to deal with the growing problem of ransomware hacking.

Travellers having to stay in quarantine hotels will be charged \u00a31,750 for their stay, and if they fail to isolate there for 10 days they face fines of up to \u00a310,000. The measures apply to UK and Irish residents returning from 33 red list countries. Meanwhile, all travellers arriving into Scotland from abroad by air will have to go into quarantine hotels. New, stricter travel measures are also being considered in Wales and Northern Ireland. Travellers arriving in England who lie on their passenger locator forms about visiting a red list country face a \u00a310,000 fine or up to 10 years in jail. So what are the new travel rules? And why hasn't the UK closed its borders?\nInternational experts investigating the origins of Covid-19 have all but dismissed a theory that the virus came from a laboratory in China. Peter Ben Embarek, from the World Health Organization, said it was \"extremely unlikely\" that the virus leaked from a lab in the city of Wuhan. Following the conclusion of a joint WHO-China mission, he said more work was needed to identify the source of the virus. Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province, was the first place in the world the virus was detected. Since then, more than 106 million cases and 2.3 million deaths have been reported worldwide.\nHead teachers' leaders have warned against \"gimmicks\" in plans to help pupils in England catch up for lost learning in the Covid pandemic. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said speculation about longer school days and shorter holidays was \"misconceived and unhelpful\" - and it would not help to try to \"grind out more hours from tired children\". Schools Minister Nick Gibb told MPs he was \"open to all ideas\" on catching up, adding: \"We just have to leave no stone unturned.\"\nThe grocery landscape worldwide is changing \"for good\", online supermarket Ocado has said, after a year in which the global pandemic forced many people to buy online for the first time. Ocado's comments came as it reported a 35% jump in sales over the past year. Amid rocketing demand, the UK-based firm narrowed losses from \u00a3214.5m to \u00a344m. The company said many customers were saying they were unlikely to revert to pre-crisis shopping habits.\nIt's hard to stay positive during lockdown, particularly in the winter months. You might be feeling just as frosty, gloomy and miserable as the UK's weather forecasts, with snow causing disruption and temperatures plummeting.  But last year, millions of people across the world experienced coronavirus lockdowns in snowy and sometimes sub-zero conditions - so what can we learn from them?\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nTo read about what your rights are if you book a holiday in the UK for later in the year.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Social care,Care homes,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Social care staff are more stretched now than at any point in the pandemic, the Association of Directors of Social Services Cymru has said.\nPresident Nicola Stubbins said workers were \"exhausted\" and under \"sustained pressure\".\nAt one point in the first lockdown, 15% of council social services staff in Wales were absent due to sickness.\nMs Stubbins said directors were \"firefighting\", but the pandemic had shown how resourceful the sector was.\nShe said the NHS would \"grind to a halt\" without the social care workforce preventing hospital admissions and supporting people to leave hospitals safely.\nAndrew James is a domiciliary care worker for Caerphilly council and provides care to older people in their own homes.\nHe has type 1 diabetes and, two years ago, had a heart attack.\n\"I had to shield in the beginning for 12 weeks. I've come back and it's worse now than it was at the first wave, but I've got to play my part,\" he said.\nHis colleague Hilary Evans, who has asthma, also shielded for three months.\n\"We couldn't stop thinking about the carers on the front line, working non-stop, and it made us feel guilty so we offered to come back,\" she said.\n\"We missed work and we missed our clients and had our part to play.\"\nSeran Wady, who manages their team, said since the beginning of the pandemic, the team had provided an average of 18,459 individual care calls a month.\n\"Like the NHS, I think we're saving lives. We're doing a lot of work around preventing admissions to hospital for people but also by facilitating discharges from hospital. \n\"We've responded really well and that's been through the dedication and the determination of the office and care staff.\"\nOther social care workers have had to completely change how they work.\nAlwen Evans, a community occupational therapist in Denbighshire, used to visit people at home but only goes out in a crisis now.\n\"I work from my dining room table and do sessions virtually. It doesn't mean the quality of care has been affected, but it is very different,\" she said.\n\"Resilience is wearing thin in health and social care across the board at the moment.\"\nThere are about 72,100 jobs in the adult social care sector, which represents about 6% of total employment in Wales. About 19,637 of those are domiciliary care workers.\nMost care workers are on the minimum wage - \u00a38.72 an hour for those aged 25 and over.\nIn 2016, the average annual earnings for those in the adult social care sector in Wales was estimated to be \u00a316,900, compared to the average of \u00a329,200 for all other industries.\nMs Stubbins, who is also the director of social services in Denbighshire, said: \"Social care staff are stretched now to a point I've never seen before and at this moment in time, stretched far more than any point during this entire pandemic. \n\"They are exhausted, but they keep going. \n\"The pressures of being able to maintain service delivery is becoming more and more challenging and with certain aspects we are only able to cover some critical services - that isn't anything that anybody ever came into this job to do, to have to choose between who you may or may not be able to help.\"\nShe said there had been times when there had not been enough staff to provide care.\n\"I know of examples in my own authority and across Wales where [senior] officers have stepped in to take on different roles. They've rolled up their sleeves, literally, and staffed care homes and other services to keep people safe.\"\nShe said numerous roles in social care, including social workers, occupational therapists and those working in domiciliary care, had been hit.\nIn May 2020, 15% of the local authority's social services workforce had been absent due to sickness, including Covid-19.\nMs Stubbins described a \"constant anxiety\" while waiting to hear about new cases or deaths - at first in care homes - but since Christmas she said there had been more cases in the community and children's homes.\n\"We are literally managing day-by-day because we don't know what tomorrow will bring. We're constantly firefighting. \n\"There's no time to stop, think and try and plan ahead and that's really, really difficult.\""

      "text": "The annual TV licence fee is to increase by \u00a31.50, from \u00a3157.50 to \u00a3159, from 1 April 2021.\nIt is the final - and lowest - annual increase under a deal between the BBC and the government that has seen the fee rise in line with inflation every year since 2017.\nThe government must decide how much a TV licence will cost from 2022 onwards.\nThe increase comes eight months after about three million over-75s lost their entitlement to free TV licences.\nThe new fee works out at \u00a33.06 per week or \u00a313.25 per month.\nIn 2019-20, it raised about \u00a33.5bn to pay for BBC services.\nLicence-fee evasion rose from 6.57% to 7.25% last year, according to the latest statistics.\nThe government had been considering whether non-payment should stop being a criminal offence.\nLast month, it decided not to go ahead with decriminalisation - but that it would \"remain under active consideration\".\nAlso last month, new BBC chairman Richard Sharp said the licence fee was the \"least worst\" way of funding the BBC.\nBut he had an \"open mind\" about how the corporation should be funded in the future.\nAnd it \"may be worth reassessing\" the current system."

      "tags": "Women and Equalities Committee,Homeschooling,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Government policies have \"repeatedly skewed towards men\", a committee of MPs has said in a report on the impact of coronavirus on men and women.\nCommittee chair Caroline Nokes said the government had \"repeatedly failed to consider\" the labour market and caring inequalities faced by women. \nThe report makes 20 recommendations including making it easier for staff to get flexible working arrangements.\nThe government said it had spent over \u00a3200bn on job support schemes. \n\"Throughout the pandemic this government has done whatever it takes to protect lives and livelihoods, and will continue to do so,\" a spokesperson said.\nSharon Luca from Warwickshire works from home, running a clothing business and a charity raising money to help parents of stillborn children. \nHer husband also works full time and so cannot help with homeschooling. \nBecause she is helping her son do school work, Sharon says she has \"barely had anytime to focus on my business or the charity\".\nThis has meant losing \"a big chunk\" of her earnings she says, adding: \"My income is my only independence.\"\nSharon thinks women are bearing the brunt of homeschooling.\n\"I know a lot of mums who work from home or have small businesses like myself and all of them are saying that they've been affected by homeschooling. \n\"They really don't have the time now to put in the energy to earn a living from their small business - homeschooling overtook everything.\"\nClare Jeffries, a single mother from Banbury, was made redundant from her job in HR during the pandemic and now can't find a role that's flexible enough to accommodate childcare  - despite lots of searching.  \nShe worries this is a problem that largely impacts on those with caring responsibility and \"disproportionately affects women\".\nShe says \"inclusion is a choice\" and that employers \"need to think about the choices they're making\".  \n\"Things like flexible working need to be a right for everybody.\"\nShe also wants the government to fund more childcare \"so that we can actually get back into work easier\".\nThe Women and Equalities Committee has examined some of these problems and says the government needs to \"start actively analysing and assessing the equality impact of every policy\".\nIts chair Ms Nokes said: \"Government policies have repeatedly skewed towards men - and it keeps happening.\"\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, she said although ministers had not \"deliberately designed policies to be sexist,\" there had been \"institutional thoughtlessness\" about their particular impact on women. \nThe Conservative MP - who lost her job as immigration minister when Boris Johnson entered Downing Street - also said the opinions of female cabinet ministers were \"not being played into debates and decisions\".\nShe told the programme there was a \"very blokey mentality at the top\" of government, which had suffered from \"the predominance of single-sex education round the cabinet table\".\nThe report notes that during the pandemic, women spent more time on caring duties than men, yet \"furlough was not clearly articulated as a right for those with caring responsibilities\".   \nOn sick pay, the report cites evidence that women were less likely to qualify for statutory sick pay, in part due to caring responsibilities, which meant their wages were too low to be eligible for the support, \nMaking over 20 recommendations, the committee said the government should:  \nThe MPs also urged the Women and Equalities Minister Liz Truss to be \"much more ambitious\" in getting other government departments to consider inequality when designing policies. \nResponding to the report, Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, called for a \"gendered response to the crisis\".\nShe added: \"The unequal impact of coronavirus on women is huge - women are more likely to work in low-paid sectors, to work in sectors which are currently shutdown such as retail and hospitality, and have taken on more caring responsibilities. \n\"The government cannot continue to deny and dismiss the reality of gender inequality across society.\"\nJoeli Brearley, CEO and founder of the campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed, said \"policy decisions have repeatedly ignored the specific needs of women\", adding: \"We are currently witnessing a generational roll back in maternal employment that will take us decades to repair.\"\nBritish Chambers of Commerce co-executive director Claire Walker said that a national focus was needed to help parents and carers. \n\"Employers value the skills women bring to the workplace and the evidence shows that businesses with a diverse and inclusive workforce perform better.\" \nShe added: \"Economic growth will depend on access to high quality, affordable childcare.\"\nA government spokesperson said it had spent over \u00a3200bn on schemes \"safeguarding people's jobs\" including the Self Employment Income Scheme helping the 1.7 million self-employed women in the UK.\n\"Covid-19 is prompting a culture shift with more people than ever before working flexibly, and the government wants to harness that as we recover. \n\"By doing so, we could see more equal sharing of care work by parents, and more flexibility from employers, enabling us to unleash the potential of everyone across the country.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Travellers having to stay in quarantine hotels in England will be charged \u00a31,750 for their stay, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced.\nThe measures, which come into force on Monday, apply to UK and Irish residents returning from 33 red list countries.\nThose who fail to quarantine in a government-sanctioned hotel for 10 days face fines of up to \u00a310,000.\nMeanwhile, all travellers arriving into Scotland from abroad by air will have to go into quarantine hotels. \nPeople travelling from red list countries to Wales and Northern Ireland will be required to book and pay for quarantine in England, as neither destination currently has any direct international flights.\nTravellers arriving into England who lie on their passenger locator forms about visiting a red list country face a fine of \u00a310,000 or up to 10 years in jail.\nIt comes as the UK reported another 12,364 confirmed cases of coronavirus and a further 1,052 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - bringing that total to 113,850. More than 12.6 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine.\nDelivering a statement in the Commons, Mr Hancock said 16 hotels have been contracted for the programme, with 4,600 rooms secured.\nThe health secretary also confirmed a new \"enhanced testing\" regime for all travellers arriving into the UK would begin on Monday, with two tests required during the quarantine process.\nThey will be required to get a test on days two and eight of their 10-day quarantine period, whether they are isolating at home or in a hotel. The tests, conducted by NHS Test and Trace, will cost travellers \u00a3210.\n\"People who flout these rules are putting us all at risk,\" the health secretary told MPs.\nAirlines and travel companies will be legally required to make sure travellers have signed up for the new measures before they depart, with fines for companies and passengers if they fail to comply, he said.\nThe penalties include a \u00a31,000 fine for travellers who fail to take mandatory tests and a \u00a32,000 fine for failing to take the second mandatory test - along with a 14-day extension to quarantine.\nFailing to quarantine in a designated hotel carries a fine of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000.\nAsked when the travel rules would be relaxed, Mr Hancock said: \"We want to exit from this into a system of safe international travel as soon as practicable and as soon as is safe.\"\nPassengers required to stay in a quarantine hotel will need to reserve a room online in advance using a booking system that opens on Thursday.\nThe \u00a31,750 fee for an individual includes the hotel, the cost of transport and testing. The additional rate for one extra adult or a child aged over 12 is \u00a3650, and for a child aged five to 12 it is \u00a3325.\nThese travellers will only be allowed to enter the UK through a \"small number of ports that currently account for the vast majority of passenger arrivals\", Mr Hancock added.\nResponding to Mr Hancock's statement, Labour's shadow health secretary said the public wanted the government to \"go further\" on border quarantine measures.\nJonathan Ashworth told the Commons: \"Our first line of defence is surely to do everything we can to stop (new variants) arising in the first place. That means securing our borders to isolate new variants as they come in. \n\"He's announced a detailed package today but he hasn't announced comprehensive quarantine controls at the borders.\"\nMr Hancock later said the red list was kept \"under review\". \nAnnouncing Scotland's tougher measures, which apply to arrivals from all countries, Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the \"targeted, reactive approach\" of the UK government was \"no longer sufficient\" to deal with the threat from coronavirus.\nWelsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said he also wanted to see \"a stronger set of defences at our borders\" and said the UK government's measures were \"the bare minimum of what needs to be done\".\nEnforcement fines and prison sentences over quarantine breaches are still \"under review\" in Wales. A Welsh government spokesperson also said the country was working to determine when it will need its own quarantine hotels, if the red list expands or if international flights resume. \nAlthough the 4,600 rooms secured so far in England would only allow for around one Boeing 747's worth of passengers per day, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said discussions were under way to add more capacity. \nShe told BBC Radio 4's World at One that separate security teams contracted by the government would be responsible for enforcing the quarantine, while hotel staff focused on giving people the \"best possible experience in what are very difficult circumstances\".\nThe \u00a31,750 fee includes three meals, tea, coffee and water, Ms Nicholls said, but other items will be available at an extra cost through room service.\nTravellers arriving in the UK - whether by boat, train or plane - are already required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry.\nThis test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling, and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to \u00a3500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks.\nThey must also provide contact details and their UK address. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to the place where they plan to self-isolate. \nAll travellers - including British nationals - must self-isolate for 10 days when they get to the UK.\nThe \"test to release scheme\" - where travellers from non-red list countries can leave home isolation after a negative test on day five - will remain under the new testing rules.\nPassengers will be expected to use the gold-standard and more expensive PCR tests.\nLockdown rules mean people must only travel abroad for essential reasons. These are the same as the \"reasonable excuses\" for domestic travel, including:\nPeople leaving England will soon have to make a declaration on why they need to travel, which will be checked by carriers prior to departure.\nThe new measures come after England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, warned it was too soon to say to what extent people could begin to start planning summer holidays.\nSpeaking at Monday's Downing Street coronavirus briefing, he said: \"The more elaborate your plans are for summer holidays, in terms of crossing borders, in terms of household mixing, given where we are now, I think we just have to say the more you are stepping into making guesses about the unknown at this point,\" he said.\n\"I can't give people a proper answer at this point because we don't yet have the data. It is just too early to say.\"\nAfter the announcement of the travel rules, aimed at preventing the spread of new variants of coronavirus, government advisers designated another \"variant of concern\" - a version of the virus which was revealed last week to have been found in Bristol.\nIt's not surprising that officials are adding this new version of coronavirus to their \"variants of concern\" list. \nTargeted testing is already under way to spot any new cases linked to the 21 that have already been found, mostly in the south west of England.\nThis new incarnation of the virus is the Kent variant \"plus\". It has the same N501Y mutation as the one that triggered lockdown - a genetic change that scientists say lets the virus spread more easily. But it also has an extra mutation called E484K.\nE484K is what experts are worried about for vaccine efficacy. It is also seen in the South Africa and Brazil variants of concern. \nA cluster of another variant in Liverpool is different again. It has got the E484K mutation but is an iteration of an earlier version of the pandemic virus rather than the Kent one.\nInevitably, more variants will continue to emerge. The challenge is to make sure vaccines are a good match to keep us ahead in this race against the virus. \nHave you recently travelled into the UK? What was your experience at the UK border?"

      "tags": "Floods,India",
      "text": "Emergency teams are working round the clock to rescue up to 35 people believed to be trapped in a tunnel in northern India. \nThe tunnel was blocked after a huge flood in the state of Uttarakhand on Sunday in which 28 people have been killed, and as many as 150 are missing. \nA piece of a Himalayan glacier is believed to have fallen into a river and triggered the deluge.\nThe main rescue effort is focused on an 8.3km (5.1-mile) long tunnel. \nIt is one of two tunnels connected to the Tapovan Vishnugad hydro power project and is meant to transport water. The other 3.8km long tunnel is to flush silt from the power project downstream on the Dhauliganga river.\nPeople were apparently trapped inside the two tunnels when the torrent of icy water swept down the valley, carrying rocks and earth as it gathered speed. Debris blocked the openings.  \nTwelve workers have been rescued from the smaller tunnel. But Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that about 35 people are still stuck inside the main tunnel. \n\"We're trying to drill and make our way via rope to reach them,\" he told news agency ANI.\nThe hydro power project is under construction and was scheduled to be completed by 2023. \nEmergency teams who ventured inside the tunnel have returned because of water and \"heavy accumulation of slush inside\", according to the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, which is helping in the rescue work. \nThere has been no contact with the workers since Sunday, and officials say it is hard to tell where in the tunnel they are and whether they are together.\nHundreds of troops, paramilitaries and military helicopters have been sent to the region to aid rescue efforts.\nRescue workers and locals have been using shovels and mechanical diggers to try to clear the entrance to the tunnel.\nAn investigation is continuing into what caused the suspected glacial burst.\nSpeaking from hospital, one man described the moment the smaller tunnel flooded.\n\"We heard screams, 'get out, get out'. We didn't know what was happening. We started running to escape when the force of the water gushed in through the mouth of the tunnel. We couldn't get out because of that,\" he said.\n\"We held on to the [roof] of the tunnel. We held on for about an hour. As the water receded, we slowly climbed onto the big rocks that flowed in, to take a breath. We had lost hope. We didn't think we would survive.\"\nUttarakhand police said an avalanche struck at about 11:00 local time (05:30 GMT) on Sunday, destroying a dam known as the Rishiganga Hydroelectric Project.\nSenior police officials said a bridge in the Tapovan area that connected 13 villages was washed away in the avalanche. Food packets have been air dropped in some of these villages.\nUttarakhand, in the western Himalayas, is prone to flash floods and landslides.\nSome 6,000 people are believed to have been killed in floods in June 2013 which were triggered by the heaviest monsoon rains in decades.

      "text": "Plans for a controversial coking coal mine in Cumbria have been suspended by the county council.\nCouncillors will reconsider the planning application for a site near Whitehaven in light of concerns about climate change. \nThe council granted planning permission to West Cumbria Mining back in October, and the government decided recently not to challenge the decision.\nBut now the council has said it will re-assess the permission.\nGuidance from the government's advisory Climate Change Committee (CCC) in December recommended that the use of coking coal should be curbed by 2035, whereas the council have granted permission to dig until 2049.\nA council statement said: \"In light of this the council has decided that the planning application should be reconsidered by the Development Control and Regulation Committee.\"\nThe decision may prove a relief for the prime minister who has been under pressure to halt the mine as he aspires to lead the world away from the fossil fuels that are heating the climate.\nThe mine has divided opinion in Cumbria, with many in favour of the well-paid manual jobs it would bring, but others warning of the risks of climate change - especially in an area prone to severe flooding.\nGreenpeace said: \"This decision could prevent Boris Johnson's climate credentials being buried under a tonne of coal.\"\nThe CCC, many green groups and scientists have been pressed the prime minister to overturn the council's decision to grant permission for the mine. \nAlok Sharma, who will head this year's climate summit on behalf of the UK, was said to be apoplectic that the mine had been given the go-ahead, and the Lib Dems wrote to him urging him to resign unless the government stopped the project.\nBut local Conservatives, including Copeland MP Trudy Harrison and Copeland mayor Mike Starkie, have been supportive of the mine, especially as some of its produce will be able to be used by the UK steel industry.\nThey said they were \"dismayed\" by the county council's move and added the area \"needs\" the \u00a3160m of private investment and 500 jobs the mine was set to bring.\n\"The decision has been made time and again, based on the forensic details the planning committee had in front of them, and the decision has repeatedly been to approve this important development.\n\"The project fully accords with the UK's green industrial commitments and includes legal conditions that production will not go beyond 2049 and the highest levels of greenhouse gas emission mitigation.\"\nLabour's Shadow Business Secretary, Ed Miliband, said the party welcomed the decision to take the application back to the planning committee.\n\"The government now has a second chance to do the right thing and call it in. The UK cannot claim to be a climate leader whilst opening a new coal mine and ministers must realise that by doing so they undermine our credibility both at home and abroad.\n\"A new mine is neither the answer for climate change nor the answer for our steel industry. Indeed, 85% of the mine's production is due for export. \n\"People in Cumbria deserve good, secure jobs and there are so many crying out to be done in the green industries of the future.\"\nHowever, the South Lakes Action on Climate Change group said it was sceptical planning officers would \"change their minds and advise councillors to refuse this time\".\nA spokesperson said: \"Cumbria County Council will almost certainly be seeking to justify a further decision to approve, as a way of defending themselves from a judicial review.\n\"It is possible that the committee meeting will be on the 19th February, and objectors will have little more than a week to prepare further objections and apply to speak at the committee.\"\nFollow Roger Harrabin on Twitter."

      "text": "Travel company Tui has said it expects to run 80% of its normal capacity for this summer, with 2.8 million customers already booked for its holidays.\nThe statement follows optimism from other travel firms that the industry is set for recovery as coronavirus vaccination programmes advance.\nDespite the upbeat mood, summer bookings for 2021 are down 44% so far compared with last year, the firm said.\nBoss Fritz Joussen said the UK market had \"a special significance\" for Tui.\n\"We see an impressive pace and ambitious targets for vaccinations there.\"\nHe added: \"We should do everything we can to quickly return to basic freedoms and make travel possible again.\"\nAverage prices for holidays are 20% higher than for summer 2019.\nAlthough demand for breaks appears to be building, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said on Monday it was \"too early to say\" whether people would be able to have holidays as normal this summer.\nTui's predictions for the summer season came in a trading statement that underlined the scale of the collapse in the tourism market due to Covid curbs.\nThe firm's winter bookings fell 89% compared with a year ago, with November and December hardest hit.\nIncome in the three months to the end of 2020 fell 87.8% year-on-year, from \u20ac3.86bn (\u00a33.4bn) to \u20ac468.1m.\n\"With strict cost discipline and the realignment of the group, which is being driven forward at full speed, we succeeded in reducing the loss in the past quarter,\" Mr Joussen said.\n\"As expected, customers will book their summer holidays much later this year than in normal years. However, demand remains strong, people want to travel - this is shown by the already good number of bookings for the summer.\"\nTui also disclosed that it had agreed a third coronavirus financing package with banks, shareholders and the German government's Economic Stabilisation Fund, created to support companies hit by coronavirus.\nThis raised \u20ac1.8bn, including \u20ac500m from shareholders in a rights issue, which it hopes will tide it over until conditions improve.\n\"The travel sector has been hammered by the global coronavirus pandemic, with revenues falling off a cliff-edge as travel restrictions have scuppered any holiday plans for consumers,\" said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor.\n\"Investors will be eager to see if vaccinations can give the business the shot in the arm it desperately needs, having already secured three bailouts from the German government. \n\"Regardless, Tui needs to reduce its costs and take advantage of the millions of consumers desperate to go on holiday as soon as the restrictions are eased.\" "

      "tags": "Impeachment of Donald Trump,US Capitol stormed,Nancy Pelosi,Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "Former US President Donald Trump is being put on trial by lawmakers for allegedly inciting a riot at the US Capitol.\nLast month Mr Trump became the first president in US history to be charged with misconduct - or impeached - twice by the lower chamber of Congress.\nRepublicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to pass an article of impeachment that accused Mr Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\".\nThe article alleged that Mr Trump had made false allegations of election fraud and encouraged his supporters to storm Congress on 6 January.\nNow a trial is being held in the upper chamber of Congress, the Senate, which will decide whether to convict or clear Mr Trump of the charge.\nThis is an unprecedented moment for the US, which has never put an impeached president on trial after they have left office.\nSo, what can we expect?\nThe trial in the Senate is political, rather than criminal. A vote will be held at the end of the trial to determine whether Mr Trump is guilty of the charge.\nA two-thirds majority of the 100-member Senate must back a guilty verdict to convict Mr Trump.\nIf Mr Trump is convicted, senators could also vote to bar him from ever holding public office again.\nThe trial opened on Tuesday with a four-hour debate on whether the proceedings were unconstitutional because Mr Trump is no longer president. A 56-44 majority then voted in favour of continuing, with six Republicans backing the measure. \nEach side will then be given 16 hours in total to make their arguments, and this will be limited to eight hours in any one day. \nThere will be an option to request a debate and a vote on whether witnesses should be called.\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are said to favour a speedy trial, amid an ongoing effort to get President Joe Biden's Covid-19 relief plan approved. \nIt is thought a vote on a conviction could come as early as Monday if no witnesses are called.\nDemocrats prosecuting the case opened the proceedings by showing a dramatic video montage of Mr Trump's 6 January speech and the deadly rioting by some of his supporters.\n\"That's a high crime and misdemeanour,\" Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland - who is leading the case - said of the footage. \"If that's not an impeachable offence, then there's no such thing.\"\nThey say Mr Trump is \"personally responsible\" for the riot and must be convicted.\nAccording to a pre-trial legal brief, they will say his repeated refusal to concede the election led to an \"incitement of insurrection against the republic he swore to protect\".\nMr Trump's \"statements turned his 'wild' rally on 6 January into a powder keg waiting to blow\", they will argue.\nAlthough he is no longer in office, Mr Trump \"must answer comprehensively for his conduct in office from his first day in office through his last\", Democrats argue.\nThey have called for Mr Trump to be disqualified from ever running for office again.\nOn the opening day, his defence lawyers argued unsuccessfully that it was unconstitutional to put a private citizen through the impeachment process. \nDefence lawyer David Schoen said the Democrats were using \"the guise of impeachment as a tool to disenfranchise\" those who support Donald Trump.\nHis lawyers are now likely to change tack and argue that Mr Trump's supporters stormed Congress of their own accord. \nAccording to their own pre-trial brief, they will argue that Mr Trump's pre-riot remarks did not amount to incitement. \nThe former president's call to \"fight\" was not meant to be taken literally, they say.\n\"To characterise this statement alone as 'incitement to insurrection' is to ignore, wholesale, the remainder of Mr Trump's speech that day, including his call for his supporters to 'peacefully' making their 'voices heard,'\" they add.\nMoreover, FBI documents had shown that the riot was planned days in advance, the lawyers said.\nIt is never happened before, so it is untested and the US Constitution does not say.\nImpeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon were ended when he quit in 1974.\nSo Mr Trump could take his case to the Supreme Court, claiming his trial was unconstitutional.\nSome lower ranked officials have been impeached after leaving office.\nThat is certainly what prosecutors wanted. Last week, they sent a letter inviting him to testify under oath \"at a mutually convenient time and place\".\nThe prosecution team suggested that they would cite Mr Trump's silence as further proof that their allegations were true.\nWithin hours, however, the former president's lawyers had rejected the request as a publicity stunt.\nThey made clear he would not testify voluntarily. The prosecutors do have the power to issue a subpoena - or an order to compel him to appear in court to testify - but that is considered unlikely.\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts presided over the first impeachment trial of Mr Trump, but will not do so again.\nDemocratic Senator Patrick Leahy - third in the line of presidential succession - is presiding over the trial instead.\nProsecuting the case are nine House Democrats, known as the impeachment managers.\nMr Trump is being represented by two attorneys - Bruce Castor and David Schoen.\nAll 100 US senators have been sworn in as jurors in the trial.\nDemocrats only hold half the 100 seats so they would require 17 Republicans to vote against someone from their own party.\nThat is a high bar for a party that has largely remained publicly loyal to Mr Trump.\nTen Republicans in the House supported impeachment and a handful of senators have indicated they are open to it.\nBut Tuesday's vote implied loyalty toward the former president in his party remained high enough to avoid a conviction.\nIf he is convicted by the Senate, lawmakers must hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again - which he had indicated he planned to do in 2024.\nThis could be the biggest consequence of this impeachment.\nIf he is convicted, a simple majority of senators would be needed to block Mr Trump from holding \"any office of honour, trust or profit under the United States\".\nSo 50 senators plus a casting vote from Vice-President Kamala Harris would be enough to damn Mr Trump's hopes of political power.\nThis could be appealing to Republicans hoping to run for president in the future and those who want Mr Trump out of the party.\nThere has been talk of Mr Trump losing benefits granted to his predecessors under the 1958 Former Presidents Act, which include a pension and health insurance, and potentially a lifetime security detail at taxpayers' expense. \nHowever, Mr Trump is likely to keep these benefits if he is convicted after leaving office.\nThat was over his dealings with Ukraine, although he denied any wrongdoing.\nHe was accused of pressing the country's leader to open an investigation into Mr Biden, then his emerging rival for the White House, and his son Hunter.\nMr Trump appeared to use military aid as leverage. He was impeached by the House and cleared by the then Republican-controlled Senate."

When deaths registered over the following few days are counted, the total is 6,843.\nRCT, with 821 deaths, has the largest number of Covid-19 deaths occurring in Wales, followed by Cardiff with 753 up to the latest week. \nWhen looking at crude death rates - based on local populations - Wales has three of the highest 10 across England and Wales.\nRCT has 340.3 deaths per 100,000 in total so far in the pandemic, which is third highest across England and Wales.  Merthyr is fifth with 323.2. Bridgend is also in the highest 10.\nThere were 93 deaths involving Covid in care homes in Wales. \nSo far during the pandemic, 6,694 deaths (15.9%) mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate.\nWith deaths occurring up to 29 January but counting registrations in the week or so after, the total is 6,843.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, continue to be above the five-year average.\nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing.\nIn Wales, the number of deaths from all causes fell again from 1,077 to 974, but it was still 172 deaths (21.4%) above the five-year average.\nThe highest proportion of excess deaths was 98.8% in London.\nThe number of deaths, as reported daily by Public Health Wales, passed the 5,000 mark on Monday.\nBut this only records deaths which have a confirmed Covid-19 diagnosis, backed up by a laboratory test, and mostly involve hospital deaths.\nONS takes a little longer to report deaths because it collates details of death registrations, in which doctors mention Covid when it is suspected or confirmed as a cause of death. In around 90% of cases, it is the underlying cause of death.\nThis also covers deaths in all settings, from hospitals to hospices, care homes and people's homes and is regarded as giving a fuller picture.\nThe worst days in the pandemic have been during the second wave. Under the Public Health Wales measure, it was 57 deaths on 1 January, when there were 63 registered Covid deaths in total. On 11 January, there were 81 registered deaths involving Covid, according to ONS figures."

      "text": "TV presenter Saira Khan has said she received death threats after revealing she is not a practising Muslim. \nThe former Loose Women panellist clarified her faith earlier this week in a column for The Daily Mirror.\n\"The problem for women like me, who have a Muslim name and are of Asian heritage, is that others make assumptions about us before we even open our mouths,\" she said.\nIn an Instagram Live on Monday, Khan said she had received death threats.\nShe also posted a statement on her account which said she had been abused and trolled online.\nKhan shot to fame as a contestant on The Apprentice. She has since appeared on Dancing on Ice and Celebrity Big Brother.\nFor the last five years she has been a regular panellist on ITV's Loose Women, but she stepped down from her role in December.\nIn a newspaper column, the broadcaster said she wanted to clarify her stance \"for [her] own wellbeing\".\n\"I feel that by saying this as a public figure, I will no longer inadvertently confuse or unintentionally hurt others of the Muslim faith,\" she wrote. \n\"People assume that because we have Muslim parents we are practising Muslims, that we have read the Quran, that we fast every Ramadan, that we don't drink, that we don't have sex before marriage.\"\nKhan said many aspects of her lifestyle did not fit with Islam, such as wearing clothes that go against the accepted dress code, drinking alcohol and having a boyfriend \"behind closed doors\".\nThe broadcaster, who is of Pakistani heritage, also highlighted that she had adopted a child and had not followed Islamic rules on her daughter's inheritance rights.\nShe continued: \"I respect people who have Islam in their lives - some are the most humble people I know.\n\"However, I don't share their conviction. I've tried hard over many years, not for myself, but for my parents and the wider family.\"\nShe said that having been brought up in a practising Muslim family, \"most of my values are based on the spiritual aspects of the Muslim faith. But I'm also influenced by other spiritual teachings\".\nKhan took part in an Instagram Live broadcast on Monday evening, during which she said she had received death threats since the publication of her article.\nOn Tuesday, she posted a statement on Instagram reiterating that she has \"been sent threats, abuse and been trolled\".\n\"Why my personal choice of how I choose to live my life should stir such hatred in others is incomprehensible to me,\" she said.\nBut, the presenter added, she had also received support from several followers. She shared screengrabs of some messages she had been sent.\nKhan said she had been \"contacted by so many women in the last 24 hours documenting their fears for wanting to live their life how they wish\".\n\"Whilst I like to keep things upbeat and positive, I cannot forget that I as a woman have a duty on my platform to help other women.\n\"We don't need to look the same in order to feel each other's pain. I feel your pain if you are hurt.\"\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Universal Credit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The \u00a320 weekly increase in Universal Credit must be extended for at least a year to avoid impoverishing hundreds of thousands of people, MPs have warned.\nThe measure, which has been called a lifeline for struggling families, is in place until the end of March.\nThe Commons Work and Pensions Committee said keeping the higher rate until April 2022 must be the \"bare minimum\". \nThe government has signalled it is looking at a range of options for support ahead of next month's Budget.\nSpeaking in the Commons, Work and Pensions Minister Will Quince criticised what he described as \"unhelpful scaremongering\", saying discussions \"remained ongoing\" with the Treasury.\nHe said Chancellor Rishi Sunak had a \"proven record of stepping up to protect the poorest, the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our country throughout this pandemic and I have no doubt he will continue to do so\". \nAbout six million families have benefited from the top-up, worth more than \u00a31,000 a year, since it was introduced at the start of the pandemic. \nThe cross-party group of MPs said a decision was needed now on extending it and warned against it being replaced by a one-off payment.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey confirmed recently that a single payment was one of the options under consideration but was not one of her department's \"preferred approaches\".\nIn its report, the committee said that removing the top-up in April would force hundreds of thousands of families below the breadline and drag those already in poverty \"down into destitution\".\nThe MPs acknowledged that keeping the top-up would come at a substantial cost, with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimating it could cost about \u00a36.4bn in 2021-2022.\nBut the committee said the actual amount could be much lower if government plans to support people back to work were successful in reducing the number of people who depend on the welfare system.\n\"Removing the extra payment in March would represent a failure by government - failure to recognise the reality of people struggling,\" said Stephen Timms, the Labour MP who chairs the committee. \n\"Without regular support, hundreds of thousands of families will be swept into poverty or even destitution. government must end the uncertainty and commit to extending this lifeline.\"\nThe MPs said charities and anti-poverty campaigners were alarmed by the possibility of it being replaced by a larger single payment - potentially of up to \u00a3500 - believing it could destabilise people's budgets, push some claimants over the threshold for other support and increase the risks of fraud. \nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and its economic impact, they said a regular, steady stream of money would be far more beneficial.\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation said removing the \u00a320 would be a \"terrible mistake\" at a time of rising unemployment and those claiming legacy benefits, who have not yet moved to Universal Credit, should be eligible.\nUniversal credit is a single payment replacing old benefits such as housing benefit and child tax credits.\nYou can claim universal credit if you are on a low income or are out of work. \nThe standard allowance varies from around \u00a3340 to just under \u00a3600 a month, depending on your age or whether you are single. \nYou may be eligible to receive more money on top of the standard allowance if, for example, you have children or a health condition.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nPeople arriving in the UK must have a negative test before entering the country. After arriving, they must self-isolate for up to 10 days - and, from 15 February, people arriving from Covid hotspots must pay to isolate in hotels. Now, another layer is being added - all arrivals will be tested twice during their isolation. It's not know when the tests will take place - but it's thought it could be on the second and eighth day of isolation. The government says the tests will \"provide a further level of protection\" and \"give us even more opportunities to detect new variants\". Last night, England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said vaccines were likely to stop serious illness caused by variants. Watch his comments below.\nThe NHS Covid-19 app has told 1.7 million people in England and Wales to self-isolate so far - and ministers believe it has prevented 600,000 cases. Internal data shows 16.5 million people are using the contact-tracing tool. That's 24% below the number of downloads, as some people delete the app, turn off the contact tracing - or never even activate it. \nGovernment policies have \"repeatedly skewed towards men\", a committee of MPs has said in a report on the impact of coronavirus on men and women. Committee chairwoman Caroline Nokes said the government had \"repeatedly failed to consider\" the labour market and caring inequalities faced by women. The report makes 20 recommendations - including making it easier for staff to get flexible working. Watch one woman's story below.\nPeople queuing for Covid-19 vaccines in West Sussex got a surprise - when Downton Abbey's Lord Grantham was there to welcome them.

      "tags": "Impeachment of Donald Trump,US Capitol stormed,Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "Lawyers for Donald Trump have responded to his impeachment charges, saying supporters of the former US president stormed Congress in Washington DC on 6 January of their own accord.\nMr Trump's trial in the Senate is due to begin on Tuesday after he was impeached for the second time by the House of Representatives last month.\nHe is charged with \"inciting insurrection\" in a speech to supporters ahead of the deadly riot.\nMr Trump says he will not testify.\nFive people, including a police officer, died when a mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol building, forcing politicians and staff to hide in offices.\nMr Trump is the only US president in history to have been impeached twice and one of only three to have been impeached at all.\nIn a pre-trial brief released on Monday, the former president's lawyers said that FBI documents had shown that the riot was planned days in advance, meaning that Mr Trump cannot have encouraged the violence.\nThey also insist the trial is unconstitutional because Mr Trump has left office and is now a private citizen.\nThey hit out at the nine \"impeachment managers\" - Democrats from the House of Representatives who will lay out the case for prosecution - accusing them of \"intellectual dishonesty and factual vacuity\" in the way they portrayed Mr Trump's address to his supporters.\nThe lawyers described the trial as \"political theatre\" and a \"brazen political act\" by Democrats that was intended to \"silence a political opponent and a minority party\".\n\"This impeachment proceeding was never about seeking justice,\" they wrote.\n\"Instead, this was only ever a selfish attempt by Democratic leadership in the House to prey upon the feelings of horror and confusion that fell upon all Americans across the entire political spectrum upon seeing the destruction at the Capitol on January 6 by a few hundred people.\" \nDemocrats say Mr Trump's repeated refusal to concede last November's presidential election to Joe Biden - as well as the fiery rhetoric he used in his address to supporters on 6 January - encouraged the riot.  \nHis lawyers argue that Mr Trump was simply exercising his First Amendment rights to freedom of speech.\nIn their own response later on Monday, the House impeachment managers reasserted that Mr Trump had \"betrayed the American people\".\n\"His incitement of insurrection against the United States government - which disrupted the peaceful transfer of power - is the most grievous constitutional crime ever committed by a president,\" their statement said.\nThe trial is expected to begin with a four-hour debate and then a vote on whether the proceedings are unconstitutional.\nIf it proceeds - as it is expected to - opening debates will begin on Wednesday afternoon with both sides allowed up to 16 hours each for presentations. \nHowever, for the Senate to convict Mr Trump a two-thirds majority is required meaning 17 Republicans would need to join the chamber's 50 Democrats in the vote. \nOn 26 January, a bid to dismiss the case as unconstitutional was backed by 45 of the Senate's 50 Republicans.\nThe former president is accused of \"incitement of insurrection against the Republic he swore to protect\" - namely the storming of the Capitol by his supporters as Congress met to confirm the result of the 3 November election. \nMr Trump's \"statements turned his 'wild' rally on 6 January into a powder keg waiting to blow\", Democrats said in a pre-trial briefing.\nThey are expected to put before the Senate Mr Trump's words - and footage from the riot - to show that \"the furious crowd\" was \"primed (and prepared) for violence if he lit a spark\".\n\"The evidence is clear,\" they wrote. \"When other attempts to overturn the presidential election failed, former President Trump incited an attack on the Capitol.\"\nThey argue that although he is no longer in office, \"a president must answer comprehensively for his conduct in office from his first day in office through his last\".\nThey call for him to be disqualified from ever running for office again.\nWhat questions do you have about the impeachment trial?\nThe impeachment process can be confusing.

      "tags": "Aviation accidents and incidents,Kobe Bryant,United States,California",
      "text": "The pilot of the helicopter which crashed killing basketball superstar Kobe Bryant, his young daughter, and seven other people had probably become disorientated amid fog, US safety investigators have said.\nThe helicopter smashed into a hillside near Calabasas, California, on 26 January 2020.\nPilot Ara Zobayan was among the dead.\nInvestigators also said Zobayan may have felt \"self-induced pressure\" to complete the flight for Bryant.\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has been investigating the circumstances around the crash, and met on Tuesday to vote on the probable cause. It is an independent federal agency with no enforcement powers. \nIn its official finding, the NTSB said the main cause of the crash was most likely the pilot's decision to keep flying in inclement conditions, \"which resulted in the pilot's spatial disorientation and loss of control\".\nDuring the flight, Zobayan told air traffic controllers the helicopter was climbing out of heavy cloud when it was actually descending. \n\"This manoeuvre is consistent with the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation in limited visibility conditions,\" said NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt.\n\"We are talking about spatial disorientation where literally the pilot may not know which way is up or down, whether he or she is leaning left or right.\"\nThe NTSB added that \"inadequate review and oversight\" of safety management processes by the helicopter charter company, Island Express, may have also contributed to the crash. \nHowever, the board did not find that the Sikorsky S-76B had experienced any mechanical problems. The helicopter was not required to have \"black box\" recorders, which capture flight data and voices in the cockpit, and was not carrying any.\nZobayan violated federal rules and went against his own flight training by flying into thick clouds, safety officials said.\nThe pilot \"was flying under visual flight orders or VFR which legally prohibited him from penetrating the clouds\", but he did so anyway, said Mr Sumwalt. \nInvestigators also criticised Zobayan for banking the helicopter to the left, instead of bringing the aircraft straight up while trying to escape the bad weather. \nZobayan was an experienced pilot who had often flown for Bryant. The widely respected pilot had logged more than 1,200 hours in the Sikorsky-76 helicopter. \nDisorientation can set in when pilots can't see the sky or landscape, making it harder to judge an aircraft's altitude and acceleration.\nInvestigators also said that the close relationship between Bryant and Zobayan may have compelled the pilot to fly even in unsafe conditions. \nIn text messages on the eve of the crash released by the NTSB, Zobayan wrote that the forecast seemed to be \"not the best\". The next morning, he wrote that the conditions were \"looking ok\". \nAt the time of the crash, retired NBA legend Bryant, 41, was travelling to a youth basketball tournament with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, two of her teammates, and several other friends.\nThe fatal crash prompted a global outpouring of support for the NBA star and his family - as well as a number of lawsuits. \nBryant's wife, Vanessa Bryant, sued Zobayan and the companies that owned and operated the helicopter for alleged negligence and wrongful death. Families of the other victims sued the helicopter companies - but not Zobayan. \nIn September, Ms Bryant sued the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department after officers shared unauthorised photos of the crash site. California now has a state law prohibiting first responders from taking unauthorised pictures of people who died at the scene of an accident or crime. "

      "title": "The plot (and spoilers) of Impeachment II",
      "tags": "Impeachment of Donald Trump,US Capitol stormed,US politics,United States",
      "text": "The rule of thumb in the cinema is that the original is invariably better than the sequel. \nBut then you get The Dark Knight getting far more acclaim than Batman Begins. Or Godfather 2 being better than the first movie - and personally I thought Toy Story 3 was the best. And don't get me started on Star Wars. \nSo, what should we expect from Impeachment II, Incitement of Insurrection, coming to a TV screen near you this week?\nSome very general and obvious observations. \nThe plotlines in this second impeachment will be much easier to follow than the original. \nA presidential call to his Ukrainian counterpart asking questions about an obscure energy company on which Joe Biden's son had served as a director, does not have the immediacy of the events of 6 January when a Trump supporting mob stormed Congress after listening to a speech delivered by the president. \nWhat is not in question is that the MAGA-mob tried to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election. Five people died following the mayhem. There will not be an American who doesn't have a view on what unfolded.\nThe other quick observation I would make is this - the chamber where the Senate trial will unfold is also the crime-scene; the epicentre of this assault on America's most sacred democratic sanctum. And the corollary of that is that some of the people who will be 'trying' the former president will have felt themselves to be victims of the crime that unfolded.\nSo what chance is there that Donald Trump will get a fair trial?\nWell, the first thing I would say about that is though the language of impeachment is replete with quasi-judicial terminology, the jurors are the 100 Senators - Republican and Democrat. This is political. \nHow many of those who will weigh the evidence for and against Donald Trump will be swayed by the evidence presented? I find it hard to imagine there will be a single one.\nDemocrats, I would guess, will vote as a block to convict. Republicans are split three ways - and this is a political split, not a schism based on the evidence. \nThere are those Republicans who remain firmly behind Donald Trump, and will not now, not ever, vote to find him guilty of \"incitement of insurrection\", the three words on the article of impeachment. \nThere are those who would love nothing more to see the former president slip away from the national consciousness, and feel that he has been a corrosive force on the democratic norms and values of US democracy - but don't want to pick a fight with him for fear of the consequences. Their worst nightmare is Trump rallying support behind a Republican rival the next time they're up for election.\nAnd there is a smaller number of Republicans who are ready to very publicly say they believe that the party of Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Reagan needs to be rid of the Trump legacy, that it is a cancer that needs to be cut out.\nIn other words, this will all be about political calculation. And the second order calculation will be how these senators will explain the decision to their voters.\nWhich brings us to this next question, how will this play itself out?\nDemocrats will make a case that evokes the drama of the day and the fears some of them had - they thought their lives were in danger as they cowered in offices while the mob went room to room. The blame for that will be laid squarely at the defendant's door.\nThe Trump defence will take two forms. \nOn the substance of the \"incitement of insurrection\" charge, his lawyers will argue that he was exercising his free speech, First Amendment rights - and they will point out that in that address on 6 January, the president told his supporters to march on Congress \"peacefully and patriotically\".  \nBut the speech was notable for all its \"We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" And telling his supporters that they have to be tough and not weak.\nAnd his case is not helped by the tweets and messaging around this time - urging his supporters to come to Washington on 6 January because it was \"going to be wild\". \nIn a video released on the night of the riots, Donald Trump told the mob that had descended on Congress that he loved them and they were special people. He tweeted that evening - seemingly to justify the actions of the insurgents - that this is what happens when you steal the result of the election.\nHe repeatedly claimed he had won the election by a landslide. There is no evidence for that. \nHe repeatedly claimed that the election had been stolen. Judge after judge - many appointed by Donald Trump - rejected those legal arguments put by his campaign lawyers. \nAnd the charges of fraud - again promoted by Mr Trump - were dismissed by the president's own Attorney General William Barr; the head of election security - another Trump appointee - also said the election had been fair.\nSo don't expect the president's words to be the backbone of the defence.\nInstead it will focus on the constitutionality of impeaching a president once he's left office. The lawyers will argue that the weapon of impeachment is only to be used for a serving politician, not a private citizen (as Donald Trump now is).\nHow can you use the sanction of removing someone from office when they've already left office? And this is I suspect the justification (fig-leaf, I feel sure Democrats will insist) that Republicans will reach for as their justification for acquitting Donald Trump.\nOf course, Democrats will point out the offence took place while he was president, and you don't get a free pass just because you've left office. Or as James Corden put it on his Late, Late Show, it's like being pulled over by a traffic cop for speeding, and saying to the officer \"I might well have been going at 50mph back then, but now as I speak to you I am stationary, so you can't charge me now\u2026\"\nImpeachment II will get big, big TV audiences - though they'd have been far greater if the president had testified, as Democrat impeachment managers had wanted.\nBut the outcome - and here I feel the need to issue a spoiler alert - is almost certainly going to be the same as Impeachment I. \nHe will be acquitted."
