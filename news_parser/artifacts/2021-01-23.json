      "title": "Coronavirus: UK variant 'may be more deadly'",
      "text": "Early evidence suggests the variant of coronavirus that emerged in the UK may be more deadly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. \nHowever, there remains huge uncertainty around the numbers - and vaccines are still expected to work. \nThe data comes from mathematicians comparing death rates in people infected with either the new or the old versions of the virus. \nThe new more infectious variant has already spread widely across the UK. \nMr Johnson told a Downing Street briefing: \"In addition to spreading more quickly, it also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant - the variant that was first identified in London and the south east - may be associated with a higher degree of mortality.\n\"It's largely the impact of this new variant that means the NHS is under such intense pressure.\"\nPublic Health England, Imperial College London, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Exeter have each been trying to assess how deadly the new variant is.\nTheir evidence has been assessed by scientists on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag).\nThe group concluded there was a \"realistic possibility\" that the virus had become more deadly, but this is far from certain.\nSir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, described the data so far as \"not yet strong\".\nHe said: \"I want to stress that there's a lot of uncertainty around these numbers and we need more work to get a precise handle on it, but it obviously is a concern that this has an increase in mortality as well as an increase in transmissibility.\" \nPrevious work suggests the new variant spreads between 30% and 70% faster than others, and there are hints it is about 30% more deadly.\nFor example, with 1,000 60-year-olds infected with the old variant, 10 of them might be expected to die. But this rises to about 13 with the new variant. \nThis difference is found when looking at everyone testing positive for Covid, but analysing only hospital data has found no increase in the death rate. Hospital care has improved over the course of the pandemic as doctors get better at treating the disease.\nThe new variant was first detected in Kent in September. It is now the most common form of the virus in England and Northern Ireland, and has spread to more than 50 other countries. \nThe Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine are both expected to work against the variant that emerged in the UK.\nHowever, Sir Patrick said there was more concern about two other variants that had emerged in South Africa and Brazil.\nHe said: \"They have certain features which means they might be less susceptible to vaccines. \n\"They are definitely of more concern than the one in the UK at the moment and we need to keep looking at it and studying this very carefully.\"\nThe prime minister said the government was prepared to take further action to protect the country's borders to prevent new variants from entering.\n\"I really don't rule it out, we may need to take further measures still,\" he said.\nLast week the government extended a travel ban to South America, Portugal and many African countries amid concerns about new variants, while all international travellers must now test negative ahead of departure to the UK and go into quarantine on arrival.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "An engaged couple taken to hospital in the same ambulance with Covid-19 were able to marry moments before the man was sedated and put on a ventilator.\nElizabeth Kerr, 31, and Simon O'Brien, 36, were taken to Milton Keynes University Hospital with breathing difficulties on 9 January.\nStaff rallied to arrange a wedding as the groom's condition worsened.\nThey held off intubating Mr O'Brien so the ceremony could go ahead. The couple are now recovering in hospital.\nMrs Kerr, a nurse, and Mr O'Brien had planned to marry in June.\nBoth contracted the disease and were taken to hospital together when their oxygen levels fell dangerously low.\nThey were placed on separate wards but when Mrs Kerr told nurse Hannah Cannon about their wedding plans, she asked her if they would like to marry in the hospital.\nMrs Kerr said she was told it could be their only chance.\n\"Those are words I never, ever want to hear again,\" she said.\nHowever, while staff were securing the wedding licence, Mr O'Brien's condition further deteriorated and on 12 January he was placed on the intensive care unit, to be put on a ventilator.\nThey waited to intubate him just long enough for the ceremony to go ahead.\nMs Cannon said: \"With lots of teamwork... we were able to give them a wedding, not necessarily the wedding that they would have initially intended, but certainly something positive, remarkable and memorable for them to really hold on to.\"\nShe filmed the marriage for the couple's families and friends, and catering staff at the hospital provided a cake.\nShortly after saying \"I do\", Mr O'Brien was placed on the ventilator.\nThe couple have now been reunited on a recovery ward and were able to kiss for the first time since being married.\nMrs Kerr said having the wedding meant \"everything\" to them.\n \"If we hadn't had each other and we hadn't been given that opportunity to get married, I don't think both of us would be here now,\" she added.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Kamala Harris,Boris Johnson,COP26,Paris climate agreement,Coronavirus pandemic,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has spoken to Joe Biden for the first time since the new US president was inaugurated.\nMr Johnson said on Twitter that he looked forward to \"deepening the longstanding alliance\" between the UK and the US as they drove a \"green and sustainable recovery from Covid-19\".\nMr Biden was sworn in as president and Kamala Harris as vice-president in a ceremony in Washington on Wednesday.\nThe PM said their inauguration was a \"step forward\" for the US.\nA Downing Street spokesman said Mr Johnson \"warmly welcomed\" the president's decision to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change and the World Health Organization - both abandoned by Mr Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump.\n\"The prime minister praised President Biden's early action on tackling climate change and commitment to reach net zero by 2050,\" the spokesman said.\nThe spokesman added that, in building on the two nations' \"long history of cooperation in security and defence, the leaders \"re-committed to the Nato alliance and our shared values in promoting human rights and protecting democracy\".\nThe two leaders also talked about \"the benefits of a potential free trade deal\" between the UK and the US, with Mr Johnson reiterating his intention \"to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible\".\nAfter the inauguration of any American president, a political spectator sport immediately begins: the order in which the new occupant of the White House speaks to other world leaders. \nIt is a crude metric of relative importance, but a metric nonetheless. \nI understand the call lasted for around 35 minutes and was the first conversation Joe Biden has had with a European leader as president. \nThe focus on climate change makes political and diplomatic sense. It's a topic where a Conservative prime minister and Democrat president can agree, and it matters particularly to the UK as the host of the COP26 UN Climate Change Summit in Glasgow in November.\nBut when you compare what Downing Street said about the call and what the White House said, one thing leaps out. \nNo 10's readout refers to a conversation about a trade deal. President Biden's does not. \nIt's widely expected there'll be no such agreement any time soon.\nMr Johnson and Mr Biden \"looked forward to to meeting in person as soon as the circumstances allow\" and to working together during the forthcoming G7, G20 and COP26 summits, the spokesman added.\nA White House statement said Mr Biden \"conveyed his intention to strengthen the special relationship\" between the US and UK and \"revitalize transatlantic ties\".\nCongratulating Mr Biden and Ms Harris - who is the first woman and first black and Asian-American person to serve as vice-president - the PM said earlier that their inauguration was a \"step forward\" for the US, which had \"been through a bumpy period\".\nMr Johnson said it was a \"big moment\" for the UK and the US and their \"joint common agenda\".\nThe BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg has said the Biden Presidency \"brings some hope to government\" because No 10 believes \"there is a lot of overlap\" between what Mr Biden and Mr Johnson want to do.\nThe US president has previously said that he does not want a \"guarded border\" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland following Brexit, and that any UK-US post-Brexit trade deal had to be \"contingent\" on respect for the Good Friday Agreement.\nThe PM and Mr Biden have never met in real life, but the new US president once referred to Mr Johnson as a \"physical and emotional clone\" of Mr Trump.\nAfter winning the presidential election, Mr Biden phoned Mr Johnson ahead of other European leaders and expressed his desire to strengthen the historic \"special relationship\" between the two countries."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

I broke no actual Covid-19 regulations.\"\nHe said since the start of the pandemic he had \"followed the Covid-19 regulations to the letter\". \n\"As with everyone across Wales, I have not seen family members or friends, I've not eaten at my favourite restaurants and, like you, we enjoyed a subdued Christmas compared to other years.\"\nHe said he was  grateful for the support of his colleagues in the Welsh Conservative Party during \"this difficult time\", especially his wife Julie and Senedd colleagues who he said had \" offered empathy, trust and advice\".\nHe said: \"Over the last couple of days, I have been speaking with colleagues in the Senedd and the wider Conservative Party. \n\"Whilst they have confirmed they do not wish to see me step down, I believe that my actions are becoming a distraction from holding this failing Welsh Labour-led Government to account.\"\nAnnouncing he was standing down as chief whip, Mr Millar, the MS for Clwyd West since 2007, said: \"While I am advised that I did not breach coronavirus regulations I am very sorry for my actions, especially given the impact of the tough restrictions that people and businesses are enduring.\n\"For this reason, and given that Paul Davies has resigned as Welsh Conservative Group Leader in the Senedd, I have decided to step down from my front bench role in the Welsh Parliament.\"\nChairman of the Welsh Conservative Party Glyn Davies said: \"We accept Paul's decision to step down, and would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his service as leader of the Conservative group in the Senedd.\"\nHe said the process to find a successor would now get under way.\nHad he stayed in post, Paul Davies would have been a wounded leader heading into the Senedd elections in May.\nA set of elections which his party has high hopes for, in the wake of their 2019 General Election performance where they made big inroads into Labour strongholds in the north east of Wales.\nHis successor will want to turn attention back to Labour's handling of the vaccine roll out, where Tory party members felt they had been making headway until this own goal from their senior team in the Senedd came to light.\nBut Mr Davies' departure could also bring into the open a broader debate within the party about their stance on devolution and whether they should be more overtly sceptical to head off the challenge from abolitionist parties. \nHelen Mary Jones, the Plaid Cymru Mid and West MS, said: \"Even when the Tory Senedd group was giving its unanimous support to the leader and chief whip, it was obvious to everyone else that their positions were untenable. \n\"Everyone will be asking what took them so long. No amount of rearranging the deckchairs will make a chaotic and increasingly right-wing Tory party fit to govern Wales.\"\nSecretary of State for Wales, Simon Hart MP, said he had \"greatly enjoyed working alongside Paul over the last year following our best general election result in Wales since 1983\".\nThe Conservative MP for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire continued: \"He has played a crucial role in helping link the Welsh and UK Government as we fight the Covid-19 pandemic, and has been undeterred in his pursuit to hold the Welsh Labour Government to account since 2018.\" \nThe Conservative MS for South Wales Central David Melding tweeted to say he fully supported Mr Davies' decision. \nHe continued: \"There is dignity in accepting responsibility even when actions were unintentional. \n\"My hope is that Paul will be given the space and support to rebuild his political career. He has so much to offer the WCP [Welsh Conservative Party] and Senedd.\""

      "tags": "Medical research,Vaccination,James Gallagher,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The rapid spread of a new variant of coronavirus has been blamed for the introduction of strict tier four mixing rules for millions of people, harsher restrictions on mixing at Christmas in England, Scotland and Wales, and other countries placing the UK on a travel ban.\nSo how has it gone from being non-existent to the most common form of the virus in parts of England in a matter of months?\nThe government's advisers on new infections now say they have \"high\" confidence that it is more able to transmit than other variants. \nAll the work is at an early stage, contains huge uncertainties and a long list of unanswered questions. \nAs I've written before, viruses mutate all the time and it's vital to keep a laser focus on whether the virus' behaviour is changing. \nThree things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention:\nAll of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily. \nHowever, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London, which had only tier two restrictions until recently. \nBut already the justification for tier four restrictions is in part to reduce the spread of the variant.\n\"Laboratory experiments are required, but do you want to wait weeks or months [to see the results and take action to limit the spread]? Probably not in these circumstances,\" Prof Nick Loman, from the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, told me.\nIt was first detected in September. In November around a quarter of cases in London were the new variant. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December. \nYou can see how the variant has come to dominate the results of testing in some centres such as the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Laboratory.\nMathematicians have been running the numbers on the spread of different variants in an attempt to calculate how much of an edge this one might have. \nBut teasing apart what is due to people's behaviour and what is due to the virus is hard.\nThe figure mentioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnson was that the variant may be up to 70% more transmissible. He said this may be increasing the R number - which indicates if an epidemic is growing or shrinking - by 0.4. \nThat 70% number appeared in a presentation by Dr Erik Volz, from Imperial College London, on Friday. \nDuring the talk he said: \"It is really too early to tell\u2026 but from what we see so far it is growing very quickly, it is growing faster than [a previous variant] ever grew, but it is important to keep an eye on this.\"\nThere is no \"nailed on\" figure for how much more infectious the variant may be. Scientists, whose work is not yet public, have told me figures both much higher and much lower than 70%. \nBut there remain questions about whether it is any more infectious at all. \n\"The amount of evidence in the public domain is woefully inadequate to draw strong or firm opinions on whether the virus has truly increased transmission,\" said Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham. \nIt is thought the variant either emerged in a patient in the UK or has been imported from a country with a lower ability to monitor coronavirus mutations.\nThe variant can be found across the UK, except Northern Ireland, but it is heavily concentrated in London, the South East and eastern England. Cases elsewhere in the country do not seem to have taken off.  \nData from Nextstrain, which has been monitoring the genetic codes of the viral samples around the world, suggest cases in Denmark and Australia have come from the UK. The Netherlands has also reported cases.\nA similar variant that has emerged in South Africa shares some of the same mutations, but appears to be unrelated to this one.\nYes.\nThe virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China, is not the same one you will find in most corners of the world. \nThe D614G mutation emerged in Europe in February and became the globally dominant form of the virus. \nAnother, called A222V, spread across Europe and was linked to people's summer holidays in Spain.\nAn initial analysis of the new variant has been published and identifies 17 potentially important alterations. \nThere have been changes to the spike protein - this is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway to our body's cells. \nOne mutation called N501Y alters the most important part of the spike, known as the \"receptor-binding domain\".\nThis is where the spike makes first contact with the surface of our body's cells. Any changes that make it easier for the virus to get inside are likely to give it an edge. \n\"It looks and smells like an important adaptation,\" said Prof Loman.\nThe other mutation - a H69/V70 deletion, in which a small part of the spike is removed - has emerged several times before, including famously in infected mink.\nWork by Prof Ravi Gupta at the University of Cambridge has suggested this mutation increases infectivity two-fold in lab experiments. \nStudies by the same group suggest the deletion makes antibodies from the blood of survivors less effective at attacking the virus. \nProf Gupta told me: \"It is rapidly increasing, that's what's worried government, we are worried, most scientists are worried.\"\nThe variant is unusually highly mutated.\nThe most likely explanation is the variant has emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus.\nInstead their body became a breeding ground for the virus to mutate. \nThere is no evidence to suggest that it does, although this will need to be monitored.\nHowever, just increasing transmission would be enough to cause problems for hospitals. \nIf the new variant means more people are infected more quickly, that would in turn lead to more people needing hospital treatment.\nAlmost certainly yes, or at least for now. \nAll three leading vaccines develop an immune response against the existing spike, which is why the question comes up.\nVaccines train the immune system to attack several different parts of the virus, so even though part of the spike has mutated, the vaccines should still work.\n\"But if we let it add more mutations, then you start worrying,\" said Prof Gupta.\n\"This virus is potentially on a pathway for vaccine escape, it has taken the first couple of steps towards that.\"\nVaccine escape happens when the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine and continues to infect people.\nThis may be the most concerning element of what is happening with the virus.\nThis variant is just the latest to show the virus is continuing to adapt as it infects more and more of us. \nA presentation by Prof David Robertson, from the University of Glasgow on Friday, concluded: \"The virus will probably be able to generate vaccine escape mutants.\"\nThat would put us in a position similar to flu, where the vaccines need to be regularly updated. Fortunately the vaccines we have are very easy to tweak.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "Russian police have detained more than 3,000 people in a crackdown on protests in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, monitors say.\nTens of thousands of people defied a heavy police presence to join some of the largest rallies against President Vladimir Putin in years.\nIn Moscow, riot police were seen beating and dragging away protesters.\nMr Navalny, President Putin's most high-profile critic, called for protests after his arrest last Sunday.\nHe was detained after he flew back to Moscow from Berlin, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal nerve agent attack in Russia last August. \nOn his return, he was immediately taken into custody and found guilty of violating parole conditions. He says it is a trumped-up case designed to silence him.\nOVD Info, an independent NGO that monitors rallies, said about 3,100 people had been detained, more than 1,200 of them in Moscow alone. The Kremlin has not commented.\nThe unauthorised demonstrations were held in about 100 cities and towns from Russia's Far East and Siberia to Moscow and St Petersburg. Protesters ranged from teenage students to elderly people who demanded Mr Navalny's release.\nAt least 40,000 people joined a rally in central Moscow, Reuters news agency estimated. But Russia's interior ministry put the number of protesters at 4,000. \nObservers say the scale of the demonstrations across the country was unprecedented while the protest in the capital was the largest in almost a decade. \nIn the city's Pushkin square, some protesters chanted \"Freedom to Navalny\" and \"Putin go away!\" One woman told the BBC she had decided to join the demonstration because \"Russia has been turned into a prison camp\".\nSergei Radchenko, a 53-year-old protester in Moscow, told Reuters: \"I'm tired of being afraid. I haven't just turned up for myself and Navalny, but for my son because there is no future in this country.\"\nLyubov Sobol, a prominent aide of Mr Navalny who had already been fined for urging Russians to join the protests, tweeted a video of police roughly pulling her away from an interview with reporters.\nMr Navalny's wife, Yulia, was briefly held at the rally. She posted an image on her Instagram account with the caption: \"Apologies for the poor quality. Very bad light in the police van.\"\nSome protesters marched on the high-security prison where Mr Navalny is being held, and many were arrested. \nMeanwhile, one independent news source, Sota, said at least 3,000 people had joined a demonstration in the city of Vladivostok, but local authorities there put the figure at 500. \nAFP footage showed riot police running into a crowd, and beating some of the protesters with batons. \nIn the Siberian city of Yakutsk, attendees at a small protest saw temperatures dip as low as -50C (-58F).\nPrior to the rallies, Russian authorities had promised a tough crackdown. Several of Mr Navalny's close aides, including his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh, were arrested earlier in the week.\nHis supporters called for more protests next weekend.\nThere were reports of disruption to mobile phone and internet coverage on Saturday, though it is not known if this was related to the protests.\nThe social media app TikTok had been flooded with videos promoting the demonstrations and sharing viral messages about Mr Navalny.\nIn response, Russia's official media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, demanded that TikTok take down any information \"encouraging minors to act illegally\", threatening large fines. The education ministry had told parents not to allow their children to attend any demonstrations.\nIn a push to gain support ahead of the protests, Mr Navalny's team released a video about a luxury Black Sea resort that they allege belongs to President Putin - an accusation denied by the Kremlin. The video has been watched by more than 65 million people. \nThe UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, condemned the \"use of violence against peaceful protesters and journalists\" on Saturday, calling on the authorities to release those detained during peaceful demonstrations.\nThe US state department condemned what it called \"harsh tactics\" used against protesters and journalists, saying: \"We call on Russian authorities to release all those detained for exercising their universal rights and for the immediate and unconditional release of Aleksey Navalny\".\nThe EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc's foreign ministers would discuss the Russian crackdown on Monday. \"I deplore widespread detentions, disproportionate use of force, cutting down internet and phone connections.\""

He says it is a trumped-up case designed to silence him.\nMore than 60m people have watched his new video about President Vladimir Putin's alleged luxury Black Sea palace.\nThe Kremlin denies the property belongs to the president.\nAmong those detained in Moscow on Thursday were his spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, and one of his lawyers, Lyubov Sobol. They face fines or short jail terms. \nMs Sobol, who has a young child, was later released. But Ms Yarmysh has now been jailed for nine days.\nProminent Navalny activists are also being held in the cities of Vladivostok, Novosibirsk and Krasnodar.\nUnauthorised rallies are being planned in more than 60 cities across Russia for Saturday. Moscow police say any unauthorised demonstrations and provocations will be \"immediately suppressed\".\nA thousand people were reported to have come onto the streets in the Khabarovsk region, with some of them already detained. \nMr Navalny's wife Yulia, who travelled back to Russia with him from Germany, said she would demonstrate in Moscow \"for myself, for him, for our children, for the values and the ideals that we share\".\nAlexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) has drawn millions of followers on social media, through slickly produced videos alleging large-scale official corruption. He has long denounced Mr Putin's administration as \"feudal\" and full of \"crooks and thieves\". \nFor a long time the Russian authorities made out that Alexei Navalny was irrelevant. Just a blogger. With a tiny following. No threat whatsoever.\nRecent events suggest the opposite. First Mr Navalny was targeted with a nerve agent, allegedly by a secret group of FSB state security hitmen. Instead of investigating the poisoning, Russia is investigating him: on his return from Germany the Kremlin critic was arrested. \nHaving put Mr Navalny behind bars, the authorities are putting pressure on his supporters. The Kremlin's greatest fear is of a Ukraine-style revolution in Russia that would sweep away those in power. \nThere's no indication that such a scenario is imminent. But with economic problems growing, the Kremlin will worry that Mr Navalny could act as a lightning rod for protest sentiment. That explains the police crackdown on Navalny allies ahead of Saturday's potential protests.\nPlus, this is getting personal. Mr Navalny's video about \"Putin's Palace\" on the Black Sea was designed to cause maximum embarrassment to the Russian president.\nIn the \"Putin's palace\" video Mr Navalny alleges that rich businessmen close to Mr Putin paid for a sumptuous 17,691sq m (190,424sq ft) palace for him at Gelendzhik, by the Black Sea.\nIt is alleged to have a casino, a theatre and many other comforts, including a vineyard and tea house in the sprawling grounds. The Kremlin dismissed the YouTube video as a \"pseudo-investigation\" aimed at earning money for Mr Navalny.\nProsecutors have warned people against protesting in support of Mr Navalny on Saturday. Russia's education ministry has told parents not to allow their children to attend. \nSome Russian celebrities in the arts and sports have pledged support for Mr Navalny. They include ice hockey star Artemi Panarin. \nFormer world chess champion Garry Kasparov - now a leading anti-Putin activist based in the US - tweeted that pro-Navalny posts were being widely blocked in Russia.\nIn a phone call to President Putin on Friday, EU Council President Charles Michel voiced \"grave concern\" about the jailing of Mr Navalny. \nMr Michel said the EU was \"united in its call on Russia to swiftly release Mr Navalny and proceed with the investigation into the assassination attempt on him, in full transparency and without further delay\".\nIn October, the EU imposed sanctions on six top Russian officials and a Russian chemical weapons research centre over the Novichok poisoning of Mr Navalny. \nThe Kremlin retaliated with tit-for-tat sanctions, denying any role in the attack and rejecting the expert finding that the Russian nerve agent had been used.\nThe social media app TikTok has a flood of videos from Russians promoting the protests planned for Saturday. The messages about Mr Navalny have been going viral for several days.\nA well-known Russian TikTok user, Slava Varfolomeyev, told BBC Russian: \"I go on TikTok and find that every third video is about 'Putin's palace', the detention of Navalny and the 23 January rally!\" \nHe said that on Thursday \"this swelled to a maximum: practically seven out of every 10 videos were on that topic [Navalny]\". TikTok's popularity is based on short-form videos. \nOn Wednesday Russia's official media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, demanded that TikTok take down any information \"encouraging minors to act illegally\", threatening large fines."

      "text": "The UK is at an \"extremely precarious\" point, according to the chief medical adviser, despite signs Covid infections are beginning to fall.\nThe virus's reproduction rate is estimated to be at or below one for the first time since early December. \nAnything below one means the epidemic is shrinking.\nBut cases are falling from a \"very, very high level\", Prof Chris Whitty said - and may still be increasing in some areas.\n\"A very small change and it could start taking off again from an extremely high base,\" he warned. \nSpeaking at a Number 10 press conference on Friday evening, the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the \"awful\" death rate would stay high \"for a little while before it starts coming down\".\n\"That was always what was predicted...and I think the information about the new variant doesn't change that\".\nEarly evidence suggests the variant of coronavirus that emerged in the UK may be more deadly, although findings are preliminary and there is a high level of uncertainty. \nDr Susan Hopkins at Public Health England said there was \"evidence from some but not all data sources which suggests that the variant of concern which was first detected in the UK may lead to a higher risk of death than the non-variant. \n\"Evidence on this variant is still emerging and more work is under way to fully understand how it behaves.\" \nThe Department of Health and Social Care said while the UK's R or reproduction number, might be below one - meaning a shrinking epidemic - overall, \"cases remain dangerously high and...it is essential that everyone continues to stay at home, whether they have had the vaccine or not.\"\nMeanwhile, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures suggested cases were decreasing slightly or levelling off across Britain. \nBut infections are falling more slowly than they did during the first lockdown - by somewhere around a quarter every fortnight compared with a halving back in April. \nA further 40,261 cases, and 1,401 deaths were recorded on Friday in the UK.\nMore than five million people had been given a first dose of the vaccine by 21 January, and about half a million had received their second dose.  \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said it is \"too early\" to say whether England's Covid restrictions will be able to end in the spring. \nWhile cases are falling or stable across the rest of the UK, in Northern Ireland cases have continued to rise and the new, more infectious strain has overtaken the older variant of the virus as of the start of January. \nDuring the week ending 16 January, about one in 55 people in England had the virus, the ONS estimated, with one in 35 in London testing positive. \nOne in 100 people had the virus in Scotland and one in 70 in Wales.\nBut in Northern Ireland infections have shot up from an an estimated one in 200 people testing positive in the week to 2 January, to one in 60 last week. \nONS statistician Sarah Crofts said while fewer people were testing positive in England, \"rates remain high and we estimate the level of infection is still over one million people\". \nAnd, she pointed out, \"the picture across the UK is mixed\".\nA survey by tech company ZOE and King's College London, based on swabs of people with and without symptoms, also suggested the R number could be at 0.8.\nAnd it estimated symptomatic cases had fallen by a quarter since last week.  \nMeanwhile, the proportion of people testing positive for the new Covid variant has risen considerably in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, ONS data suggest.\nBut the new strain, which remains by far the main source of infections in England, has yet to overtake the old strain in Scotland and Wales.\nWithin England, the proportion of infections that appear to be due to the new variant remained stable, but the gap between the regions is narrowing. \nIn the figures covering 2 January, 80% of infections looked like the new variant in London compared to 30% in the North East. \nTwo weeks later, that gap had narrowed to 70% in London versus 50% in the North East.\nIt is not clear what is behind the small fall in London, but it may be down to behaviour change, or other variants like the South Africa strain now in circulation and diluting the numbers.\nFollow Rachel on Twitter"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Senior doctors are calling on England's chief medical officer to cut the gap between the first and second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.\nProf Chris Whitty said extending the maximum wait from three to 12 weeks was a \"public health decision\" to get the first jab to more people across the UK.\nBut the British Medical Association said that was \"difficult to justify\" and should be changed to six weeks.\nIt comes as early evidence suggests the UK virus variant may be more deadly.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson told a Downing Street briefing on Friday: \"In addition to spreading more quickly, it also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant - the variant that was first identified in London and the south east - may be associated with a higher degree of mortality.\"\nPrevious work suggests the new variant spreads between 30% and 70% faster than others, and there are hints it is about 30% more deadly.\nFor example, the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said if 1,000 men in their 60s were infected with the old variant, roughly 10 of them would be expected to die - but this rises to about 13 with the new variant.\nAnother 1,348 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK on Saturday, in addition to 33,552 new infections, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard.\nThe government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says unpublished data suggests the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is still effective with doses 12 weeks apart - but Pfizer has said it has tested its vaccine's efficacy only when the two doses were given up to 21 days apart.\nThe World Health Organization has recommended a gap of four weeks between doses - to be extended only in exceptional circumstances to six weeks. \nGovernment minister Robert Jenrick said the current strategy ensured \"millions more people can get the first jab\" and the \"high level of protection\" which it offered.\nHe said the BMA's concerns would be taken into account but that the government was following the \"very clear advice\" of the medicines regulator and the UK's four chief medical officers who, he said, \"could not have been clearer that this is the right thing to do for this country\".\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care added: \"Our number one priority is to give protection against coronavirus to as many vulnerable people as possible, as quickly as possible.\"\nIn the letter to Prof Whitty, seen by the BBC, the British Medical Association (BMA) said it agreed that the vaccine should be rolled out \"as quickly as possible\" - but called for an urgent review and for the gap to be reduced.\nThe doctors' union said the UK's strategy \"has become increasingly isolated internationally\" and \"is proving evermore difficult to justify\".\n\"The absence of any international support for the UK's approach is a cause of deep concern and risks undermining public and the profession's trust in the vaccination programme,\" the letter said.\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the BMA, said there were \"growing concerns\" that the vaccine could become less effective with doses 12 weeks apart.\n\"Obviously the protection will not vanish after six weeks, but what we do not know is what level of protection will be offered [after that point],\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\"We should not be extrapolating data when we don't have it.\"\nHe said while he understands the rationale behind the decision, \"no other nation has adopted the UK's approach\". \n\"We think the flexibility that the WHO offers of extending to 42 days is being stretched far too much to go from six weeks right through to 12 weeks,\" he added. \nThere has been understandable enthusiasm over a promising start to the hugely ambitious UK vaccination rollout.\nBut there has been some tension over the decision to lengthen the time between doses for the Pfizer vaccine to 12 weeks. \nProf Whitty and other health leaders and experts say this will allow many more people to get vaccinated quickly and the first dose gives most of the protection. \nBut critics argue this goes against Pfizer's recommendation of a three-week gap and there is no data to back up the long delay. \nThe intervention of the BMA is significant as it shows senior doctors now have widespread concerns, including worries about reliability of supplies if people have to wait longer for a second jab. \nThis is a private letter to Chris Whitty seen by the BBC and not a grandstanding press release. The BMA wants to have talks with the chief medical adviser about moving to six weeks.\nProf Whitty will no doubt restate his case, but it will be interesting to see whether the BMA argument gains traction in the wider medical world. \nThe BMA also suggested second doses might not be guaranteed after a 12-week delay \"given the unpredictability of supplies\".\nHowever, Public Health England's medical director said people would get their second dose.\nDr Yvonne Doyle told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she backed the current strategy, saying it was \"about bearing down on transmission\" to reduce deaths and reduce the chance of more dangerous variants of the virus emerging.\n\"The more people that are protected against this virus, the less opportunity it has to get the upper hand,\" she said.\nOther issues highlighted in the letter include:\nThe UK's chief medical officers have said the \"great majority\" of initial protection comes from the first jab, while the second dose is likely to help that protection last longer.\nIn total, the UK has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and 40 million of the Pfizer vaccine. \nBoth vaccines are expected to work against the variant of Covid-19 that emerged in the UK.\nWhat has been your experience of receiving the vaccine?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,Italy,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte says a delay in the supply of coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca is \"unacceptable\". \nBoth companies have warned they will not be able to deliver vaccines to the EU as agreed due to production issues. \nMr Conte has accused them of serious contract violations. \nA senior Italian health official has warned that the country will have to rethink its vaccination programme if supply issues continue. \nThe AstraZeneca vaccine, developed by Oxford University, has not yet been given EU approval; however the bloc's drug regulator is expected to give it the green light at the end of this month. \nA spokesman for AstraZeneca said on Friday that \"initial volumes will be lower than originally anticipated\" without giving further details.\nOfficials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but an unnamed EU official told Reuters news agency that deliveries would be reduced to 31m - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year.\nThe drug firm had been set to deliver about 80m doses to the 27 nations by March, according to the official who spoke to Reuters. \nLast week Pfizer announced it was slowing supplies to Europe to make manufacturing changes that will boost capacity. The EU has ordered 600 million doses from Pfizer.  \nOn Saturday, Mr Conte wrote on Facebook: \"Our vaccination plan ... has been drawn up on the basis of contractual pledges freely undertaken by pharmaceutical companies with the European Commission.\"\n\"Such delays in deliveries represent serious contractual violations, which cause enormous damage to Italy and other countries,\" he added. \nThe head of Italy's Higher Health Council Franco Locatelli said Pfizer deliveries were 29% lower than planned this week but the levels were expected to return to those agreed by 1 February. \nMr Conte vowed to use \"all available legal tools\". \nPoland has also vowed to take action over the delay. \nAustrian media have reported that only 600,000 of 2m AstraZeneca doses promised by the end of March will arrive in the country on time, with the remaining 1.4m now being delivered in April.  \nA delay would be \"completely unacceptable\", Austrian Health Minister Rudolf Anschober said on Friday. \nHungary's government, which has complained over the time it is taking EU regulators to approve the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, has reached a deal with Russia to buy up large quantities of its Sputnik V vaccine, even though it has not received EU approval.\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel, who led a call with EU leaders this week, said on Thursday that officials were considering all ideas to try and stop future vaccine delays. \n\"All possible means will be examined to ensure rapid supply, including early distribution to avoid delays,\" he said.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Mr Michel both say they are still aiming for the target of 70% of the EU population being vaccinated by summer.\nThere has been criticism and frustration across the region about the speed of vaccination roll-outs.\nIsrael, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, and the US are all well ahead of EU nations in terms of doses given per capita so far.\nThe European Commission has co-ordinated orders for all member states, with vaccines then distributed based on their population size.\nVaccines are seen by public health experts as an important part of a route out of the Covid-19 crisis, with many European nations struggling to cope with a deadly surge of the virus over the winter period. \nThe total number of German Covid-19 deaths climbed above 50,000 on Friday - a day after the country warned that it could close its borders if other EU countries were less strict in controlling the virus. Berlin sounded the alarm amid rising concern about new variants.\nEU leaders agreed late on Thursday to keep their internal borders open but warned non-essential travel might need to be restricted to curb the spread of the virus. \nMs von der Leyen said Thursday that more testing and \"targeted measures\" were needed throughout the EU in order to keep internal and external borders open. \nFor its part, France said it would impose tighter travel restrictions for European arrivals from Sunday, requiring a negative PCR Covid test within three days of travel.\nIn the Netherlands, a ban on all flights from the UK, South Africa and South American countries came into effect on Saturday to try and prevent new coronavirus variants gaining a foothold.\nLooking ahead to the future, officials from EU nations reliant on tourism - including Spain and Greece - have floated the possibility of using vaccination certificates to allow for cross-border travel but there has been scepticism within the bloc.

The next day is day one of self-isolation.\nYou can leave self-isolation after five full days if you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart.\nYou can take the first on day five. If it's negative, you can take another test 24 hours later on day six. If this is also negative - and you don't have a temperature - you can immediately end isolation. \nThe rules apply whether or not you are vaccinated.  \nThe current self-isolation regulations run out on 24 March.\nThe prime minister has told MPs he does not expect to renew the rules and said they could end sooner - if Covid data allows.\nHe said that \"as Covid becomes endemic\" (in other words, constantly present) the government will \"replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others\". \nThis would be similar to advice for other infectious diseases such as flu. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid also said he was \"optimistic\" the government would shortly be able to \"remove all restrictions around Covid\".\nIt is not clear whether the rest of the UK would follow suit. \nIn Scotland and Wales you must self-isolate for at least seven days as soon as symptoms appear.\nPeople without symptoms who have a positive LFT result should also self-isolate immediately. They don't need to take a PCR test, although clinically vulnerable people in Wales are advised to do so.\nYou can end self-isolation after two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart - the first no earlier than day six. If you don't have a temperature, you can stop self-isolating after the second negative test, on day seven.\nIf the day six test is positive, you can take two further tests on subsequent days.\nThe guidance applies whatever your vaccination status.\nAnyone leaving self-isolation is \"strongly advised\" to limit close contact with people in crowded or poorly-ventilated spaces. \nThey should work from home and minimise contact with people at higher risk from Covid.\nThe rules about self-isolation after contact with someone with Covid are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or until 10 days since your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to under-18s (18 years and four months in Scotland; 18 years and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test.\nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. \nIn Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nSelf-isolation means staying at home and not going out.\nAdults shouldn't go to work and children shouldn't go to school. \nYou should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to deliver supplies.\nNo-one from outside your household should come inside, unless to deliver essential care.\nIf you have symptoms or test positive, you should: \nPeople on a low income who are told to isolate may be entitled to some financial help:"

      "text": "The second impeachment trial of Donald Trump will begin next month under an agreement reached between Senate Democrats and Republicans.\nHouse of Representatives Democrats will send the charge of \"inciting insurrection\" to the Senate on Monday.\nBut arguments will not begin until the week of 8 February, allowing Mr Trump's lawyers two weeks to build a defence.\nDemocrats accuse the ex-president of instigating the deadly 6 January riot at the US Capitol.\nThe House last week paved the way for the Senate proceedings by charging Mr Trump with inciting the violence, which left five people dead. \nHis second impeachment trial will begin almost exactly a year after the Senate acquitted him on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. That case related to accusations he pressured Ukraine to help smear Joe Biden and his son.\nMr Trump's term ended on Wednesday and he left Washington, snubbing his successor Joe Biden's inauguration.\nHis speech to a rally ahead of the Capitol riot are at the heart of the case against him. The then-president told protesters near the White House to \"peacefully and patriotically\" make their voices heard as they prepared to march towards the US Capitol building, which houses the US Congress. He also told them to \"fight like hell\".\nTop Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said on Friday that the House would deliver the impeachment article - or charge - on Monday. \n\"The Senate will conduct a trial of the impeachment of Donald Trump. It will be a full trial. It will be a fair trial,\" Mr Schumer said, speaking on the floor of the Senate.\nHouse Democrats say the article will be passed to the upper chamber of Congress at 19:00 local time on Monday. Democratic impeachment managers, lawmakers from the House who will act as prosecutors during the Senate trial, will be sworn in on Tuesday.\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell's office said he was glad Mr Schumer had agreed to his request for more time during the pre-trial phase, and that the trial itself would begin on 9 February. \nA statement said: \"Especially given the fast and minimal process in the House, Republicans set out to ensure the Senate's next steps will respect former President Trump's rights and due process, the institution of the Senate, and the office of the presidency. \n\"That goal has been achieved. This is a win for due process and fairness.\" \nEarlier on Friday, President Biden also appeared to suggest he would prefer a later trial. He told reporters, referring to the urgent domestic issues that he wants to pass legislation to address: \"The more time we have to get up and running to meet these crises, the better.\"\nThe White House will however not say whether Mr Biden thinks Mr Trump should be convicted. \n\"[Joe Biden] is no longer in the Senate and it's up to the Senate and the Congress to hold the former president accountable,\" said press secretary Jen Psaki when asked on Friday.\nEven though Democrats now hold a narrow Senate majority, they would need the support of at least 17 Republicans in order to convict Mr Trump, because a two-thirds vote is required.\nBut Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, told CNN on Friday: \"The chances of getting a conviction are virtually nil.\"\nOnly five Republican senators - Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania - are seen as potential defectors. \nMr Trump will be the first former US president ever to be tried by the Senate. No president has ever been convicted in such proceedings, and if Mr Trump were found guilty he could end up being barred from future office.\nOn Friday, Mr Trump was approached by a reporter from the Washington Examiner at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.\u00a0\nThe former president was asked about his future plans. \"We'll do something, but not just yet,\" he told the journalist from his regular table at the private club before an aide cut short the brief encounter.\u00a0\nMr Trump is residing five miles away at his other golf club, Mar-a-Lago, which he calls his \"Winter White House\"."

It needs to be below 1.0 for the number of cases to start falling.\nProf Axel Gandy of London's Imperial College said the differences between the viruses types was \"quite extreme\".  \n\"There is a huge difference in how easily the variant virus spreads,\" he told BBC News. \"This is the most serious change in the virus since the epidemic began,\"  he added.\nThe Imperial College study suggests transmission of the new variant tripled during England's November lockdown while the previous version was reduced by a third.\nCases of Covid-19 have begun to increase rapidly during the second spike, and the number of cases recorded in a single day reached a new high on Thursday.\nNew coronavirus variant: What do we know?\nCases of new variant appear worldwide\nEarly results indicated that the virus was spreading more quickly among under-20s, particularly among secondary school age children. \nBut the very latest data indicates that it was spreading quickly across all age groups, according to Prof Gandy who was a member of the research team.\n\"One possible explanation is that the early data was collected during the time of the November lockdown where schools were open and the activities of the adult population were more restricted. We are seeing now that the new virus has increased infectiousness across all age groups.\"\nProf Jim Naismith, of Oxford University, said he believed that the new findings indicated that even tougher restrictions would soon be needed.\n\"The data from Imperial represent the best analysis to date and imply that the measures we have employed to date, would - with the new virus - fail to reduce the R number to below 1.\n\"In simpler terms, unless we do something different the new virus strain is going to continue to spread, more infections, more hospitalisations and more deaths.\"\nThe R number is the average number of people an infected person infects. If it is above 1 the epidemic is growing.\nThe most chilling finding from this piece of research is that the November lockdown in England, hard though it was for many people, would not have stopped the variant form of the virus spreading. The same severe restrictions that saw cases of the previous version of the virus fall by a third, would see a tripling of the new variant. This is why there has been such a sudden tightening of restrictions across the country. \nIt is unclear whether the current restrictions will be enough to control the spread of the virus. Given the fact that it has taken two lockdowns to stop the earlier version of the virus overwhelming the NHS, many scientists fear that further tightening will be necessary.  \nInfection levels will begin to drop as enough people are vaccinated. But until then it is now more important than ever for people to follow social distancing guidelines, wear masks where required and to regularly wash their hands.\nThe new year brings with it hope of a more normal life in the next few months but also a new form of the virus that all of us will have to combat in the coming days and weeks.\nProfessor Lawrence Young, of Warwick University, said early indications suggested that vaccines would be effective against the new form of the virus.\n\"Variants virus have been around since the beginning of the pandemic and are a product of the natural process by which viruses develop and adapt to their hosts as they replicate.  \n\"Most of these mutations have no effect on the behaviour of the virus but very occasionally they can improve the ability of the virus to infect and/or become more resistant to the body's immune response.\"\nFurther research is needed to understand why the variant is spreading so quickly. But early indications are that vaccines should be effective against it.\nThe new virus has been designated \"Variant of Concern 202012/01\" or VOC by Public Health England.\nIt was detected in November and thought to have originated in the south-east England in September. \nThere is no evidence to suggest that it is more deadly, but it will increase the number of cases which in turn will add further pressure on the NHS.\nThe variant can now be found across the UK, except Northern Ireland, but it is heavily concentrated in London, as well as south-east and eastern England.

To have five die on one day is unprecedented.\n\"That's been a real struggle for their families and for the staff dealing with it.\"\nFour additional medical wards have opened to cope with the impact of coronavirus at Morriston, with about 300 patients being treated.\nDr Gorst said: \"If it wasn't for the treatment given on the wards, intensive care would have been completely overwhelmed.\n\"However, when patients have failed on these treatments, sadly the safety net of the intensive care unit [and] getting them on an invasive ventilator, largely doesn't work.\n\"Most patients who come to intensive care to go on an intensive ventilator, sadly, will not survive.\n\"These patients are mostly of working age. They don't have any significant medical conditions.\"\n\"This is alien to us as an intensive care unit. We expect far more patients to survive. Now they are not.\"\nMorriston's senior matron Carol Doggett agreed that the \"number of sicker patients has definitely increased\", and she said they were younger than had been experienced in the first wave of the pandemic.\n\"That should be a stark warning to anyone not to take chances with this,\" she said.\nOn Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said there was cause for concern over new variants of Covid-19.\n\"We know the new highly contagious strain - sometimes called the Kent variant - is now widespread across Wales,\" he said.\nHe also said the government was closely monitoring three new variant variants: one from South Africa and two from Brazil.\nSix cases of the South African variant have been identified in Wales."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Welsh government,NHS Wales",
      "text": "It is hoped 70% of the over-80s in Wales will get the first dose of a Covid vaccine by the end of the weekend.\nBut it could be a few days before the official figures are published so we know for sure. \nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said, because he has access to \"day-by-day\" data, it gives him confidence to know that by the end of Sunday, the target should be met\nBut with criticism of a slow start to its vaccination roll-out, has Wales been lagging behind other nations?\nWales reported 28,230 first dose vaccinations on Saturday - a 29% rise in its daily total on the day before.\nIf this was maintained at the same level, it is well on course to see the target of first doses of the first four priority groups being met by 14 February.\nWith 7.6% of the population getting the first dose, this is now even a little ahead of Scotland (7%), based on rates of population. \nEngland has reached 9% of its population. But comparisons are complicated and here's why. \nThe vaccine figures we see every day are already a few days old. It takes up to five days after a person receives a dose for the data to be actually published. \nGPs are asked to input data as soon as possible but it then has to be checked and verified by the national immunisation service and Public Health Wales - to ensure people aren't double-counted for instance - before it is actually published.\nSo there is a built-in lag between what NHS Wales bosses are seeing happening daily and when we see the figures.\nOne health official said they were under-reporting rather than leaving \"any chance of over-reporting\".\nThat enables Mr Drakeford, from the information he has to hand each day, to have confidence.\n\"Ministers every day see information, operational data that comes in from the health service, more or less, in real time,\" he said. \n\"The statistics that are published every day have a lag in them. They have to be collected formally from the health service. \n\"They have to be interrogated, they have to be quality assured, and then they are published as formal figures.\"\nIn England, \"real time\" data is published the next day, which is then subject to changes if necessary at a later date.\nSo, the official figures from NHS England - showing a higher rate - are actually ahead in time compared to Wales. \nIt pointed to its website which states that data was \"provisional\", showing doses, as reported by midnight on the date before publication. \n\"The weekly release then provides more accurate and detailed data by dose and age,\" it added. \nWales had 6% of people given a first dose by 21 January, England had reached 6% four days earlier - but without the publishing lag.\nThe figure for Saturday was 9% of population in England and 7.6% in Wales. Four days earlier, the figure in England was 6.5%.\nWales admittedly seemed to make a slow start last month, compared to other UK nations.\nOne of the explanations from health bosses in Wales is that it was a product of the different approaches taken by the UK nations to start with. \nThey expect things to even out between now and February.\nNorthern Ireland focused on mobile vaccination units to care homes, England focused on its primary care hubs, doing about two-thirds of vaccinations, while Wales started with mass vaccination centres before bringing in its network of GPs - increasing as more of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine became available.\nSome GPs were frustrated they did not get supplies early on. This was because vaccine batches could not be split up and had to be sent in their original sized packs, but as supplies increased this issue was expected to be ironed out.\nHealth officials in Wales said GPs were condensing a lot of their vaccine clinics from Wednesday onwards and then into the weekends.\nVaccination figures are not normally published at weekends in Wales in any case. But with the data lag, we should see the proof in the pudding later in the week.\nA total of 650,000 in the four first priority groups are expected to get first doses of vaccines by mid-February.\nMass vaccination centres (MVCs) - about 40% will be delivered through this network of approximately 35 centres, with the Pfizer vaccine. These includes healthcare and care home workers, and in the weeks to come the over-70s and second doses. If there is more supply of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, some MVCs could be adapted to take this too.\nGP practices - about 48% of vaccines are expected for the first priority groups from 250 GP centres, involving Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines to the over-80s initially.\nMobile units will deliver about 5% to isolated people and those in care homes and 7% by a hybrid model with vaccine centres that might open for short time. \nThe planning of the programme and how many vaccines will be delivered from these different areas of the health service will depend on supply, but health officials are planning for centres opening later - including possibly 24 hours in future.\nThey are looking to train opticians and dentists to help, as well as the likes of St John Ambulance and 50 firefighters.\nNHS Wales is using what has been called its own \"seamless\" booking and tracking system for the immunisation programme. \nUpdated four times a day, it manages supply and can see who is scheduled to be vaccinated and where. \nIt means appointments can be sent quickly, which can be used by GPs, to see who on their list may have been seen and to hopefully avoid double bookings.\nHealth officials certainly hope so. They say since the start of the roll-out, 180,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and 140,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca doses - 320,000 in all - have gone out to health boards, will \"go into arms\" and will start to show up in figures. \nThe gap between supplies going out and actual vaccinations is getting smaller all the time, indicating a step-up.\nFriday's figures showed 30% of over-80s and 60% of care home residents had received a first dose; on Saturday it had risen to 38.7% and 63.2%. These would be lagged figures. \nHowever, the changes in daily numbers for the over-80s - increases of 11,500 and 15,451 in successive days - suggest we are starting to see the results of the roll-out in GP clinics.\nThe hope is that 70% of over-80s and care home residents will have had the vaccine (or been offered it, they might refuse) by the weekend. The target is that all will be reached by the end of January.\nIf at the current rate - and if it stayed the same - that 70% target for the over-80s would be reached in about six days. But the trend is expected to be upward.\nThose in charge of the programme say they can see a steep rise in the numbers of over-80s and care home staff getting their dose, while the health minister said he expected the programme to \"significantly ramp up\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The idea of a flat \u00a3500 payment to anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 has been dismissed by the UK government. Health officials had come up with the suggestion in the hope of encouraging people with the illness to self-isolate.\nThere are concerns the virus is continuing to spread because some people are ignoring the instruction to stay home when they show symptoms or test positive. Downing Street has said there is already a \u00a3500 sum for those on low incomes who could not work from home and had to isolate. But this must be applied for and there have been high rejection rates in England at least, A behaviour expert who advises the government, told the BBC  just 18% of people with symptoms were self-isolating for the full 10 days they were meant to.\nSo how do other countries handle the question of paying people to stay at home, or just trusting they will do the right thing? Here, BBC correspondents from Prague to New York, offer an insight.\nIn Portugal, even those who are just at-risk of contracting Covid - having been in direct contact with a confirmed case - are entitled to 100% of their basic salary, for 14 days, writes Alison Roberts, in Lisbon.\nFor those who show symptoms, or have tested positive, the same is available for up to 28 days. And the normal waiting times people are used to when claiming while ill have also been done away with - these Covid payments kick in on day one of isolation.\nThose not on permanent work contracts tend to be treated as self-employed and are eligible for benefits based on income declared. But there are a lot of people, including many immigrants, who lack the necessary paperwork, and are therefore not eligible to claim.\nNevertheless, it's perhaps not surprising that, because people are able to claim full basic pay, there hasn't been much, if any, debate about people obeying self-isolation. If there are reports of people not seeking tests, or not isolating, it seems to be more out of ignorance, which is certainly rather worrying. \nSlovenia has been offering compensation to people forced to self-isolate after exposure to coronavirus since it first introduced emergency measures in March, writes Guy De Launey in Ljubljana.\nDepending on the circumstances, this covers anything from 80% to the full amount of usual earnings. The payments may be made directly to people in quarantine, or as compensation to employers. A government official told the BBC that with its socialist past, it was normal for Slovenia to take care of people in quarantine by providing payments - and that without compensation, it would be impossible to deal with coronavirus.\nWhen the measures were first introduced, they enjoyed broad public support. But the second wave of the epidemic has seen case numbers skyrocket - Slovenia's per capita death-rate is now the third highest in the world - and public confidence overall has dipped.\nBy the end of 2020, market research company Valicon said that only 12% of Slovenians viewed the government's measures as \"appropriate\", adding that people were \"worried and dissatisfied with the social situation\", suggesting compensation is not a panacea. \nIn March last year, the US agreed to pay for some workers to stay at home - a big change for a country that had never paid sick leave requirement before, writes Natalie Sherman in New York.\nThe measure guaranteed up to 14 days of pay for workers forced to isolate because they had symptoms, had received medical advice to self-quarantine, or were under government lockdown orders. It also said it would guarantee two-thirds of pay for people caring for someone with the virus for up to two weeks. One study suggested it helped prevent hundreds of news cases a day.\nBut the assistance - paid by employers which were then reimbursed by the government via tax credits - expired on 31 December. And even before that, analysts estimated that loopholes meant roughly half of the country's workforce, including many grocery workers and medical staff were potentially excluded.\nAs part of his $1.9tn stimulus plan, President Joe Biden is pushing to renew the law, and end the exemptions. But the proposal - which his team estimates would expand the benefit to as many as 106 million more Americans - faces stiff resistance from Republicans and key business lobbies. \nIn Germany financial support is generous for people ordered to self-isolate by the authorities because of infection risk, writes Damien McGuinness in Berlin.\nAs a result there hasn't been a debate in Germany about breaking self-isolation rules because of financial need. Fines can be huge - tens of thousands of euros - and are strictly enforced. Overall there's no great issue with compliance and Germany's financial package has widespread cross-party backing, and is supported by voters. \nEmployees who are unable to work at home receive full pay for up to six weeks. This is paid by the employer, who is then reimbursed by the state. After that, workers may be eligible for sick-pay. \nFreelancers and self-employed people are generally also entitled to full pay for six weeks. But they would apply directly to their regional government. The exact rules and level of efficiency for payments vary from region to region. For those in the gig economy - Germany has it, though less so than Britain - this should be covered by state aid, based on tax returns. \nThe level of state support was agreed by Germany's national parliament in Berlin. But payments are administered and funded by regional governments.\nThere's been some discussion here about paying people to stay home if they test positive for Covid, writes Rob Cameron, in Prague.\n The idea is advocated by at least one independent expert group. But it would be expensive, and the Czech state coffers are already stretched from keeping employees on furlough and paying compensation. \nInstead, salaried employees who receive a positive diagnosis are left with two choices: work from home - if they're up to it, if their job allows it and if their employer agrees, or go on sick leave for 10 days and receive 60% salary.\nFor the self-employed it's worse. Only those who have chosen to pay state sickness insurance will receive anything. Most opt out - the benefits are marginal. So most continue working from home - if their health and profession allows it.\nFor many workers, in other words, a positive Covid test can be a real blow to the wallet. It's an open secret that many people - especially freelancers in creative professions - beg friends and colleagues who test positive not to declare them as contacts, to avoid having to go into quarantine. For some the fear of losing work and money outweighs social responsibility.\nMoves to compensate people for taking time off work have largely been well received, writes Maddy Savage in Stockholm. \nTo encourage people to stay at home from the moment they develop coronavirus symptoms, the government changed the rules to allow Swedish employees and the self-employed to claim sick pay from the first day they are off, rather than the second. Employees receive about 80% of their salary while they isolate (capped at SEK 700 or \u00a361.88 per day), and the self-employed are entitled to payments capped at 804 SEK or \u00a371.05. The government has also introduced an allowance for people isolating because they live with someone who has coronavirus. \nWhile Sweden has largely kept primary schools open throughout the pandemic, parents have been able to make use of a pre-existing benefit which allows them to take state-funded time off work if their children are ill (with the virus or any other illness), and an additional benefit has been introduced for parents who are forced to take time off work to look after children affected by school closures as a result of a local outbreak.\nBut these measures have also stirred debates about welfare inequality. There are concerns that workers who are paid by the hour or on temporary contracts aren't entitled to the same level of sickness benefits as permanent staff - there are reports that this has encouraged some to keep working despite developing Covid-19 symptoms."

      "text": "Ministers will discuss at a meeting on Monday whether to tighten restrictions at UK borders - including the possibility of hotel quarantines for travellers, the BBC has been told.\nAt a Downing Street news conference on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not rule out taking further action. \nIt comes amid increased concerns over the spread of new coronavirus variants.\nUnder current travel curbs, almost all people arriving in the UK must test negative for Covid to be allowed entry.\nThe test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to \u00a3500.\nAll passengers are also required to quarantine for up to 10 days, although the isolation period can be cut short with a second negative test after five days in England.\nThe only people not subject to the conditions are children under 11, hauliers, air, international rail and maritime crew, and passengers from the Common Travel Area - comprised of the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own quarantine rules, which differ slightly.\nAs of Monday, travel corridors, which exempted passengers arriving from some countries from quarantine, were suspended throughout the UK.\nAsked whether the government would bring in further measures at UK borders, Mr Johnson said: \"I really don't rule it out, we may need to take further measures still.\n\"We may need to go further to protect our borders.\n\"We don't want to put that [efforts to control Covid] at risk by having a new variant come back in.\"\nOne more infectious variant , which was first identified in Kent, has already spread widely across the UK.\nAnd, at the briefing, the prime minister announced that early evidence suggests this variant may be more deadly.\nOther new variants causing concern have been identified in South Africa and Brazil in the weeks since the Kent variant was discovered. \nThose discoveries led to direct flights to the UK from all South American countries and several southern African countries being suspended.\nScientists fear these variants discovered in other countries may interfere with the effectiveness of vaccines and evade parts of the immune system.\nWhile those travelling into the UK are asked to abide by the 10-day isolation and told they can be subject to checks, London mayor Sadiq Khan is among those who have called for the UK to adopt the use of enforced quarantine in hotel rooms.\nThe policy is among the measures in Australia that has limited the country to just 28,750 positive cases during the entire pandemic, fewer than the UK currently has every day.\nTravellers who choose to go to Australia have to pay for their rooms at one of a number of selected quarantine facilities - and have all their meals delivered to their room throughout a stay of at least 14 days. They get tested twice for Covid during that period and if they test positive their quarantine is extended for a further 14 days.\nMeanwhile, passengers arriving into London's Heathrow airport this week have complained of queues at passport control and what they described as poor social distancing, after the latest travel restrictions - requiring travellers to show proof of their negative Covid tests - came into force.\nOn Friday, former British ambassador Peter Westmacott posted a picture on Twitter of long queues at the airport. \nA government spokesman said people \"should not be travelling unless absolutely necessary\".\nThe statement added: \"You must have proof of a negative test and a completed passenger locator form before arriving. \n\"Border Force have been ramping up enforcement and those not complying could be fined \u00a3500.\n\"It's ultimately up to individual airports to ensure social distancing on site.\"\nWith all parts of the UK under strict virus rules amid high levels of infection, only essential foreign travel is permitted in the current advice from the Foreign Office.\nA further 40,261 cases, and 1,401 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported on Friday in the UK."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

In one, she states: \"Just a reminder that white women are just as complicit in upholding and enforcing white supremacy.\"\n\"The last 24 hours have been ... not the greatest,\" she tweeted on Saturday, along with screenshots of highly offensive, racist messages.\nBut many have spoken out in support of Arielle, while the hashtag #IStandWithKrystina started trending on Twitter.\nMatthew Mercer, host of the Critical Role podcast, which has featured her, said: \"There are few as bright, badass and altogether wonderful as [Krystina Arielle], and anyone who tries to step into her ring better know we're right there beside her.\"\nThis is not the first time someone involved in the Star Wars franchise has reported receiving racist abuse.\nActor John Boyega said his casting in The Force Awakens elicited a blatantly racist backlash from some fans. \n\"Nobody else had the uproar and death threats sent to their Instagram DMs and social media, saying, 'Black this and black that and you shouldn't be a Stormtrooper,'\" he told British GQ last year.\n\"Nobody else had that experience.

      "tags": "Germany,Coronavirus vaccines,European Commission,Pfizer,Italy,European Union,Hungary,Poland",
      "text": "A second coronavirus vaccine manufacturer has warned of supply issues to the European Union, compounding frustration in the bloc.\nAstraZeneca said a production problem meant the number of initial doses available would be lower than expected.\nThe fresh blow comes after some nations' inoculation programmes were slowed due to a cut in deliveries of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nThe EU Health Commissioner expressed \"deep dissatisfaction\" at the news.\nOfficials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but an unnamed EU official told Reuters news agency that deliveries would be reduced to 31m - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year.\nThe drug firm had been set to deliver about 80 million doses to the 27 nations by March, according to the official who spoke to Reuters. \nThe AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Oxford University, has not yet been approved by the EU's drug regulator but is expected to get the green light at the end of this month, paving the way for jabs to be given.\nA spokesman for AstraZeneca said on Friday that \"initial volumes will be lower than originally anticipated\" without giving further details.\nHis written statement blamed the discrepancy on \"reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain\" and said the firm was continuing to ramp up production volumes. \nNews of the delay comes amid criticism and frustration across the region about the speed of vaccination roll-outs.\nIsrael, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, and the US are all well ahead of EU nations in terms of doses given per capita so far.\nThe European Commission has co-ordinated orders for all member states, with vaccines then distributed based on their population size.\nVaccines are increasingly seen by experts as the only way out of the Covid-19 crisis, with many European nations struggling to cope with a deadly surge of the virus over the winter period. \nAustrian media have reported that only 600,000 of two million AstraZeneca doses promised by the end of March will arrive in the country on time, with the remaining 1.4m now being delivered in April.  \nA delay would be \"completely unacceptable\", Austrian Health Minister Rudolf Anschober said on Friday. \nAs for Pfizer, the US firm said it had to cut shipments for the next few weeks while it worked to increase capacity at its Belgian processing plant. The EU has ordered 600 million doses from Pfizer.  \nSome regions, including Germany's most populous state North-Rhine Westphalia and parts of Italy, said earlier this week that they were suspending giving first jabs of the two-dose vaccine because of the shortages.\nItaly and Poland have threatened to take legal action in response to the reduction in vaccine supply.\nMeanwhile Hungary's government, which has complained over the time it is taking EU regulators to approve the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, has reached a deal with Russia to buy up large quantities of its Sputnik V vaccine, even though it has not received EU approval.\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel, who led a call of EU leaders this week, said Thursday that officials were considering all ideas to try and stop future vaccine delays. \n\"All possible means will be examined to ensure rapid supply, including early distribution to avoid delays,\" he said.\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and Mr Michel both say they are still aiming for the target of 70% of the EU population being vaccinated by summer.\nThe total number of German Covid deaths climbed above 50,000 on Friday - a day after the country warned that it could close its borders if other EU countries were less strict in controlling the virus. Berlin sounded the alarm amid rising concern about new variants.\nEU leaders agreed late on Thursday to keep their internal borders open but warned non-essential travel might need to be restricted to curb the spread of the virus. \nMs von der Leyen said Thursday that more testing and \"targeted measures\" were needed throughout the EU in order to keep internal and external borders open. \nFor its part, France said it would impose tighter travel restrictions for European arrivals from Sunday, requiring a negative PCR Covid test within three days of travel.\nIn the Netherlands, a ban on all flights from the UK, South Africa and South American countries came into effect on Saturday to try and prevent new coronavirus variants gaining a foothold.\nLooking forward to the future, officials from EU nations reliant on tourism - including Spain and Greece - have floated the possibility of using vaccination certificates to allow for cross-border travel but there has been scepticism within the bloc.

      "text": "Up to 500 new prison cells are to be built in women's jails, the Ministry of Justice has announced.\nThese will be built in existing women's prisons to increase the number of single cells available and improve conditions.\nThey will include in-cell showers, and some will enable women to have overnight visits with their children to prepare for life at home after release.\nIn future, older cells could also be shut if the prison population reduces.\nThe Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has also pledged almost \u00a32m in funding to 38 charities so their \"vital work in steering women away from crime can continue\".\nThis may include addressing mental health problems and drug use, both of which affect around half of women in prison.\nPrisons minister Lucy Frazer said: \"This funding boost will allow frontline services to continue the incredible work they do with some of the most vulnerable women in our society to prevent them being drawn into crime.\"\nAnnouncing the funding, the government reiterated its promise to cut the number of women in custody and provide effective support to deal with problems which could lead to crime in the first place or reoffending.\nBut it admitted there could be a temporary rise of inmates in the near future as the number of investigations and prosecutions is expected to increase amid the hiring of 20,000 more police officers.\nIt added that the number of women in custody has fallen by 10% since 2010 and stressed that government investment in community services should see this trend continue in the long-term.\nIf the number of women in prison falls longer term, the MoJ says the new modern facilities will allow the Prison Service to close old accommodation.\nCampaigners largely welcomed the announcement, but warned the efforts do not go far enough to tackle longstanding problems.\nKate Paradine, chief executive of charity Women in Prison, said: \"This pledge and funding are just the start, and a far cry from what is needed in order to provide stability for women who face the sharp end of our society.\"\nShe called on the government in its upcoming Budget to safeguard the future of women's centres, which she described as an \"anchor that stop women being swept up into crime\" but warned were \"facing a funding cliff edge in April\".\nEmily Evison, policy officer at the Prison Reform Trust, said the plans would need to be backed up by \"action on the ground to prove effective\", adding: \"Instead of planning for a rise (in women prisoners), the government should redouble its efforts to ensure women are not being sent to prison to serve pointless short sentences.\"\nAndrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \"If the goal is to reduce the number of women entering the criminal justice system, then today's announcement shows that ministers are looking at the issue down the wrong end of a telescope\", claiming the funding promised was \"dwarfed\" by the cost of the extra prison places."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of coronavirus patients on mechanical ventilation in the UK has passed 4,000 for the first time in the pandemic.\nA total of 4,076 Covid patients were in ventilator beds as of Friday, according to government data.\nThat is higher than during the first wave, when the peak was 3,301 on 12 April.\nIt comes as another 1,348 deaths and 33,552 new infections were reported on Saturday.\nThe UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told a Downing Street news briefing on Friday: \"The death rate's awful and it's going to stay, I'm afraid, high for a little while before it starts coming down.\"\nMeanwhile, new figures show that a record number of seriously-ill Covid patients are being transferred from over-stretched hospitals because of a lack of bed space.\nAbout 1 in 10 patients admitted to intensive care are being sent to a different site, according to the body which audits critical care services.\nIn a series of reports in the past week, the BBC's Clive Myrie has been to a mortuary and the Royal London Hospital, where 12 out of 15 floors are occupied by Covid patients and staff are struggling to cope.\nMartin Freeborn's wife Helen, 64, died with Covid-19 at the hospital shortly before he spoke to the BBC. \nMr Freeborn urged people to \"be over-careful\" in taking precautions to stay safe from the virus because \"you don't want this to happen\".\n\"Nobody wants to go through this... Don't end up like us, please,\" he added.\nThe number of people in mechanical ventilation beds has climbed every day since 18 December when it was 1,364 and now stands at 4,076.\nIt is one of the key figures the government considers when deciding its policy on when to ease coronavirus lockdown restrictions. \nWhen the pandemic first struck the UK, the government saw what had happened in hospitals in China and Italy and prioritised the provision of ventilators in British hospitals.\nIt set about buying as many ventilators as possible, and encouraged British manufacturers to design the machines to build stocks to cope with the worst-case Covid scenario. In September last year, a report found the NHS now had 30,000 ventilators available - about one for every 2,200 people in the UK.\nPeople in hospital are also being treated differently from the early days of the pandemic - which may explain why figures suggest slightly more people go on to recover after being on ventilation than back in March, April and May.\nA number of drugs are being tested as possible treatments for people with the disease, the BBC's health and science correspondent James Gallagher has said.\nThey include the steroid dexamethasone, which has been shown to reduce the risk of death by a third for ventilated patients and by a fifth for those on oxygen. Encouraging results have also been reported from two anti-inflammatory medications, tocilizumab and sarilumab. \nDr Ami Jones, intensive care consultant at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, in Wales, said there had been \"carnage\" for the \"last few weeks\".\nSpeaking whilst on shift, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We're maybe at 150% capacity and I know London are much worse than that.\n\"We've a steady stream of fit, young patients requiring critical care and sadly we're losing some of those patients.\n\"We lost a patient overnight and I've replaced them with a patient of similar age.\n\"It's heartbreaking - and it's been going on for weeks and weeks and we haven't seen any kind of stop yet.\"\nDr Jones said the average Covid patient stays in hospital between two to four weeks \"and it really puts them through it\".\nShe added: \"You really want people who are going to be able to survive that three or four weeks and actually come out the other end and make a good recovery.\n\"We're not stopping people having care but we're giving it to the people we feel have the best chance of getting through what is a horrific situation we're going to put them through.\"\nDr Jones said nurses are \"broken\", both physically, from months of long shifts in personal protective equipment (PPE), and emotionally - partly due to the impact of the virus on them, their families and the community.\nDr Rupert Pearse, consultant in intensive care medicine at a London hospital, speaking on behalf of the Intensive Care Society, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a \"huge number\" of patients were still attending hospital.\nHe said: \"Whilst we know the infection rate has probably now peaked, and we can be hopeful to soon be sure we've hit a hospital admissions peak, admissions to ICU [the intensive care unit] usually lag 48 hours behind that.\n\"So we're still very very worried that we're being pushed right up to the wire in terms of the resources we're able to deliver for patient care.\"\nDr Pearse added that there were three or four times more critical care beds in some hospitals than they would usually have.\nHe said: \"I can remember a time when it would take years for an intensive care unit to negotiate one extra bed on a complement of 14 or 15 beds.\n\"We, within a few weeks, have massively increased the number of beds and finding the staff - most importantly of all - to deliver that has been a huge logistical exercise.\" \nReacting to the ventilation figures, Dr Charlotte Hopkins, deputy chief medical officer for Barts Health NHS trust in east London, said on Twitter there had been a \"fast-paced increase\" since 18 December, and that more than a third of the 4,076 ventilated patients were in London.\nIt comes as some scientists said that signs a new Covid variant is more deadly than the earlier version should not be a \"game changer\" in the UK's response to the pandemic.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that there was \"some evidence\" the variant that emerged in the UK may be associated with \"a higher degree of mortality\".\nBut Prof Graham Medley, the co-author of the study the PM was referring to, said the variant's deadliness remained an \"open\" question.\nDr Mike Tildesley, a member of Sage subgroup the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), said he was \"surprised\" Mr Johnson had shared the findings when the data was \"not particularly strong\". \nPublic Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said it was \"too early\" to be \"absolutely clear\".\n\"There is some evidence, but it is very early evidence. It is small numbers of cases and it is far too early to say,\" she told the Today programme.\nUp to and including 22 January, 5,861,351 people have now had their first Covid jab and 468,617 have had their second dose.\nSenior doctors are calling on England's chief medical officer to cut the gap between the first and second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.\nThe British Medical Association told Prof Chris Whitty an extension to the maximum gap between jab from three weeks to 12 weeks, to get the first dose to more people, was \"difficult to justify\".\nThe UK's four chief medical officers have previously defended the delay to the second jab in a letter to medical staff, saying: \"unvaccinated people are far more likely to end up severely ill, hospitalised [or] in some cases dying\"."

Nursing staff need to have full confidence that they are protected.\"\nShe added: \"Staff picking up this virus at work are angered at any suggestion they have stopped following the rules - this is down to the new variant and the dangerous shortage of adequate protection.\"\nNHS England data shows a 22% rise in the average number of healthcare staff off sick because of Covid-19 in the first week of January, compared with the last week in December.\nA spokesman from the Department of Health and Social Care in England said the safety of NHS and social care staff was \"top priority\" but the current guidance did not need changing.\n\"In response to the new Covid-19 variants, the UK Infection Prevention Control Cell conducted a comprehensive review of all available evidence and concluded that current guidance and PPE recommendations remain the right ones.\n\"New and emerging evidence is continually scrutinised and evaluated by the government, in conjunction with our world-leading scientists,\" the spokesman said.\nThe Royal College of Nursing is asking the governments of the UK to:\nIt is also calling for the Health and Safety Executive to review the guidance on appropriate use of PPE in all health and care settings.

The figure - which would represent a small proportion of the more than 25,000 deployed, has not been publicly confirmed. \nChuck Schumer, a Democrat and the new Senate majority leader, said that the move was \"an outrage\" and pledged it \"will never happen again\".\nRon DeSantis, Florida's governor, was among those who said he had ordered guards from his state to return home following the controversy.\n\"This is a half-cocked mission at this point and the appropriate thing is to bring them home,\" he told Fox News on Friday.\nThe Senate Rules Committee is also investigating the issue, Senator Roy Blunt told Politico. \nThere are conflicting reports about why the troops were moved from the Capitol.\nA National Guard spokesman told US media they were moved on Thursday afternoon at the request of the Capitol Police because of \"increased foot traffic\" as Congress came back into session.\nThe acting chief of the Capitol Police, Yogananda Pittman, later said her agency \"did not instruct the National Guard to vacate the Capitol Building facilities\", while two officers contradicted her statement in comments to the Associated Press news agency.\nThe decision was reversed later on Thursday, when the troops were allowed to return to the Capitol. \nA joint statement from the US National Guard and US Capitol Police on Friday said they had worked together to make sure those in the Capitol Complex had \"appropriate spaces\" to take on-duty breaks.\nThey also said off-duty troops were being housed in hotel rooms or other accommodation and thanked members of Congress for their concern. \nSome 19,000 guardsmen will return to their home states in the coming days with about 7,000 expected to stay on in Washington, according to the New York Times.

This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack.\nThe genetic material is encased in a tiny protective bubble of fat to get it into cells. \nThe exact ingredients of the vaccine have not been made public, but other vaccines can contain other ingredients, like aluminium, to make them stable or more effective. \nThis is the first RNA vaccine to be approved for use in humans. \nThe concept has been researched before and people have been given them in clinical trials for other diseases.\nThe vaccine will be considered by regulatory agencies around the world, who will decide whether the jab can be approved for use.   \nNHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, and the over 80s are first in line to receive the two vaccines being rolled out in the UK - Pfizer and Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab. \nAbout half of over-80s in the UK have now been vaccinated. \nPeople in England in their 70s, and those listed as clinically extremely vulnerable, are now beginning to receiving their offers of a jab.\nOut of the nine priority groups, those aged 50-54 are at the bottom of the current list. \nThere will be a second phase, which will offer the vaccine to the other groups in the population.\nThe vaccine was initially delivered in hospitals. It is now also being administered through GPs and care homes, as well as local vaccination centres in venues such as sports halls and mass vaccination hubs in places like cathedrals and sports halls. \nHowever, there are logistical challenges for the Pfizer vaccine:\nIt is impossible to know and we will find out only by waiting. \nIf immunity does not last then it may be necessary to have annual vaccines, as we do for flu.\nThe vaccine appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old and data from its phase three trial suggests it works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities.\nEarly evidence suggests the Pfizer vaccine is likely to protect against a coronavirus variant that is spreading around the UK.\nSome people - such as those with a weak immune system - will not be able to have the vaccine. \nNothing in medicine is 100% safe - even something we take without thinking, like paracetamol, poses risks. \nThe data so far is reassuring - trials on 43,500 people discovered no safety concerns, although mild side effects, such as headaches and muscle aches, have been reported.  \nIf there were highly dangerous and common consequences of this vaccination, they should have become apparent.\nHowever, rarer side effects may emerge as millions of people are immunised.\nHopefully yes, but not for some time.\nIf enough people are immune then the virus would stop spreading and we would not need other measures.  \nHowever, the manufacture and distribution of a vaccine will take some time.\nSo testing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing are going to be a feature of our lives for a while yet. \nThe vaccine has been designed and developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, and they own the intellectual property. \nThey already have the manufacturing capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of this year, but could partner with others to increase capacity even further.\nWe do not know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or just stops you from getting ill. We also don't know how protective the vaccine is in different age groups. \nThese will be crucial for understanding how it will be used.\nAbout a dozen vaccines are in the final development stages. The Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab is also being used in the UK, and supplies of the approved Moderna vaccine should arrive in the spring."

      "text": "Police broke up a wedding party in north London, where they now say about 150 people had gathered.\nOfficers found the windows at the Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School, in Stamford Hill, had been covered when they arrived at 21:15 GMT on Thursday. \nGuests fled from the strictly Orthodox Charedi Jewish school when the police arrived. The organisers face a \u00a310,000 fine for breaking lockdown rules.\nThe Met originally claimed that about 400 guests were at the gathering.\nIn a statement, the school said its hall had been leased out.\nA spokesman for the school, whose principal Rabbi Avrahom Pinter died in April after contracting coronavirus, said \"we had no knowledge that the wedding was taking place\".\nHe added: \"We are absolutely horrified about last night's event and condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\"\nBoris Johnson supports the police for \"taking action against people who flagrantly and selfishly ignore the rules\", according to the prime minister's official spokesman.\nThe spokesman said: \"Large gatherings such as that pose a health risk, not just to those who attend but those who they live with or others who they may come into contact with.\"\nChief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, meanwhile, said the \"overwhelming majority\" of the Jewish community would be appalled at the event.\nRabbi Mirvis, who serves as the head of the UK's orthodox Jewish community but is not the leader of the Charedi group, called the wedding party \"a most shameful desecration of all that we hold dear\".\nFive guests were issued with \u00a3200 fixed penalty notices, according to police, who said their inquiries had established those present at the school had gathered for a wedding.\nVideo shared with the Jewish Chronicle shows officers in Stamford Hill speaking with a man to explain why they are there, although he is not accused of any wrongdoing. \nThey are then seen arriving at the Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls' School. \nDet Ch Sup Marcus Barnett of the Met Police said: \"This was a completely unacceptable breach of the law.\n\"People across the country are making sacrifices by cancelling or postponing weddings and other celebrations and there is no excuse for this type of behaviour. \n\"My officers are working tirelessly with the community and we will not hesitate to take enforcement action if that is required to keep people safe.\"\nOn Friday morning, a security guard at the school told the BBC there were more like 100 guests at the party than the much higher number given out by police.\nThe Met later said in a statement: \"Although initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance.\"\nStamford Hill is part of the borough of Hackney, which has a Covid-19 infection rate of 625.43 cases per 100,000 people. The England average rate is 471.31 per 100,000 people. \nThe mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said he was \"deeply disappointed\" that the wedding party had taken place, despite \"the number of lives that have already been lost in the Charedi community and across the borough\".\nHe added: \"Unfortunately, similar events have taken place even at this venue before and we need to be really clear how unacceptable it is.\n\"We will be meeting with the Rabbinate and our community partners over the coming days to see how we can prevent further incidents of this nature.\"\nLondon is under an England-wide lockdown, which prevents social mixing between households.\nLondoners are asked to only leave home for limited reasons such as shopping, going to work, seeking medical assistance, or avoiding domestic abuse.\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nDo you have any information to share about this incident?

      "text": "Paul Davies has been something of an understated figure leading the Welsh Conservative group in Cardiff Bay since he won the race to succeed Andrew RT Davies in September 2018.\nThe Senedd member for Preseli Pembrokeshire tried to move the party group in the direction of being more sceptical of devolution.\nBut a row over drinking on Senedd premises ended his ambitions to be the first Conservative first minister of Wales.\nBorn in 1969, Paul Davies grew up in the village of Pontsian in Ceredigion.\nHe attended Llandysul Grammar School and Newcastle Emlyn Comprehensive School before working for a bank for 20 years.\nMr Davies entered Cardiff Bay politics in 2007 when he was elected to the then National Assembly for Wales. He was appointed deputy leader of the Welsh Conservative group in 2011 before becoming interim leader and then leader in 2018.\nPresented as a safe pair of hands during his leadership campaign he has, at times, almost appeared to have been overshadowed by his predecessor Andrew RT Davies, who sometimes seems to enjoy media appearances more than his leader.\nFaced with the potential rise of the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party, Paul Davies attempted to steer the Welsh Tories towards a more devo-sceptic, if not anti-devolution, approach.\nHe pledged a future Conservative Welsh Government would not \"tread on Westminster's turf\", and \"respect what is not devolved\" by \"unpicking\" the Welsh Government's international relations department.\nThere were also promises to halve the current number of Welsh ministers to seven, freeze civil servant recruitment and not increase the budget of the body which runs the Senedd if he became first minister.\nBut the coronavirus pandemic has, arguably, made it even harder for opposition party leaders in the Senedd to cut through to the wider electorate.\nThe crisis has given Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford a much bigger profile, on a Wales and UK stage, making it more difficult for other Welsh party leaders to get onto the news agenda.\nLast July, there were raised eyebrows when Paul Davies suggested \"a dose of Dom\" was needed in Wales to \"shake up\" its governance.\nThe reference to the prime minister's now departed chief advisor and brutal political operator Dominic Cummings was interesting, given the criticism heaped on Mr Cummings a couple of months earlier for driving his family 260 miles from his London home to Durham during lockdown, and a subsequent 25-mile trip to check his eyesight before a return trip.\nBacking Remain at the 2016 referendum on EU membership, Paul Davies aimed to steer a steady course during a fractious period for a Conservative Party dealing with the polarising issue of Brexit.\nHe has been loyal to the UK party leader of the day, and often stuck to the Westminster line rather than try to carve an independent stance.\nDespite this, Mr Davies had wanted the Tory Senedd group leader to be given the title Welsh Conservative leader.\nIt is something the party has never formally agreed to do despite a review of its Welsh structures."

      "tags": "Robert Jenrick,Alok Sharma,Trudy Harrison,Cumbria County Council,COP26,Fiji,Climate change,Mark Jenkinson,Matthew Pennycook,Kwasi Kwarteng,Greenpeace",
      "text": "The government has been pressured into calling a public inquiry into a proposed new coal mine in Cumbria.\nThe county council at first approved the colliery, and the government decided not to challenge the decision.\nAfter an outcry from environmentalists, the council decided to review its decision.\nBut now ministers have taken over the process, following weeks of angry criticism from climate experts and campaigners.\nA firm applied for planning permission to dig for coking coal in Cumbria, and councillors approved the bid. They said the scheme did not contravene planning rules and would help diversify jobs.\nBut coal is seen as the dirtiest of the fossil fuels driving up global temperatures. The British government heads a UN climate summit in November and has launched the Powering Past Coal alliance of nations to relinquish coal.\nFiji is an alliance member - and its UN ambassador Satyendra Prasad told me opening a new mine sends the wrong signal. \n\"Investment in renewables in place of coal is the morally correct choice,\" he said.\n\"In the global climate struggle, words are extremely important. Deeds matter even more.\" \nThis was a thorny decision. \nCommunities Secretary Robert Jenrick could have overridden the council but, amid the turmoil of the January Covid lockdown, he put out a notice saying he would not block permission because it was a \"local\" issue. \nEnvironmentalists were furious, saying climate change was the ultimate global problem. \nThe government later told me there were no grounds to block the application under planning law. A spokesperson said leaving the decision to the council aligned with the Tory principle of having decisions taken at the lowest possible tier of government.\nBut then the council itself decided to review its approval of the mine, because councillors said they hadn't taken the climate change question into account in their discussions.\nUltimately, the government decided it would review the issue itself, with a public debate over the issues involved.\nYes. The mine lies in the Copeland constituency in a cluster of so-called \"red wall\" seats won by the Conservatives from Labour. \nCumbria has low unemployment (2.8% from July 2019-June 2020 compared with 3.4% in Copeland and 3.8% nationally) but local MPs argued that well-paid manual jobs shouldn't be turned away. \nThe Copeland MP Trudy Harrison is the prime minister's parliamentary aide and it's hard to conceive that she did not drop a word in his ear, although she wouldn't talk to me about that.\nThey insist they're not. The key to the debate, they say, is that the mine will produce coking coal, which is needed for steel. \nThe government is phasing out thermal coal for power stations by 2025 but has not announced any plans to phase out coking coal. \nThe advisory Climate Change Committee says the UK must stop burning coking coal by 2035 in order to hit climate targets. I understand the committee fears that if the mine goes ahead its owners and workers will lobby to keep it running after that date.\nBut the MPs fear that the technology to create steel using non-coal methods such as hydrogen won't be ready by 2035. \nMark Jenkinson, Tory MP for nearby Workington, told me: \"It's better for the environment to dig coking coal from Workington than from Wyoming, because it saves on emissions from transport. We can't let other countries pick up the tab for emissions on our behalf.\"\nEnvironmentalists have long called for a moratorium on new fossil fuels. \nWhen John Sauven, from Greenpeace, heard that approving the mine was considered a local decision he said: \"Let's hope China doesn't take the same view - or the world will be toast\".\nHe's written to Boris Johnson saying: \"As host of the largest global climate talks since the signing of the Paris Agreement, it is mystifying that a new coal mine has been approved. \n\"This will make it much harder to fulfil the ambitions of the alliance to phase out coal. We call on you to reverse the decision\".\nLabour's Climate Change lead Matthew Pennycook agreed. \"This makes a mockery of the government's claim to be a climate leader, and won't provide the long-term job security Cumbrians deserve,\" he said. \n\"Decarbonised steel is the future and Ministers should be relentlessly focused on developing an active industrial strategy that will attract good, low-carbon jobs and investment to counties like Cumbria.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats and Greens agree.\nThe government will hold a public inquiry to allow supporters of the mine and environmentalists to put their opposing cases. \nThere's no timetable for the inquiry yet, but the government will be hoping that the controversy has been kicked into the long grass until at least after it hosts the UN climate summit in November.\nEnvironmentalists will doubtless accuse the government of failing to take a stand.\nThe inquiry will examine evidence from the Climate Change Committee against the mine, and the counter-case from those who believe the mine is needed to support the UK steel industry. In effect, climate strategy and industrial strategy will both be on trial.\nIn the meantime, pressure will increase on ministers to agree policies that will stimulate green jobs in West Cumbria, which has an unemployment rate just below the national average, but where jobs are heavily concentrated in the nuclear sector at Sellafield.\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Exercise,Back injury,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Millions of people are less physically active than they were before Covid-19. For those working from home, the morning walk to the bus stop has gone. Days on end can be spent hunched over a laptop without ever leaving the house.\nFor some, that's taking a painful toll.   \nA survey of people working remotely, by Opinium for the charity Versus Arthritis, found 81% of respondents were experiencing some back, neck or shoulder pain. Almost half (48%) said they were less physically active than before the lockdown.  Another study by the Institute for Employment Studies found 35% reporting new back pain while working from home.\nPhysiotherapists and other back pain experts say those with serious or persistent problems should seek professional help, but there are things that many of us can do to help ourselves.\nPretty much all the experts agree that one of the best things you can do is get moving.\nDon't sit in the same position for long periods.\n\"Make sure you take any opportunity you can to move your body,\" says Ashley James of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists (CSP). \"It doesn't need to be about exercise as such,\" he says.  \"It's about building movement into your day.\" He calls it taking \"regular movement snacks\".\nThat could be taking phone calls or joining online meetings standing up, just having a stretch or walking up and down the stairs when you don't really need to, he says.  When you're moving, different muscle groups share the work of keeping your head, neck, back and the rest of your body supported, rather than continually overloading the same muscles. \nWhere lockdowns have restricted outside exercise to once a day, Mr James's advice is to use that daily opportunity for at least a good walk whenever you can.\nMovement can help with breathing by opening up your chest, and reducing muscle atrophy. It increases blood flow and lubricates synovial joints - joints that allow free movement - like hips and shoulders. \nCreating a new routine to help keep you moving can be difficult, so experts suggest setting a timer on your phone or laptop to remind you to move. It's a good way to avoid getting stuck in the same position hour after hour, says neck specialist Chris Worsfold.  \n\"We've evolved to move,\" he says. \"We naturally want to move after about 20 or 30 minutes, so that's when you need to go and shake it about.\"\nIf you're sitting when it goes off, stand up. If you're standing, have a stretch or walk up and down the stairs.\n\"The key is to create a routine that works for you,\" says Leanne Antoine, who treats patients in Hertfordshire.  \"There's no point in creating a schedule that makes you feel like a failure when you don't keep to it.\" \nSo ask yourself honestly what you would be prepared to do, and stick to it. Be careful, but as long as it gets you out of the chair, stretching, walking or Zumba dancing in your living room, it doesn't matter, she says.  \n\"You don't need the perfect set up with a thousand pound chair, but if you're scrunched up on the sofa, it's not going to be good for your back,\" says Chris Martey. \nYour workspace is worth some serious thought, but companies have a big interest in selling expensive equipment, so he says beware of unnecessary costs.\nLeanne Antoine agrees: \"Just make small tweaks that don't cost the earth.\"\nThat could be as simple as using a cushion to raise you up on your chair, or to support your lower back. An inexpensive adjustable office chair can help. A mount for your laptop will raise your screen to eye level so that you're not always looking down, particularly on long online video calls. An external keyboard is also useful.\n\"Talk to your employer,\" says Ms Antoine. Many will supply equipment to staff.\nIf you have to use a sofa, at least make sure your feet are firmly on the floor and you're sitting back with a cushion to support your lower back. Standing desks can be helpful, says Chris Martey. But you need to alternate between standing and sitting - and take regular screen breaks.\nIf you don't have a standing desk, some experts recommend standing with your laptop on an ironing board for short periods.\nWe're in a \"perfect storm\" for back trouble - according to Ashley James, with Covid-19 restricting physical activity while simultaneously ramping up anxieties about health, job insecurity, children's education and more.  \nIt's impossible to quantify but a lot of back pain is driven by anxiety, he says.  In the jargon, back problems are \"biopsychosocial\". It doesn't help that we're now in winter - when many people experience a dip in mood.\nPeople de-stress in all sorts of ways of course.  Pilates and yoga are helpful for some.  \nOne of the best ways is to work on getting better sleep, says Mr James. \"Sleep hygiene\" is the key.  \nThat means cutting down on caffeine in the afternoon and evening, keeping to a consistent night time routine and trying to wake up at the same time every day.\nThe NHS advises against using electronic devices for an hour or so before you go to bed, as the light from the screen may make it more difficult for you to sleep. Light suppresses the secretion of melatonin, a hormone which helps to make you sleepy.\nMany studies have suggested that blue light does this most powerfully, but some research suggests the warmer colours used in \"night mode\" on many devices may actually have a bigger impact.\nThe CSP has designed some simple stretches which, if done regularly, can help ward off aches and pains. They're for people who are working remotely and find themselves sitting for long periods. \nThe chest stretch, the leg stretch, the sit stretch and the wall press, are designed to help different muscle groups. The CSP says there is no \"perfect posture\" and that the priority is to keep moving.\nThere's a positive message here, says Chris Martey. For millions of people suffering everyday aches and pains he says: \"You can take control. You can self-manage. You don't have to be dependent.\"\nIllustrations by Gerry Fletcher."

He was working on an article for the Argus [newspaper]. He sat on his own and was socially distanced,\" said Mr Gir.\n\"He attended the tea room at approximately 6pm. He had a chicken curry. He left at about 8pm. Others came in whilst he was there but it was not a 'gathering' Mr Ramsay was part of.\"\nOn Wednesday afternoon the health minister said the \"last thing\" that should happen at the end of an investigation was that \"it's only staff who essentially get thrown under the bus, everyone needs to look what they've done\".\nAt a press conference, Vaughan Gething refused to be drawn on whether the Tory members should stand down or be suspended.\nBut he said the Labour group's decision to suspend Alun Davies \"was the right thing\" to do.\nHe said he himself had been subject of press stories \"where some people made comments, without wanting to understand the facts or not being interested in them so I don't think I should then lay in on an issue like this\".\nBut, he added: \"Any sense of people not all being in this together, isn't helpful in terms of the message that we all need to follow.\"\nA senior Conservative source has told BBC Wales they were \"totally flabbergasted\" that the party Senedd members involved have not stood down pending the investigation.\n\"There's a lot of anger and I don't know how they can continue,\" the source added.\n\"Everyone I've spoken to in the party is just completely baffled by this.\n\"This is a complete own goal.\"\nDavid Fouweather, a Conservative councillor in Newport, said the Tories involved should \"stand aside and go\".\nOne senior Conservative grassroots official who contacted BBC Wales said: \"I'm furious. The party messaging is trying to break up the Cardiff Bay cartel and they're having nice drinks with Alun Davies who, let's not forget, has been really vicious in public against us.\n\"I've spoken to a lot of Conservatives and they're not happy at all.\n\"Nobody is going to put their head on the line for Paul Davies. I'll be very surprised if he continues to the end of the week.\"\nThe official also referred to Mr Millar's call at the start of the pandemic for the first minister to sack Health Minister Vaughan Gething over claims he broke Covid rules at the time when he sat and ate chips while on a walk with his family. \nThe grassroots activist said: \"Darren Millar talking about Vaughan Gething having his chips - well, what on earth is he doing?\"\nAnother Conservative councillor said: \"Paul's position as leader is now untenable, especially when you consider the strain that hardworking people are under.\"\nA senior Welsh Government minister also joined calls for the Conservative Party to take action of its own.\nEluned Morgan, mental health minister, said she had written to the party asking it suspend those involved while \"investigations continue into this alleged incident\".\nLabour has suspended Alun Davies from the party's Senedd group pending an investigation.\nPlaid Cymru MS Rhun ap Iorwerth said politicians failed to set \"the best example that's something that should be regretted by all of us\".\n\"I want to be talking about how we can push government to deliver better in its response to this pandemic,\" he said.\n\"It's a matter of concern to me that distractions like this move the focus from where it should be and where you then have questions about the role of political leaders - and I count all of us, whether in government or in opposition, in that bracket.\"\nCharlton House said it was \"aware of an alleged breach of public health regulations at the Senedd estate\" and took its \"responsibilities and obligations to restrictions and public health regulations across the UK very seriously\". \n\"We are currently undertaking a full investigation into this matter,\" the firm added. \nWales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said it was \"important that everybody follows the rules\".\n\"I don't know the details of what may or may not have happened down there, I'm sure that will come out in the fullness of time,\" he told BBC Wales Live on Tuesday.\nA statement on behalf of Paul Davies, Darren Millar and Welsh Conservative chief of staff Paul Smith, who was also at the meeting, said they were \"profoundly sorry\".\n\"While we did not break the rules, we recognise that what was part of a day's work would not be seen to be following the spirit of them, especially given the tough time the country has been going through,\" the statement said.\nA spokesman for the Senedd Labour Group said a member had been suspended from the group \"while an investigation takes place into this alleged incident\". \nIn his statement, Labour's Alun Davies said: \"I am very sorry if my actions have given the impression that I am in any way not committed to upholding the regulations which I have consistently supported throughout the last year.\"\nHe said the purpose of the meeting \"was to seek to persuade the Welsh Conservatives to support my proposal for a Welsh Hearts Bill, which the Senedd endorsed on 21 October, and to make a commitment to enact this life-saving legislation in their manifesto for May's election\". \nAlun Davies added: \"The Senedd Commission has already confirmed to me that I did not breach the coronavirus regulations on the consumption of either food or alcohol that were in force at that time.\"\nA spokesman for the Senedd Commission said: \"We are aware of an incident on the Senedd estate last month which may have been contrary to public health regulations in force at the time. \n\"The Senedd Commission takes the public health regulations in Wales very seriously and is currently investigating the matter in order to establish an accurate account of what took place and to determine whether action may be required.\""

      "text": "Two railway lines, closed to passengers since the 1960s, are to get almost \u00a3800m funding from the government.\nEast West Rail, which will eventually connect Oxford and Cambridge, will get \u00a3760m to open new parts of the line.\nThe Northumberland Line, which still carries freight, will get \u00a334m for initial work aimed at reintroducing passenger services.\nReopening closed lines like these would help connect \"left-behind\" communities, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said.\n\"Restoring railways helps put communities back on the map and this investment forms part of our nationwide effort to build back vital connections and unlock access to jobs, education and housing,\" he said.\nThese investments would return these routes \"to their former glory\" and was part of the government's \"levelling up\" agenda, Mr Shapps added.\nDiesel engines will initially run on the lines, but Mr Shapps said he hoped more environmentally friendly trains, for example powered by hydrogen or new battery technology, would replace them in the future.\nWhen asked by the BBC why the lines wouldn't be electrified, he said these lines might potentially bypass the overhead wire technology altogether.\n\"We're building it in such a way that we can use, probably, the very latest technology, potentially, in the future,\" he said.\n\"The most important thing is the infrastructure,\" he said. \"It's about building the stations, things you need to do no matter what kind of train you're going to run on there, if it's going to take passengers.\"\nBut Labour MP Daniel Zeichner, who represents Cambridge, said: \"Every rail expert will tell you it will cost more later to electrify a line.\"\n\"In a time of climate emergency, we really shouldn't be building railway lines for diesel, it's got to be electric.\"\nThe line connecting Oxford and Cambridge would serve new housing developments, he said, and rail was \"the right way to get people in and out of a city like Cambridge\".\n\"It's very important for the UK economy, but it's got to be done in an environmentally sustainable way,\" he said. \"It seems crazy to be building new railways which aren't electrified in the first place, and I really hope the government will reconsider.\"\nThe East West Rail investment will rebuild a train line between Bicester and Bletchley which was closed in 1968.\nThe project is being delivered by a publicly-owned body called the East West Company.\nThe first phase of East West Rail, which was completed in 2016, connected Oxford and Bicester.\nBut at the moment, rail passengers wishing to go from Oxford to Bletchley have to take a detour via Coventry.\nThe aim is to get trains running between Oxford and Bletchley by 2025, with new stations at Winslow and Bletchley.\nThe Department for Transport said the works will create 1,500 jobs, and have a wider economic benefit for the area.\nThe eventual aim of the project, which the government expects to be completed by the end of the decade, is to connect Oxford and Cambridge by rail via Bedford, taking in Milton Keynes and Aylesbury on branches.\nThe Northumberland Line was closed to passengers in 1964 as part of a rationalisation of the railway network known as the Beeching cuts.\nHenri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said the Northumberland Line was \"a really critical piece of local infrastructure\" that would help bring people in south east Northumberland and north Tyneside closer to Newcastle city centre, and closer to well-paid jobs.\n\"Having better connectivity will help attract businesses to that area, and it will help to deliver genuine levelling-up,\" he said.\nThe new \u00a334m investment, which aims to reopen the line between Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Ashington, will include funds for preparatory works and land acquisition.\nThere are plans for new stations at at Ashington, Bedlington, Blyth, Bebside, Newsham, Seaton Delaval, and Northumberland Park, in North Tyneside, as well as upgrades to the track and changes to level crossings where new bridges or underpasses were needed, the Department for Transport said."

      "text": "Four men have been jailed for the manslaughter of 39 Vietnamese migrants found dead in a lorry trailer in Essex.\nThe migrants died \"excruciatingly painful\" deaths, having suffocated in the container en route from Belgium to Purfleet in October 2019, a judge said.\nRonan Hughes, 41, and Gheorghe Nica, 43, played \"leading roles\" in the smuggling conspiracy and were jailed for 20 and 27 years respectively.\nAt the Old Bailey, two lorry drivers were also jailed for manslaughter.\nEamonn Harrison, 24, who towed the trailer to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge before their journey to the UK, was sentenced to 18 years.\nMaurice Robinson, 26, was given 13 years and four months, having collected the trailer and opened it in an industrial estate to find the migrants dead.\nThree others members of the people-smuggling gang were also sentenced for conspiracy to facilitate unlawful immigration.\nChristopher Kennedy, 24, from County Armagh, was jailed for seven years; Valentin Calota, 38, of Birmingham, for four-and-a-half years; and Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Hobart Road, Tilbury, Essex, was given a three-year sentence.\nSentencing, Mr Justice Sweeney said: \"I have no doubt that the conspiracy was a sophisticated, long-running and profitable one to smuggle mainly Vietnamese people across the channel.\"\nHe said on the fatal trip the temperature had been rising along with the carbon dioxide levels throughout, hitting 40C (104F) while the container was at sea on 22 October 2019.\n\"There were desperate attempts to contact the outside world by phone and to break through the roof of the container,\" the judge said.\n\"All were to no avail and, before the ship reached Purfleet, [the victims] all died in what must have been an excruciatingly painful death.\"\nThe victims had used a metal pole to try to punch through the roof but only managed to dent the interior.\nThe court heard some of their final desperate phone messages, including one where a man spoke with ragged breaths as he apologised to his family.\n\"I can't breathe,\" he said. \"I want to come back to my family. Have a good life.\"\nJustice Sweeney added: \"The willingness of the victims to try and enter the country illegally provides no excuse for what happened to them.\" \nDuring the trial, jurors were given a snapshot of the victims - who included a bricklayer, a university graduate and a nail bar technician - and their dreams of a better life. \nMany of their families borrowed heavily to fund their passage, relying on their potential future earnings once they got into the UK.\nThe father of Nguyen Huy Tung, one of two 15-year-olds in the container, later learned of his son's death via social media.\nHarrison, of Newry, County Down, claimed he did not know there were people in the trailer when he towed it to the Belgian port, and that he watched \"a wee bit of Netflix\" in bed as they were loaded on. \nRobinson, from County Armagh, collected the trailer when it arrived on UK shores just after midnight on 23 October.\nHis boss, Hughes, had messaged him: \"Give them air quickly don't let them out.\" \nRobinson gave a thumbs-up in reply. When Robinson stopped on a nearby industrial estate, he found that the migrants were all dead.\nHis barrister said Robinson, who admitted manslaughter, being part of the trafficking plot and money laundering, was \"horrified by what he saw\".\nThe trial examined three smuggling attempts by the gang - two that were successful on 11 and 18 October, and the final trip on 23 October. \nOn all three runs, Nica, of Basildon, Essex, had arranged cars and a van to transport the migrants at the UK end. \nWhen Robinson discovered the bodies, there was a series of telephone conversations between him and Nica and Hughes, of Tyholland, County Monaghan, Ireland, before the driver eventually dialled 999. \nIn his evidence, Nica said Robinson told him: \"I have a problem here - dead bodies in the trailer.\"\nWhile Hughes admitted manslaughter, both Nica and Harrison were convicted by a jury.\nMr Justice Sweeney said that in the conspiracy \"two played leading roles, namely - in order of importance - Hughes and Nica\".\nHe accepted Hughes was \"not at the very top of the conspiracy\" but said his role was \"pivotal... in that he ran a haulage business and supplied the trailers and drivers used to transport the migrants\".\nThe judge said Nica \"recruited and paid the drivers whose job it was to collect the migrants when they reached the drop-off site in this country and to drive them to the safe house(s) where they were to be held until payment\".\nHe added at the top of the conspiracy was a Vietnamese man called \"Fong\", who was based in London.\nMr Justice Sweeney told the defendants jailed for manslaughter they would serve two-thirds of the term in custody, instead of the usual half.\nEarlier this month, Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Barclay Road, Tottenham, north London, was sentenced, having admitted his limited role in the people-smuggling operation. It was accepted he was not a member of the organised crime group behind the smuggling operation.  \nDet Ch Insp Daniel Stoten said: \"May this serve as a warning to those who think it's OK to prey on the vulnerabilities of migrants and their families, transporting them in a way worse than we would transport animals. \n\"My message to you is that we will find you and we will stop you.\"\nHe said the victims died in an \"unimaginable way, because of the utter greed of these criminals\".\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Media,United States,Broadcasting",
      "text": "Larry King, giant of US broadcasting who achieved worldwide fame for interviewing political leaders and celebrities, has died at the age of 87.\nKing conducted an estimated 50,000 interviews in his six-decade career, which included 25 years as host of the popular CNN talk show Larry King Live.\nHe died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to Ora Media, a production company he co-founded. \nEarlier this month, he was treated in hospital for Covid-19, US media say. \nThe talk show host, famous for his braces and rolled-up sleeves, had faced several health problems in recent years, including heart attacks.\nKing was married eight times to seven women and had five children. Two of them died last year within weeks of each other - daughter Chaia died from lung cancer and son Andy of a heart attack.\nKing carried out interviews with every sitting US president from Gerald Ford to Barack Obama and a number of world leaders. His other high-profile guests included Dr Martin Luther King, the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela and Lady Gaga.\n\"For 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television and digital media, Larry's many thousands of interviews, awards, and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster,\" Ora Media said in a statement, without giving the cause of death.\nBorn Lawrence Harvey Zeiger in Brooklyn, New York, in 1933, King rose to fame in the 1970s with his radio programme The Larry King Show, on the commercial network Mutual Broadcasting System.\nIn 1985 he launched Larry King Live on the fledgling CNN, and became one of the network's biggest stars. The programme, broadcast around the world, was a success with audiences, with King answering thousands of phone calls from viewers.\nHe earned a number of honours, including two Peabody awards, but was also criticised for his non-confrontational approach and open-ended questions. King boasted of not doing much research for the interviews so, he said, he could learn along with viewers.\nBy 2010 his ratings had dropped significantly, with critics saying King's approach felt outdated in an era of more aggressive interviewing styles. King then announced his retirement, saying: \"It's time to hang up my nightly suspenders.\"\nIn his final programme on CNN, he told his viewers: \"I don't know what to say, except to you, my audience, thank you. Instead of goodbye, how about so long?\"\nCNN replaced him with British journalist and broadcaster Piers Morgan, whose programme King criticised for being \"too much about him\".\nMorgan, whose programme was cancelled three years later, said on Twitter on Saturday: \"Larry King was a hero of mine until we fell out after I replaced him at CNN & he said my show was 'like watching your mother-in-law go over a cliff in your new Bentley.' (He married 8 times so a mother-in-law expert).\"\nBut, Morgan added, King \"was a brilliant broadcaster & masterful TV interviewer.\"\nIn a statement, CNN president Jeff Zucker said: \"The scrappy young man from Brooklyn had a history-making career spanning radio and television. His curiosity about the world propelled his award-winning career in broadcasting, but it was his generosity of spirit that drew the world to him.\"\nMost recently, King hosted another programme, Larry King Now, broadcast on Hulu and RT, Russia's state-controlled international broadcaster.\nA Kremlin spokesman was quoted as saying by state RIA Novosti news agency: \"King repeatedly interviewed Putin. The president has always appreciated his great professionalism and unquestioned journalistic authority.\"\nOutside broadcasting, King founded the Larry King Cardiac Foundation in 1988, a charity which helps to fund heart treatment for those with limited financial means or no medical insurance."

      "title": "New light shed on Charles Darwin's 'abominable mystery'",
      "tags": "Fossils,Evolution,Charles Darwin",
      "text": "A scientist has shed new light on the origins of Charles Darwin's \"abominable mystery\".\nThe famous naturalist was haunted by the question of how the first flowering plants evolved.\nDarwin feared this inexplicable puzzle would undermine his theories of evolution, says Prof Richard Buggs.\nForgotten historical documents show a rival scientist was arguing for divine intervention in the rise of the flowering plants.\nThis greatly vexed Darwin in his final months, says the evolutionary biologist at Queen Mary, University of London.\n\"The mystery seems to have been made particularly abominable to him by its highly publicised use by the keeper of botany at the British Museum to argue for divine intervention in the history of life,\" he says.\nDarwin coined the phrase, abominable mystery, in 1879. In a letter to his closest friend, botanist and explorer Dr Joseph Hooker, he wrote: \"The rapid development as far as we can judge of all the higher plants within recent geological times is an abominable mystery.\"\nThe mystery centres on the rise of the flowering plants, or angiosperms, the family of plants that produce flowers and bear their seeds in fruits.\nThey make up the vast majority of all known living plants, from oaks to wildflowers and water lilies.\nFlowering plants appeared on Earth relatively recently on a geological timescale, then swiftly diversified in an explosion of colour, shape and form.\n\"In the fossil record they appear very suddenly in the Cretaceous, dated at about 100 million years ago, and there's nothing that looks like an angiosperm before them and then they suddenly appear and in considerable diversity,\" says Prof Buggs. \nQuestions raised by the sudden appearance of flowering plants are at the heart of Darwin's abominable mystery, he explains. \n\"Why isn't there a gradual evolution of the angiosperms? Why can't we see intermediate forms between the gymnosperms - things like conifers - and the flowering plants? And why, when they appear, are they already so diverse?\"\nDarwin was deeply bothered by how flowering plants conquered the world seemingly in the blink of an eye, while other large groups, such as the mammals, evolved gradually.\nThe advent of flowering plants suggested evolution could be both rapid and abrupt, in direct contradiction to an essential element of natural selection, natura non facit saltum - nature makes no leap.\nDarwin toyed with the idea that flowering plants might have evolved on an as yet undiscovered island or continent.\nIn August 1881, only months before his death, he wrote to Hooker: \"Nothing is more extraordinary in the history of the Vegetable Kingdom, as it seems to me, than the apparently very sudden or abrupt development of the higher plants. I have sometimes speculated whether there did not exist somewhere during long ages an extremely isolated continent perhaps near the South Pole.\"\nIn the library at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Prof Buggs came across a re-print of a lecture from 1876 by the Scottish botanist William Carruthers that gives new context to Darwin's thinking.\nWilliam Carruthers rose to become keeper of botany at the British Museum, and \"a towering figure at the time in paleobotany\".\nIn a lecture to the Geologists Association in the library of University College London, Carruthers highlighted the problems that Darwin had with the fossil record, focussing on the sudden appearance of flowering plants.\nHis comments were reported in The Times and the scientific press, sparking a public debate.\n\"Carruthers was using the abominable mystery to launch an attack on evolution itself,\" says Prof Buggs. \"He thought that God had created the angiosperms in the Cretaceous; they hadn't evolved. \n\"To Darwin and his friends, this was anathema, basically, because [Carruthers] was trying to bring supernatural explanations into the fossil record.\"\nBut Darwin had a problem. The points Carruthers was making about the fossil record were actually very difficult to explain in terms of evolution, says Prof Buggs.\nHe thinks this is what prompted Darwin to coin the phrase \"an abominable mystery\" and makes his case in a scientific paper, published in the American Journal of Botany.\nThe mystery was to Darwin what Fermat's Last Theorem was to the 17th Century mathematician Pierre de Fermat, he adds. \n\"It gives an insight into what was going on in Darwin's mind in the last few years of his life and it gives it an extra romance, almost, a bit like Fermat's Last Theorem - Darwin's last mystery, this problem preying on his mind in his final months.\"\nIn short, no. \"One hundred and forty years later, the mystery's still unsolved,\" says Prof Buggs. \"Of course, we've made lots of progress in our understanding of evolution and in our knowledge of the fossil record, but this mystery is still there.\"\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

      "tags": "Patrick Vallance,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scientists say signs a new coronavirus variant is more deadly than the earlier version should not be a \"game changer\" in the UK's response to the pandemic.\nBoris Johnson has said there is \"some evidence\" the variant may be associated with \"a higher degree of mortality\".\nBut the co-author of the study the PM was referring to said the variant's deadliness remained an \"open question\".\nAnother adviser said he was surprised Mr Johnson had shared the findings when the data was \"not particularly strong\".\nA third top medic said it was \"too early\" to be \"absolutely clear\".\nAt a Downing Street coronavirus news conference on Friday, the prime minister said: \"In addition to spreading more quickly, it also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant - the variant that was first identified in London and the South East - may be associated with a higher degree of mortality.\"\nSpeaking alongside the PM, the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said there was \"a lot of uncertainty around these numbers\" but that early evidence suggested the variant could be about 30% more deadly.\nFor example, Sir Patrick said if 1,000 men in their 60s were infected with the old variant, roughly 10 of them would be expected to die - but this rises to about 13 with the new variant.\nThe announcement followed a briefing by scientists on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) which concluded there was a \"realistic possibility\" that the variant was associated with an increased risk of death.\nBut one of the briefing's co-authors, Prof Graham Medley, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The question about whether it is more dangerous in terms of mortality I think is still open.\" \n\"In terms of making the situation worse it is not a game changer. It is a very bad thing that is slightly worse,\" added Prof Medley, who is a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \nAnother 1,348 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK on Saturday, in addition to 33,552 new infections, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard.\nThere is huge uncertainty in the evidence on how lethal the variant is. \nThe scientific experts that reviewed the data used a precise phrase saying it was a \"realistic possibility\" the new variant is more deadly.\nThat means there's a roughly 50-50 chance it will turn out to be true.\nWith time, and sadly more deaths, the picture will become clearer. \nWhile people debate the uncertainties though, we already know this variant has the ability to kill more people than the old ones. \nA virus that spreads faster (this one is 30-70% faster) will infect more people, more quickly, putting a greater strain on hospitals and leading to a sharper spike in deaths. \nIt is why viruses becoming more transmissible can be a bigger problem than ones becoming more deadly.\nNervtag's chairman Prof Peter Horby defended the government's \"transparency\" in making the announcement.\n\"Scientists are looking at the possibility that there is increased severity... and after a week of looking at the data we came to the conclusion that it was a realistic possibility,\" he said.\n\"We need to be transparent about that. If we were not telling people about this we would be accused of covering it up.\"\nBut Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of Sage subgroup the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), agreed it was too early to draw \"strong conclusions\" as the suggested increased mortality rates were based on \"a relatively small amount of data\".\nHe told BBC Breakfast he was \"actually quite surprised\" Mr Johnson had made the early findings public rather than monitoring the data \"for a week or two more\".\n\"I just worry that where we report things pre-emptively where the data are not really particularly strong,\" Dr Tildesley added. \nPublic Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle also said it was not \"absolutely clear\" the new variant was more deadly than the original.\n\"There is some evidence, but it is very early evidence. It is small numbers of cases and it is far too early to say,\" she told the Today programme.\nMeanwhile, senior doctors are calling on England's chief medical officer to cut the gap between the first and second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.\nThe British Medical Association told Prof Chris Whitty an extension to the maximum gap between jab from three weeks to 12 weeks, to get the first dose to more people, was \"difficult to justify\"."

We'll have another update for you on Sunday morning. \nSenior doctors have asked England's chief medical officer to halve the current 12-week gap between the first and second doses of the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccine. The wait was originally three weeks but was then extended, a decision which Prof Chris Whitty said would double the number of people receiving jabs. But, in a letter seen by the BBC, the British Medical Association said the delay was \"difficult to justify\". It comes after the prime minister revealed the UK variant of Covid-19 may be more deadly.\nEfforts to distribute the jab in the European Union have faced another setback after UK drug-maker AstraZeneca warned of supply issues. Vaccinations have already been halted in some parts of Europe due to a cut in deliveries of the Pfizer vaccine. Cases in many European countries are surging. Germany has reached 50,000 Covid deaths and Spain has seen record infections in recent weeks.\nElizabeth Kerr and Simon O'Brien were engaged to be married when they were taken to hospital in the same ambulance with Covid-19. As his condition worsened, staff at Milton Keynes University Hospital rallied to arrange a wedding for them - and they were able to marry moments before he was sedated and put on a ventilator. Mrs Kerr said she was told it could be their only chance.\"Those are words I never, ever want to hear again,\" she said.\nOn 23 January last year, the Chinese authorities severed transport links out of Wuhan and confined the city's population to their homes.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The prime minister says it is too soon to say whether lockdown will be lifted in the spring.\nBut with the most vulnerable to be offered vaccination by mid-February, what is standing in the way?\nLockdown looks to be having an impact on infection levels with the number of new cases starting to fall.\nBut there are only tentative signs this has filtered through to a slowing of new admissions to hospital.\nAnd even if they start coming down, the overall number of patients in hospital will remain high as patients are being discharged at a much slower rate than they are coming in.\nChris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, predicts hospitals will remain under the current \"intense pressure\" perhaps until the end of February.\nWith no headroom in the NHS, ministers will be cautious about lifting many of the restrictions, especially with the threat of the new faster-spreading variant.\nThere are no guarantees the government will meet the mid-February target.\nThe UK has certainly made a good start. Per head of population, only Israel, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have vaccinated more.\nOver the past week more than two million people have received their first dose. \nThat puts the government on track for achieving its aim of offering a vaccine to everyone over 70, the extremely clinically vulnerable and frontline health and care workers. \nBut the supply chain remains fragile. Pfizer has announced a slowdown in manufacturing for the next couple of weeks so it can upgrade its facilities and ramp up production in the spring.\nThe UK is less reliant on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine than other countries, as we manufacture the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine here.\nThere are millions of doses already made but not all of it has been through the final packaging process or safety checks.\nEnsuring this happens will be crucial to allowing the NHS to keep its foot on the accelerator, especially as the vaccination clinics will have to start factoring in giving second doses from late February onwards.\nThose close to the programme say it will be \"touch and go\" especially if extra supplies of the Pfizer vaccine do not come back on stream as quick as the company is saying they will.\nEven if the supply is good, there will still be lots of vulnerable people.\nNearly 90% of Covid deaths have been in the groups due to get the jab by mid-February.\nBut no vaccine is 100% effective and uptake will not be 100%.\nWhat is more there will still be many vulnerable people in the over-60s age group.\nAs we get further into spring, everyone over the age of 50, as well as younger adults with health conditions, will be offered a vaccine. \nBut even that may not be enough, according to some.\nModelling by the University of Warwick suggests that, even with 85% uptake, a complete lifting of restrictions in April could lead to very high levels of deaths.\n\"Vaccines are not a panacea,\" says Prof Matt Keeling, who led the research.\nAnd for younger age groups, who are at little risk of dying from the virus, there is still the risk of long-Covid, he says. \nAlthough he acknowledges there is still little hard data to quantify this, some studies have suggested one in 10 suffers long-lasting symptoms from infection.\nThe factor that could have a significant impact on spread is whether vaccination stops transmission. \nThe trials showed the vaccines were good at stopping symptoms developing.\nBut it is not yet known whether those who have been vaccinated will still be able to pass the virus on.\nMost people expect there will be some disruption to transmission but how much is not clear - and will not be for months.\nBut on the other side of all this is the huge impact lockdown has. \nThe first priority will, of course, be the re-opening of schools. \nRussell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, says everything must be done to make this happen.\nHe says while schools contributed to spread of the virus, they were not a \"significant driver\", adding schools were closed for the \"benefit of the population\" but at great expense to children.\nOnce schools are open some tough calls will have to be made - and this is where the debate is going to rage.\nBackbench Tory MPs are putting the pressure on the prime minister with the Covid Recovery Group calling for a \"gradually unwrapping\" of society from early March.\nIn the end, it is going to come down to what society is willing to tolerate.\nUK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has spoken about \"de-risking\" Covid.\nHis point is that we will reach a situation at which the level of death and illness caused by Covid is at a level society can \"tolerate\" - just as we tolerate 7,000 to 20,000 people dying from flu every year.\nSociologist Prof Robert Dingwall, who advises the government on the science of human behaviour, believes that point will be reached sooner rather than later.\n\"I think we will see a pretty rapid lifting of restrictions in the spring and summer. \n\"There are some sections of the science community that want to pursue an elimination strategy - but once you start seeing fatality levels down at the level of flu I think the public will accept that.\""

They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "The government's fund to pay for the removal of dangerous cladding is woefully inadequate, oversubscribed and taking too long to make buildings safe, campaigners say.\nMore than three and a half years since the Grenfell Tower fire which killed 72 people, an estimated 700,000 people are still living in high-rise blocks with flammable cladding.  \nThe \u00a31.6bn Building Safety Programme was set up in 2019. Concerns have emerged about the contract that the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government requires applicants to the fund, usually managing agents or building owners, to sign.\nA clause in the contract, seen by the BBC, indicates applicants will be financially liable for any repair work not covered by the fund.\nThe BBC has learnt that some managing agents are refusing to sign the document, further delaying the repair work, and have written to the government asking ministers to clarify the position.\nChristian Hansen, a solicitor at Bindmans LLP specialising in housing law and fire safety claims, said the contract showed that \"there's going to be a significant shortfall between the costs of the [repair] works that are required and the funding provided under the scheme\".\n\"Someone is going to need to pick up the bill and pay the difference. This contract makes clear it's going to be the leaseholders and for many, this could be tens of thousands of pounds, potentially ruinous costs,\" he warned.\nMr Hansen said that leaseholders wanted the focus of government action \"to be on the manufacturers of the defective materials and construction companies who built these buildings\".\n\"At the moment, they are the ones profiting from putting people's lives at risk.\"\nFirst-time buyer Amy Cottenden, who is 28, bought a one-bed flat in Metis Tower in the centre of Sheffield for \u00a385,000 in 2017.\nInspections of the 14-storey building in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy revealed it had the same type of flammable ACM cladding and other safety faults.\nWork to remove the cladding started last month, but Ms Cottenden, who is a frontline NHS health worker, is frustrated at what she describes as a lack of progress.\n\"The pace of work is extremely slow. So far, they've put scaffolding up and removed three panels. They have told us it's going to take between 12 and 24 months just to take the cladding off,\" she said.\n\"It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here. With lockdown, they are saying not to go out, but you are in a building where all you want to do is not be in it. You can't leave. You can't sell. My flat isn't worth anything until it is made safe.\"\nWhile the government's Building Safety Fund is paying for the Grenfell-style cladding to be removed, the building has other fire safety faults, including missing fire breaks, that aren't covered by the scheme.\nIt could cost up to \u00a36m to fix. Flat owners fear they may face huge bills of up to \u00a350,000 each.\n\"We can't pay it and we shouldn't have to pay it. It is not our fault. We could all go bankrupt because of this,\" Ms Cottenden said.\nA spokesperson for Rendall & Rittner, the company which manages Metis Tower, said government funding to remove ACM cladding had been approved totalling \u00a36.3m.\nHowever, an application to the same fund to pay for the removal of other types of unsafe cladding was rejected and the company has appealed against that decision.\nThe company added: \"We understand and sympathise with residents and owners about the uncertainty that this situation is causing and will do all we can to assist.\"\nWhat started as a cladding scandal has now become a much wider building safety crisis, exposing decades of regulatory failure.\nSafety inspections have revealed that many buildings have other serious faults, including missing fire breaks, flammable balconies and defective insulation. None of that is covered by the government's Building Safety Fund.\nDr Nigel Glen, the chief executive of ARMA, the trade association for residential leasehold management, said the additional costs that leaseholders were currently facing for non-cladding-related issues remained a huge concern.\n\"In the longer term, the draining of reserve funds will also mean that in the years to come, any major works that were being saved up for, such as a new roof or lift repairs, will have to be funded anew by the leaseholders,\" he added.\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said that despite the pandemic, significant progress had been made to remove dangerous cladding, but \"building safety remains the responsibility of the building owner and we expect them to ensure any necessary work is carried out safely and effectively\".\n\"All applicants to the Building Safety Fund are told the amount of funding they have been awarded before being asked to sign contracts - this is clearly explained in the guidance,\" the spokesperson added."

      "text": "Wuhan has long since recovered from the world's first outbreak of Covid-19. It is now being remembered not as a disaster but as a victory, and with an insistence that the virus came from somewhere - anywhere - but here.\nFrom the moment a new, pandemic coronavirus emerged in the same city as a laboratory dedicated to the study of new coronaviruses with pandemic potential, Prof Shi Zhengli has found herself the focus of one of the biggest scientific controversies of our time.\nFor much of the past year she has met the suggestion that Sars-Cov-2 might have escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology with angry denial.\nNow though, she has offered her own thoughts on how the initial outbreak may have begun in the city.\nIn an article in this month's edition of Science Magazine she referred to a number of studies that, she said, suggest the virus existed outside of China before Wuhan's first known case in December 2019.\n\"Given the finding of Sars-Cov-2 on the surface of imported food packages, contact with contaminated uncooked food could be an important source of Sars-Cov-2 transmission,\" she wrote. \nFrom one of the world's leading experts on coronaviruses, even the discussion of such a possibility seems unusual.\nCould a spiralling outbreak of infection that almost destroyed Wuhan's health system, sparked the world's first Covid lockdown and spawned a global catastrophe really have arrived on imported food without any signs of similarly devastating outbreaks elsewhere?\nBut with the virus vanquished, the idea that it is a foreign import is repeated with almost unanimity across this city of 11 million people.\n\"It came here from other countries,\" one woman running a hotpot stall in a busy street tells me. \"China is a victim.\"\n\"Where did it come from?\" the next-door fishmonger repeats my question aloud, and then answers: \"It came from America.\" \nOn 23 January last year, the Chinese authorities severed transport links out of Wuhan and confined the city's population to their homes. \nThe tough lockdown coincided with the annual spring festival celebrations and came too late to prevent the global spread of the disease - five million people had already left the city ahead of the holiday.\nDoctors' warnings had gone unheeded and, in an outpouring of anger on the Chinese internet, the authorities stood accused of covering up the initial outbreak in the interests of political stability.\nOne year on, there's little sign of that anger in Wuhan today. In fact it's the humdrum normality that is striking - the traffic jams, the bustling markets and busy restaurants.\nIts success in eventually bringing the virus under control is now being celebrated in a giant exhibition hall, complete with models of medical workers in hazmat suits, installations of hospital beds and - everywhere you look - giant portraits of President Xi Jinping.\nThe accompanying texts mention his \"all-out war\" against the pandemic, his \"resolute decision making\" and how he has been willing to share \"China's solutions\" with the world.\nThere can be no doubting the success of China's mass testing programmes, its tracing apps and the widespread mask wearing.\nBut its strict enforcement of lockdowns, with little hand-wringing over the impact on individual rights, may be far less easy for democratic countries to emulate.\n\"The strategic success achieved in this battle fully manifested the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the significant advantages of the socialist system of our country,\" the exhibition proclaims.\nDespite China's promise of international co-operation, the world is still no closer to an answer to the biggest question of them all - where did the virus come from?\nMany prominent scientists believe that - based on past outbreaks - the most likely source of the coronavirus is a natural one, a \"zoonotic\" leap from bats - known to harbour such viruses - to humans, possibly via an intermediate species.\nBut China has produced very little evidence to show the work that's been done in its search for the source, in particular the testing of historic human samples stored by hospitals to determine where and when the virus really started spreading.\nThose scientists who argue that the possibility of an accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology should also be included as part of any investigation are curious about this apparent silence.\n\"I find it very unlikely that such investigations would not have already occurred,\" Alina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, told me.\n\"It's a serious risk to resume life as usual without knowing where a dangerous human pathogen came from.\"\nInstead of publishing its own evidence though, China appears to be taking an anywhere-but-Wuhan approach, with state media cheerleading the idea that the virus may have arrived in Wuhan on frozen food imports or talking cryptically of \"multiple origins\".\nAt a recent daily press briefing, I asked China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, why such narratives were being promoted in the absence of real scientific evidence.\n\"Your question reveals your prejudice against China,\" she replied. \"Reports have emerged from Australia, Italy and many other countries that the coronavirus was found in multiple places in the autumn of 2019.\"\n\"Aren't these all facts?\" she asked.\nNot according to Alina Chan, who told me that such studies \"lack validation\" and some have been conducted without \"the most basic controls\".\n\"They do not present persuasive scientific evidence that the virus was circulating outside of China before the late 2019 outbreak in Wuhan,\" she said.\n\"The earliest detected cases and outbreak were in Wuhan. Early cases outside of China were found to have travelled from Wuhan. The most similar viruses have been found inside China.\"\nInterestingly, scientists who have found themselves disagreeing strongly about the likelihood of the lab-leak theory, suddenly find themselves very much aligned on whether the virus came from abroad.\n\"I do not find the data linking Sars-Cov-2 to frozen foods to be credible,\" Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the Scripps Research Institute in the US, told me.\nAs someone who is a firm supporter of China's insistence that the virus could not have escaped from a lab, he gives its latest position much shorter shrift.\n\"All the available evidence points to an emergence of the virus somewhere in China in late 2019,\" he said.\nProf Shi Zhengli recently told the BBC in an exchange of emails that she'd welcome \"any form of visit\" by an inquiry team to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to rule out the possibility of a lab leak.\nBut to a follow-up email asking about the alignment of her discussion of possible foreign origins with the Chinese government's own narrative, she sent another reply.\n\"Your question is not friendly,\" she wrote. \nAfter months of delay and wrangling with China about access, a World Health Organization team has arrived in Wuhan to begin its inquiry into the origins of the virus.\nTheir terms of reference hint at the politics behind the scenes, with the document mentioning many of China's talking points, including foreign origins and food-chain transmission.\nDr Daniel Lucey, a physician and infectious disease professor at the Georgetown Medical Centre in Washington, suggests the stage is being set for a foregone conclusion.\n\"In my view, if you line up side-by-side the WHO's terms of reference with the Shi Zhengli Science article,\" he told me, \"then it is clear that the overarching strategic narrative is that the origin of the virus is outside of China.\"\nThe crisis that began in Wuhan is now the world's crisis and, with so many lives and livelihoods lost, answers are desperately needed.\nIf the virus came naturally from bats, an understanding of that pathway is important to protect humanity from the risk of repeated \"spillover\" events from the same source.\nIf it leaked from a lab, an urgent review of safety protocols is needed - not just in China but globally.\nScientists are beginning to wonder if those answers will ever be forthcoming.\n\"It's undeniable now that politics have gotten in the way of science,\" Alina Chan said. \n\"I just hope that the WHO team will relay the details of their experience so that the public can understand what the limitations of their investigation are.\"\nIn Wuhan's giant exhibition hall, the city's place in history is again called into question by one of the concluding sign boards which says Covid-19 broke out \"in multiple places around the world\". \nFor China, this city's past is now propaganda and the truth, like the virus, is being brought under tight control."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": " The rate at which coronavirus infection is falling in the UK - as measured by the R number - has continued to level off. \nThe latest R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sage, is between 0.7 and 0.9, up slightly from the week before.\nIt means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine other people.\nThe R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. \nR is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average.\nMeasles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity. \nThat means, on average, one person will spread measles to 15 others. \nCoronavirus - known officially as Sars-CoV-2 - would have a reproduction number of about three if no action was taken to stop it spreading.\nYou can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards.  \nData - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading. \nIf the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases keeps increasing.\nBut if the R number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, because not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.\nGovernments everywhere want to force the R number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one.\nThe R number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes or as immunity develops. \nMathematical modellers at Imperial College London attempted to track how the number changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced in spring of 2020. \nBefore any measures came in, the R number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one. \nAlthough the R number across the UK is now between 0.7 and 0.9, there are regional differences.\nScotland's estimated R number is between 0.8 and 1.0, up slightly on the previous week.\nIn Wales the number is between 0.6 and 0.9 - while in Northern Ireland it remains between 0.75 and 0.95.\nIn England, the number is risen slightly to between 0.8 and 1.0.\nThe R number is one of the big three.\nAnother is severity - some people have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems. But coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly. \nThe last is the number of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases.\nA vaccination programme, like the one currently under way in the UK, is another way to bring down the reproduction number.\nA coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one."

      "text": "The UK is at an \"extremely precarious\" point, according to the chief medical adviser, despite signs Covid infections are beginning to fall.\nThe virus's reproduction rate is estimated to be at or below one for the first time since early December. \nAnything below one means the epidemic is shrinking.\nBut cases are falling from a \"very, very high level\", Prof Chris Whitty said - and may still be increasing in some areas.\n\"A very small change and it could start taking off again from an extremely high base,\" he warned. \nSpeaking at a Number 10 press conference on Friday evening, the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the \"awful\" death rate would stay high \"for a little while before it starts coming down\".\n\"That was always what was predicted...and I think the information about the new variant doesn't change that\".\nEarly evidence suggests the variant of coronavirus that emerged in the UK may be more deadly, although findings are preliminary and there is a high level of uncertainty. \nDr Susan Hopkins at Public Health England said there was \"evidence from some but not all data sources which suggests that the variant of concern which was first detected in the UK may lead to a higher risk of death than the non-variant. \n\"Evidence on this variant is still emerging and more work is under way to fully understand how it behaves.\" \nThe Department of Health and Social Care said while the UK's R or reproduction number, might be below one - meaning a shrinking epidemic - overall, \"cases remain dangerously high and...it is essential that everyone continues to stay at home, whether they have had the vaccine or not.\"\nMeanwhile, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures suggested cases were decreasing slightly or levelling off across Britain. \nBut infections are falling more slowly than they did during the first lockdown - by somewhere around a quarter every fortnight compared with a halving back in April. \nA further 40,261 cases, and 1,401 deaths were recorded on Friday in the UK.\nMore than five million people had been given a first dose of the vaccine by 21 January, and about half a million had received their second dose.  \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said it is \"too early\" to say whether England's Covid restrictions will be able to end in the spring. \nWhile cases are falling or stable across the rest of the UK, in Northern Ireland cases have continued to rise and the new, more infectious strain has overtaken the older variant of the virus as of the start of January. \nDuring the week ending 16 January, about one in 55 people in England had the virus, the ONS estimated, with one in 35 in London testing positive. \nOne in 100 people had the virus in Scotland and one in 70 in Wales.\nBut in Northern Ireland infections have shot up from an an estimated one in 200 people testing positive in the week to 2 January, to one in 60 last week. \nONS statistician Sarah Crofts said while fewer people were testing positive in England, \"rates remain high and we estimate the level of infection is still over one million people\". \nAnd, she pointed out, \"the picture across the UK is mixed\".\nA survey by tech company ZOE and King's College London, based on swabs of people with and without symptoms, also suggested the R number could be at 0.8.\nAnd it estimated symptomatic cases had fallen by a quarter since last week.  \nMeanwhile, the proportion of people testing positive for the new Covid variant has risen considerably in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, ONS data suggest.\nBut the new strain, which remains by far the main source of infections in England, has yet to overtake the old strain in Scotland and Wales.\nWithin England, the proportion of infections that appear to be due to the new variant remained stable, but the gap between the regions is narrowing. \nIn the figures covering 2 January, 80% of infections looked like the new variant in London compared to 30% in the North East. \nTwo weeks later, that gap had narrowed to 70% in London versus 50% in the North East.\nIt is not clear what is behind the small fall in London, but it may be down to behaviour change, or other variants like the South Africa strain now in circulation and diluting the numbers.\nFollow Rachel on Twitter"

      "tags": "China,Retailing,Global trade,Shipping industry,Freight transport",
      "text": "\"We were paying \u00a31,600 per container in November, this month we've been quoted over \u00a310,000,\" says Helen White. \nThe founder of start-up Houseof.com, which imports lighting from China, says the rise in shipping costs means she's making a loss on what she sells.\nShe's one of many UK importers facing soaring freight costs amid a global shipping crisis that may last months.\nA shortage of empty shipping containers in Asia and bottlenecks at the UK's deep sea ports are behind the problems.\nIt was hoped the backlogs could be cleared during the Chinese New Year holiday in February, but instead a coronavirus outbreak in China is adding to the uncertainty facing firms. \nIn the UK the difficulties in international shipping have coincided with problems faced by businesses trading with the EU after Brexit.\nOne Manchester-based freight forwarder said the logistics industry is facing the most challenging conditions he's seen in the 17 years he's been in the business.\nCraig Poole from Cardinal Maritime said during lockdowns, people have been turning to online shopping, and that's causing a surge in demand for goods from China. \nBut some companies can't absorb the skyrocketing freight costs that shipping lines are charging. That could lead to higher prices for consumers or businesses having to close. \n\"The really unfortunate thing is, the small businesses who can't afford to pay those rates are going to go under as a result,\" Mr Poole said.\nHelen White's lighting range is designed in the UK and manufactured in Guangzhou, China. \nShe said the six-fold increase in shipping costs is hard to take, especially when getting hold of a container \"is like gold dust\".\n\"It's really hard for a small business to absorb those costs. We'll be making a loss on the goods we're selling.\"\nAt the other end of the supply chain, Chinese manufacturers and logistics firms say they are equally frustrated.\nJohnny Tseng is the owner and director of Hong Kong-based J&B Clothing Company Ltd., which manufactures garments for some of the UK's most popular fashion sites including Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing.\nHe's been supplying clothes to British retailers for more than 40 years, but he says his family-run firm won't be able to absorb inflated shipping rates for much longer. \n\"To be honest I don't even know how we can survive if we carry on shipping things at this kind of cost.\"\nHe says he's now being quoted $14,000 to ship a container to the UK, when the usual price is $2,500. \nThe shortage of empty containers in China and congestion at UK ports caused some of his stock to miss the busy Christmas trading period. Now some customers are holding orders for their Autumn-Winter collections until next year. \n\"It's chaos,\" he said. \"We are making a loss. We take it as a loss leader and keep our fingers crossed it will go back to normal after Chinese New Year, but it is a major issue if it persists this way.\"\nUsually during the Chinese New Year holiday, factories in China shut down for two weeks.  There were hopes the pause in production would give UK ports a chance to clear the backlog of ships waiting to dock, and encourage shipping lines to move more empty containers back to Asia, which is a less profitable journey.\nBut rising numbers of coronavirus cases have prompted the Chinese authorities to stagger factory closing dates so that not all workers are travelling to their home regions at the same time. A worsening outbreak could lead to travel restrictions, in which case some factories may not stop production at all.\nCraig Poole says some companies have been caught out by factories closing earlier than planned.\n\"A lot of businesses that can't get those goods away are delaying orders until after Chinese New Year, so this situation could continue 'til March,\" he said.\nPatrick Lee from the Hong Kong-based Unique Logistics International said it could be even longer than that.\n\"Middle of the year at the earliest is what we're hearing from end customers in the UK, and also from some of our people in the industry. Some of the carriers as well,\" he said.\nMr Lee has called on the shipping lines to add more ships to help ease the backlog of stock orders building up at warehouses across China.\n\"They are increasing sailing but can increase a lot more. There are idle ships out there that they can reactivate without too much difficulty,\" he said. \nBut a spokeswoman for the World Shipping Council said carriers are using all available capacity.\n\"The demand for transportation service far exceeds supply. As in any free market, this puts upward pressure on rates,\" she said. \nShipping lines have been trying to drive down demand from British importers by charging a premium for deliveries to the UK, or bypassing the country's ports altogether.\nOne shipping line recently offered freight rates of $12,050 for a 40ft container from China to Southampton, but charged just $8,450 for the same container to travel from China to Rotterdam, Hamburg, or Antwerp.\nThe UK's largest container port at Felixstowe has been experiencing long delays since October. Congestion has also been a problem at the Port of Southampton, albeit to a lesser extent.\nThe bottlenecks were initially caused by a surge in imports as business activity picked up after the first wave of the pandemic. Huge shipments of PPE and the usual Christmas rush added to container volumes and ports struggled to cope. \n\"Most of the carriers just don't want UK cargo because of the issues when the vessels dock, so mainly they're favouring European ports and we are having to truck containers over,\" said freight forwarder Craig Poole.\nHe said that adds a cost of up to \u00a32,000 per container, and takes an extra seven to ten days to reach the delivery point in the UK. \nFor business-owners like Helen White, the difficulties affecting the shipping industry can't be solved quickly enough.\n\"Lots of little start-ups are really hurting,\" she said. \"It has been paired with logistical nightmares across Europe as well. It just feels like logistics is falling apart at the moment. It's hard to see where the resolution is.\""

      "tags": "Germany,Coronavirus vaccines,European Commission,Pfizer,Italy,European Union,Hungary,Poland",
      "text": "Vaccinations in parts of Europe are being held up and in some cases halted because of a cut in deliveries of the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine.\nGermany's most populous state and several regions in Italy have suspended first jabs, while vaccinations for medics in Madrid have been stopped too.\nThe US pharmaceutical firm has had to cut deliveries temporarily while cases in many European countries surge.\nGermany has reached 50,000 Covid deaths and Spain has seen record infections.\nItaly and Poland have threatened to take legal action in response to the reduction in vaccines. Pfizer said last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian processing plant. The EU has ordered 600 million doses from Pfizer and has also authorised the Moderna vaccine.\nResponding to the delays, Hungary's right-wing Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, said the EU had to take some responsibility because of its slow approval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which may come at the end of next week. \nHungary has reached a deal with Russia to buy up large quantities of the Sputnik V vaccine, even though it has not received EU approval.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said after an EU summit on Thursday night that quick delivery had to be ensured. \"We are determined to provide more predictability and stability to the delivery process and we look forward to more vaccines and more doses coming on stream soon,\" she said.\nItaly has been told to expect a a 20% cut in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine next week - it has already seen a 29% dip this week - and Rome is considering legal action. Special Covid commissioner Domenico Arcuri says jabs fell from 80,000 a day to an average of 28,000 last Saturday. Some Italian regions have seen a 60% fall in doses.\nGermany, where BioNTech is based, has had several states struggle with vaccine deliveries. North Rhine-Westphalia, in the west, halted jabs in hospitals on Tuesday and paused first vaccinations in nursing homes too. Second vaccinations are continuing but special centres for the over-80s will not open now until next month.\nAuthorities in and around the Spanish capital Madrid have temporarily stopped vaccinating healthcare personnel this week, saying they had only received half the doses they were expecting. The national government is rationing distribution until Pfizer's deliveries improve. Spain reported a record 44,357 cases in one day on Thursday.\nRomania has warned that its vaccine stocks could be down to almost zero by the end of the first week of February. The Czech government has warned that the reduction in distribution has created \"huge complications\".\nPoland, which began by vaccinating healthcare workers and moved to care homes this week, saw a 50% drop in the number of vaccines delivered this week. Ministers say they have been promised normal service by mid-February. If that is not the case, Warsaw says it would consider legal action.\nEU leaders agreed late on Thursday to keep their internal borders open but warned that restricting non-essential travel may be needed to curb the spread of the virus. \nMs von der Leyen suggested Covid hot spots could be labelled as \"dark red\" zones, requiring a negative test from travellers before departure. Hours later, European stock markets fell on Friday, particularly shares in travel companies.\nFrance has said it will impose tighter travel restrictions for European arrivals from Sunday night, requiring a negative PCR test within three days of travel. Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran has appealed to people to stop using home-made fabric masks - health officials are recommending that medical masks are worn instead.\nBelgium is to ban non-essential travel for Belgian residents from late January to 1 March, other than for people living in border areas to go shopping. Anyone making an \"essential\" trip that lasts more than 48 hours will have to self-isolate and take two Covid tests after they return.\nDenmark, meanwhile, is suspending flights from the UAE for five days because of a tip-off suggesting that pre-flight tests are unreliable. Denmark requires all air passengers to have tests taken in the 24 hours before a flight.\nThe total number of German Covid deaths climbed above 50,000 on Friday, but the number of infections has fallen in the past week. Leading virologist Christian Drosten has warned Germans that as increasing numbers get vaccinated there will be growing pressure to curb restrictions. \"Then we won't be talking in terms of 20,000 or 30,000 infections a day but in the worst case scenario 100,000,\" he told Spiegel magazine."

      "title": "Covid: Side-by-side in a London mosque - funerals and a food bank",
      "tags": "Islam,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A mosque in east London has closed for all communal prayer. Instead it is serving two purposes - providing funerals and feeding the local community. Michael Buchanan finds a team of volunteers there battling to deal with the pandemic.\nThe family shuffled quietly past a crate of milk cartons. They came through the small porch, towards the open coffin. Inside was a woman - a loved one - who died of Covid two days ago. The coffin sat feet away from tins and packets to be distributed by the local food bank. The milk was the latest delivery. \nIt is impossible to capture the enormous consequences of the pandemic. But last Saturday lunchtime, this tragic image - one of grief and hardship coming together - came close, for me at least. \nCovid-19 has made extraordinary demands of so many different people, but what is currently happening at the Masjid Ibrahim and Islamic Centre in east London is truly remarkable. Situated on a busy road, with the noise of ambulance sirens regularly shattering its peaceful interior, the mosque has closed to communal prayer and is open for two other purposes - to provide a funeral service and a food bank to the local community. Both are inundated. \n\"We've had so many bodies coming in. It's quite shocking. It's one after another after another. We've never had that situation before,\" says Sofia Bhatti. Alongside her friend, Tabassum Khokhar - known as Tabs - the pair are unheralded heroes. They volunteer to wash the bodies of Covid-positive women prior to burial. \nThe practice, called Ghusl, is a sacred Islamic ritual and is usually performed by the deceased's relatives, who cleanse and shroud the body. But Covid restrictions mean families are currently denied that religious honour, so volunteers like Sofia and Tabs are taking on what they consider to be a privileged task. \n\"We actually believe that when we are shrouding here, that God is shrouding the soul at the same time,\" says Tabs, standing by a coffin. By day, she works as a teaching support worker in a local school, so the PPE that the mosque provides - bodysuit, footwear, two sets of gloves, masks and visors - is crucial for her. \"I make sure my PPE is secure because it's not just about me, it's about my family. I have an 81-year-old mother.\" \nThe women are seeing first hand - and in graphic detail - the pressure the NHS is under. \"Very often we see bodies coming in with a lot of medical equipment still attached to them,\" says Sofia. \"Tubes and pipes and catheters still attached. So it makes our job a little bit harder.\" One of the women they washed during my visit had died in the ambulance, never actually reaching hospital. \nThere are far more bodies than during the first peak and there is a larger age range. One day this week, the mosque was handling seven bodies. A few days earlier they said they'd processed 10 funerals, all arranged for free and paid for by donations. Before the pandemic, they'd handled two to three funerals a week. The two local hospital trusts in east London have each had more than 1,000 Covid deaths since the start of the pandemic. More have died at home.  \nThe borough of Newham, where the mosque sits, has suffered a disproportionate number of deaths. Home to the Olympic Park, the 2012 London games were meant to regenerate this area. Yet it retains high levels of poverty and overcrowded housing. Add in a diverse population, rich in south Asian culture, and large numbers of people who can't work from home and the virus has sadly ripped through its residents. \nIsfand Aslam said he's shocked by what's going on. His father, Mohammad, died on 3 January, a week after falling ill. His positive Covid test result arrived two days after his death. The 85-year-old was a committee member at the Masjid Ibrahim and despite his age had been in good health. \"It took a week between him passing away and getting buried. Initially I was getting a lot of condolences from friends. But by the end of that week I am giving condolences to three friends because their fathers had passed away. It's now got to the stage where everybody we know knows somebody who has passed away.\"\nThe sheer number of deaths is impacting the area's main Muslim cemetery. Normally, the Gardens of Peace buries three to four people each day. They're currently carrying out an average of 15 funerals daily. Overall, they are about 50% busier than usual. They can no longer promise burials within 24 hours, as per Muslim custom. \nDespite this, there is still a concerning number of people in the local area who either don't think Covid is real or are resistant to taking a vaccine. There was anger among some community leaders before Christmas when it emerged the Bangladeshi High Commission in London held a cultural evening to celebrate its independence. Photos from the event, on 16 December, showed a group - including the High Commissioner herself - standing close together with no masks or social distancing. The High Commission said performers had been Covid tested and it had issued 10 videos in Bangla urging British-Bangladeshis to adhere to UK government guidance.  \nTo counter disinformation among its members, an imam at the Masjid Ibrahim, Mohammad Ammar, filmed a short video of himself being injected with the vaccine and urged his congregation to follow suit. Imam Ammar has actually been furloughed by the mosque as it focusses all its resources on battling the pandemic, including feeding its local community. \nThe virus forced the mosque to open a food bank in March. It is still running 10 months on. On Monday night, I watched a steady stream of people gather in the gloom at the rear of the mosque to fill their bags. Most were collecting on behalf of a larger household, and the mosque says they're currently feeding 350 families each week, including students, refugees, people with no access to public funds and those who've lost income.  \nAmong those collecting food on Monday was Mohammad Rahman. A 42-year-old chef, he lost his job in an Indian restaurant three months ago. The married father of two boys - aged eight and six - told me he was already in rent arrears and struggling to pay his energy bills. \"My son says 'where is the pizza'? But I have no money. He says '[can I have] chicken and chips'? But I have no money. The shops are open, but no money\", he adds, taking his hands from his pockets. \nIn normal times, the Masjid Ibrahim would attract about 1,100 worshippers over three floors for Friday prayers, and there has been some pressure on the leadership to reopen for communal worship. But Asim Uddin, chairman of the mosque, says now is not the time. \"Prayers, yes, it's important. But right now what is the need? The need of the community is they want to be fed and they want a place where they can respectfully bury their loved ones. And the demand is overwhelming. Right now, it's better they stay home, and they can pray at home until the situation goes back to normal.\"\nMichael Buchanan is the BBC's social affairs correspondent and has been reporting on the impact of the pandemic on communities in the UK. Last year, he visited the town of Pontypool to find out what impact coronavirus restrictions were having in Wales."

      "text": "A health board boss has criticised council staff for potentially sharing Covid vaccine invites with colleagues.\nThe board meeting in North Wales heard some council staff, not within groups currently being vaccinated, booked appointments by following a link in an email only intended for the recipient.\nBetsi Cadwaladr health board's chairman Mark Polin said such actions could deprive someone else of a jab.\nDenbighshire council said it had warned staff the emails were not to be abused.\nIt is not clear if anyone not entitled succeeded in getting a Covid jab, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. \nOnly front-line social care and health workers, those over 80 and 70 years old, care home residents and their carers are currently being vaccinated. \nIndependent member Jackie Hughes spoke about the matter at Thursday's monthly health board meeting.\nAnswering her query, Dr Chris Stockport, the health board's executive director of primary care and community services, said: \"We are very clear with our local authority partners and teams of what frontline means in the same way we are elsewhere.\n\"When you arrive [for a vaccine] there's a process of validation. \n\"The likelihood is they will experience some difficulties working through the booking system [if they try to get into a higher vaccination cohort].\n\"It adds complications for a busy team and I would ask them not to do that when it's a clear effort to circumvent the cohort.\"\nAt Thursday's daily press briefing the UK Government Home Secretary Priti Patel said people who jumped the queue for the vaccine were \"morally reprehensible\" as they were putting the lives of vulnerable people at risk.\nShe said all the UK Government's measures were under review but \"our focus is getting that vaccine to the most vulnerable to make sure we can protect them and obviously protect others in the community\".\nMr Polin added: \"Whilst we understand the concerns people should not be doing what they are doing.\n\"The priority groups have been identified with clear medical guidance and sound reasoning behind it.\n\"So people jumping the queue are depriving someone else, potentially, of receiving the vaccine at the point at which they should.\"\nHe said it was a temporary problem, adding: \"We are changing the booking system, so this opportunity is not going to last much longer.\"\nHe said staff were looking out for any inappropriate bookings."
