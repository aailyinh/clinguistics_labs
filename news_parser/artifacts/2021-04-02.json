      "tags": "Department of Health & Social Care,Social care,Care homes,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Campaigners have started legal action against the government over guidance that bans care home residents in England aged 65 and over from taking trips outside the home. \nJohn's Campaign, of residents and their loved ones, says the ban is unlawful. \nThey are also challenging the requirement for residents to self-isolate for 14 days after such visits. \nThe government said its guidance provides a \"range of opportunities\" for visitors to spend time with loved ones.\nNearly all residents have now had at least one dose of the vaccine, and care homes have been cautiously reopening, allowing indoor visits with designated family or friends. \nBut the government guidance, updated on 8 March, says trips to see family or friends \"should only be considered\" for under-65s while national Covid restrictions apply because they increase the risk of bringing Covid into a home. \nVisits out for residents, whatever their age, \"should be supported in exceptional circumstances such as a visit to a friend or relative at the end of their life\", it adds - but on returning to the home, the resident must self-isolate for two weeks.\nThe legal letter sent to the Department of Health and Social Care by John's Campaign says the decision whether someone can go on a visit outside a care home should be based on individual risk assessments. \nTo deny this contravenes equality and human rights legislation, the group says. \n\"The 440,000 people living in care homes include some who moved in through their own volition, with full mental capacity, never guessing that this simple freedom, enjoyed by everyone else in the population, apart from prisoners, could so easily be denied them,\" campaign co-founder Julia Jones said.\n\"Those who cannot make their own choices have relatives and friends who would normally be glad to take responsibility but have been excluded choices.\"\nShe told the BBC Today programme those in care homes were being discriminated against because of their age and had been \"comprehensively ignored\". \n\"The Department of Health, and particularly Public Health England, looks at care home residents as if they are a different species,\" she said. \"These are people living in care homes and they have the range of morbidities, of problems, of disabilities and of capabilities.\" \nMike Padgham, chair of the Independent Care Group, said he hoped the government would provide further guidance for after 12 April, when restrictions are due to ease further, so some visits outside could take place. \n\"I think the risks of not going out are greater than the risks perhaps of getting the virus,\" he told Today, but added it was right to be cautious and there had to be \"a balance\", with an individual risk assessment for each resident. \nHe said getting care home residents outside \"does them the world of good\". \nThe campaigners also say the progress made on vaccinations and testing make the 14-day isolation rules unnecessary.\nThe pre-action letter asks the DHSC to reply within 14 days, after which the lawyers for the campaigners will decide whether to apply for a judicial review. \nA Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: \"We know just how crucial visits are in supporting the health and wellbeing of residents. \n\"Our current guidance provides a range of opportunities for visitors to meet and spend time with their loved ones in a care home under carefully designed conditions to keep everyone safe. \n\"Residents over 65 can make visits outside of care homes in exceptional circumstances and all decisions in relation to visiting should be made on the basis of a risk assessment centred around the individual. This is made clear in our guidance. \n\"As we move along the roadmap, we are looking to open up more opportunities for visiting both into and outside of care homes, wherever this can be done safely and is supported by data.\""

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "Pfizer says its vaccine is preventing 91% of coronavirus cases in the six months after people are immunised.\nAnd a separate study shows even people in their 80s and 90s are producing impressive levels of antibodies after receiving both doses of the vaccine. \nOnly 63% of them, however, also produce the T-cells that help maintain those antibodies in the longer term.\nAnd the crucial question of how long the protection from the vaccine lasts remains unanswered. \nPfizer analysed data from 46,000 people on the original clinical trial, exactly six months after their second dose.\nIt also looked at 800 trial participants in South Africa and concluded the vaccine was equally effective against the variant identified there - despite laboratory studies suggesting people's antibodies were less effective at attacking this variant. \n\"The high vaccine efficacy observed through up to six months following a second dose and against the variant prevalent in South Africa provides further confidence in our vaccine's overall effectiveness,\" chairman and chief executive officer Albert Bourla said.    \nSimilar, long-term studies are taking place for all the vaccines including Oxford-AstraZeneca, but Pfizer has been the first to report.\nSeparate research by the University of Birmingham looked at what happened to the immune systems of 100 80- to and 96-year-olds.\nBlood samples showed high levels of antibodies able to effectively neutralise the original coronavirus.\nAgainst the variant identified Brazil, however, they were 14 times less effective.\nAlthough, the researchers were confident those who had received the Pfizer vaccine would still be protected against the Brazil variant because their levels of antibodies were so high.\nHowever, only 63% of people in this age group produced a detectable T-cell response. \n\"It is not clear what that means for clinical protection in the longer term,\" one of the researchers, Dr Helen Parry, said.\nT-cells can kill the cells in the body that have been hijacked and turned into coronavirus factories. \nBut they also help maintain levels of antibodies over time. \n\"That's something we'll keep an eye on very closely,\" researcher Prof Paul Moss said.

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

      "text": "People should not socialise indoors with other households even if they are vaccinated, Boris Johnson has said.\nAs the Easter Bank Holiday weekend began, the PM said \"we're not yet at that stage\" as coronavirus vaccines \"are not giving 100% protection\".\nPolice forces across England have also called for people to obey the rules over the bank holiday.\nIt is the first weekend since England's rules were relaxed to allow outside gatherings of more than two people. \nWith groups of up to six or two households allowed to meet, councils and police forces are preparing for beauty spots and parks to be busy.\nBut, despite unseasonably warm weather earlier this week, the weekend is forecast to be mild before temperatures drop further from Sunday, with a warning of snow in northern Scotland.\nRules have also recently been relaxed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - with people also allowed to meet outside in small groups.\nIn a video published on Twitter to answer questions about the rule changes, the prime minister addressed the question: Can I meet family and friends indoors if they are vaccinated?\n\"I'm afraid the answer is no, because we're not yet at that stage,\" he said. \n\"We're still very much in a world where you can meet friends and family outdoors under the rule of six or two households.\n\"And even though your friends and family members may be vaccinated, the vaccines are not giving 100% protection, and that's why we just need to be cautious.\n\"We don't think that they entirely reduce or remove the risk of transmission.\"\nHe later tweeted: \"This Easter weekend, please remember that outdoors is generally much safer than indoors.\"\nMore than 4.9 million people in the UK have now been fully vaccinated - receiving both doses - while 31.3 million first doses have been given. \nPfizer said its vaccine prevented 91% of coronavirus cases in the six months after people are given their second dose.\nMeanwhile, a recent study found a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab offered 76% protection for three months, and this went up to 82% after the second dose.\nSeveral police forces have also issued warnings ahead of the bank holiday. The Metropolitan Police said officers will be \"highly visible\" in open spaces in London to remind people in groups of more than six that they could be fined.\n\"After a long and difficult few months, let's not undo all of that hard work now,\" said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors.\n\"We can expect to see parks and beauty spots busier than usual,\" she said, adding: \"Don't crowd in open spaces and do follow the rule of six, or, only meet up with one other household.\"\nOther forces have said they will be patrolling parks and beaches, with Merseyside Police planning to remind people that alcohol is banned at some beaches.\nAlso pleading with people to follow the rules, Sussex Police said: \"Warm blankets and hot drinks are the way forward this weekend - not bringing friends or family into your home.\"\nMeanwhile, Police Scotland said if anyone was visiting their local beauty spots, they should do \"safely and respectfully\".\nRules have been relaxed in Scotland, where the \"stay at home\" order has been lifted and replaced with \"stay local\". \nIn Wales, since last weekend people have been allowed to meet groups of six or two households outdoors, as well as travel within the country for holidays with their own household.\nIn Northern Ireland, up to six people from two households are allowed to meet in a private garden and 10 people in public spaces.\nIt comes as a further 52 people died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, according to UK government figures released on Friday - although the data does not include Wales. \nThe number of cases has increased by 3,402 - the lowest since mid-September.\nEarlier this week, parks an beaches were busy as the UK saw a spell of warm weather, including its hottest March day since 1968 as temperatures topped 24.5C on Tuesday.\nTwo parks in Nottingham were closed after large crowds failed to socially distance and left rubbish behind.\nForecasters predict that this weekend will be milder, ahead of air from the Arctic moving in from Sunday night and bringing colder weather across the UK - with even gales and snow possible in some areas.\nA yellow weather warning predicting heavy snow showers has been issued for northern Scotland from 18:00 BST on Sunday."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Healthcare,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Seven people have died from unusual blood clots after getting the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK, the medicines regulator has confirmed to the BBC. \nIn total, 30 people out of 18 million vaccinated by 24 March had these clots.\nIt is still not clear if they are just a coincidence or a genuine side effect of the vaccine.\nThe Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency says the benefits continue to outweigh any risk. \nThe World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency have echoed this conclusion.\nA spokeswoman for AstraZeneca said: \"Patient safety remains the company's highest priority.\"\nHowever, concern has led to other countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands and Canada to restrict the vaccine's use only to older people. \nThe data released by the MHRA on Friday showed 22 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) which is a type of blood clot in the brain. \nThese were accompanied by low levels of platelets, which help form blood clots, in the body. The MHRA also found other clotting problems alongside low platelet levels in eight people. \nNow the MHRA has confirmed, in an email to the BBC, that \"sadly seven have died\". \nDr June Raine, the chief executive of the MHRA, said: \"The benefits\u2026 in preventing Covid-19 infection and its complications continue to outweigh any risks and the public should continue to get their vaccine when invited to do so.\"\nInvestigations are under way to determine if the AstraZeneca vaccine is causing the very rare blood clots. Earlier this week the European Medicines Agency said it was \"not proven, but is possible\".\nTwo issues are raising suspicions. The first is the unusual nature of the clots which, including low levels of platelets and rare antibodies in the blood that have been linked to other clotting disorders.\n\"This raises the possibility that the vaccine could be a causal factor in these rare and unusual cases of CVST, though we don't know this yet, so more research is urgently needed,\" said Prof David Werring, from the UCL Institute of Neurology. \nThe other issue is the difference between the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.\nThere have been two cases of CVSTs after Pfizer in the UK, out of more than 10 million vaccinated, but these did not have the low platelet levels. \nHowever, there remains uncertainty around how common these clots normally are. Estimates range from two cases per million people every year to nearly 16 in every million in normal times and the coronavirus has been linked to abnormal clotting, which may be making these clots more common. \nGermany has reported 31 CVSTs and nine deaths out of the 2.7 million people vaccinated there, with most cases in young or middle-aged women.\nSimilar data on who has been affected in the UK has not been published in the UK, but a wider mix of people are thought to have been affected. \nAll medicines, from vaccines to paracetamol, have the potential to cause severe side effects. \nThe seasonal flu jab has around a one-in-a-million chance of causing the nerve disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome.\nSo, the real question is: Are the risks worth the benefits?\nEven if the vaccine was the cause, and this is still not proven, the numbers suggest around one death in every 2.5 million people vaccinated. \nHowever, this has to be weighed against the known threat posed by coronavirus.\nIf 2.5 million 60-year-old people caught coronavirus then around 50,000 would die. If they were all 40-year-olds then around 2,500 would die. \nThis balance of risk and benefit will continue to be assessed as more safety data comes in and as the vaccine programme moves into younger people, who are at lower risk of dying from Covid-19.\nOne scientist has told the BBC that evidence is growing that the blood clot events are \"causally related\", although he stressed that the benefits of taking the AstraZeneca vaccine still far outweighed the risks of not getting the jab. \nProf Paul Hunter, a medical microbiologist at the University of East Anglia, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It is not uncommon to get clusters of rare events purely by chance.\n\"But, once you find that cluster in one population and it then crops up in another - such as previously in the German and now in the English - then I think the chances of that being a random association is very, very low.\n\"Clearly more work needs to be done, but I think the evidence is shifting more towards it being causally related at the moment.\"\nHowever, public health expert Prof Linda Bauld, of the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Breakfast the cases were \"rare events\" and stressed there was no event \"at the moment of a causal link - that the vaccine would be directly causing these outcomes\". \nShe urged the public to continue coming forward for a jab, and added: \"Covid itself increases the risk of blood clots quite significantly and it's possible that that may be part of the explanation why we're seeing this.\"\nHave you been affected by the issues raised?

      "text": "Huge crowds have again gathered in Cardiff Bay, despite coronavirus restrictions still being in place.\nHundreds of people were seen partying close together on the steps outside the Senedd on Friday evening.\nIt follows similar scenes outside the same building earlier in the week, when three police officers were injured and litter was dumped on the waterfront. \nCardiff council leader Huw Thomas said people who took part should be \"deeply ashamed of themselves\". \nCovid rules state only six people from two different households can meet outdoors. \nOn videos posted on Twitter, people could be seen singing and drinking from later afternoon and well into the evening.\nMr Thomas said police had taken over from council marshals, who had been patrolling the site in the day, after the situation \"escalated\".\nBBC Wales has attempted to contact South Wales Police for comment. It is not known if any arrests have been made. \nMath Wiliam, who lives in Cardiff Bay and works for a Plaid Cymru Member of the Senedd and is a member of the party, said: \"There were hundreds, possibly over 1,000 people, out in Cardiff Bay engaging in what I would describe as partying, with the largest cohort assembled on the steps of the Senedd. \n\"There was no adherence to social distancing rules, which was unsurprising given that many people were heavily under the influence.\"\nHe added the number of people coming to the bay had been \"increasing daily\". \nBBC Wales reporter Mark Hutchings said \"hundreds\" were gathered and it was \"calm, if noisy, at the time, though no social distancing\".\nMr Thomas said: \"We have been in close communication with the police throughout the day. \n\"This is concerning and disappointing. It flies in the face of the regulations, which are there to keep us safe. \n\"I anticipate a bombsite there tomorrow. We'd put out extra wheelie bins, but rubbish is just being dumped. The clear-up will mean an unnecessary cost to the council and so the taxpayer.\n\"But this is about public health and a clear abuse of the rules. I worry about a spike in cases after this. It in fact risks prolonging restrictions, rather than easing them, as people there seemed to be complaining about.\"\nIt comes after a student launched an online petition for more bins in Cardiff Bay after rubbish was dumped there earlier in the week. \nWales' Covid restrictions were eased last Saturday, with people allowed to travel anywhere within the country and meet a maximum of six different people from two different households outdoors. \nHowever, pubs remain closed until at least 26 April and it is still against the rules to travel between Wales and the other UK nations without a reasonable excuse. \nEarlier this week, police said violence and anti-social behaviour would \"not be tolerated\" as people gathered in the same area on Tuesday.\nSouth Wales Police said a number of missiles, including bottles, were thrown at officers, three of whom suffered minor injuries, during the disorder earlier in the week.\nCardiff council said on Wednesday that it had taken three hours to clean up the \"unacceptable amount of litter\" in Cardiff Bay and the city's parks."

      "text": "Nike has won its lawsuit against Brooklyn art collective MSCHF over their controversial 'Satan Shoes' that contain a drop of real human blood in the soles.\nThe $1,018 (\u00a3740) trainers are modified Nike Air Max 97s that feature an inverted cross, a pentagram and the words \"Luke 10:18\".\nMSCHF produced the shoes in collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X.\nIt said only 666 pairs were made and all but one have already been shipped.\nNike claimed trademark infringement, asking a federal court in New York to stop MSCHF from selling the shoes and prevent them from using its famous Swoosh.\n\"MSCHF and its unauthorised Satan Shoes are likely to cause confusion and dilution and create an erroneous association between MSCHF's products and Nike,\" the sports shoe giant said in the lawsuit.\nLawyers for MSCHF countered that the 666 pairs it created were \"not typical sneakers, but rather individually-numbered works of art that were sold to collectors for $1,018 each\".\nSiding with Nike, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on Thursday.\nThe impact of the ruling remains unclear as MSCHF had indicated it has no plans to produce any more pairs of the shoe.\nMSCHF \"dropped\" the black and red shoes on Monday, coinciding with the launch of Lil Nas X's latest song Montero (Call Me By Your Name), which debuted on YouTube last Friday.\nThe song features the rapper, who came out as gay in 2019, celebrating his sexuality and rejecting attempts to shame him. \nIn a heavily stylised music video, he slides down a pole from heaven to hell before dancing provocatively with Satan, then snaps his neck and steals his horns.\nThe imagery and the shoes both reference the Bible verse Luke 10:18 - \"So He told them, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven'.\"\nEach shoe also features a signature Nike air bubble cushioning sole, containing 60 cubic centimetres (2.03 fluid ounces) of red ink and a single drop of human blood, donated by members of the MSCHF art collective. \nIn its filing with the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Nike said it did not approve or authorise the customised Satan Shoes.\n\"There is already evidence of significant confusion and dilution occurring in the marketplace, including calls to boycott Nike in response to the launch of MSCHF's Satan Shoes, based on the mistaken belief that Nike has authorised or approved this product,\" it said.\nThe lawsuit cited a tweet by popular shoe influencer @Saint from last Friday, which teased the upcoming release of the shoes and drummed up publicity over the weekend on social media and in the media in the US.\nSome conservatives, including South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, and some religious followers, took offence at the controversial design of the shoes and criticised Lil Nas X and MSCHF on Twitter. \nLil Nas X hit back at the governor and other critics on Twitter, tweeting several memes on his profile in response to the Nike lawsuit.\nJoseph Rasch of Tennessee, who paid $1,080 for the trainers, says he is worried the conflict means his money will be lost.\n\"I'm hoping I'll receive them since I paid for them,\" he told BBC OS on World Service radio, adding that he made the purchase not because he definitely planned to wear them but as a political statement.\n\"I wanted to support a black gay man who is attempting to show a different narrative in a majority Christian country that currently is dealing with a lot of issues with black people. So what better way to do that than to buy shoes that this person has collaborated with?\" he said.\nBuyer McKenzi Norris of South Carolina, a longtime follower of the MSCHF art collective, said Nike's lawsuit had disrupted his plans to resell the trainers for $2,500 on eBay, which removed his listing.\n\"In general I think Nike's lawsuit and their intervention is pretty ridiculous considering how much damage it can cause to everyday people like me who just like to customise and resell their products legally,\" he said."

      "text": "New rules to help pubs, cafes and restaurants reopen outdoors safely in England on 12 April have sparked anger from industry groups.\nAll customers will have to sign in on entry, not just one member of the group like before. It is also unclear whether payment at the bar will be permitted.\nUK Hospitality said it would burden struggling pubs and staff and risk customers deciding not to go out.\nThe government said it was providing as much flexibility as possible to venues.\nIt also said it had removed other unpopular requirements such as drinking curfews.\nUnder the new guidance, every customer aged 16 and over will have to check in to NHS test and trace before entering a venue, or give their contact details to staff.\nPubs and restaurants must take \"reasonable steps\" to stop people who won't comply from coming in, or they could face a \u00a31,000 fine.  \nCarl Ford, an accountant based in Tamworth, told the BBC he was frustrated and confused by the rules.\n\"I feel like it's almost like going back to school where I have to sign in and out,\" he said. \n\"I don't understand why I have to do this in a restaurant or pub, but I don't need to do this in a supermarket where you have a free for all. People don't have to sign in and they can pick up fruit with their hands.\"\nOthers were supportive of the idea, however, saying it could reduce transmission.\nIn a joint statement, UK Hospitality, the British Beer & Pub Association and the British Institute of Innkeeping said the rules would add \"more confusion and inconvenience for customers and staff\".\nThey also warned if indoors payments were not permitted from 12 April, then some pubs, particularly in rural areas with poor broadband, would be unable to take payments at all.\nWith the government also considering whether \"proof of immunity\" should be a requirement for entry, the groups warned that \"millions\" of people could be put off going to pubs and venues at a time when the hospitality industry is struggling.\n\"Pubs will already be trading at a loss when they reopen with all the existing restrictions and Covid-secure measures in place,\" they said. \n\"Adding further disproportionate and discriminatory measures threatens the very survival of thousands of businesses.\"\nHospitality businesses have been hit particularly hard by lockdown closures and restrictions. \nIn the year to February, 368,000 payroll jobs were lost in the accommodation and food service sectors. The next worst hit sector was retail where 123,000 jobs were lost.\nA government spokeswoman said: \"Public health rules are kept under constant review and we are providing as much flexibility for pubs and other hospitality businesses as possible. \n\"The roadmap [to reopening] set out that hospitality would open from step two, and removed any requirements for curfews or a substantial meal for customers.\"\nShe said no final decisions had been taken on whether Covid-status certification could play a role in reopening the economy.\nShe added that the government continued to support the hospitality sector through the pandemic with its new \u00a35bn Restart Grant scheme, the VAT cut, business rates relief, and by extending furlough."

      "text": "Beauty YouTuber James Charles has admitted sending sexually explicit messages to two 16-year-old boys.\n\"I fully understand my actions and how they are wrong,\" the 21-year-old influencer said in a video posted to his YouTube channel on Thursday.  \nAllegations against Charles first emerged on social media earlier this year.\nIn February, the influencer - who has 25 million subscribers to his YouTube channel - was accused by one teenager of grooming, which Charles denied, saying he flirted with the person because he believed the boy to be 18.\nCharles had denied previous accusations, but in Thursday's video, titled \"Holding myself accountable\", he admitted wrongdoing.\nHe says there were two incidents - one last year and one more recently - where he came to be aware that the person he was exchanging messages with was underage.\n\"These conversations should have never happened,\" Charles said in the 14-minute video. He admitted he could have searched for them on other social media platforms and found their real ages. \nHe also publicly apologised to the boys and said he would take time away from posting on social media to \"educate\" himself about these issues.\nThe scandal is not the first time the beauty influencer has faced a controversy.\nIn 2019, he was accused of using \"fame and money to try to manipulate someone's sexuality\", which he denied.    \nWhen addressing why he has been \"reckless\" in past relationships, he said it's because he's \"desperate\".\nIn a video he made addressing the 2019 accusation, Charles made a promise to be more careful moving forward. \nBut as time progressed, he says in his most recent video, he began \"ignoring red flags again\". \nHe ended his video vowing to be more cautious in the future and stop treating his social media accounts as dating apps. \nAccusations - and admissions - of sexual misconduct by YouTubers have become more and more common. \nIn 2019, YouTube deleted singer Austin Jones's channel, after he admitted to exchanging sexually explicit images and videos with underage girls.\nDavid Dobrik, one of YouTube's top earners in 2020, recently had his channel demonetised by YouTube following a rape allegation about a former associate. \nMr Dobrik has denied any wrongdoing.\nCody Godwin is based in San Francisco.

      "text": "The pace of Europe's Covid-19 vaccination campaign has picked up and in many countries infection rates have been falling.\nLockdowns are gradually being eased as the summer tourist season gets under way, and there are plans for an EU-wide digital vaccination certificate to be in place by 1 July.\nNationwide curfew ended on 20 June, 10 days earlier than planned. Face masks are no longer required outdoors. \nRestaurants, cafes and bars can serve customers indoors, with 50% capacity and up to six people per table.\nStanding concerts will resume on 30 June and nightclubs on 9 July (with 75% capacity). People attending will need a health pass which shows either full vaccination, a negative test within the previous 72 hours, or else a previous coronavirus infection.\nRestaurants, bars, beer gardens, museums, hotels and concert halls have reopened.\nMedical grade masks are compulsory in shops and on public transport.\nLocal authorities can impose stricter rules in high infection rate areas. \nFrom 30 June, working from home will no longer be compulsory.\nOn 21 June, Italy's curfew was scrapped and the whole country, except for the northwest region of Valle d'Aosta, became \"white zone\" - the country's lowest-risk category.\nAmong the measures still in place are social distancing (1m) and the wearing of masks indoors (and in crowded outdoor places), and a ban on house parties and large gathering. \nNightclubs and discos are also closed. \nAll indoor businesses, with the exception of nightclubs, are open. \nThe government introduced a \"corona pass\" in April, the first to do so in Europe. \nThis shows - either on a phone or on paper - that you have been vaccinated, previously infected or that you have had a negative test within 72 hours. \nPeople need to show it for entry to cinemas, museums, hairdressers or indoor dining.\nThe Greek government is welcoming tourists from many countries, if they are fully vaccinated or can provide a negative coronavirus test.  \nFace coverings must be worn in all public places and there is a curfew from 01:30-05:00, but bars, restaurants, museums and archaeological sites are all open.\nCinemas, theatres, museums and restaurants are open at 50% capacity. From 26 June, this increases to 75%. \nNightclubs and discos will also be allowed to reopen, with a limit of 150 people.\nFace coverings must be worn in enclosed spaces and 1.5m social distancing observed.\nShops, bars, restaurants and museums are open, although face coverings remain compulsory in most public places. \nNightclubs can now reopen in parts of Spain with low infection rates. \nIn Barcelona, they are restricted to 50% of capacity and can stay open until 03:30 - dancers have to wear masks.\nSpain began welcoming vaccinated tourists from 7 June. Most European travellers still have to present a negative Covid test on arrival.\nShops, cinemas, gyms, cafes and restaurants are open, with restrictions. Households can invite up to four people inside.\nFrom 1 July, working from home will no longer be mandatory, if the situation continues to improve. \nCultural performances, shows and sports competitions can also go ahead, with limited numbers, and more people will be allowed at weddings and other ceremonies and parties. \nPortugal has lifted many of its restrictions but face coverings must still be worn in indoor public spaces and some outdoor settings.\nBars and nightclubs remain closed, and it's illegal to drink alcohol outdoors in public places, except for pavement caf\u00e9s and restaurants. \nAlcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 unless it is with a meal.\nRestaurants, cafes and cultural venues have to close at 01:00 and have capacity limits. \nA weekend travel ban is in force in the Lisbon area, starting at 15:00 on Friday, with residents only allowed to leave for essential journeys. \nIn Lisbon and in Albufeira (Algarve), cafes, restaurants and non-essential shops have to close by 15:30 at the weekend and 22:30 on weekdays. \nRestaurants, cafes, museums and historic buildings have reopened with capacity limits. \nFrom 26 June, a number of restrictions are being lifted. \nAlcohol can be sold after 22:00, and nightclubs can open, with an entry pass system. \nEvents held in public venues such as cinemas, conference centres and concert halls will be allowed, subject to social distancing. \nMasks will no longer be compulsory except on public transport, airports and in secondary schools.\nOutdoor services in restaurants and bars returned in June. Theme parks, funfairs, cinemas and theatres, gyms and swimming pools, have reopened as well.\nFrom 5 July, restaurants and bars will be able to serve customers indoors. Weddings and other indoor events for up to 50 people will be permitted and the numbers at outdoor organised events will increase. \nSince June, pubs have been able to stay open until 22:30 and more people are now allowed at sports events, outdoor concerts, cinemas and markets.\nOn 1 July, limits on private gatherings will be raised, and the recommendation to interact with a small circle of people removed.\nFurther easing is planned on 15 July and in September.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Department of Health & Social Care,Helen Whately,Care homes,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Care home residents in England will be allowed two regular visitors indoors from 12 April, the government has said.\nCurrently people in care homes can have just one face-to-face visitor, but as part of the next step of lockdown easing it will be extended to two.\nThey will be able to hold hands - but visitors must be tested and wear PPE.\nVisitors will also be able to bring babies and young children with them, meaning some residents could meet grandchildren for the first time.\nPeople living in care homes were first allowed one regular, nominated visitor again in early March - leading to many loved ones finally being reunited after lockdown. \nThe government has now said that from 12 April - which is the date for the planned next step of lifting lockdown - visitor numbers can be increased because of a drop in community infection rates and the vaccine rollout.\nBabies and toddlers will also be able to accompany visitors, and will not be counted as one of the two. \nHowever, the age of young children included has yet to be announced and the government said full guidance will be published later this week.\nMeanwhile, the essential care giver scheme - whereby relatives or specially trained assistants to residents with particularly complex needs have greater access to a home - will also continue, the government said.\nThe scheme was set up to help residents with advanced dementia, some autistic people and residents with a learning disability who needed a particular person to provide certain aspects of their care.\nMore than \u00a3340m of government funding has been earmarked to extend rapid testing to care homes and free PPE (personal protective equipment) until March 2022.\nActor Ruthie Henshall is an essential care giver for her mother Gloria, who has dementia and lives in a care home. \nThey were recently reunited as rules on visiting care homes were eased, and Ruthie says that \"the light is back on in her [mother's] eyes\". \nShe told BBC Breakfast she was shocked at how much her mother had \"gone downhill\" over the last year, but that the difference in her mental health in just two weeks was \"incredible\". \n\"She's saying words again, and she's not been saying anything,\" she said.\n\"It is beautiful to see the joy in her and it is absolutely imperative that people get to see their loved ones. We are running out of time with our loved ones.\"\nRuthie can now go into the care home and feed her mother lunch, read to her or sing her favourite songs - Someone to Watch Over Me or I Dreamed A Dream. \nShe stressed care giving does not always have to be about changing and dressing a loved one. \"It is performing a something for her that is good for her care and wellbeing,\" she said.\nRuthie welcomed the announcement on visits, saying it was \"vital that we get family in\". \n\"The entertainment, the people, the life. It all comes in, they can't go out,\" she said.\nThe government also said that in the coming weeks, some visitors will be able to take tests at home rather than having them done at the care home.\n\"Our aim is to make visiting to care homes as normal as possible by the summer,\" said the government's care minister, Helen Whately.\nShe said the government continued to \"follow the science\", but that \"things are looking up\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson added: \"I'm particularly pleased to allow residents to have more visitors, including grandchildren, given the isolation and concern felt by so many this past year.\"\nIn addition, outdoor visits - as well as those inside pods or behind screens - will be able to continue for people who are not nominated as a regular visitor. \nThe announcement on visits was welcomed by Mike Padgham, the chairman of industry body the Independent Care Group - but called for residents aged over-65 to be allowed to take trips outside homes.\nAccording to the latest government guidance - which is facing a legal challenge - trips to see family or friends \"should only be considered\" for under-65s while national Covid restrictions apply because they increase the risk of bringing Covid into a home.\nBut campaigners say the ban is unlawful.\nMr Padgham, who runs four homes in North Yorkshire, said: \"It is hard to object to a party of over-65s going out in a minibus, for example, to enjoy a change of scenery and some fresh air, provided they were careful.\n\"We would like to see the government give greater guidance on this going forward.\"\nIn Scotland, care home residents are allowed to choose two people to visit indoors once a week, while in Wales, indoor care home visits are allowed for one visitor.\nIn Northern Ireland, government guidance states that where possible, visiting should be facilitated where there are well ventilated designated rooms or visiting pods - but families are still being denied visits, the nation's older people's commissioner has claimed.\nIt comes as a further 52 people died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, according to UK government figures released on Friday - although the data does not include Wales. \nThe number of cases also increased by 3,402 - the lowest daily rise reported since mid-September, although again the figures do not include Wales.\nMore than 4.9 million people are now fully vaccinated with both doses, while in total 31.3 million first doses have been given.\nAs the Easter Bank Holiday began on Friday, Boris Johnson urged people to obey the rules and not mix indoors, even if they are vaccinated.\nIn other developments:\nHow will the increase in visitor numbers at care homes affect you?

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

Previously it has explored the deepest place in the ocean, the Mariana Trench, which lies almost 11km down, as well as the Titanic. \nIt took several dives to relocate the wreck of the USS Johnston, but then Victor Vescovo, along with engineer Shane Eigler on one dive and naval historian Parks Stephenson on another, were able to spend time surveying and filming the destroyer.\nMr Vescovo said that the hull number \u2013 557 \u2013 was clearly visible on both sides of its bow, and two full gun turrets were also intact.\n\u201cThe gun turrets are right where they're supposed to be, they're even pointing in the correct direction that we believe that they should have been, as they were continuing to fire until the ship went down,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cAnd we saw the twin torpedo racks in the middle of the ship that were completely empty because they shot all the torpedoes at the Japanese.\u201d\nThe team is now working with naval historians in the hope of shedding more light on the World War Two battle. \nThe relatively small USS Johnston was heavily outnumbered by the Japanese fleet, which included Japan\u2019s largest battleship, but was awarded for its courage under heavy fire.\nOf the crew of 327, only 141 survived the battle.\nNo human remains or clothing were found during the expedition, and the team laid wreaths before and after the dives.\nFollow Rebecca on Twitter."

      "text": "An Australian Olympic kayaker and his brother have been found guilty of attempting to smuggle A$200m ($152m; \u00a3109m) of cocaine into the country. \nNathan Baggaley and Dru Baggaley will be sentenced later this month. Both have pleaded not guilty. \nDru and another man were arrested in 2018 after a dramatic police chase at sea that also involved the navy and air force. \nNathan purchased the boat used in the incident. \nDru and the other man, Anthony Draper, made an 11-hour journey in June 2018 to meet up with a foreign ship that was carrying the drugs. \nHowever, they were spotted by surveillance planes and followed by a navy ship. Footage captured Dru throwing packages of cocaine overboard while Draper attempted to get away from the ship. \nThey were later caught by a Queensland police vessel off the coast and arrested by armed officers. \nDru claims that he thought he was collecting tobacco and not cocaine and said he was kidnapped by Draper and made to go on the voyage. He said Draper threatened his family if he didn't help him. \nHowever, Draper claimed he was recruited by Dru to drive the boat and alleged he was told they were picking up \"smoko\" which he assumed was marijuana. \nDraper pleaded guilty to importing cocaine earlier this year but his sentence was reduced for testifying against the Baggaley brothers. \nProsecutors say Nathan - a double silver-medallist at the Athens Olympics - was involved in the plan, purchasing the boat and fitting it with a satellite phone and a navigation system. \nBut he said in court that the boat was purchased with money given to him by Dru and said he was told it would be used to start a whale watching business, ABC News reports. \nHis fingerprints were also discovered on tape used to conceal the boat's registration number. \nIt isn't the first time the two brothers have been charged with drug offences. They have previously been convicted of involvement in a drug manufacturing group that made hallucinogenic tablets. They were also convicted in 2009 on other drug charges. \nAccording to ABC News, they could both face life in prison. "

      "text": "A student is campaigning for more bins at a spot blighted by mass gatherings and litter after lockdown eased, saying everyone should be \"allies tackling a problem\".\nIsidora Jovanovic, 24, has started a petition to Cardiff council after being disgusted by the litter left by crowds enjoying the sunshine in Cardiff Bay.\nYoung people were unfairly blamed, she said, and everyone needed to help.\nA city councillor said more bins had already been placed around Cardiff.\nThe steps of the Senedd were littered with empty cans, wine bottles and nitrous oxide canisters this week, leading to what Ms Jovanovic called a \"blame game\".\nThe masters student, who lives in Roath, said it was \"really upsetting and disappointing\" to see the mess people had left behind and even tried to clean some of it up herself.\n\"There was a lot of alcohol to be honest - glasses and bottles - and the wrapping from fish and chips,\" she said.\n\"It wasn't just the bay. Roath was quite filthy, Bute Park as well. You had dog walkers and runners picking up rubbish. I took a couple of bin bags out with me just in case and filled two of them and couldn't collect everything, it was just upsetting.\n\"It was a very hot day so I think there were more people, so more mess was going to be left. But I think once you've had a few drinks as well people just can't be bothered or just maybe don't think about it.\"\nHer petition calls on Cardiff council to put more bins around the city to \"encourage people\" to responsibly dispose of their litter, but she said it needed to be a joint effort.\n\"I think the onus is more on us to clean up our rubbish. Seeing a bin next to you might encourage people to do that. Human nature can be quite lazy sometimes.\"\nShe added that hearing young people being blamed for leaving litter was unfair, as \"a mixture of ages\" were doing the same thing.\n\"It's a difficult one because I would consider myself a young person. I don't think that the blame game is helpful or productive,\" she said.\n\"We are all allies tackling a problem and it's more about coming together with the council too, hopefully.\n\"If we are to approach it with curiosity as to why this is happening then we can work together to find a solution. When we get this feedback off the people causing the mess and we work with them, then there really is no excuse when the solution is implemented.\"\nIn Cardiff Bay on Friday, young people said they were horrified to see the litter and were keen to show they were not doing the same.\nNaomi Randall said: \"We did see the rubbish and it was pretty shocking. It's pretty disheartening to see how people are treating their local area. \"We've been walking - we've done 20km so far today - so we'll be keeping our rubbish, looking out for recycling bins, keeping it in our bags and then dumping it where we can.\"\nMolly, 24, said: \"It ruins it for other people as well doesn't it? This area is lovely for families to come out to as well.\n\"We brought the dog down and you wouldn't want that mess to come down to. I think it's just disrespectful. \n\"You should bring a bag down with you or there's bins around - you can go and find them. It's just unacceptable.\"\nMichael Michael, Cardiff council's cabinet member for clean streets, recycling and the environment, told BBC Radio Wales more than 1,100 large bins had already been added to tackle the litter problem.\n\"We've had teams over the last two, three days out picking up and cleaning after our visitors. We really want people to enjoy Cardiff's open spaces but what we don't want them to do is litter the place,\" he said.\n\"Carry stuff with you, take it home, use the bins.\"\nThe sun also shone a light on litter issues in other areas of Wales, such as Powys, this week.\nMichael Butterfield, from Llangattock Litter Pickers, said he had seen an increase in the amount of litter in the area since restrictions had started to ease.\n\"Since the lockdown, we have been seeing more PPE - facemasks predominantly - but the main litter we see out on the verges are drinks - so cans, bottles, single-use cups,\" he said. \nVale of Glamorgan council issued a warning for those gathering in parks and other open spaces to \"bin your litter or take it home\" after rubbish and damage from open fires was discovered in beauty spots including Porthkerry Park and Cosmeston Lakes Country Park."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Oliver Dowden,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Vaccine passports could be a \"tool in the short term\" to reopen theatres and sports stadiums, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has said. \nThe government needs to \"look at all options\" to \"make areas of our national life viable\", he said, but no decisions have yet been made. \nAnd he insisted the roadmap for lifting restrictions in England was on track.\nWales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said there were \"prizes to be won\" with vaccine passports. \nUnder the government's four-step plan to ease England's lockdown, all legal limits on social contact could be lifted by 21 June, if strict conditions are met.\nWhile most social gathering rules are due to be fully lifted outside on 17 May, social distancing rules and limits on capacity will remain indoors for at least a further five weeks for venues like cinemas, museums and theatres, and for sporting events. \nThe prime minister has suggested pub goers could be asked to provide a vaccine certificate as part of a wider review that could report in May. But he said vaccine passports would not be considered until everyone has been offered a jab, which is due to be by the end of July. \nSpeaking on The Andrew Marr Show, Mr Dowden said no decisions had yet been made about Covid certification.\nHe said it was important to examine this in order to reach \"a much greater easing in the middle of June\" as planned, but it is \"not the only factor\". \nMr Dowden said he completely understood \"concerns people have raised on civil liberties grounds\" and that was why the review currently being undertaken by the cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, was so important. \nHe said pilots would begin from the middle of April to look at things like ventilation, one-way systems and tests on how the virus spreads at indoor and outdoor events. \nThe success of the vaccine rollout and the better weather in the summer months would also be crucial factors, he added. \nWales' First Minister Mr Drakeford said he was prepared to consider coronavirus certificates on a \"four-nation basis\" but the system had to be \"fair and reliable\".\nHe told The Andrew Marr show that he had spoken with Michael Gove and the first ministers of Scotland and Northern Ireland on the matter this week.\n\"I think there are definitely prizes to be won through domestic vaccine certification, but there are very big practical and ethical challenges to face as well,\" he said. \n\"What about those who can't be vaccinated because their health conditions don't allow that to happen? If it's a self-certification system, then what reliance can we put on the fact the that somebody produces a certificate?\"\nSpeaking on the same programme, Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh,  said vaccine passports needed to be considered as part of a wider package of protective measures.\n\"It's certainly something we have to consider seriously\" in order to \"make our activities safe\", he added.\nVaccine passports could be used for reopening nightclubs and enabling mass gatherings, said Prof Woolhouse. \nHe added: \"Part of the whole point of living with this virus is we have to switch emphasis, we have to now start thinking about how do we make those activities safe.\n\"For those activities that it is difficult to make completely safe - I am thinking things like nightclubs, large concerts, mass gatherings - that's where passports come in. Whether it is vaccine passports, test-negative passports or even immunity passports.\" \nLabour has said while vaccine passports \"may be necessary\", it is more important to get a comprehensive quarantine programme in place for arrivals in to the UK.\nShadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the priority was closing \"the gaping hole in our defences at the border\".

      "text": "Bands including Idles and Lanterns on the Lake have said they will not work with a north-east England promotions company due to claims of sexual harassment made against it by staff.\nSSD Concerts called the claims made against them online \"malicious\", but said they were taking them \"seriously\".\nNorthumbria Police told the BBC that no reports had been submitted to them.\nHowever officers did arrest and caution a man for hacking into the company's social media account earlier this week.\nThe largely anonymous allegations, which also include the use of \"offensive\" language, staff being made to feel \"uncomfortable\" and \"underpaying\" workers, were shared via the business reviews section of the jobs website Glassdoor.\nSSD Concerts, which describes itself as \"one of the UK's largest independent live event promoters\" was the driving force behind last summer's Virgin Money Unity Arena - billed as the world's first socially distanced music festival. It saw the likes of The Libertines and local star Sam Fender perform in Gosforth Park in Newcastle.\nOn Thursday evening, Idles, who scored a number one with their recent album Ultra Mono and were previously listed for the Mercury Prize, posted: \"In light of the recent allegations against SSD Concerts, we would like to make it clear that they will no longer be promoting our show at Newcastle City Hall on 2 February 2022.\"\nThe Bristol band then directed fans to online resources where they can get help regarding sexual harassment and bullying in the workplace.\nFellow Mercury listees Lanterns on the Lake added they were similarly unwilling to perform in their home city as long as their gig was promoted by SSD Concerts. They noted how they had now opted to move their gig to the Boiler Shop - a Newcastle venue which has also since cut its ties with the firm.\n\"I suppose the most disappointing part of this is that there has been no real acknowledgement by SSD of the pain, stress and discomfort they have caused some of their own employees or any indication of what they plan to do to put things right,\" they wrote.\nIn a statement released online on Thursday, SSD Concerts boss Steve Davis said: \"We take what we have seen very seriously, but it seems 'trial by social media' means you are guilty until proven innocent.\"\n\"The safety of our staff, the agents, the artists and the audiences that attend our shows is paramount,\" he added.\n\"Bullying, harassment and equal opportunities policies are in place, a process that started long before the recent postings and allegations on social media.\n\"We are committed to continue to improve the working environment and to implement systems and procedures that protect our staff and enable them to develop.\"\nMr Davis noted how the company was pleased the police \"acted so swiftly\" to catch the man who had hacked into its account.\nA spokesman for Northumbria Police said: \"We can confirm we received a report that the social media account of SSD Concerts had been hacked earlier this week.\n\"Enquiries to identify the person responsible have been ongoing and on Wednesday a 25-year-old man was arrested.\n\"He has since been issued with a caution for the offence of performing a function that gains unauthorised access to a computer.\"\nAfter the reviews were made public, music development agency Generator claimed it had heard \"exceptionally worrying accounts\" from workers; while the PRS Foundation, which helps to fund new artists, declared: \"Misogyny and abuse is unacceptable\".\nThe BBC has asked SSD Concerts for a further comment about the allegations.\nMeanwhile, another BBC 6 Music favourite artist, Kelly Lee Owens, also confirmed on Friday she \"will no longer be promoted by them\" due to the \"increasingly worrying allegations\"\n\"My team are working on alternative options and ticket buyers will be notified,\" she added.\nOne of the region's rising stars, singer L Devine, echoed those sentiments saying she would not be performing at the company's Hit the North Festival, while praising the \"bravery\" of those who have spoken out online.\n\"Let's now continue to make the north east music scene one we can be proud of with no room for mistreatment or harassment,\" she said.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Covid in Scotland: How are the numbers looking?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "After three months of lockdown the tough restrictions are finally beginning to ease - but with the caveat that it's all dependent on continued progress in tackling Covid. So how are the numbers looking? \nThe Scottish government collates the most recent evidence in its weekly State of the Epidemic in Scotland publication. Here are some of the latest findings:\nThe lockdown delivered a steep and steady decline in case numbers throughout January and February - but the first weeks of March saw a small increase. \nA week ago, data from the ONS indicated that Scotland had the highest rate of infection of all four UK nations. \nThe most recent data suggests case numbers are now falling again, although at a slower rate than we saw earlier in the year. \nThe latest State of the Epidemic document, published on 1 April, said that last week an average of 505 cases were reported each day, a 7% decrease on the previous week. \nThere were 66 weekly cases per 100,000 of population - a similar rate to that observed at the end of September. \nScotland no longer has the highest proportion of people becoming infected,  having been overtaken by Northern Ireland, but the rate of infection is still higher than in either England or Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nCase rates have declined among all age groups but the falls have been most marked among the over-80s.\nThe latest estimate of the reproduction (R) number - a measure of the disease's ability to spread - is between 0.8 and 1, unchanged from last week. \nWhile overall case rates have come down, there are wide geographical variations with local outbreaks keeping infection rates stubbornly high in a number of council areas. \nClackmannanshire currently has the highest weekly case rate in Scotland reporting 165 cases per 100,000 population in the last week. \nWest Lothian, North Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire also had seven-day average rates above 100 cases per 100,000 population. \nSharp increases in infection have recently been observed in Angus, East Dunbartonshire, Moray and North Lanarkshire. \nAt the other end of the scale Shetland, Argyll and Bute, Na h-Eileanan Siar and Orkney each reported 10 or fewer cases per 100,000.\nUnder the Scottish government's plans for easing lockdown, it is hoped all mainland council areas will be able to move initially to level three from 26 April but rates of lower than 50 cases per 100,000 population will be one of the benchmarks for going down to level two. \nIt's important to stress that the case rate is only one of the factors that will determine such decisions on levels, with other considerations including, for instance, the capacity of the NHS locally to cope with the situation. \nThe number of people in hospital with confirmed Covid peaked on 22 January at 2,053 which was well above the first wave peak. \nThe most recent figure, which will not be updated until after the Easter break, is 215 people in hospital, 21 of them in intensive care. In addition there were another 18 people who have been in ICU for longer than 28 days. \nThe latest modelling predicts that both hospital bed and ICU occupancy will continue to fall, however it is possible that this will plateau or even rise again slightly depending on factors such as the impact of more pupils returning to school.\nBefore the start of the Easter break a slight increase in infections among children was observed, although this could have been down to the wider availability of asymptomatic testing.  \nIn the week to 28 March there were 61 deaths where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate - an 8% decrease on the previous week. \nBy comparison, during the first wave in April last year the equivalent figure was 663. \nIn mid-December more than a third of deaths were occurring in care homes but that has now fallen to about 8%.\nScotland, however, does have the highest daily rate of deaths in the UK - 0.1 per 100,000 population compared with 0.07 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nMore than 54% of the adult population have now received a first dose of a vaccine - that's more than 2.5 million people. \nThat figure includes 34,000 care home residents and 51,000 care home staff.\nWhile it has been hard to unpick whether the falling death rate is due to lockdown or vaccination, there is now evidence the vaccination programme is leading to decreasing hospitalisation and deaths. \nVigilance is required though as it is not clear yet how effective existing vaccinations will be for some new variants of Covid-19.\nThe more infectious variant, known as the UK variant, is currently the dominant strain in Scotland. \nHowever, there have also been 22 confirmed and five probable cases of the \"South Africa variant\" as well as three confirmed and one probable case of the \"Brazil variant\"."

      "tags": "Minneapolis,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "Witnesses to the arrest of George Floyd have given emotional testimony about being at the scene of Mr Floyd's arrest.\nMr Floyd's girlfriend, the teenager who filmed the viral video from the scene and a city fire-fighter who begged police to check Mr Floyd's pulse are among those who have testified they watched Mr Floyd under the knee of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin.\nThe former officer denies charges of murder and manslaughter, and his defence team heard from a police officer who responded to the scene of Mr Floyd's arrest, a use-of-force expert and a forensic pathologist. \nMr Chauvin has decided not to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right under the constitution to stay silent and avoid self-incrimination. \nHere's what we've heard so far.\n'I had lost a lot of faith in God when I met George'\nMr Floyd's girlfriend of the last three years, Courteney Ross, provided some of the most emotional testimony of the trial. She is, to date, the only witness to take the stand who personally knew Mr Floyd.\nShe described their first meeting in the lobby of a Salvation Army homeless shelter, where Mr Floyd worked as a security guard.\nMs Ross was waiting to see the father of her son, and she said Mr Floyd asked her to pray with him, a memorable and \"sweet\" gesture at a time when she \"had lost a lot of faith in God\".\nShe said it was \"one of my favourite stories to tell\". The couple shared their first kiss that night, she said.\nMs Ross also told the court they both suffered from chronic pain, which led to an off and on struggle with opioid addiction.\n\"We got addicted and tried really hard to break that addiction many times,\" she testified.\nShe did not specifically address whether Mr Floyd was using opioids on the day he died.\n'If I would have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided'\nThe teenage store clerk who says he believes that Mr Floyd unknowingly paid for cigarettes with a fake $20 bill told the court he was grappling with feelings of guilt over Mr Floyd's death. \nMr Martin, 19, said he had also been living in the building above Cup Foods, but moved after the incident and stopped working at the store.\n\"I didn't feel safe,\" the teen said.\nHe said Mr Floyd \"appeared to be high\" that day because he struggled to respond to a simple question, but that he was lucid enough to hold a conversation. He described Mr Floyd as \"friendly and approachable\".\nMr Martin, who witnessed the arrest, said he felt \"disbelief and guilt\" because \"if I'd have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided\".\n'I did call the police on the police'\nAmong those to testify was a security guard and former wrestler trained in mixed martial arts who was heard in the viral video of Mr Floyd's arrest calling the officers \"punks\" and \"murderers\".\nMr Williams, 33, had gone fishing with his son earlier that day, and had gone to Cup Foods to get a drink.\n\"I did call the police on the police. I believe I witnessed a murder. I felt the need to call the police on the police,\" he testified. \n\"That was bogus, what they just did,\" he told the 911 dispatcher, according to a recording of the call played in court.\nMr Williams alleged he witnessed Mr Chauvin use a \"blood choke\" to cut off the airway, and a \"shimmy\" hold to keep up the pressure on Mr Floyd.\nHe said he watched Mr Floyd's life \"fade away, like a fish in a bag\".\nUnder cross-examination, he took issue with the notion that he and the crowd were growing \"angrier and angrier\".\nHe said his words \"grew more and more pleading for life\", as Mr Floyd fell unconscious.\nWhen defence lawyer Eric Nelson repeated the question, Mr Williams again objected.\n\"I grew professional and professional,\" he said. \"I stayed in my body. You can't paint me out to be angry.\"\n'It's not part of our training and it's certainly not part of our ethics or values'\nThe Minneapolis police chief, who oversees around 800 officers in the city, was one of the most high profile witnesses for the prosecution.\nChief Arradondo, the city's first African-American police chief, fired Mr Chauvin one day after the arrest and previously condemned his actions as \"murder\".\nDuring the trial, he testified that Mr Chauvin violated police procedures.\nHe said that Mr Chauvin had shown some \"initial reasonableness\" when he used force on Mr Floyd as he resisting getting in the back of the police car.\nBut when Mr Floyd had stopped resisting and \"clearly when Mr Floyd was no longer responsive and even motionless, to continue to apply that level of force to a person prone out, hands cuffed behind their back - that in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy,\" Chief Arradondo said.\n\"It's not part of our training and it's certainly not part of our ethics or values.\" \n'My instincts were telling me something is wrong'\nThe first witness called to testify was a 911 dispatcher who had sent police to Cup Foods, where Mr Floyd had allegedly bought cigarettes with a counterfeit bill.\nMs Scurry watched the arrest unfold on a live CCTV feed on a camera across the street from the shop, and thought that the video had \"frozen\" due to how long the three officers remained on top of Mr Floyd.\n\"They were still on the ground. That whole situation was still the same,\" she said, noting that she was also being distracted by other work matters at the time.\n\"My instincts were telling me something is wrong, something is not right. I don't know what, but something was not right,\" she said. \"It was an extended period of time.\"\nShe called a supervisory sergeant to report what she saw. \"Call me a snitch if you want to,\" she said according to audio of the call, adding \"all of them sat on this man\".\n'We're lucky it was video-taped'\nThe off-duty Minneapolis city fire-fighter was hoping to have \"a peaceful day\" and went for a walk, she testified. \nShe noticed the lights of the police car, and wondered if her co-workers were responding to a fire.\n\"As I got closer there was a woman across the street screaming that they were killing him,\" said Ms Hansen, 27, who is also a trained emergency medical technician (EMT).\n\"I was concerned to see a handcuffed man who was not moving with officers with their whole body weight on his back and a crowd who was stressed out,\" she said.\nMs Hansen described pleading with the officers to check Mr Floyd's pulse and to begin CPR. One officer, she said, told her that \"if you really are a Minneapolis fire-fighter you would know better than to get involved\".\nThere were several heated moments during Ms Hansen's cross-examination by the defence.\nWhen Mr Chauvin's attorney asked her if the crowd had been \"upset or angry\", she replied: \"I don't know if you've seen anybody be killed, but it's upsetting.\" \nIn another testy response after she was challenged over her recollection of the incident, she said: \"We're lucky it was video taped.\"\n'What I watched was wrong'\nThe first bystander on the scene of George Floyd's arrest was 61-year-old Charles McMillian, a self-described \"nosy\" resident.\nHe pled repeatedly with Mr Floyd to \"get up and get in the car\" and told him \"you can't win\". He also said the officers looked like they were trying to \"hogtie\" him.\nWhile viewing graphic footage of the arrest in court, Mr McMillian broke down in tears and was unable to continue his testimony for a while. In the video, the court heard him tell Mr Chauvin: \"Your knee on his neck - that's wrong man.\"\nHe described feeling \"helpless\" seeing the incident unfold.\nMr McMillian said that he confronted officer Derek Chauvin after Mr Floyd was taken away in an ambulance because \"what I watched was wrong\".\n\"I think I said to him: 'Five days ago I told you at the end of the day go home to your family safe, and that the next person go home to their family safe, but today I gotta look at you as a maggot,'\" he said.\n'I stay up apologising and apologising to George Floyd'\n\"When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad. I look at my brothers, I look at my cousins, my uncles. Because they are all black,\" said the 18-year-old that filmed the viral video of the arrest. \n\"I look at that and I look at how that could have been one of them,\" said Darnella, the first of four witnesses who the judge permitted to speak off-camera because they were minors at the time of the incident.\n\"It's been nights I stay up apologising and apologising to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life,\" she continued.\n\"But it's not what I should have done. It's what he should have done,\" she said in a reference to Mr Chauvin.\n'I was sad and kinda mad'\nDarnella's nine-year-old cousin testified that Mr Chauvin did not take his knee off Mr Floyd's neck even after ambulance workers had told him to.\n\"I was sad and kind of mad, and it felt like it was stopping his breathing and it was hurting him,\" she replied when asked how the event made her feel.\n\"It sounded like he was hurting,\" she added.\n'I was failing to do anything'\nAnother teenager present that day said she felt powerless to help as she saw Mr Chauvin work to maintain pressure on Mr Floyd.\n\"I kind of saw him move his knee down more,\" said the 18-year-old, \"down onto Mr Floyd's neck.\"\n\"I felt like there wasn't really anything I could do,\" Alyssa continued. \"As a bystander I was powerless there, and I was failing to do anything.\"\nAsked why she shouted to Mr Chauvin to release Mr Floyd, she said: \"I knew time was running out or it had already... That he was going to die.\"\n'I was scared of Chauvin'\n\"He was like digging his knee into George Floyd's neck,\" testified the 17-year-old.\nShe added that Mr Chauvin \"did grab his Mace and started shaking it at us... I didn't know what was going to happen.\"\n\"I was scared of Chauvin,\" she added.\n'Derek Chauvin was justified and acting with objective reasonableness'\nThe use-of-force expert, called by the Chauvin defence team, said \"the imminent threat\" posed by Mr Floyd was a major factor in his detention.\n\"I felt that Derek Chauvin was justified and acting with objective reasonableness following Minneapolis police department policy and current standards of law enforcement in his interaction with George Floyd,\" he said.\n\"From a police officer's standpoint, you don't have to wait for it to happen. You just have to have a reasonable fear that somebody is going to strike you, stab you, shoot you.\"\nMr Brodd added: \"It's easy to sit in an office and judge an officer's conduct. It's more of a challenge to put yourself in the officer's shoes, to try to make an evaluation through what they are feeling, what they're sensing, the fear they have, and then make a determination.\"\nDefence lawyer Eric Nelson asked Mr Brodd: \"Was this a deadly use of force?\"\n\"No, it was not,\" Mr Brodd replied.\nCross-examining Mr Brodd, the prosecution maintained that the dangers of positional asphyxia - not being able to breathe in a certain position - were well known.\n\"Would you agree that that's something commonly understood in law enforcement?\" prosecutor Steve Schleicher asked.\n\"Yes,\" Mr Brodd replied, confirming it was not new information.\n'So many conflicting different potential mechanisms'\nThe forensic pathologist who was chief medical examiner for the state of Maryland until his retirement in 2019 said the cause of Mr Floyd's death was not clear.\nHe was questioned about the findings of the Hennepin County medical examiner, who ruled Mr Floyd's death a homicide.\n\"I would fall back to undetermined, in this particular case,\" Dr Fowler testified.\nHe said, in his opinion, the cause of death was not clear because there were \"so many conflicting different potential mechanisms\". These complicating factors, he said, could be considered homicide in some cases, and accidental in others.\nMr Floyd's consumption of fentanyl and methamphetamine, and his possible exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning from the police car's exhaust, were among the complicating factors cited by Dr Fowler.\nAsked about the cause of death, Dr Fowler said he believed Mr Floyd suffered \"a sudden cardiac arrest\" while struggling with the officers.\nDr Fowler said Mr Floyd's health problems contributed to an erratic beating of his heart, known as sudden cardiac arrhythmia.\n'Very aggressive crowd'\nThe Minneapolis Park Police officer responded to the scene of Mr Floyd's arrest and said the crowd of bystanders was \"very aggressive to the officers\". \n\"Did that cause you any concern?\" Defence lawyer Eric Nelson asked him.\n\"Concern for the officers' safety, yes,\" Mr Chang replied."

      "text": "The asteroid impact that killed off the dinosaurs gave birth to our planet's tropical rainforests, a study suggests.\nResearchers used fossil pollen and leaves from Colombia to investigate how the impact changed South American tropical forests.\nAfter the 12km-wide space rock struck Earth 66 million years ago, the type of vegetation that made up these forests changed drastically.\nThe team has outlined its findings in the prestigious journal Science.\nCo-author Dr M\u00f3nica Carvalho, from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institution in Panama, said: \"Our team examined over 50,000 fossil pollen records and more than 6,000 leaf fossils from before and after the impact.\"\nThey found that cone-bearing plants called conifers and ferns were common before the huge asteroid struck what is now the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.\nBut after the devastating impact, plant diversity declined by roughly 45% and extinctions were widespread, particularly among seed-bearing plants.\nWhile the forests recovered over the next six million years, angiosperms, or flowering plants, came to dominate them.\nThe structure of tropical forests also changed as a result of this transition. During the late Cretaceous Period, when the dinosaurs were still alive, the trees that made up the forests were widely-spaced. The top parts did not overlap, leaving open sunlit areas on the forest floor.\nBut post-impact, forests developed a thick canopy that allowed much less light to reach the ground.\nSo how did the impact transform the sparse, conifer-rich tropical forests of the dinosaur age into the rainforests of today, with their towering trees dotted with multi-coloured blossoms and orchids?\nBased on their analysis of the pollen and leaves, the researchers propose three different explanations. \nFirstly, dinosaurs could have kept the forest from growing too dense by feeding on and trampling plants growing in the lower levels of the forest.\nA second explanation is that falling ash from the impact enriched soils throughout the tropics, giving an advantage to faster-growing flowering plants. \nThe third explanation is that the preferential extinction of conifer species created an opportunity for flowering plants to take over.\nThese ideas, say the team, aren't mutually exclusive, and could all have contributed to the outcome we see today. \n\"The lesson learned here is that under rapid disturbances... tropical ecosystems do not just bounce back; they are replaced, and the process takes a really long time,\" said Dr Carvalho."

      "tags": "Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The health minister has appealed for people to stay safe over the Easter holiday.  \nWhile some regulations have been eased this week, the \"stay at home\" message remains.\nRobin Swann said he understood the frustration of facing another holiday with Covid-19 restrictions in place.  \nThe warning comes as BBC News NI learns that Belfast City Hospital is closing as Northern Ireland's Nightingale Hospital in the next couple of days.\nThe hospital was re-established last October and expanded in January to deal with the surging number of cases, but officials have said in recent weeks that the hospital would be wound down as case numbers have dropped.\nWith the beginning of the Easter holidays, Mr Swann said he wanted \"people not to let their frustrations affect their judgement\". \n\"These restrictions are in place to protect us from a vicious virus that has brought great tragedy to so many families.\n\"When we are following them, we are helping keep ourselves and others safe - and helping our community get to a better place.\"\nThere are concerns that the good weather will encourage people to go out more than they have been able to.\nThe minister advised people to continue to avoid crowded places, especially where social distancing is difficult or not possible.  \n\"Stay at home as much as possible and stay local when you are enjoying the great outdoors.  \n\"Make fresh air your friend this Easter weekend - outdoors is much safer than indoors. Please please don't mix indoors with people from other households.\"\nIn a joint statement, First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said people can \"look forward with hope\". \n\"I would ask people to take a moment this Easter Sunday to remember all those we have lost and those who are continuing to experience pain and hardship,\" said Arlene Foster.\n\"For those of faith this can be through a time of prayer, as discussed recently with church leaders.\"\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said that Easter will be \"a time of mixed emotions for many\".\n\"Thankfully this year, with the success of our vaccination programme and the gradual easing of restrictions, we can all look to the future together with hope and optimism,\" she added.\nPolice Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd echoed Mr Swann's appeal for people to be mindful of Covid regulations.\n\"We understand that people may be frustrated and are keen to return to normal but the fact remains that we are still in the midst of a pandemic and the choices we make have the potential to influence the road map out of the current lockdown,\" he said.\n\"The regulations also direct that no person may leave or remain away from home without reasonable excuse. \n\"Travel or stay at holiday accommodation does not constitute reasonable excuse and we are asking everyone to continue to postpone their visits to holiday accommodation until the regulations change.\"\nFrom 1 April, people in Northern Ireland have been able to meet in groups of up to six from no more than two households in private gardens.  \nUp to 10 people from no more than two households can meet for some outdoor sporting activities in a public place or sports club.  \nWith more than three-quarters of a million people having received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, the Department of Health has also published advice about how those who have been vaccinated should continue to follow public health advice.\nIt reiterates that the guidance on social distancing, hand-washing and face coverings still applies, and that the virus spreads easily in enclosed indoor spaces.

There have been only low-level incidents since then.\nLast month Russia conducted military exercises in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula it annexed from Ukraine in March 2014. \nThe rebels in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine also rely on Russian help. Western governments say Russia has deployed regular troops there, along with heavy weapons. That is denied by the Kremlin, which says Russian \"volunteers\" are helping the rebels, who seized a swathe of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April 2014.\nUnverified video on Twitter in recent days purports to show Russian tanks, artillery and armoured vehicles heading to the Ukrainian border.\nUkraine's army commander Gen Ruslan Khomchak says Russia has deployed 28 battalion tactical groups near Ukraine's eastern border and in Crimea, which would amount to 20,000-25,000 troops. Russian officials have not confirmed that, nor given any precise figures.\nAccording to Gen Khomchak, Russia also has nearly 3,000 officers and military instructors in the rebel units in eastern Ukraine.\n\"The Russian Federation moves its armed forces within its territory at its discretion,\" Kremlin spokesman Mr Peskov said. He added that \"it should not worry anyone and does not pose a threat to anyone\".\nThe Russian military has confirmed that an airborne assault brigade - about 4,000 troops - is being redeployed to Crimea from Volgograd in southern Russia this year. \nSince 2014 Russia has considerably beefed up its military presence in Crimea, including its key Sevastopol naval base."

      "text": "The Ulster Unionist Party has become the latest to call for the resignation of the Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) chief constable.\nUUP leader Steve Aiken said the force's leadership had \"failed\" and Simon Byrne no longer had his party's support.\nEarlier this week, it emerged that prosecutors would not charge anyone in relation to their attendance at the funeral of republican Bobby Storey. \nThe funeral attracted 2,000 mourners when Covid restrictions were in place.\nThe chief constable has already faced calls to step down from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) and Progressive Unionist Party (PUP).\nIn a statement on Thursday night, Mr Aiken said: \"It is with regret that it has come to this, but it is clear that without the support of much of the community he seeks to serve, it is time for the chief constable to resign.\"\nMr Storey, 64, was a senior republican figure and had been the head of intelligence for the IRA in the 1990s.\nOn Thursday, the assembly passed a motion censuring Sinn F\u00e9in ministers for their attendance at the funeral.\nThe actions of 24 Sinn F\u00e9in politicians - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - were examined by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS), but it decided not to proceed with charges.\nEarlier on Thursday, Mr Byrne expressed surprise at the conclusion of prosecutors during a meeting with the Policing Board.\nHe also said he recognised policing of the former IRA intelligence chief's funeral last June had caused outrage and damaged confidence in policing.\nThe decisions taken by the PSNI over Bobby Storey's funeral will also be reviewed by the UK policing watchdog, it has emerged.\nMr Byrne told the Policing Board that he welcomed the planned review by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), which independently assesses the conduct of police forces across the UK.\nOn Tuesday, Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Herron said the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 had become \"extremely difficult to navigate\" because of various amendments, and were in some respects \"inconsistent\".\nHe concluded that the \"lack of clarity and coherence within the regulations and the prior engagement between organisers and the police\" would \"pose an insurmountable difficulty\" if prosecutions were brought.\nOn Thursday, Mr Byrne - who faces calls to step down from First Minister Arlene Foster - said he and his officers were surprised professionally by those conclusions.\n\"The PPS draw their conclusions but this is what we're wrestling with now,\" he said.\n\"To what extent could we have foreseen that by speaking to the organiser and the event management company this would afford this excuse?\n\"This is at the heart of what HMIC will want to get to.\n\"If we had anticipated where we would have ended up we may have taken an entirely different approach.\" \nMr Byrne said there had been no negotiations between police and the funeral organisers, and the PPS found no evidence that deals were done in the run-up to the event.\nThe chief constable said he recognised that people were angry.\n\"We are trying to make sense [of] how legitimate engagement... has put us in this situation,\" he said.\nMr Byrne also said the force has received legal advice which states that it cannot cancel fines issued around Black Lives Matter protests last year. \nAssistant Chief Constable Alan Todd, who was the PSNI's so-called gold commander on the day of the funeral, said it was always his assessment that there was going to be more than the permitted numbers at the funeral.\nMr Byrne suggested that he had previously raised concerns about the Covid-19 regulations relating to funerals.\nBut Mrs Foster said her office had not received any letters from him in relation to such concerns.\n\"He appeared with me on four occasions at press conferences and did not take the opportunity to raise any issues in relation to regulations so he's wrong,\" she told BBC Newsline.\n\"He has been wrong in the way he handled the policing operation; he has been wrong in the fact that he received a plan for the funeral; and he did not challenge that plan and deal with the issues.\n\"There is no letter in the Executive Office from the chief constable,\" she added.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader said she welcomed the decision by the PPS to review its decision not to make prosecutions.\nMrs Foster also said she supported the HMIC investigation into the PSNI's handling of the funeral.\n\"For the rank and file officers, we will continue to support you in the very difficult job that you do but your leadership needs to change,\" she said. \n\"If republicans and nationalists were saying they had no confidence in the chief constable would he remain? I very much doubt it.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Ofgem,Energy industry,Renewable energy in the UK,Renewable energy",
      "text": "Energy suppliers offering environment-friendly tariffs are not always as green as they sound, experts say.\nMany \"100% renewable\" electricity tariffs use energy generated by fossil fuels, which is then \"offset\" for a small price.\nSustainable energy think tank Regen complains of \"loose language and loose marketing\" around green energy tariffs.\nBut industry body Energy UK says all renewable tariffs help to transform the grid for a low-carbon future.\nThe vast majority of energy suppliers now offer green tariffs and many promise 100% renewable electricity as standard.\nHowever, some energy companies accuse others of \"greenwashing\" - using marketing spin to make \"dirty\" electricity seem clean.\n\"The sale of green tariffs increased remarkably in the period since 2015. In fact, it doubled between 2017 and 2018,\" says Rob Gross, the director of the UK Energy Research Centre.\nFor many consumers, electricity which is environmentally friendly plays a role in which supplier they choose. \nThat was the case for Su in Gainsborough, who told the Jeremy Vine Show on BBC Radio 2: \"The tariff we're on at the moment has 100% renewable electricity, so they source all their energy from renewables. So wind, solar, hydro.\"\nWe explained to Su that the supplier she was with sources the majority of its electricity from the wholesale market, which includes energy generated by gas and coal. \nThen it purchases cheap renewable energy certificates called REGOs to effectively \"offset\" this. That allows her supplier to legally call the electricity \"100% renewable\".\nIn response, Su said: \"I'm not very impressed with that at all. To claim that all your energy is sourced renewably and then to do that is very misleading. \n\"That's not giving consumers an informed choice about where they're getting their electric from.\"\nJohnny Gowdy is a director at Regen, a not-for-profit organisation supporting the transition to a net-zero energy future. \nHe says: \"The good news is, there's a lot of demand for green energy products and that's why the industry is responding to that. \n\"So there's a success story here which has been muddied somewhat by loose language and loose marketing around green energy tariffs.\"\nREGO stands for Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin. When an renewable unit of electricity is generated - for example, by a wind turbine - the regulator Ofgem issues a REGO to prove that this energy is green.\nThe person who owns that wind turbine is now allowed to sell the electricity and the REGO separately. \nIt means there is a marketplace where leftover REGOs are traded, and there are enough of them \"going spare\" that energy suppliers are able to purchase enough to cover the proportion of fossil fuels they sell to customers.\nSome industry experts are supportive of REGOs and many agree that they have a role to play in expanding and supporting the renewable energy market.\nThe problem is how much they cost. They are cheap. \nAn energy supplier can make electricity from the wholesale market, which includes fossil fuels, look entirely green for just \u00a31 or \u00a32 per customer per year. The majority of UK energy suppliers are doing this to some extent.\nThe Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy says: \"We will be reviewing the REGO scheme this year. This will include ensuring people can make informed decisions over their energy supplier's green credentials.\"\nFor environmentally-conscious consumers, finding a truly \"green\" tariff is confusing. \nMany suppliers have contracts to buy electricity directly from renewable electricity generators and some invest directly in renewable energy infrastructure. These are arguably \"greener\", but tend to cost more.\nThe regulator, Ofgem, acknowledged this when it exempted three suppliers from the UK-wide energy price cap. \nEcotricity, Good Energy and Green Energy UK are allowed to charge more than their competitors because their electricity costs more to supply.\nEnergy UK, the trade body representing all suppliers, says that the bigger picture is very promising. \nIts chief executive, Emma Pinchbeck, says: \"All renewable tariffs, including those with REGOs, are supporting renewables in some way. Over a third of our power now comes from renewables.\n\"The reason we're having this debate is everyone's so enthused about a low-carbon world and that's so exciting for us in the industry.\""

      "tags": "France,Weddings,Women,Sex",
      "text": "A French reality TV series has been condemned by the government over its treatment of so-called \"handkerchief ceremonies\" in which young brides are supposed to prove their virginity.  \nThe Minister for Citizenship Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa has written to the country's broadcast watchdog the CSA, saying she was \"outraged\" by Incredible Gypsy Weddings uncritical handling of the rite, which sees the bride being examined by female relatives just before the marriage takes place. \nInspired by Channel 4's Big Fat Gypsy Weddings, the French series on the free-to-view TFX channel follows the courtship and marriage traditions of the Catalan gitan community living in the southern town of Perpignan.  \nIn an edition broadcast in February, viewers saw, amid the preparations for a lavish wedding, the bed on which the ceremony was due to take place. \nThe commentary then ran: \"On this bed a woman with special training tests the resistance of Naomi's hymen with a delicate tissue. The ceremony of the handkerchief is ancestral and inescapable. If Naomi has had sexual relations, the wedding will be cancelled.\"\nIn other scenes, women from the community explained why it was important. \"It is for the family of the boy,\" said one. \"So that they know he has a taken a beautiful woman who is a virgin.\" \n\"Since she was a baby she's been brought up to know that she has to have the ceremony, to get all her dresses, to get her wedding,\" said another. \nAsked if men should not have similar questions asked of them, another replied: \"That's not how it is done. We start from the principle that if a young man doesn't go out to party and see other girls before he gets married, then afterwards he'll miss it. It's an experience he has to have.\" \nMs Schiappa said in her letter she was incensed at the unquestioning tone of the programme. \n\"The whole institution of our Republican marriage was trampled underfoot, without any proper commentary,\" she said.\nShe said the sequences were \"all the more revolting\" because the National Assembly had only just voted for a law \"banning virginity tests and assuring the consent of both partners to a marriage\". \nA clause in France's Separatism Law - which is currently before the Senate - makes it illegal for doctors to issue virginity certificates. The article is aimed primarily at France's Muslim community, where some families insist on proof of virginity before marriage. The extent of the practice is disputed.  \nIn the text voted by the Assembly, doctors who issue certificates would risk a year in jail and a \u20ac15,000 fine (\u00a312,800; $17,600). Non-medical professionals who carry out virginity tests, even with the consent of the woman, would risk being charged with rape.    \nThe World Health Organization says the practice of inspecting the hymen visually or with fingers cannot prove whether a woman or girl has had vaginal intercourse or not. It is also a violation of their human rights, the organisation says.\nMs Schiappa has complained before of sexism on French television. Last year, as minister for sexual equality, she commissioned a report that criticised reality TV for perpetuating stereotypes. \n\"Reality TV programmes emphasise the hyper-femininity of women candidates and the ultra-masculinity of the men. From this dichotomy stems a vision of relations between men and women that is stereotyped and unequal,\" the report said. \nShe has also complained about popular French wedding TV shows such as Four Marriages for a Honeymoon, in which couples are judged against each other for the quality of their weddings, and Married at First Sight where a couple are married within hours of meeting each other and the cameras follow their marital progress.

      "title": "Bobby Storey funeral: Sinn F\u00e9in accused of 'arrogance and self entitlement'",
      "tags": "Sinn F\u00e9in,Michelle O'Neill,Conor Murphy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Sinn F\u00e9in has been accused of showing arrogance, self-entitlement and privilege over its actions in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey. \nMLAs passed a motion censuring party ministers after it was announced there would be no prosecutions.\nThe funeral in June attracted 2,000 mourners at a time when Covid restrictions were in place. \nThe actions of 24 Sinn F\u00e9in politicians were examined, including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill.\nThe BBC understands Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary is to examine the Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) role in the funeral. An announcement is expected later.\nMr Storey, 64, was a senior republican figure and had formerly been the head of intelligence for the IRA in the 1990s.\nThe attendance of many senior Sinn F\u00e9in politicians at his funeral in west Belfast, at a time when strict limits on gatherings were in place, caused a political furore.\nThe decision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) not to prosecute anyone in relation to the funeral led to First Minister Arlene Foster on Tuesday calling for the resignation of Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Simon Byrne.\nMrs Foster said he had lost the confidence of the unionist community, but he has rejected calls to step down.\nOn Wednesday, the PPS announced a review of its decision. \nIn the assembly on Thursday, the deputy first minister apologised \"for the hurt that has been caused to so many families who have lost a loved one\".\n\"I am truly sorry that my actions have contributed to the grief or heartache that has been felt and experienced by many people who have lost a loved one during this pandemic. That was never my attention,\" Ms O'Neill said. \n\"For that, I offer my heartfelt and unreserved apology to those families who have lost a loved one.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in Finance Minister Conor Murphy, who also attended the funeral, said he regrets the political division it caused. \n\"I want to say sorry to the wider community and more particularly to apologise fully and unreservedly to those families who were hurt by my actions.\"\nBut First Minister Arlene Foster said the wake and funeral procession were clear acts of \"premeditated breaches of the Covid regulations\".\n\"The message from Sinn F\u00e9in was clear: ourselves alone, ourselves first regardless of the cost of undermining the public health messaging,\" Mrs Foster said. \n\"The prioritisation of Roselawn (cemetery) over other grieving families was hurtful, ignorant and callous in the extreme, acts of arrogance, acts of self entitlement, acts of privilege. \n\"Sinn F\u00e9in calls for equality, respect and integrity, but actually demonstrates the opposite.\"\nMrs Foster said the police had \"abdicated\" their responsibility.\nThe motion, proposed by the SDLP, passed unanimously on an oral vote, but has no binding consequences. \nThe first speaker in the debate, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon of the SDLP, said Sinn F\u00e9in made the choice \"not to stand with the people but put themselves above them\".\n\"This is no longer about a funeral. It is now an issue of why Sinn F\u00e9in believes they are above the restrictions, above the law, above the public health advice,\" Ms Mallon said. \n\"We are here today, to hear Sinn F\u00e9in account for their actions, to answer the question countless citizens across the north are asking - why is it one rule for the political elite in Sinn F\u00e9in and one rule for the rest of us?\"\nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) MLA Doug Beattie said Sinn F\u00e9in had spoken for just four minutes in a two-hour debate. \n\"Not good enough. We needed to hear more, and we heard nothing. It was doubling down on the position you were in before we came here today. \n\"Policing and justice has been damaged. We cannot lay the blame on the rank and file police officer who gets a set of regulations that we write, interprets them, and then on the sharp end of justice, he has to deliver and he will make mistakes.\"\nJustice Minister Naomi Long appealed for Sinn Fein to \"step up\", make a fulsome apology and give \"some comfort at this late stage to the families affected\".\n\"There are many wrongs in this world that cannot be prosecuted in court, but we can still apologise for those wrongs,\" Ms Long said. \nThe assembly began sitting at 12:00 BST.\nThe motion, which recalled the assembly early from its Easter recess, called for assembly members (MLAs) to \"condemn\" Ms O'Neill and Mr Murphy, who attended the funeral, for \"their actions which have caused immense hurt and undermined the executive's public health message\". \nThe recall motion had the support of the DUP, Ulster Unionists (UUP), Alliance and the Green Party.\nOpening the debate, assembly Chair Alex Maskey, of Sinn F\u00e9in, said he was professional, competent and well within his abilities to preside over the debate, after a point of order raised by DUP MLA Jonathan Buckley. \nWe've had some heated and passionate exchanges in the chamber, not least from those MLAs who've lost loved ones and friends during the pandemic and were unable to attend their funerals. \nThey had pointed remarks for both Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Conor Murphy, both of whom attended Bobby Storey's funeral last year. \nEven before the debate started, Sinn F\u00e9in MLA and Speaker Alex Maskey was challenged for his impartiality, and that set the tone.\nMs O'Neill was challenged several times across the chamber floor to apologise for her attendance at the funeral. \nShe didn't do that, but she did say sorry for the hurt caused. \nThis is a non-binding debate which means there is a vote in the chamber, but there will be no effect on Sinn F\u00e9in because this simply registers other MLAs' anger at what happened. \nIn the absence of a court case, it's another chance for MLAs to deliver their verdicts.\nAhead of the debate, SDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole said the recall would provide a \"forum for accountability\".\nThe South Belfast MLA said the motion, which does not have any binding consequences, was not \"political game play\" but was about holding Sinn F\u00e9in ministers to account.\nHe said people who make the laws \"should be held to the same rules as the rest of society\".\nMeanwhile, Mr Byrne addressed a meeting of the Policing Board on Thursday afternoon, at which he expressed surprise at the conclusions of the PPS. \nOn Wednesday, Mrs Foster stopped short of saying whether DUP members of the board would step down, but did not rule it out.

      "tags": "Companies,Retailing,Boohoo",
      "text": "Online retailer Boohoo is investigating why the same items of clothing were sold for higher prices across a number of its fashion labels.\nThe BBC discovered that Dorothy Perkins and Coast, which are both owned by Boohoo, sold exactly the same coat but it cost \u00a334 more at Coast. \nThere are price disparities across a range of Boohoo brands, which also include Oasis and Warehouse.\nBoohoo said the \"miscommunication was not intentional\".\n\"All Boohoo group brands work independently, and so this miscommunication was not intentional as teams are not privy to what's being bought and sold across the other group brands,\" a spokeswoman for Boohoo said.\n\"Our internal investigation continues and we will be re-pricing all the crossover stock to be aligned.\"\nThe price disparity was revealed after reporter Jennifer Meierhans bought a coat from Coast - as a friend happened to buy the exact same coat from Dorothy Perkins. \nThe Dorothy Perkins branding appeared to have been cut from the care label in the coat sold by Coast.\nBoohoo said the coat was first sold by Coast and has now been re-priced at \u00a317 on both brands' websites.\nCatherine Erdly, founder of The Resilient Retail Club consultancy, and a former senior merchandiser at Coast, said: \"If all Boohoo are going to do is buy the same stuff and slap different prices on it then it's destroying that brand's identity.\"\nShe said that while each brand will have its own \"architecture\" for setting prices, it is likely Coast and Dorothy Perkins had benefited from some kind of trading \"opportunity\", where a supplier had stock and both companies needed coats.\n\"But if they're going to do things like that, they didn't do it in a clever way,\" Ms Erdly said. \"The customer will sense that it's just trying to get as much as possible out of them.\"\nShe added: \"There's no way a Coast garment could have sold at \u00a317 without losing money, a garment made for the Coast brand would cost more than that to make.\"\nThere are a number of instances where the same item of clothing is priced differently across Boohoo's brands.\nA long \"luxe\" padded coat in the colour mushroom was originally sold for \u00a389 at Oasis and \u00a365 at Dorothy Perkins.\nThe same coat in khaki was in the sale for \u00a330 in Warehouse and \u00a366.75 in Coast until the BBC brought the matter to Boohoo's attention. They are now both priced at \u00a318. \nNatalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at consumer watchdog Which?, said loyal customers of these brands will be \"shocked and disappointed to see these stark price differences between seemingly identical items of clothing\". \nShe said: \"People choose brands and stay loyal by expecting quality to match the prices they pay.\n\"Brands that offer a first-class customer experience and can be trusted are the ones that come out on top in our retailer surveys. This practice from Boohoo could risk undermining trust with customers.\"\nBoohoo operates a number of different brands after buying up businesses when their owners fell into administration.\nBoohoo bought Coast's online business in 2019 along with sister brand Karen Millen. While in February, it acquired Dorothy Perkins, together with Wallis and Burton, from failed retail group Arcadia for \u00a325.2m\nBoohoo said: \"Stock of the item in question was purchased and live on site by Coast prior to The Boohoo Group's acquisition of the Dorothy Perkins brand.\"\nHave you bought clothes from a Boohoo brand, only to see it priced cheaper under another Boohoo-owned business?

      "title": "Derek Chauvin trial: Homicide chief criticises force used on George Floyd",
      "tags": "Minneapolis,US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "The top homicide investigator in the US city of Minneapolis has said former police officer Derek Chauvin used \"totally unnecessary\" force when arresting George Floyd.\nRichard Zimmerman was testifying on the fifth day of Mr Chauvin's murder trial.\nWhite officer Mr Chauvin was filmed kneeling on African-American Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes last May, sparking global protests.\nThe 45-year-old has denied charges of murder and manslaughter. \nIn his testimony on Friday, Lieutenant Zimmerman said he arrived on the scene after Mr Floyd's death in order to help ensure evidence was secured and witnesses were found.\nHe said officers were responsible for the safety and wellbeing of anyone they arrested.\n\"Totally unnecessary,\" he said, when asked about Mr Chauvin's actions. \"If your knee is on a person's neck, that can kill them.\"\nHe added that he could see no reason for Mr Chauvin to keep his knee on Mr Floyd for more than nine minutes. \n\"First of all, pulling him down to the ground facedown and putting your knee on a neck for that amount of time is just uncalled for,\" he said. \n\"I saw no reason why the officers felt they were in danger, if that's what they felt... and that's what they would have to have felt to be able to use that kind of force.\"\nParamedics, bystanders and Mr Floyd's girlfriend are among those who have taken the stand since the trial began on Monday.\nAt its opening, prosecutor Jerry Blackwell said Mr Chauvin had \"betrayed his badge\" and claimed he used \"excessive and unreasonable force\".\nDefence lawyers have indicated they will argue that Mr Floyd died of an overdose and poor health, and the force used in his arrest was reasonable.\nFootage from both witnesses' mobile phones and the police officers' bodycams have been shown to the jury at length.\nIn one video, Mr Floyd could be heard pleading with officers, saying: \"I'm not a bad guy\".\nIn another, Mr Chauvin is heard telling a bystander: \"We had to control this guy because he's a sizeable guy. It looks like he's probably on something.\"\nThe court also examined security camera footage of Mr Floyd inside a grocery store, where he allegedly paid for a packet of cigarettes with a counterfeit note, leading to his arrest.\nShop employee Christopher Martin said Mr Floyd \"didn't seem to know it was a fake note\", adding that he watched the arrest with \"disbelief and guilt\".\nMr Floyd's girlfriend, Courteney Ross, gave emotional testimony, in which she described their first kiss and struggle with opioid addiction.\nTwo paramedics later said Mr Floyd had no pulse and did not appear to be breathing when they arrived at the scene.\nJurors have also heard from David Pleoger, the supervising police officer on duty that day, who said he only learned later in the evening that Mr Chauvin had restrained Mr Floyd by kneeling on his neck.\nHe told the court that an officer should stop using the knee as a restraint once \"you get control of the situation\" and the suspect is in handcuffs.\nDefence lawyer Eric Nelson sought to play down the significance of his testimony by saying Mr Pleoger had \"not reviewed the entirety of the evidence in this particular case\".\nThroughout the testimony, Mr Chauvin has been taking almost constant notes. \nFor many people here, the first week of the trial has been deeply traumatic - opening wounds from last May, when George Floyd died. \nIn the courtroom jurors heard wrenching accounts from eyewitnesses, people who were outside the store, Cup Foods, where Mr Floyd was arrested. \nThe jurors also listened to police testimony and statements from paramedics, and watched searing footage of the moments before Mr Floyd died, filmed on police body camera and shown for the first time in public. The images reminded people in town of what happened on that day, and how the city was ripped apart by his death. \nFor some, the evidence that was presented in the courtroom brought back a sense of despair and helplessness, as they themselves had watched the events outside of the store unfold. \nAll week, people scrolled through their phones in the downtown area, watching the trial. Others stood in stunned silence as the images appeared on TV screens in barbershops, convenience stores and other places in town. \nOn Monday, the trial continues.\nFootage of Mr Chauvin kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck was viewed around the world and sparked mass demonstrations against racism and police brutality.\nFormer US President Barack Obama said the protests represented a \"genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system\".\nPolice officers have rarely been convicted - if they are charged at all - for deaths that occur in custody, and the verdict in this trial is being widely seen as an indication of how the US legal system will treat such cases in future."

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "Pfizer says its vaccine is preventing 91% of coronavirus cases in the six months after people are immunised.\nAnd a separate study shows even people in their 80s and 90s are producing impressive levels of antibodies after receiving both doses of the vaccine. \nOnly 63% of them, however, also produce the T-cells that help maintain those antibodies in the longer term.\nAnd the crucial question of how long the protection from the vaccine lasts remains unanswered. \nPfizer analysed data from 46,000 people on the original clinical trial, exactly six months after their second dose.\nIt also looked at 800 trial participants in South Africa and concluded the vaccine was equally effective against the variant identified there - despite laboratory studies suggesting people's antibodies were less effective at attacking this variant. \n\"The high vaccine efficacy observed through up to six months following a second dose and against the variant prevalent in South Africa provides further confidence in our vaccine's overall effectiveness,\" chairman and chief executive officer Albert Bourla said.    \nSimilar, long-term studies are taking place for all the vaccines including Oxford-AstraZeneca, but Pfizer has been the first to report.\nSeparate research by the University of Birmingham looked at what happened to the immune systems of 100 80- to and 96-year-olds.\nBlood samples showed high levels of antibodies able to effectively neutralise the original coronavirus.\nAgainst the variant identified Brazil, however, they were 14 times less effective.\nAlthough, the researchers were confident those who had received the Pfizer vaccine would still be protected against the Brazil variant because their levels of antibodies were so high.\nHowever, only 63% of people in this age group produced a detectable T-cell response. \n\"It is not clear what that means for clinical protection in the longer term,\" one of the researchers, Dr Helen Parry, said.\nT-cells can kill the cells in the body that have been hijacked and turned into coronavirus factories. \nBut they also help maintain levels of antibodies over time. \n\"That's something we'll keep an eye on very closely,\" researcher Prof Paul Moss said.

      "text": "A Met Police officer has been convicted of being a member of a banned neo-Nazi terrorist organisation.\nBenjamin Hannam, of Enfield, north London, was found guilty of membership of the banned right-wing extremist group National Action (NA).\nHe was also convicted of lying on his Met Police application and having terror documents detailing knife combat and making explosive devices.\nHannam is the first British officer to be convicted of a terrorism offence.\nHe was released on conditional bail ahead of sentencing on 23 April.\nAt the Old Bailey, Judge Anthony Leonard QC lifted a ban on reporting the case after the 22-year-old admitted possessing an indecent image of a child, which was to have been the subject of a separate trial. \nThe PC had been working as a probationary officer for the Met for nearly two years before he was found on a leaked database of users of extreme right-wing forum Iron March.\nHe had signed up to the forum when he joined the London branch of neo-Nazi group NA in March 2016.\nFollowing his arrest in March last year, officers discovered a NA business card and badges, as well as writings about his involvement with the group.\nJurors were told that on the day the group was banned in December 2016, Hannam had transferred the knife-fighting manual from his computer to folder named \"NA\" on a memory stick along with other extremist texts.\nDetectives also found he was in possession of multiple prohibited images including \"pseudo images\" of young boys and girls.\nJurors convicted him of remaining in NA for several months after it was banned in December 2016, as well as two counts of fraud for lying about his far-right past in a Met application form.\nProsecutor Dan Pawson-Pounds said the fraud was \"intimately connected\" to Hannam's membership of the outlawed group.\nHannam had denied all the offences, telling the court he had never been a member of NA despite regularly attending group meetings.\nHe claimed that he was interested by the \"look and aesthetic of fascism\", but that he was not a racist and had actually challenged group members when they expressed such views.\nThe officer said he had been \"desperate to impress\" an older NA organiser and his association with the group ended before he began working for the Met.\nThe court heard that Hannam was part of a successor version of the extremist group called NS131 - which was itself outlawed in September 2017 - and that he appeared in its online videos spray-painting neo-Nazi logos.\nHe had joined the Met in 2018 and during his training was actually shown videos relating to NA.\nHe passed out early in 2019 but was identified on the neo-Nazi web forum by detectives.\nIt can now be reported that, soon after he joined the Met, Hannam was found to have committed gross misconduct after he was found using a young relative's travel card to use public transport for free.\nScotland Yard said it had reviewed Hannam's time in the Met and found no evidence his actions had been influenced by any extremist ideology.\nHe is currently suspended from duty.\nAfter the jury returned their verdict, the judge said Hannam had been \"convicted of serious offences\" and was being bailed as a \"courtesy\".\nJenny Hopkins, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said Hannam's \"lies have caught up with him and he's been exposed as an individual with deeply racist beliefs\".\n\"Benjamin Hannam would not have got a job as a probationary police constable if he'd told the truth about his membership of a banned, far-right group,\" she added.\nCdr Richard Smith, of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said \"the public expect police officers to carry out their duties with the very highest levels of honesty and integrity. \n\"Sadly, PC Hannam showed none of these qualities.\""

      "tags": "Minnesota,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "The US has been convulsed by nationwide protests over the death of an African-American man in police custody.\nGeorge Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nFootage of the arrest on 25 May shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the floor.\nMr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder.\nTranscripts of police bodycam footage show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained by the officers. \nThe key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes. Based on accounts from witnesses, video footage and official statements, here's what we know so far. \nIt began with a report of a fake $20 (\u00a316.20) bill.\nA report was made on the evening of 25 May, when Mr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes from Cup Foods, a grocery store.\nBelieving the $20 bill he used to be counterfeit, a store employee reported it to police. \nMr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas. He had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but, like millions of other Americans, was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic. \nMr Floyd was a regular at Cup Foods. He was a friendly face, a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble, the store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC. \nBut Mr Abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident. In reporting the suspicious bill, his teenage employee was just following protocol.\nIn a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but \"he [Floyd] doesn't want to do that\", according to a transcript released by authorities.\nThe employee said the man appeared \"drunk\" and \"not in control of himself\", the transcript says.  \nShortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner.\nAfter approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands. In an account of the incident, prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun.\nMr Lane, prosecutors said, \"put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car\". Then Mr Floyd \"actively resisted being handcuffed\".\nOnce handcuffed, though, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for \"passing counterfeit currency\". \nCourt transcripts from police body cameras show Mr Floyd appears co-operative at the beginning of the arrest, repeatedly apologising to the officers after they approach his parked car.\nMr Lane asks Mr Floyd to show his hands at least 10 times before ordering him to get out of the vehicle.\nIt was when officers tried to put Mr Floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued. \nAt about 20:14, Mr Floyd \"stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic\", according to the report. \nMr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in a further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car.\nDuring this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd away from the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said. \nHe lay there, face down, still in handcuffs.\nThat's when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd's last.\nMr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck.\nFor more than nine minutes, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, the prosecutors say. The duration was initially given as eight minutes and 46 seconds but Minnesota prosecutors have since revised the time.  \nThe transcripts of bodycam footage from officers Lane and J Alexander Kueng show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained. He was also pleading for his mother and begging \"please, please, please\".\nAt one point, Mr Floyd gasps: \"You're going to kill me, man.\"\nOfficer Chauvin replies: \"Then stop talking, stop yelling. It takes heck of a lot of oxygen to talk.\"\nMr Floyd says: \"Can't believe this, man. Mom, love you. Love you. Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead.\"\nA female bystander told the police: \"His nose is bleeding, come on now.\"\nAbout six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse.\nOfficer Kueng did just that, checking Mr Floyd's right wrist, but \"couldn't find one\". Yet the other officers did not move. \nAt 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd's neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance. \nHe was pronounced dead about an hour later.\nOn the night before his death, Mr Floyd had spoken to one of his closest friends, Christopher Harris. He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency.\nForgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd.\n\"The way he died was senseless,\" Harris said. \"He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn't designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can't get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.\""

      "text": "Within days of the second warmest March day on record, a swing in temperatures could see a cold Easter Bank Holiday weekend with gales and even snow.\nAccording to the Met Office, by Easter Monday temperatures will struggle to reach double digits and the colder weather will last throughout next week.\nAnd a \"white Easter Monday\" is likely, with snowfall in some higher areas in Scotland and northern England.\nForecaster Nicola Maxey said the UK was heading for \"an Arctic trough\".\nBut she said that, for this time of year, the recent warmer weather was more unusual than the upcoming cold temperatures.\nThis week's warm temperatures - including a high of 24.5C (76.1F) at Kew Gardens in London on Tuesday - will last longest in the south of England, said Ms Maxey.\nBut by early next week the whole of the UK will struggle to get above single figures.\nFor Easter Monday, the daily high forecast for London is 7C (44.6F) and 6C (42.8F) in Leeds and Manchester. Edinburgh's maximum is expected to be 5C (41F) while Cardiff's is 7C and Belfast 5C.\nOvernight temperatures are expected to fall to as low as 0C (32F) - and below freezing in some areas.\nThe shift in temperatures has already begun, with BBC Weather saying parts of the central England have seen temperatures fall by 15C in 24 hours.\nIn an average year, snow is actually more likely to fall at Easter than at Christmas. The coldest Easter Sunday morning on record was in 2013, with -12.5C at the village of Braemar in Aberdeenshire.\n\"It's not unusual to see these big swings in spring - it's a transition period between winter and summer,\" said Ms Maxey.\nShe said: \"There are some blustery winds around, particularly along the east coast, as we go through the weekend.\"\n\"It's a marked change from what we saw on Wednesday,\" she said - and on Sunday and into Monday an \"Arctic trough\" will arrive. \n\"It turns windy in the north from Sunday with gales possible in northern areas locally, and across northern isles, Scotland,\" Ms Maxey said.\n\"We're looking at possible gale force winds across the northern half and the west side of the UK.\" \nShe added: \"The cold will be with us for much of next week, and with any showers you could see the possibility of snow falling over high ground in northern areas - the Pennines, Cumbria, Scotland.\"\nThe RAC said it anticipated a \"sharp rise in breakdowns\" as a result of the colder weather returning, and urged people to check their vehicles ahead of travelling.\nTuesday was the hottest March day since 1968 as temperatures topped 24.5C, leading to many people gathering in parks and on beaches. Wednesday was also warm in some areas.\nThe warmer weather came just a few days after coronavirus rules were relaxed in England and Wales - and parks and beaches were busy.\nTwo parks in Nottingham were closed after large crowds failed to socially distance and left rubbish behind.\nPublic Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said: \"As restrictions lift and the weather improves, we cannot drop our guard. We're not out of the woods quite yet.\" \nHeath Secretary Matt Hancock also tweeted to say \"don't blow it\" - urging people to enjoy the warm weather safely."

      "tags": "King's Lynn",
      "text": "A hospital roof held up by props poses a \"direct risk to the life and safety of patients\", board papers said.\nDespite the 131 supports at Norfolk's Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH), the \"potential of catastrophic failure of the roof\" remains, the papers revealed.\nThe government said the hospital had been given \"over \u00a320m to directly address the most immediate issues\".\nIn a letter, leaked to the BBC, its deputy chief executive says \"more than short-term fixes are needed\".\nLaura Skaife-Knight wrote to tell governors that the hospital trust was doing \"all it can\" to secure funding for a new hospital in King's Lynn.\nThe letter details the measures that have been taken to support the ageing roof, and says that since January, a further 50 props have been put up in 16 different areas.\nIt said the latest problems caused by the roofing had closed the hospital's critical care unit, though Ms Skaife-Knight wrote that it would soon reopen following a two-week closure for repairs.\nThe hospital trust was recently awarded \u00a320.6m by the government to \"fund the short-term fixes and improvements needed as surveys identify failings with the roof planks and rapid deterioration of the hospital's estate\", said the letter.\nMs Skaife-Knight said that would \"improve safety in the years to come \"but would not \"replace the roof planks or extend the life of the hospital beyond 2030\".\nThe trust has bid for \u00a3165m over three years to help improve the safety of the hospital estate in the short-term. That included \u00a345m in year one, towards which the \u00a320.6m was awarded.\nHowever, Ms Skaife-Knight wrote that the trust had developed \"a strong case\" for a new hospital.\nShe said living with the risk at the current hospital would cost \u00a3554m over 10 years, while a new building would cost around \u00a3679m but come with additional benefits to meet \"modern healthcare requirements\".\nQueen Elizabeth Hospital was not selected as one of 40 hospitals included in a \u00a33.7bn building package announced by the government in October last year.\nMs Skaife-Knight told governors: \"We know that there will be funding to build a further eight new or part-new hospitals by 2030 and that these will be announced in autumn 2021.\n\"QEH is doing all it can to position the trust to be one of these further eight hospitals.\"\nA risk register within the board meeting agenda reads: \"There is a direct risk of life and safety to patients, visitors and staff of the trust due to the potential of catastrophic failure of the roof structure due to structural deficiencies.\"\nIt said this was because the pre-cast concrete construction of the building was 40 years old, despite only being built to last 25 years, and rated the risk as \"very high/extreme\".\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said it recognised \"the need to invest in improving health infrastructure across the country, including where trusts have identified significant issues\", and cited the money awarded to the QEH already.\nA spokesman said criteria for the further eight schemes to be included in the New Hospitals Programme would be announced shortly.\nA spokeswoman for the hospital said: \"We have a team permanently on site to systematically check and manage our buildings and to act on any work that might be needed, and we are treating patients safely, as normal.\"\nShe added that \"a major incident\" has not been declared and it has received \"investment to support us with the maintenance of our estate, and we have an ongoing programme of estates work underway including monitoring and safety checking of the roof\". \nA meeting of the hospital's board of directors will be held on 7 April. \nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Schools,Scotland Education,Exams,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Pupils and teachers have told BBC Scotland that assessments some senior pupils will be sitting in the coming weeks are \"exams by another name\". \nThis year's National 5s, Highers and Advanced Highers were cancelled because of disruption caused by the pandemic. \nGrades are to be given on \"teacher judgement\" but that needs to be backed up by evidence gathered in tests. \nSome schools are setting these tests in conditions which are very similar to exams but with much less preparation.\nThe approach across schools varies with some spreading the tests over several class lesson times but others doing them all in one go, with invigilators on hand to make sure strict exam conditions are met. \nThe system is being described as unfair by pupils and parents.\nSixteen-year-old Deni, who is doing her Highers, has started a petition asking for these final assessments to be scrapped. \nThe petition says that after being in school for just four months and then having to learn remotely since the New Year she is now being told there will be a \"final assessment\" after the Easter holidays on which her grade will be primarily based. \n\"Why not just call it an exam?\" she says.\nThis is the second year without senior students sitting final exams.\nLast year, the decision to scrap them was made in a rush and with no warning.\nThis year it was made with more foresight in a bid to tackle \"unfairness\" caused by repeated periods of Covid-related isolation for some students and not others. \nHowever, the perception of unfairness might be one which is hard to shake.\nTeachers have been given guidance on how to come up with pupils' estimated grades, but they have also been given some flexibility. \nIt means that the experiences of young people in schools across the country could be totally different, the very situation everyone was hoping to avoid.  \nThe authorities will say that \"quality assurance checks\" will make up for this.\nDeni, from Dundee, says students now need to try to revise a whole year's work for courses that most have not yet finished and which, for much of it, they have had to teach themselves. \nA Dundee City Council spokesman said Deni's school had not indicated to pupils that their grades would \"only\" be based around one assessment. \nHe said: \"We are working closely with young people and families during this hugely challenging time and will be re-assuring them directly over how assessments will be made.\"\nDylan is taking his Highers but when final end of year exams were cancelled he was told grades would be based on an overall teacher judgement of coursework and class tests.\nNow Dylan, who is at school in Bathgate, says he has been told his grades will mainly be based on assessments he will sit in the coming weeks.\n\"I'm really worried because normally we have at least nine months in advance knowing when our exams are going to be and I only got told this morning that I have got one in three weeks,\" Dylan says.\n\"It does not feel great. It's quite worrying, especially since we have to be in class the rest of the time as well.\"\nWhen this year's exams were cancelled, guidance was given to schools advising them the most robust way to gather evidence for grades was through class tests based on questions provided by the Scottish Qualifications Authority.\nIt has led to schools doing this in different ways - with some planning to do these tests spread over different class times while others are setting them up much closer to an exam style - but without study leave.\nBBC Scotland has also spoken to teachers who think the system is unfair.\nBrian Donlin, who teaches geography, says the way schools are carrying out these assessments is wildly different.\n\"How can we turn around and say that that we are ensuring consistency across a national level?,\" he says. \"We can't fundamentally, you just can't. \n\"Let's not kid ourselves on, there are some kids across Scotland who are sitting exams this year.\"\nSeamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA), told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that there was a lot of confusion because exams were cancelled prior to Christmas and everyone assumed it would be coursework and continuous assessment.\nMr Searson said schools were now trying to gather evidence for awarding grades and were falling back on the question papers provided by the SQA (Scottish Qualifications Authority).\nHe said: \"Our view is if youngsters do any assessments, they should be broken up, and used between now and the end of term. \n\"At the moment, the government guidance is that when pupils go back to school after Easter, it should be for teaching and learning. Assessments should come towards the end of the session. \n\"That is the mistake schools are making.\"\nMr Searson said schools are probably concerned there may be another lockdown and are trying to put these assessments in early so they have some evidence just in case.\nHe said: \"There are a lot of children who won't have been engaging during lockdown who will be totally disadvantaged by the systems these schools are trying to bring in.\n\"The system put in place at the moment looks straightforward but it's actually micro-managing teachers' decisions. This is where the panic is starting to come in. Teachers are now looking for pieces of evidence to prove to the SQA their grades are correct.\"\nThe Scottish Qualifications Authority said it had \"made it clear that there is no requirement to replicate a full formal exam or prelim diet\".\nIt said it had provided detailed guidance to schools and there was flexibility on how assessment evidence was gathered.\n\"Schools and colleges know their learners best, so it is appropriate that they deliver assessments which suit their circumstances this year,\" the SQA said. \n\"Evidence requirements have been significantly reduced - it is about quality, not quantity.\""

      "text": "Staff at the DVLA headquarters in Swansea are to go on strike for four days next week due to concerns over Covid cases among workers. \nThe office has seen more than 500 cases since September and workers voted to take industrial action last month. \nThe Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union said its members would strike for four days from 6 April.\nThe DVLA said it was \"disappointing\" the strike was going ahead and motorists would be affected. \nPCS said it had been in \"intensive talks\" with the DVLA to try and address its members' health and safety concerns and avoid strike action, but would now be \"asking over 3,300 of our members in Swansea to go on strike to protect workers' safety\".\nThe union said, despite \"welcome progress\" being made, operational staff would strike next week due to the \"lack of immediate moves from the employer to reduce the numbers on site\". \nIt added: \"We are convinced that the DVLA is able to give more than it is willing to at this stage and we believe that a strong show of strike action next week will help tip the balance to getting management to reduce numbers in the medium term and make the site safe.\"\nMore than 6,000 people work at the centre in the Clase area of Swansea and PCS said in March that 2,000 had been working on site every day, despite the number of cases. \nA coronavirus outbreak was declared at the headquarters in December. \nThe DVLA said: \"There is currently not a single member of staff in the 10-day isolation period, out of a workforce of more than 6,000.\n\"DVLA has ensured that it has followed Welsh government guidance at every single point throughout the pandemic, having consistently worked with Public Health Wales, Environmental Health and Swansea Bay health board to introduce a wide range of safety measures. \n\"It is disappointing that the PCS is pushing ahead with industrial action which will affect motorists just as restrictions are easing and the UK vaccination roll out programme is in full swing.\""

      "text": "A lack of \"adequate\" funding for schools in England during the pandemic is placing staff and pupils at risk, a teachers' union warns. \nThe Nasuwt union says it has reports of redundancies of staff who are vital to Covid safety measures in schools. \nOnline delegates at the union's annual conference will also hear about the high pay of academy \"fat cats\".\nThe Department for Education has offered support to schools for increased staffing and safety costs.\nThe Nasuwt teachers' union is warning of funding shortfalls and job losses in schools, particularly among support staff, who might help with Covid control measures outside of lesson times.\n\"It is not an exaggeration to say that the government's failure to fund schools adequately during the coronavirus pandemic is placing at risk staff, pupils and local communities,\" says a report from the union, called \"Where has all the money gone?\".\nIn the first lockdown in March 2020, the Department for Education announced funding for additional coronavirus costs in schools such as free school meals and cleaning.\nBut the teachers' union says the terms for funding were \"unnecessarily restricted\" - for instance, schools could claim for extra cleaning costs if there was a Covid outbreak, but could not claim for cleaning to prevent an outbreak. \nThere were also high costs in some schools for covering teachers kept at home because of the pandemic - but there was limited eligibility for reclaiming staffing costs, says the union.\nThe funding report also warns of excessive pay for some leaders of academy trusts.\nResearch by the union found the combined salaries of chief executives in the 20 largest academy trusts in 2018-19 cost \u00a34.72m, or an average of \u00a3236,000 for each chief executive. \nNasuwt president Phil Kemp will tell the conference: \"The snouts have to come out of the trough\" and public money has to be protected from the worst excesses of a deregulated education system, which he likens to the \"Wild West\".\nHe will call for a national pay scale \"as soon as possible and measures put in place to ensure all employers in education adhere to it\".\nThe annual conference will hear debates about how the poor mental health of some teachers has been exacerbated by unmanageable workloads during the pandemic and challenging pupil behaviour.\nOn academy boss pay, the Department for Education (DfE) says: \"We consistently challenge trusts where we deem executive pay to be too high, and will continue to do so when it is neither proportionate nor directly linked to improving pupil outcomes.\"\nLast November, the DfE announced a fund to help schools which were hardest-hit by funding pressures from the pandemic - particularly to cover high levels of staff absence.\nThere has also been the promise of \u00a31.7bn in catch-up funding for schools to help children recover from the disruption of the pandemic."

      "text": "People who have been shielding could become \"prisoners in their homes\" due to a loss of confidence after months indoors, an expert has said.\nDr Deborah Morgan, a leading specialist on loneliness, said a \"national strategy\" was needed to help people reintegrate into their communities. \nThe Welsh government said on Wednesday that 138,500 people shielding in Wales would no longer need to.\nHowever, they have been advised to limit their contact and work from home.\nAmy-Claire Davies, 26, has been shielding with her parents in Swansea since the start of the pandemic.\nMedically, she is extremely vulnerable. She is living with a life-limiting condition which means she suffers multiple agonising spasms.\nShe feels anxious about going outside, a fear she said was shared by other young people like her living with life-limiting conditions.\nShe said: \"I think I'd struggle going anywhere that was particularly crowded, I would get quite anxious about that, because it's been ingrained as a survival instinct over the past year and I haven't been in a crowded space for the past year. It would be quite overwhelming.\n\"A lot of the young people I know are at a real risk of struggling to go back out into the world in the way that we were before.\"\nThat concern is shared by experts who think some people might never leave their homes again unless they get help.\nDr Morgan, from the Centre for Innovative Ageing at Swansea University, said without the right support they might find a return to the outside world too daunting.\nShe said: \"When we talk to younger people, as well as older people, about this experience that's just the way they're feeling, they're just too fearful to go back out again.\n\"These are people who have been very active in social groups and have been part of their communities but they're now really fearful of going back out there.\n\"We have an economic strategy about how we're going to recover from this, and I really think we need a strategy for the social aspect of this, not just the economic.\"\nWork is already ongoing to introduce some of the most vulnerable groups to life in a world with face masks, social distancing and contactless payment. \nThe Get There Together project is a Wales-wide NHS project designed to show people with dementia what the world looks like now.\nA series of films and written resources have been produced in English and Welsh showing how shops, libraries and public transport has adapted since the start of the pandemic.\nDr Natalie Elliott is the allied health professional lead for dementia at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and is leading the project.\n\"The feedback we were getting from people with dementia is that they were very fearful of going back out into the community,\" she said.\n\"One of the ideas we had was would it be useful to create resources, video clips walking people through visits to places in their communities showing what it is like and what safety measures are there to support people and this allows people to rehearse at home, perhaps with the support of a family member or carer to go through and prepare to feel ready to go out.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"Throughout the pandemic, local authorities have worked tirelessly alongside the voluntary and third sector to co-ordinate support to a wide range of vulnerable groups. They will continue to play an important role in supporting the most vulnerable in our communities.\n\"During the pandemic we have introduced a number of new initiatives to support vulnerable people, including a national telephone befriending service for older people and the Looking Out For Each Other Safely campaign, which provides advice about how to stay in contact to prevent feelings of loneliness or isolation.\""

      "tags": "Minneapolis,US race relations,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "Two paramedics have told a Minneapolis court that George Floyd had no pulse and did not appear to be breathing when they arrived at the scene.\nFormer police officer Derek Chauvin is accused of killing Mr Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes during an arrest in May 2020.\nParamedic Seth Bravindar said he had to ask Mr Chauvin to get off Mr Floyd so that they could access the patient.\nEarlier, the court heard emotional testimony from Mr Floyd's girlfriend.\nCourteney Ross described their first kiss, and their struggle with opioid addiction on the fourth day of Mr Chauvin's trial.\nMr Chauvin, 45, who was fired from the Minneapolis police force, denies charges of murder and manslaughter.\nMr Bravinder said the initial call-out was deemed non-life threatening although that soon changed.\nHe told the court he initially thought that a struggle was taking place when he and his partner arrived on the scene, but quickly realised that Mr Floyd, 46, was limp.\nAsked about video footage showing him gesturing to Mr Chauvin, Mr Bravinder said he wanted to \"have him move\" and this was \"so we could move the patient\".\nHis partner Derek Smith checked Mr Floyd's neck for a pulse but could not find one. \"In lay terms, I thought he was dead,\" Mr Smith said. \n\"When I arrived on scene there was no medical services being provided to the patient,\" he added.\nMr Bravinder cradled Mr Floyd's head to prevent it from hitting the road as they transferred him to a stretcher.\nThey put him in an ambulance and started chest compressions.  \nAt one point Mr Smith thought he saw electrical activity from Mr Floyd's heart and delivered an electrical shock to try to restart it. \"He was a human being and I was trying to give him a second chance at life,\" he said.\nMr Bravinder said he had to stop the ambulance en route to the hospital to help his colleague after the heart monitor showed Mr Floyd had flatlined - his heart had stopped. All further efforts to resuscitate Mr Floyd failed.\nCourteney Ross is the first person to testify who personally knew Mr Floyd.\nShe told the court that she met him in 2017 in the lobby of a Salvation Army homeless shelter, where he worked as a security guard and she was waiting to see the father of her son. She said Mr Floyd asked if she would pray with him.\n\"It was so sweet and at the time I had lost a lot of faith in God,\" she said, adding that they kissed that night.\nShe said their first meeting was \"one of my favourite stories to tell\".\nMs Ross said they both suffered from chronic pain, and were addicted to opioids. \n\"Addiction, in my opinion, is a lifelong struggle,\" she said. \"It's not something that comes and goes, it's something I'll deal with forever.\"\nShe did not specifically address whether Mr Floyd was using opioids on the day he died.\nA statement from Floyd family lawyers Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci denounced \"defence attempts to construct the narrative that George Floyd's cause of death was the Fentanyl in his system\".\n\"We want to remind the world who witnessed his death on video that George was walking, talking, laughing, and breathing just fine before Derek Chauvin held his knee to George's neck, blocking his ability to breathe and extinguishing his life,\" it said.\nJurors also heard from David Pleoger, the supervising police officer on duty that day, who said he only learned later in the evening that Mr Chauvin had restrained Mr Floyd by kneeling on his neck. \nHe told the court that an officer should stop using the knee as a restraint once \"you get control of the situation\" and the suspect is in handcuffs. \n\"Leave someone on their stomach for too long, their breathing will be compromised, so you'll want to get them up out of that position,\" he said.\nDefence lawyer Eric Nelson sought to play down the significance of his testimony by saying Mr Pleoger had \"not reviewed the entirety of the evidence in this particular case\".\nThe trial began on Monday with the Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell saying Mr Chauvin had \"betrayed his badge\" and used \"excessive and unreasonable force\".\nDefence lawyers have indicated they will argue that Mr Floyd died of an overdose and poor health, and the force used was reasonable.\nFootage from both witnesses' mobile phones and the police officers' bodycams have been shown at length. At one point, Mr Floyd can be heard pleading with officers: \"I'm not a bad guy\", while the police officer is heard telling a bystander: \"We had to control this guy because he's a sizeable guy. It looks like he's probably on something.\nSeveral witnesses have also taken the stand, including four children who were under the age of 18 at the time of the arrest, and spoke of their trauma at what they saw.\nShop employee Christopher Martin - who inadvertently set off the tragic events after alerting his manager to a fake $20 bill Mr Floyd had used to buy some cigarettes - has spoken of his \"disbelief and guilt\". \"If I'd have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided,\" he told the court.\nThroughout the testimony, Mr Chauvin has been taking almost constant notes. Three other officers  charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder will go on trial later in the year.\nThe video footage of a white police officer kneeling for a prolonged period on the neck of an African-American caused outrage and led to global protests and a racial reckoning in the US.\nMr Floyd's death had followed on the heels of several other high-profile cases of African-Americans dying at the hands of police officers.\nFormer President Barack Obama said the protests represented a \"genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system\".\nAfrican-Americans are disproportionately more likely to be fatally shot by police and arrested for drug abuse and five times more likely than white Americans to be imprisoned.\nPolice officers have rarely been convicted - if they are charged at all - for deaths that occur in custody, and the verdict in this trial is being widely seen as an indication of how the US legal system will treat such cases in future."

      "text": "At least 50 people have been killed and dozens more injured after a train carrying nearly 500 crashed and then derailed in a tunnel in Taiwan.\nThe eight-carriage train reportedly hit a construction vehicle that had slipped onto the tracks at the tunnel's mouth.\nRescuers combed badly damaged carriages inside the tunnel to find survivors, some of whom smashed windows to flee.\nThe train, from the capital Taipei to Taitung, was carrying people travelling for a long-weekend annual holiday.\nMany people may have been standing because the train was so full.\nThe 408 train is one of the fastest deployed on a network that is generally considered safe. It can reach speeds of 130km/h (80mph).\nFriday's crash is Taiwan's worst rail disaster in decades. President Tsai Ing-wen has sent her condolences to the families of the victims and ordered an investigation.\nThe latest reports from the National Fire Agency say 494 people were on the train, with 50 dead and 66 injured and taken to hospital. \nThe crash took place at about 09:00 local time (01:00 GMT).\nSome people at the back of the train were able to walk away unscathed, while 100 were rescued from the first four carriages. Many of the dead, injured and trapped were in four crumpled carriages inside the tunnel.\n\"It felt like there was a sudden violent jolt and I found myself falling to the floor,\" one female survivor told Taiwan's UDN.  \"We broke the window to climb to the roof of the train to get out.\"\nAnother rescued woman said: \"My whole body fell to the floor. I hit my head and it started bleeding.\"\nA 50-year-old survivor told Apple Daily she saw many people trapped under their seats and when she walked out of her carriage she saw bodies everywhere.\nLocal media reports say the train driver is among the dead.\nImages show a large, yellow flatbed truck lying at the side of the tracks. A construction project has been under way near the north end of the tunnel.\nIt is not known how the vehicle slipped down the embankment.\nOther pictures showed people walking along the tracks with their belongings as they were evacuated from less badly affected carriages. \nOther survivors were being carried away on stretchers with their necks in braces.\nTaiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang visited the crash site on Friday afternoon.\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter: \"I offer my sincere condolences to all those affected by this morning's rail accident in Taiwan.\"\nAnalysis by BBC's Cindy Sui in Taiwan\nTaiwan has an impressive transportation network, including more than 1,000km of railway tracks. The trains transport more than 200 million passengers each year.\nAccidents are rare, but this latest derailment  - if it was indeed caused by a construction vehicle parked on a nearby slope sliding onto the tracks - would add to a number of recent incidents that have been blamed on negligence and/or human error.\nThey include:\nThis latest accident once again raises questions about whether Taiwan is placing enough importance on safety and preventing accidents.\nMany of those on the train are believed to have been travelling to celebrate the Tomb Sweeping festival - a time when people pay their respects to the dead by visiting the graves of family members, sprucing them up and making offerings to their spirits.\nThe island's worst crash in recent history was in 1991, when 30 passengers were killed and 112 injured after two trains collided.\nYou may wish to read:\nAre you in the area?

      "text": "Demanding a Covid passport as proof of a jab or test to access jobs or services is \"dangerous, discriminatory and counterproductive\", opponents say.\nBaroness Chakrabarti warned the passports risked creating a \"checkpoint Britain\" as more than 70 MPs railed against their use in England.\nLabour's Jeremy Corbyn and senior Tory Iain Duncan Smith are among a broad coalition who pledged their opposition.\nThe government said no final decision had been made on Covid passports.\nBut a series of Covid passport trials are being planned to test their use in different venues, the Daily Telegraph reported.\nA review is taking place into whether passports could help to reopen the economy in England, with discussions also taking place across the devolved nations.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said people could be asked to provide a vaccine certificate for entry into pubs in England, saying it \"may be up to individual publicans\". \nCertification could involve people being either vaccinated, having had a recent negative test or having previously been infected, the PM said. \nBaroness Chakrabarti told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's one thing to have a passport to travel internationally, that is a privilege, even a luxury, but participation in local community life is a fundamental right.\"\nShe added: \"To introduce two queues at the cinema, two queues at the football stadium going forward, is to introduce checkpoint Britain that so many of us just do not want.\"\nThe Labour peer, a former head of human rights organisation Liberty, said passports could see \"policing power\" given \"to every bouncer or unscrupulous boss\".\n\"It's a recipe for bullying, it's a recipe for corruption, it's a recipe for discrimination and it's not what we sacrificed so much for as a community over the past year,\" she said.\nThe plan could also \"scupper things\" for hospitality venues who are trying to reopen, Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said.\nShe told BBC Breakfast: \"It is a difficult process for us to implement... and yet today we have not had a consultation with the government about how we would do this in pubs.\" \nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden said vaccine passports could also be used as a \"tool in the short term\" to reopen theatres and sports stadiums. \nA cross-party group of MPs and peers have signed a pledge saying they \"oppose the divisive and discriminatory use of Covid status certification to deny individuals access to general services, businesses or jobs\".\nThe issue has brought together some unlikely allies, with many of Mr Corbyn's former shadow cabinet joining the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group of Conservative MPs in backing the campaign.\nAccusing the government of \"creeping authoritarianism\", Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"As we start to get this virus properly under control we should start getting our freedoms back. Vaccine passports - essentially Covid ID cards - take us in the other direction.\"\nSir Graham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, added: \"With high levels of vaccination protecting the vulnerable and making transmission less likely, we should aim to return to normal life, not to put permanent restrictions in place.\"\nConservative MP Andrew Bridgen told BBC News he was \"not convinced that vaccine passports for use within the UK is proportionate to the risk\".\n\"It would be divisive, effectively creating an underclass of people who are not vaccinated, many of whom won't be vaccinated for medical reasons,\" he added. \"It's a major infringement of civil liberties.\"\nPrivacy campaigning organisation Big Brother Watch also signed the pledge, arguing it could \"create a two-tier nation of division, discrimination and injustice\".\nIn a report - entitled \"Access Denied\" - the group said if certificates were brought in, it would be \"the first policy for decades that could see segregation imposed throughout the population\".\nPolitical opposition to the idea of Covid passports is hardening among some, even before the government announces its plans.\nThe unlikely coalition of more than 70 MPs and peers of varying political colours shows that the issue crosses party lines.\nBoris Johnson has talked increasingly openly about the idea in general, perhaps trying to prepare people for what is to come.\nBut will principled objections to asking people to prove their Covid status scupper the prime minister's plans?\nThat depends on exactly what is proposed and how Labour and rebellious Conservatives respond.\nIf and when it comes to a vote in the House of Commons, the government can't be sure at this point that it will have the support it needs. \nThe campaign comes after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer this week said the use of Covid passports to decide whether people can enter pubs would go against the \"British instinct\".\nA government spokeswoman said: \"The review is considering a range of issues, including the ethical, equalities, privacy, legal and operational aspects and what limits, if any, should be placed on organisations using certification.\"\nMeanwhile, the prime minister is preparing to give an update on the UK's Covid situation on Monday.\nHe is expected to confirm that data suggests the next stage of lockdown could ease in England on 12 April and that a traffic light system could be implemented for foreign travel, with countries being categorised as red, amber or green.\nMore than 31 million people have received the first dose of a coronavirus vaccine and more than 4.5 million have had a second dose, according to Thursday's daily figures.\nThe figures also show there were a further 51 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, bringing the total to 126,764. Some 4,479 new cases have been recorded."

They can be found along our coastline around the UK and we must do all that we can to protect them.\n\"Disturbance by members of the public can be detrimental to seals but this is entirely preventable.\"\nAndy Ottaway, of the Seal Protection Action Group, added:  \"Our precious coastal wildlife is coming under increasing human pressure.\n\"We need to be aware of the harm we can cause by getting too close to our seals and the often tragic consequences when we do.\"\nSue Sayer, of the Seal Research Trust, said: \"If a seal is looking at you, it has been disturbed, so please move further away. Use your camera and binoculars, stay quiet and out of sight.\"\nThe UK is home to about 153,000 grey seals, an estimated 38% of the world's population, and 88% of these are in Scotland.\nThe coastline is also home to about 30% of the European subspecies of common or harbour seals, about 46,000 seals."

Indoor venues are required to reduce crowding and collect the contact details of customers to help with Test and Protect.\nRetail and other sectors also have to ensure social distancing and manage customer flow.\nThe two-metre distancing rule remains in healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists.\nA vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year for entry to:\nUnder the scheme, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or a negative lateral flow test.\nIf it is more than four months since your second jab you will need to show proof of a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. The app has been updated to include boosters.\nProof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later. \nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 and four months old and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\nHowever, people returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. \nInstead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online so that Test and Protect can start the contact tracing process.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said no changes to the guidance for schools were being recommended at this stage - although this was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nPupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the one-metre social distancing rule is still in place.\nMs Sturgeon said young people wanted to see the back of masks as soon as possible, but that many understood they provided \"important protection\". She said the issue \"requires and will receive careful consideration\".\nAll secondary school children are being asked to take a lateral flow test twice a week. \nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\nUniversity and college students are being asked to test twice a week and before socialising with other households.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

He had a wonderful sense of humour and could be relied on to find a humorous take on the most difficult of situations. \n\"The family is devastated by the loss and he will be sadly missed.\"\nThe statement said Mr Mawer had been in Mozambique for 18 months and he had previously worked in Somalia, Sierra Leone, Algeria, Afghanistan, and Yemen.\n\"It was the nature of his chosen line of work to be in the more dangerous corners of the world,\" they said. \"His ability to get things done in the most hostile of environments made him a valued colleague.\n\"Earlier in his life, Philip overcame a period of compulsive gambling and went on to write the book Overcoming Problem Gambling: A Guide for Problem and Compulsive Gamblers, using his personal experience to help others to overcome this destructive addiction. He would often receive letters of thanks from people helped by the book.\"\nFollowing the attack in Palma, hundreds of people have taken refuge at a nearby natural gas facility operated by the French company Total - according to the medical charity M\u00e9dicins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.\nMany have shown up injured including a baby who had been shot and a mother who had just given birth.\nThe fighting in the region has left more than 2,500 people dead and 700,000 displaced since the insurgency began in 2017.

      "tags": "Peatlands,Climate change",
      "text": "Leading garden retailers are still failing to stop the sale of peat in compost despite pressure from the government and campaigners.\nThe Wildlife Trusts said only one of 20 retailers contacted said it would eliminate peat from its shelves this year.\nThe restoration of peatlands is a key part of the government's strategy to mitigate the impact of climate change. \nHighly absorbent, it also helps with flood prevention. \nHowever, one peat producer told the BBC that since lockdown there had been a surge in interest in gardening. Demand for peat was \"unprecedented\" and there was currently no viable alternative.\nAbout 10 years ago, the UK government drew up a voluntary agreement for retailers to phase out sales of peat.\nPeatlands are a carbon \"sink\", which means they soak up carbon dioxide helping combat human-driven climate change.\nAccording to the Wildlife Trusts' survey, many retailers offer peat-free composts, but only two have set a date for ending peat sales. Travis Perkins plans to go 100% peat-free this year. Wickes intends to phase out peat by 2025. \nB&Q, Hillier and the Blue Diamond group of garden centres said they were committed to phasing out peat, but gave no date. Asda, Lidl and others have set themselves targets to reduce sales, but not yet to end them.\nWhen peatland is drained and dug up, it emits rather than soak up carbon. \nCraig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said: \"Our survey shows that most retailers' approach to the voluntary ban on peat sales has been woeful - even though the industry has been aware of the problem for decades. \n\"The time for voluntary agreements is over - the sale of peat must end now. Countless promises have been broken and targets missed, with the result that precious peatland habitats are still being unnecessarily destroyed in the name of gardening.\n\"Only one leading retailer - Travis Perkins - is planning to eliminate peat from its shelves by 2021, whilst growers like Hillier demonstrate that you can produce compost and grow high-quality plants without peat. These retailers are to be congratulated, but we now need government to make the rest follow their lead. The time for delay and excuses is over.\"\nSuppliers say they are doing what they can to meet rising demand. Ben Malin is director of Godwin's Peat, a company based on the Somerset levels. \nIt provides around 120,000 cubic metres of growing material a year to garden centres, DIY outlets and professional growers across the south of England and the Midlands. Mr Malin said some 40% of this is peat.\nMr Malin said: \"We've seen an absolute step-change in gardening over the last 12 months. We've had an unprecedented demand for raw material, and peat is a very important part of the supply chain.\n\"We've been moving towards peat reduction and aiming to be peat-free at a pace that the industry could move at; but this sudden increase in demand has made it absolutely clear to most people in the industry that at the moment it's simply not possible to phase out the use of peat and meet the demand in the marketplace.\"\nHe said that a significant amount of wood chip, which is one alternative, goes towards the biomass industry, which is subsidised. This pushes up prices. \nAnother option is coir, which is made from coconut husks. However it has a very long and unreliable supply chain.\nJames Barnes, chairman of the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA), said the industry fully supported alternatives to peat.\nHe commented: \"Manufacturers now produce more peat-free and peat-reduced growing media than ever, which are stocked and sold by retailers, but an immediate ban on peat use is unrealistic - access to the amount and quality of alternative materials needed is not yet in place.\"\nHe said the HTA had come together with other industry groups to propose a way forward with work to be published soon, including \"meaningful and realistic peat removal targets\" and said the organisation wanted to work with government, organisations and the supply chain to deliver viable, responsibly sourced alternatives\".\nDr Rebekka Artz is an expert in peatland ecosystems at the James Hutton Institute. \nShe said that between two and three million cubic metres of peat - around 8,000 hectares - was used for horticulture in the UK each year. A sizeable part of this goes to amateur gardeners.\nShe said the volume could be likened to the size of the London O2 building. Even more was imported from the Baltic states or from the Republic of Ireland, thereby \"offshoring our emissions.\"\nShe believes it is crucial a way is found to protect the peatlands these amounts are sourced from. \n\"Only 3% of our land area on the planet is covered in peatlands but they are the largest carbon store that we have. They have grown very slowly since the last Ice Age, and only accumulate about a millimetre every decade. It's a very slow-growing resource and it's very easy to lose it.\"\nAccording to the HTA, the figure is around 2m cubic metres in total which amounts to 0.04% of peatlands that is extracted for horticulture in the UK.\nThe Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) recently committed to going completely \"peat-free\" by 2025 and is calling on gardeners across the UK to do the same. \nBord Na Mona, Ireland's partial state company which was set up to develop peatlands for the Irish economy, also announced that it's formally ending all peat harvesting on its land.\nFollow Claire on Twitter."

      "text": "The leader of the SNP has insisted her party was \"not divided\".\nSpeaking on BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Nicola Sturgeon said her aim at May's Holyrood election was winning a \"simple majority\".\nShe rejected Alex Salmond's idea of creating a \"super majority\" by encouraging voters to back his newly-formed Alba Party on the regional list.\nThe former first minister said he wanted to work with an SNP government to advance the cause of independence.\nHe told the BBC's Today programme that that cause was \"much, much bigger than personalities\".\nMs Sturgeon denied that the SNP was suffering from internal issues and said support had \"never been higher\".\nShe explained: \"I know I lead a party that has a growing membership just now and has a commanding position in the opinion polls.\n\"The breakdown of opinion polls that tests the views and attitudes of SNP voters show the SNP is actually the most united of all the parties in Scotland.\"\nSCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat elections are happening? On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government. Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Scottish Parliament have? MSPs pass laws on most aspects of day-to-day life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and welfare benefits. Defence, foreign policy and immigration are decided by the UK Parliament.\nHow do I vote?\u00a0Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You can\u00a0register to vote online. \nMs Sturgeon went to say that she was concentrating on winning a \"simple majority\" and if people wanted an SNP government, and her as first minister, then voting for the nationalists was the only way to bring that about.\nShe said: \"You only have to cast your mind back to the days when Alex Salmond was leader of the SNP and he didn't say what he is saying now.\n\"What he said then, and he was right then, is that the only way to make sure you get the government you want is to vote for the party that will be that government.\n\"Anything else is trying to gamble with the system, game the system, take a chance on the outcome of the election.\n\"If you want to see an SNP government elected that then has the ability to deliver an independence referendum, you don't get that by voting for somebody else.\"\nNicola Sturgeon insists that there is no split within the independence movement.\nBut it is inescapable that at the same moment she was being interviewed on Radio Scotland, her predecessor Alex Salmond was speaking on Radio 4 as the leader of a rival party.\nThe two were once an inseparable double act atop the SNP, which took Scotland to the brink of independence. But he has now formed his own breakaway group, populated with defectors from the SNP including two sitting MPs. \nThe fact that many of these defectors have left the SNP over various policy differences means there is sure to be friction between their manifesto pledges too.\nSo, Mr Salmond's very presence in the race raises questions for Ms Sturgeon - even over her core objective of independence, which her party can no longer own as home turf. She now has to spend precious time talking about his vision, instead of her own.\nBoth leaders may insist that their campaigns will be positive and do not pose a threat to the cause they share, but in many ways Holyrood is no longer big enough for the both of them.\nMs Sturgeon told listeners that two things were required to win independence - a majority in the Scottish Parliament to bring about a referendum and, \"crucially\", winning majority support among the Scottish population.\nShe said: \"Anybody who tries to suggest there's a shortcut to that, or that we can somehow game or trick our way to independence, frankly, is misleading people. It's got to be through a process that is not just legitimate but seen to be legitimate so that it can command respect and authority at home and internationally as well.\"\nOn SNP politicians leaving the party to stand at the Holyrood election for the Alba Party she said she was \"not sure it is as many as Mr Salmond might have been hoping for\".\nShe added: \"I also don't think this is a friendly gesture on Mr Salmond's part towards the SNP.\"\nLast week, former SNP leader Mr Salmond announced the creation of a new pro-independence party. \nHe said the Alba Party would not field candidates in any of the 73 constituency seats - but the party will field four candidates in each of the eight regional lists.\nSpeaking on Today, Mr Salmond said that securing a \"super majority\" of pro-independence parties at Holyrood would \"strengthen immeasurably Scotland's hand in negotiating with a Tory PM\".\nHe added: \"From 2007 to 2011 I was first minister and I was negotiated first with Gordon Brown.\n\"No Tory PM will want to be to trying to face down an entire parliament and an entire people.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Ms Sturgeon's comments were \"the clearest sign yet that the SNP will put another referendum before Scotland's recovery.\"\nHe added: \"The Institute for Fiscal Studies demonstrated this week that higher levels of public spending in Scotland is possible because we're part of the United Kingdom. \n\"The UK furlough scheme is still protecting Scottish jobs and people are still getting Covid jags in their arms - but Nicola Sturgeon thinks risking all of that is what's best for Scotland?\"\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrats said Ms Sturgeon had \"once again made it very clear that her only priority this election is another independence referendum\".\nThe party's campaign chairman, Alistair Carmichael, said: \"This is not what Scotland needs.\n\"Scotland needs a needle-sharp focus on green and secure jobs, a plan to help education bounce back and supporting the NHS and mental health.\"\nScottish Labour has said the focus of the next parliament should be on recovering from the pandemic and rebuilding the country's economy and health service rather than arguing about the constitution.\nBut the Scottish Greens believe a referendum is needed within the next five years because \"decisions about Scotland should be made by the Scottish people.\""

Some shops and businesses have been damaged.\nAt the start, about 12 police vehicles and officers in riot gear corralled rioters into Donegall Road.\nA line of police jeeps then blocked access at the junction of Bradbury Place. \nDozens of protestors hurled bricks and bottles and a bin, which was set alight, was pushed up against a police vehicle. \nOn Friday, a small crowd of protestors also gathered in Ballymena at the Larne Road Link, which was closed by police along with the Crebilly Road. \nSpeaking to BBC News NI, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MLA Christopher Stalford, whose constituency office is in Sandy Row, said everyone must \"abide by the law\". \n\"Given the actions of the deputy first minister, some may think that it's alright to break Covid guidance in relation to public gatherings - that is not the case,\" he said, referring to Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill and her attendance at the funeral of Bobby Storey last June.\nEarlier this week, the Public Prosecution Service announced that no one would face charges over their attendance at the funeral, provoking a furious political backlash among unionists. \n\"We should all abide by the law and I don't want to see a situation where young people end up with a criminal record or their lives destroyed because they've acted out of frustration at recent political developments,\" Mr Stalford added.\nUlster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken pleaded for those involved to \"please stop this violence\".\n\"It will not achieve anything, and undermines the legitimate concerns that you have and is damaging our own communities,\" he posted on social media.\nSinn F\u00e9in West Belfast MP Paul Maskey said \"dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric\" from the DUP and political unionism has \"heightened tensions\".\nMr Maskey said it was \"deeply concerning to see these types of incidents at the height of the Covid pandemic and as we are beginning to make good progress\".\n\"This is a time for calm heads and responsible leadership,\" he added.\nSouth Belfast MP Claire Hanna said it was \"sad to see disorder in Sandy Row\".\nShe blamed what she described as \"usual suspects with no vision\" for creating \"tension for electoral gain\".\n\"History repeats, people lose hope, kids get criminal records, communities pull apart. There's a better way,\" she said.\nStormont's Justice Minister Naomi Long said the disorder was \"in no-one's best interests - not the officers dealing with it and not the mostly young people risking their futures by engaging with it\".\n\"It's incumbent on leaders to behave responsibly and dial down the inflammatory rhetoric over recent days,\" the Alliance Party leader tweeted.\n\"Words have consequences.\"\nThe Police Federation for Northern Ireland, which represents officers, said that \"once again the outworkings of political flux in Northern Ireland results in our colleagues being attacked\". \n\"No excuse for violence and condemnation across the political spectrum would be welcome,\" it tweeted."

      "tags": "Gaming,Gambling",
      "text": "The link between gaming loot boxes and problem gambling has been \"robustly verified\", according to a new report.\nThe report, carried out by researchers at the universities of Plymouth and Wolverhampton, found that loot boxes \"are structurally and psychologically akin to gambling\".\nIt also found that large numbers of children are opening loot boxes.\nThe UK government is already considering whether gambling laws should cover such loot boxes.\nThe upcoming Gambling Act review is set to look at the question, with the UK's House of Lords already having weighed in to say that loot boxes should be firmly regulated as \"games of chance\".\nLoot boxes are a video game feature involving a sealed mystery \"box\" - sometimes earned through playing the game and sometimes paid for with real money - which can be opened for a random collection of in-game items such as weapons or cosmetic costumes.\nThe new research, commissioned by the GambleAware charity, compiles existing research to examine the strength of links between the in-game random prizes and gambling behaviour. It found:\nThe report said that many games use a \"psychological nudge\" to encourage people to buy loot boxes - such as the fear of missing out on limited-time items or special deals. \n\"Many gamers do ascribe discrete financial values to loot box contents - based on purchase or resale price - suggesting that many loot boxes meet existing criteria for gambling regulation,\" the authors wrote.\nThe big spenders - the crucial 5% for the industry - can spend more than \u00a370 or $100 a month on the boxes, the report said. But those are not necessarily wealthy people who earn lots of money.\n\"Our research therefore demonstrates that games developers, unwittingly or not, appear to be generating outsized loot box profits from at-risk individuals (these are likely to include both people with gambling problems or problematic patterns of video gaming) - but not from wealthy gamers,\" it concluded. \nAmong the authors' recommendations were that any regulation has extremely precise definitions to avoid any possible workarounds; that loot boxes are included in game labelling and age ratings; that the odds of winning items be clearly shown including the average cost of enough boxes to obtain a rare item; establishing spending limits; and more.  \nDr James Close, one of the report's authors from the University of Plymouth, said the study had established the link between loot boxes and \"problem gambling behaviours\".\n\"We have also demonstrated that at-risk individuals, such as problem gamblers, gamers, and young people, make disproportionate contributions to loot box revenues,\" he added.\nGambleAware's chief Zoe Osmond said the charity was \"increasingly concerned that gambling is now part of everyday life for children and young people\". \n\"It is now for politicians to review this research, as well as the evidence of other organisations, and decide what legislative and regulatory changes are needed to address these concerns,\" she said.\nA spokesman for Ukie, the national games industry body, said that game companies had \"already taken action\" on the issue.\n\"Probability disclosure has already been introduced to the major game platforms; a new paid random item descriptor was added to the PEGI age rating system to inform players of their presence in games; settings and tools on all major game devices - and in a number of leading games - already allow players to manage, limit or turn off spend,\" he said.\n\"We will also continue to work constructively to support our players in partnership with Government and other organisations.\""

      "tags": "Tigray People's Liberation Front,Tigray crisis,Ethiopia",
      "text": "An investigation by BBC Africa Eye has uncovered evidence that a massacre in northern Ethiopia was carried out by members of the Ethiopian military. It also reveals the precise location of the atrocity, in which at least 15 men were killed.   \nIn early March, a series of five video clips surfaced on social media showing armed, uniformed men leading a group of unarmed men to the edge of a cliff, shooting some at point blank range, and pushing dead bodies over the cliff.\nThe BBC has confirmed that the massacre took place close to the town of Mahbere Dego in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, where the Ethiopian army is fighting the forces of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), previously the region's ruling party.\nThe fighting began last November when the government launched a military offensive against the TPLF, which Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed accused of attacking a government military base. The TPLF is opposed to efforts by Mr Abiy to increase the power of the federal government, and has said it is committed to \"extended resistance\".\nThe conflict has so far displaced more than two million people, according to Tigray's interim administration, and left more than four million people in need of aid.\nThe BBC Africa Eye investigations team, working together with analysts from the media outlets Bellingcat and Newsy, set out to establish where the massacre took place. \nThe first people to post the clips to social media claimed they were filmed near  Mahbere Dego. Africa Eye analysed geographical features seen in the videos, including a dirt road, a plateau, and an escarpment with a distinctive profile, and compared them with satellite imagery of the area around the town.\nThe direction and length of shadows cast by the armed men helped to pinpoint the likely time of day and showed that the escarpment was oriented north-south, allowing Africa Eye to identify a likely location.\nA ridgeline in the video footage was then overlaid on a topographical map of the location to confirm it was an exact match. A dry riverbed, band of vegetation, and pattern of trees further confirmed the match.\nThe BBC spoke by phone to a resident of Mahbere Dego, who said the Ethiopian army took away 73 men from the town and surrounding area in January this year, including three of his relatives. He said none of them had been heard from since.\nThe BBC also spoke to a resident in a neighbouring village who said that his brother was among those killed in this massacre. He said that the killings took place in Mahbere Dego, and gave the same month: January 2021 - the government had declared victory in the conflict in November.\n\"They killed them at the cliff,\" he said.\nAfrica Eye was not able to confirm the identities of the armed men seen in the video footage, but the details of their uniforms - including the camouflage pattern and arm badge in the colour of the Ethiopian flag - appear to match those worn by the Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF). \nOther features also match the ENDF uniform, including the cut and style of the pockets. One of the armed men wears a green beret bearing an insignia that appears to closely match the colour and insignia of the ENDF beret.\nThe armed men are speaking Amharic, the main official language of Ethiopia. In the first of the five video clips, they can be heard speaking to one another as they stand around the group of unarmed men, who are seated on the floor.\n\"We should not free these people. Not even one of them should be spared,\" says a voice off camera.\n\"We have to get this on video, how these people die,\" says another voice. \nMore about the conflict in Tigray:\nThe next four clips show the unarmed men being led at gunpoint towards the cliff edge, and capture the armed men killing several prisoners and pushing the bodies of the dead over the cliff.\nIn some sections of the footage, the gunmen can be seen firing bullets from close range into the bodies. In others they can be heard insulting and mocking the dead.\n\"I wish we could pour gas over them and burn them,\" says a voice off camera in one clip.\n\"It would have been great if there was gas to burn these people,\" replies a second voice. \"Burn their bodies like the Indians do.\"\nThe identity of the victims, who are seen wearing civilian clothes, is not known. They can be heard speaking Tigrinya, the language of the Tigray region. In the footage, the killers appear to suggest they believe the victims belong to the TPLF.  \n\"This is the end of woyane,\" says a voice of one of the armed men, using a slang term for the TPLF. \n\"We don't show mercy.\"\nLaetitia Bader, the Horn of Africa director for Human Rights Watch, told the BBC that observers had seen \"a whole magnitude of very serious abuses\" in the region in recent months, but that this footage was \"obviously particularly alarming\". \n\"We see what appear to be unarmed detained men, who are being executed,\" she said. \"This is absolutely an incident that requires further investigation, because what we are seeing here in these videos could amount to war crimes.\"\nThe BBC put the evidence it had gathered to the Ethiopian government, which said in a statement that \"social media posts and claims cannot be taken as evidence\", adding that the Tigray region was \"open for independent investigations to be undertaken\".\nInvestigation by Aliaume Leroy, Giancarlo Fiorella (Bellingcat), and Jake Godin (Newsy).\nAdditional reporting by Daniel Adamson, Joel Gunter, Chiara Francavilla, Bertram Hill, Carlos Gonzales, Mohammed Osman, Samir, and Leila Nathoo."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday. We'll have another update for you on Saturday morning. \nMore than 70 MPs have launched a campaign against \"divisive and discriminatory\" Covid passports in England. The government is currently consulting on the measure, which could be used, among other things, for entry into venues, including pubs, theatres and sports stadiums. But MPs from across the political spectrum have lined up to condemn the proposal, with former Labour and Conservative leaders Jeremy Corbyn and Iain Duncan Smith among them. Read more here about what a Covid passport is and how they could be introduced. Meanwhile, new rules requiring every customer to sign in when pubs reopen in England on 12 April have sparked anger from industry groups.\nA teachers' union has warned that insufficient funding for schools in England during the pandemic is placing staff and pupils at risk. The Nasuwt union said it had seen reports of redundancies of staff who are essential to Covid safety measures in schools. At the same time, leaders of some academy trusts have been receiving \"fat cat\" salaries, the union said. Read our explainer here on some of the costs involved for schools in keeping Covid-secure. \nA \"national strategy\" is needed to help people in Wales who have shielding reintegrate into society, an expert on loneliness has said. In Wales, 130,000 people who have been shielding have been told that they no longer need to. But Dr Deborah Morgan warned these people could become \"prisoners in their homes\", citing a loss of confidence after months of being indoors. \"A lot of the young people I know are at a real risk of struggling to go back out into the world in the way that we were before,\" Amy-Claire Davies, who has been shielding, says.\nLockdown has meant that seals have ventured further into spaces that were previously dominated by humans, experts have said. But as restrictions ease, the public is being urged to give the animals space, with concerns that getting too close could lead to their injury and death. The warning comes after a popular seal known as \"Freddie\" was put down last month after being attacked by a dog in Barnes, south-west London.\nAnd finally, there is good news for the beleaguered arts and music sector, which has been hit so hard by the pandemic. West End theatres, comedy clubs, the Glastonbury Festival and Canterbury Cathedral will receive a share of \u00a3400m emergency government culture funding. A total of 2,700 English culture and heritage venues will share the latest round of the Culture Recovery Fund. Glastonbury Festival organisers Emily and Michael Eavis said the money would \"make a huge difference in helping to secure our future\". \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Universities,Cardiff,Cardiff University,Wales education,Students",
      "text": "Security has been beefed-up at Cardiff University to tackle students holding parties breaking Covid laws, it has been claimed. \nA letter to Unison members expressed concern at \"parties and mass gatherings\" held at halls of residence.\n\"These gatherings and parties are unlawful and put staff and students' health at risk,\" it said.\nThe university said a small minority were not observing the rules and there had been parties at some of its sites.\nIt added that breaches were investigated by university security \"often working alongside South Wales Police\".\nUnder current coronavirus regulations large groups of people are banned from meeting inside and only six people from two households can meet outside.\nThe Unison letter, sent in an email and seen by BBC Wales, said the parties and gatherings were taking place predominantly at two halls, Talybont and University Hall. \n\"We recognise how frustrated many of the students are, however, we fully support the university in their efforts to stop this dangerous and unlawful behaviour,\" said the email. \nIt said security from the firm Showsec had been drafted in to help on nights when they were needed. \nIt said Showsec was being used as a \"temporary measure\" and would only be used on \"evening/nights where there are issues\".\nThe email said four new security guards had been employed by the university.\n\"There are lots of Covid-specific measures that are required at present in order that the safety of all staff and students is prioritised and the trade unions are fully supportive of every measure that increases safety.\" \nThe student experience has been very different for those studying in 2020 and 2021 so far, with campuses closed, lectures cancelled, and nights out banned for much of the year.\nUniversities in Wales had agreed a staggered start of the new term after the Christmas break, but many students continue to learn online.\nNUS Wales president, Becky Ricketts, urged students to \"stick to the rules\". \n\"As with any part of society, there will always be a small number of people who break rules, but we can't scapegoat students and young people, the majority of whom are behaving responsibly,\" she said.\n\"The plan to lift measures in Wales announced earlier this week means that by doing the right thing for a little longer, students will soon be able to do more with more people. \n\"Universities have procedures in place to deal with misconduct and these are appropriate to be able to deal with any rule breaches.\n\"I'd encourage universities to continue to communicate the latest rules with their students and avoid the over-policing of our campuses.\"\nCardiff University said it took students' health and safety seriously. \nA spokesman said using extra private security was not new and had been in place since the start of the academic year \"especially in response to an increase in non-residents trying to access them\". \nHe said: \"The vast majority of our students are observing Covid-19 rules and we are extremely grateful to them for doing so.\n\"However, like other universities, a small minority are not observing the rules and we have seen parties and other gatherings in communal spaces at some of our sites, including University Hall and Talybont.\n\"Such incidents are contrary to current Covid-19 restrictions, are not acceptable and we have a duty to act.\"\nBreaches are investigated by university security \"often working alongside South Wales Police\".\nThe spokesman said: \"They have resulted in fixed penalty notices and acceptable behaviour contracts and, in some cases, may result in university disciplinary action.\""

      "title": "'Threatening' landlord's flats have still been let",
      "tags": "Edinburgh,Renting,Landlords",
      "text": "Flats owned by a man who was refused entry to Scotland's landlord register have been let out for residential use under the guise of holiday lets. \nMark Fortune failed to get on the list of fit and proper landlords in 2013 after threatening his tenants. \nBut rooms in his Edinburgh flats are being let out under contracts which do not give tenants the same protection as residential agreements. \nThe millionaire property tycoon denied that he rents out flats. \nMr Fortune said the properties are operated by limited companies, not him personally. \nFormer tenants have told BBC Scotland that they were given monthly holiday let contracts to sign, despite making clear they were in Edinburgh to live and work. \nPeople who have lived in properties owned by Mr Fortune have shared evidence of poor maintenance standards, such as damp, broken windows and faulty wiring, and some claim to have not had their deposit returned when they moved out.  \nOne couple said they were asked to leave a flat owned by Mr Fortune during the Covid pandemic after requesting that some repairs be made to the property. \nHailey La Sarre and Gergely Farkas moved into a flatshare in Edinburgh in October last year.\nThe flat is owned by Mr Fortune and their contract was with Edinburgh Rent Limited. Companies House has Mr Fortune listed as its sole director and the person with significant control. \nHailey and Gergely said the flat had a number of issues, including a broken skylight and faulty electrics. \nWhen they raised the problems, they were told that they would have to leave the property.\n\"Your heart sinks,\" said Hailey.\n\"What are you supposed to do? You don't expect that. You ask for a simple fix and they say get out.\"\nEdinburgh Rent told the couple their holiday let contract was not being renewed, but Hailey said this was not their understanding of the deal when they found the room listed on the flatmate-finder website Spare Room.\nShe said: \"On their listing online it said that it was long-term lets, implying that we could stay as long as we want.\"\nA group called Mark Fortune Investigation (MFI) said it had been contacted by more than 40 former tenants in flats operated by the businessman's companies.\nMFI said these people had shared accounts of the flats being in a poor state of repair with issues such as faulty boilers and damp. \nThe group also claimed the majority of ex-tenants who contacted them did not get their deposit back when they moved out. \nAlessandro Carosi, a spokesman for MFI, said he failed to get his deposit back from a long-term stay in an Edinburgh flat owned by Mr Fortune. \nHe said people had been contacting the MFI group because they wanted their voices to be heard. \n\"The majority are foreigners like me,\" said Mr Carosi.\n\"A lot of them just move to Edinburgh and they cannot afford more expensive flats.\"\nHe said the people contacting MFI had been renting flats under holiday let contracts but living there for a long time.\n\"That is how Mark Fortune is making his fortune with people on minimum wages or foreigners who just arrive and don't know the rules or the laws,\" he said.\nMr Fortune is thought to own scores of flats across Edinburgh and is no stranger to controversy. \nIn 2013, he was refused entry to Scotland's landlord register after being convicted of offences directly relating to his letting business, including threatening tenants. \nEdinburgh City Council said Mr Fortune last applied to join the landlord register in 2018 and this was refused. \nMr Fortune told BBC Scotland this application was made in 2015 and that he withdrew it in 2018.\nMr Fortune is listed at Companies House as the only director of a company called Edinburgh Holiday and Party Lets (EHPL).\nLast year part of a housing tribunal ruling said that a person living in a flat operated by EHPL was doing so on a private residential tenancy and not a holiday let agreement.\nIt pointed out the person was living and working in Edinburgh and had lived in the property for seven months. \nThe ruling stated: \"The agreement signed by the parties states that it is a holiday let. However, the evidence clearly establishes that it was not.\"\nThe ruling goes on to say that EHPL \"appears to have called the tenancy agreement a holiday let in an attempt to avoid security of tenure and the requirement to serve proper notice and apply to the tribunal for an eviction order\".\nBBC Scotland showed one of the \"holiday let\" agreements used by one of Mr Fortune's firms to Catherine McQuarrie, a residential tenancy law specialist at TC Young Solicitors.\nShe pointed out a number of problems with the one-page contract, which quoted legislation that had been superseded. \nShe said: \"It's quite clear from the wording of the document that the person using this is attempting to get out of complying with the legislation that would otherwise apply to protect the tenant.\n\"Essentially you can't have a holiday let if you're not on holiday. It's as simple as that.\n\"That simply means that the agreement is null and void and instead the parties have a private residential tenancy agreement.\"\nHoliday lets are exempt from tenant protections such as the landlord registration scheme and putting deposits into third-party protection schemes. \nMr Fortune told BBC Scotland he was not banned from the landlord register but that a decision was taken to not place his name on the list of Scotland's approved landlords. \nHe added: \"I do not operate as a landlord, any properties both residential or commercial are operated by limited companies having been granted a licence by myself which allows commercial subletting.\n\"All deposits that were due for refund have, I'm advised, been refunded.\"\nMr Fortune said the complaints raised represent a \"very small percentage of overall residents\" of  the 160 properties he says he owns.\nThis issue was also covered by The Ferret investigative news website.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The stay at home rule which has been in place in Scotland for more than three months has been lifted.\nPeople have been told to \"stay local\" and to remain within their local authority boundaries for the next three weeks.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the vaccination programme's progress had been \"better than we could have dared hope for back at the turn of the year\".\nHowever, she also warned that there were \"no grounds for complacency\".\nOn Friday another 414 new cases of Covid-19 were reported and four new deaths of people who had tested positive.\nMs Sturgeon said: \"It is really important right now that while the vaccination programme continues to be rolled out, all of us remain hyper-vigilant in how we're going about our daily lives.\"\nPolice Scotland's Deputy Chief Constable Malcolm Graham issued a warning ahead of the Easter weekend, urging people to stay local unless for essential purposes.\nHe said: \"While Easter weekend is traditionally a time for visiting friends and family, I would urge people to stay local and follow the regulations on gatherings.\n\"If you are visiting beauty spots within your local area, do so safely and respectfully - leaving no trace of your visit. Please also park responsibly to allow emergency access.\"\nPolice in Edinburgh also said increased patrols would continue following a spate of anti-social behaviour incidents on or near public transport.\nThe Scottish government's weekly State of the Epidemic in Scotland document pulls together the most recent statistics from a range of sources. Here are the key points:\nProf Nick Hopkins, who sits on the Scottish government's Covid-19 advisory group, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme there was \"a lot to be optimistic about\".\nHe said: \"The vaccine rollout gives us enormous cause for hope, but hope is not the same as wishful thinking.\n\"We need to recognise that there is still a reality out there and we need to be very mindful of those risks and continue to be careful, to monitor our behaviour, to follow the guidelines.\"\nThe University of Dundee psychology professor also said the move to \"stay local\" was very positive.\nProf Hopkins added: \"It really does send out the signal that the sacrifices that people have made over the last year, and it's been a long, long year, are actually getting us where we need to be.\"\nFurther easing of restrictions in Scotland from Monday will enable barbers, hairdressers, car showrooms, homeware shops and garden centres to reopen. \nShops will be allowed to resume click and collect services.\nIn addition, outdoor contact sports for 12 to 17-year-olds can start again and college students will be able to return to in-person teaching for practical subjects.\nIt is expected that all school pupils will return full-time after the Easter holidays. Those in secondary schools had been attending part-time in recent weeks.\nThe easing of the level four restrictions in Scotland will have a minimum gap of three weeks between phases, and will be assessed using conditions set out by the World Health Organization.\nIn February, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a four-step plan which could see all legal limits on social contact lifted by 21 June in England. \nEach stage in his routemap will be a minimum of five weeks apart, with conditions that must be met before proceeding to the next step.\nThe stay at home rule in England was eased on 29 March, although the government advice was to \"minimise travel\"."

      "tags": "Washington DC,United States Capitol,United States",
      "text": "An attack at the US Capitol complex in Washington DC has left one police officer dead and another in hospital with injuries.\nA car crashed into a security barrier before the driver lunged towards the officers with a knife, police said. \nThe officers opened fire and the suspect was shot dead.\nAuthorities said the attack, which came three months after January's deadly Capitol riots, did not appear to be terrorism-related.\n\"Whether the attack was at law enforcement, or whoever, we have a responsibility to get to the bottom of it and we'll do that,\" Robert Contee, the acting chief of Washington DC's Metropolitan Police Department, said at a news conference.\nActing Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman said it was \"with a very, very heavy heart that I announce one of our officers has succumbed to his injuries\".\nIn a later statement, she named the officer as  William \"Billy\" Evans, who had been a member of the Capitol Police for 18 years and was part of the department's first responders unit.\n\"Please keep Officer Evans and his family in your thoughts and prayers,\" she said. \nTwo law enforcement sources involved in the investigation told BBC partner CBS News that the suspect in the attack was 25-year-old Noah Green from Indiana. \nThey said that no prior information about him had been found on any police databases.\nIn a post from mid-March on a now-deleted Facebook page, Green wrote that he had recently left his job, \"partly due to afflictions, but ultimately, in search of a spiritual journey\".   He added he had been suffering the \"side effects of drugs I was intaking unknowingly\" and wrote extensively of his interest in the black nationalist religious organisation, Nation of Islam.\nIn a statement Facebook said it had designated the incident under its \"Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy\", meaning the suspect's Facebook and Instagram accounts were being removed, as well as any content praising him.\nAn increased security presence remains around the Capitol building, where the US Congress sits.\nAs Congress is not currently in session, most politicians were not at the Capitol complex at the time of the attack. \nShortly after 13:00 local time (18:00 GMT) the Capitol Police alert system sent an email to lawmakers and their staff ordering them to stay away from exterior windows and doors due to a threat. Anyone outside was instructed to seek cover.  \nAt that time, a man driving a blue sedan had rammed the car into two officers standing at the North Barricade, according to police.\nHe exited the vehicle and ran towards the officers - at least one of whom drew a weapon and shot the suspect. The officers were then transported to hospital, one in an ambulance and one in a police cruiser.\nFootage of the scene showed a helicopter flying overhead and what appeared to be two people on stretchers being moved into ambulances. \nOnlookers were told to clear the area. \nPolice said the suspect died due to his injuries at 13:30 local time. Chief Contee told reporters the suspect appeared to act alone.\nThe FBI's Washington Field Office said it was providing support to the Capitol Police.\nAnalysis by Samantha Granville, US Capitol\nCapitol Hill has been tense over the past three months. Since the riot on 6 January, the complex has been like a fortress with barbed wire, metal fencing and heightened security. \nBut just weeks later, we are back here with blocked roads, extra troops, and a solemn feeling.\nCongress is in recess today and staff I have spoken to are grateful to be home and nervous about returning to work after the Easter holiday. \nThey say, understandably, that it is scary to have your workplace attacked twice in a short space of time.\nIt is concerning for them that even with ramped up security, an event that led to an officer's death still happened.\nUS President Joe Biden said he was \"heartbroken to learn of the violent attack\".\nHe offered his \"heartfelt condolences to Officer Evans' family, and everyone grieving his loss\", and said that he had ordered flags at the White House to be lowered to half mast.\nDemocratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi said \"America's heart has been broken\" and called Mr Evans \"a martyr for our democracy\".\nDemocratic Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said he was \"heartbroken for the officer killed\" and indebted to the Capitol police force.\nRepublican Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell wrote that he was \"praying\" for those attacked."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The UK's medicines watchdog says it has found 30 cases of rare blood clots in people who have had the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine.\nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says the risk of having this type of clot is \"very small\".\nThe UK cases were out of more than 18 million doses given as of 24 March.\nFears over clots have led nations such as the Netherlands, Germany, France and Canada to restrict the jab's use.\nThe pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has said international regulators had found the benefits of its jab outweighed risks significantly.\nThe MHRA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have also said the benefits of taking the vaccine outweigh any risks.\nThe MHRA said it had received 22 reports of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) - where a blood clot forms in the brain - and eight reports of \"other thrombosis events with low platelets [the cells involved in clotting]\" following use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, out of a total of 18.1 million doses given up to and including 24 March.\nThe watchdog said the benefits of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in preventing Covid-19 infection and its complications continued to outweigh any risks, and urged the public to accept the jab when offered it.\nIn response to the MHRA's data, Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), insisted taking the vaccine was \"by far the safest choice\" to minimise the risk of serious illness or death from Covid-19.\nHe said: \"The extreme rarity of these events in the context of the many millions of vaccine doses that have been administered means that the risk-benefit decision facing people who are invited to receive Covid-19 vaccines is very straightforward: receiving the vaccine is by far the safest choice in terms of minimising individual risk of serious illness or death.\"\nMeanwhile, the MHRA said there had been no reports of blood clots following use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs of 21 March, an estimated 10.8 million first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab had been administered in the UK, the regulator said. It added that around 2.2 million second doses, mostly the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, had been administered.\nMore than 31.3 million people in the UK have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and more than 4.9 million have had a second dose, according to Friday's daily government figures.\nThe Netherlands is the latest country to restrict the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, after saying on Friday that it was suspending its use for people under the age of 60.\nThe Dutch health ministry said the precautionary measure was taken after five reports of blood clots in combination with low platelet counts in women between the ages of 25 and 65.\nAll appointments for those under-60s scheduled to receive the jab have been cancelled with immediate effect. The suspension will remain in place until 7 April when the EMA is expected to issue new guidance.\nAbout 400,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca injections have been given in the Netherlands, it added.\nEarlier this week, Germany said it was suspending routine use of the jab for people below the age of 60 due to fears over a link with blood clots.\nIt has reported 31 CVSTs and nine deaths out of 2.7 million people vaccinated. Almost all the cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women.\nThe Netherlands and Germany were among several European countries which briefly suspended use of the jab last month pending an EMA review into the possible link to blood clots.\nWhen the EMA declared the vaccine \"safe and effective\", they resumed its use while investigations continued.\nFrance already limits use of AstraZeneca to those aged over 55 and on Monday, Canada recommended immediately suspending use of the jab in people aged below 55 following reports in Europe. \nThe EMA, which has assessed data from around the world, estimates there is around a one in 100,000 risk of a CVST in people under the age of 60 who have been given the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThe organisation's head of safety monitoring, Dr Peter Arlett, said that was \"more than we would expect to see\".\nJames Gallagher, the BBC's Health and Science correspondent, says that it is uncertain what the background rate of these blood clots in the brain truly is. \nEstimates vary from around two cases per million people every year to nearly 16 in every million in normal times and coronavirus itself may be causing them too.\nCVSTs are inherently more common in younger women and taking the pill increases the risk. So the natural risk levels - whether people are vaccinated or not - could have a role too.\nTwo vaccines - developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being used in the UK to protect people against Covid-19. \nThe first doses of a third vaccine - from Moderna - are due to arrive in the UK later this month. Like the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs, Moderna's is given in two doses several weeks apart.\nThe UK has ordered seven vaccines and expects to receive 407 million doses - more than enough for every adult to receive two.\nThe aim is to vaccinate everyone aged 18 or over in the UK with one dose by the end of July - but children could receive a vaccine in the long term if they are shown to be safe."

      "text": "Social media groups involving teenage girls that led to \"suicidal crises\" and \"serious self-harm\" have been uncovered by police, BBC News has learned.\nTwelve girls, aged between 12 and 16 years old and from across southern England, were part of an Instagram chat group whose name refers to suicide.\nThe group was discovered when three of the girls went missing and were found seriously unwell in London.\nInstagram says it found no suicide or self-harm related content in the group. \nBBC News has obtained a police briefing about the investigation which discovered the online groups.\nIt says \"peer-to-peer influence increased suicidal ideation amongst the children involved to the extent that several escalated to suicidal crises and serious self-harm.\"\nThe group came to the notice of police when three of the girls, who had been reported missing, travelled by train to meet in London.\nThey were found seriously unwell in a street and taken by ambulance to hospital for emergency treatment. \nOne of the girls mentioned they had first met each other online and discussed suicide, according to the briefing which was published on 25 March.\nPolice officers then examined digital devices to identify the name of the online group and its other members.\nSeven of the 12 girls had self-harmed prior to being traced by the police. Children's social care services from seven different local authorities have been involved in safeguarding children identified as members of the group.\nBBC News understands that some of the children had met on other social media platforms but were part of a closed Instagram group - a direct message thread - whose title explicitly mentions the words \"suicide\" and \"missing\".\nIn November 2020, Instagram introduced new technology to recognise self-harm and suicide content on its app.\nFears about the impact of this content on young and vulnerable people been raised since 14-year-old schoolgirl Molly Russell killed herself after seeing graphic images on the platform.\nMolly's father, Ian, told the BBC at the time that the \"pushy algorithms\" of social media \"helped kill my daughter\".\nFacebook, which owns Instagram, does not deny that the name of the closed group referenced \"suicide\" but says it has not been removed from the platform because the content of the messages does not break its rules.\nIn a statement, a company spokesperson said it was co-operating with the police.\n\"[We] reviewed reports but found no content that broke our rules, nor in fact any suicide or self-harm related content,\" they said.\n\"We don't allow graphic content, or content that promotes or encourages suicide or self-harm, and will remove it when we find it. \n\"We'll continue to support the police and will respond to any valid legal request for information.\"\nBritish Transport Police, which led the investigation, declined to comment. \nIf you've been affected by issues raised in this story, sources of support are available via the BBC Action Line here.\nYou can call Samaritans free on 116 123, email them at jo@samaritans.org, or visit www.samaritans.org to find your nearest branch."

      "text": "Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week, has been admitted to hospital.\nTendulkar tweeted on Friday that he decided to go to a hospital in Mumbai \"as a matter of abundant precaution under medical advice\".\nThe former captain, who is loved by millions, added that he was hoping to be back home in a few days.\nSeveral Indian cities, including Mumbai, have seen a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in the past few weeks.\nTendulkar, 47, shared the news at a time when India is staring at what experts have called a \"deadlier second wave\".\nIndia reported 81,466 news cases and 469 deaths on Thursday - the highest daily spike since December.  \nThe country's Covid caseload had dropped sharply in January when it was reporting less than 15,000 cases daily. But cases began to spike again in March, largely driven by poor test-and-trace and lax safety protocols.\nMany of the new cases were reported in the western state of Maharashtra, where Tendulkar lives in the city of Mumbai.\nSince the pandemic began, India has confirmed more than 12.2 million cases and over 163,000 deaths. It has the third-highest number of infections in the world after the United States and Brazil - however, its number of deaths per capita is far lower. \nIndia has registered 118 deaths per million, compared to 1,487 in Brazil and 1,668 in the US.\nIndia launched its vaccination drive in January and so far more than 65 million doses have been administered. But experts say the pace needs to further pick up to halt the spread. \nSome have also attributed the uptick in numbers to a highly contagious variants of the coronavirus, but the government has denied this.\nThe surge in cases comes during what some experts have called a \"delicate phase\" of the pandemic for India.\nStates are now reintroducing restrictions to stem the spread of the virus.\nIn his tweet, Tendulkar thanked his fans for their wishes and prayers. \nHis fans and many of his former teammates have responded with prayers for his recovery.\nNicknamed the Master Blaster, Tendulkar retired from cricket in 2013 but continues to be one of the most popular public figures in India.\nHe recently took part in the Road Safety World Series Challenge, a veterans' tournament in the central Indian city of Raipur.\nHe made his international debut aged 16 in November 1989, setting off an illustrious 24-year career that earned him global recognition.\nIn that time, he amassed a record 15,921 Test-match runs, the highest number by any batsman in cricket history.\nIn 2012, Tendulkar became the only batsman ever to reach 100 international centuries.\nOne of his most memorable Test centuries was an unbeaten 103 that inspired India's victory over England in December 2008, and came shortly after terror attacks hit his home city of Mumbai."

      "text": "Nurses who were recruited from the Philippines to work in north Wales hospitals due to a nursing shortage have said they have \"no regrets\" as they mark their 20th year working in the region. \nAbout 100 nurses came in 2001 and took up positions across the three main hospitals.\nThe recruitment was seen at the time as a temporary measure and the nurses were given two-year contracts - but many stayed and built their lives in Wales.\nJoanne Canlas was 27 when she arrived as part of a cohort of 50 to take up a position at Wrexham Maelor hospital. \nShe said: \"We arrived in Heathrow in March time. The weather was freezing cold. I got used to it.\"\nShe started working in critical care where she still works as acting sister and it is where her husband, Emerson, also a Filipino, works. They met when living in neighbouring hospital accommodation, and now have two sons aged 15 and 13. \nShe said: \"They go to school, which they [learn] about the Welsh language, they are the ones teaching us.\n\"Initially I found it difficult to understand the British and Welsh language, and some slang words. But now I can even understand some Welsh words. \n\"I can say bore da [good morning] when I go on the ward, nos da [good night], diolch [thanks] and croeso [welcome]. People here are very kind and approachable.\"\nEmerson Canlas, 45, said Wrexham was a \"home away from home\" and although he loved Wales' castles and beaches, he missed the Philippines and it had been hard not to be able to travel there during the pandemic. \n\"It was very difficult me, for our parents especially, because there are five of us - all nurses - in our family,\" he added.\nThe couple both expressed how painful the past year has been for them, their colleagues and especially their patients. \n\"It was heartbreaking seeing them missing their loved ones, unable to sit at their bedside. We just had to hold their hands to let them feel they are not alone,\" Ms Canlas said.\n\"It was so painful to see friends and colleagues as a patient due to Covid - we managed to pull through.\"\nArniel Hernando, 50, arrived with the first group and started at Ysbyty Gwynedd as a critical care nurse.\nHe still works at the Bangor hospital as the lead surgical advanced nurse practitioner. His wife, also a nurse, took up a position in America, but he said for Filipinos, \"working abroad is the only way you can provide a good life for your family\".\nHe said: \"We are doing it for a purpose, we are doing it for our family. Nursing in the Philippines is not a very good income-generated job. I worked there a few years and would probably say the highest salary I got was \u00a3150 a month.\"\nHis children are both nurses and his 21-year-old son is due to join him in Gwynedd to take up a role at the hospital, once Covid travel restrictions allow. \nFilipino nurses were also recruited to Cardiff, Swansea and Pembrokeshire before the cohort came to north Wales in 2001.\nDirector of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales, Helen Whyley, said they were \"crucial\" to help the NHS in Wales address a shortage of nurses.\n\"We were experiencing a significant number of nursing vacancies, unfortunately we are experiencing something very similar now,\" she said.\n\"They very quickly became part of the nursing family... the NHS is founded on a multicultural work force. People from the Philippines fitted in very neatly and nicely. We are very grateful that they decided to stay.\"\nMs Canlas said she never regretted filling out her application to come to Wales and is very grateful to her team and the NHS.\n\"There's ups and downs over the years, nevertheless I am so glad that I did it, not only for myself but for my family back home. Also, I brought my own family up here.\"\nThe same is true for Mr Hernando.\nHe said: \"I went to London five years ago. I just wanted to try. But then I missed home, because this is probably my home, second home. I am happy to come back.\""

      "text": "Schools have been told that no singing can take place indoors when pupils return after the Easter break.\nThe instruction from Education Minister Peter Weir prohibits pupils singing individually or in choirs.\nHowever, pupils will be allowed to sing outside alone or in choirs as long as they are socially distanced.\nMr Weir said the decision had been taken on the advice of the chief medical officer and the Public Health Agency (PHA).\nPlaying wind instruments, such as recorders or flutes, and brass instruments, such as trumpets, is also banned indoors.\nThe guidance for childminders was also updated on 26 March and said that singing should not take place indoors. \nThere is a similar ban on indoor singing for registered group childcare settings. \nIn a letter to schools, Mr Weir said the decision would be \"kept under review\".\nSchool choirs in Northern Ireland had previously been permitted to sing indoors during the term from September to December 2020 as long as social distancing and good ventilation were in place.\nSinging is very popular in schools in Northern Ireland and a number of choirs have been successful in national competitions.\nSeparately, the Education Authority (EA) has told schools that face-to-face music tuition will not resume as planned after the Easter break.\n\"We have been instructed by the Public Health Agency (as of Tuesday 30th March) to delay the resumption of EA Music Service delivery in schools and music centres, which was due to re-commence during the week beginning Monday 12th April 2021,\" a letter from the EA music service to schools said.  \n\"This decision has been based on emerging data regarding the new Covid variant.\n\"This will be reviewed by the PHA on a weekly basis and we will update schools accordingly.\" \nOn Thursday, the Northern Ireland Executive confirmed that all pupils would return to school on Monday 12 April.\nIn his subsequent letter to schools on Thursday, Mr Weir also said discussions were taking place with the Department of Health on when breakfast clubs, education visits, inter-school sports and after school activities could resume.\n\"There are also further discussions to finalise plans for a swift resumption of extra-curricular managed outdoor sports training within schools,\" he said."

      "tags": "Companies,Contact tracing,Hospitality industry,Pubs,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "New rules to help pubs, cafes and restaurants reopen outdoors safely in England on 12 April have sparked anger from industry groups.\nAll customers will have to sign in on entry, not just one member of the group like before. It is also unclear whether payment at the bar will be permitted.\nUK Hospitality said it would burden struggling pubs and staff and risk customers deciding not to go out.\nThe government said it was providing as much flexibility as possible to venues.\nIt also said it had removed other unpopular requirements such as drinking curfews.\nUnder the new guidance, every customer aged 16 and over will have to check in to NHS test and trace before entering a venue, or give their contact details to staff.\nPubs and restaurants must take \"reasonable steps\" to stop people who won't comply from coming in, or they could face a \u00a31,000 fine.  \nCarl Ford, an accountant based in Tamworth, told the BBC he was frustrated and confused by the rules.\n\"I feel like it's almost like going back to school where I have to sign in and out,\" he said. \n\"I don't understand why I have to do this in a restaurant or pub, but I don't need to do this in a supermarket where you have a free for all. People don't have to sign in and they can pick up fruit with their hands.\"\nOthers were supportive of the idea, however, saying it could reduce transmission.\nIn a joint statement, UK Hospitality, the British Beer & Pub Association and the British Institute of Innkeeping said the rules would add \"more confusion and inconvenience for customers and staff\".\nThey also warned if indoors payments were not permitted from 12 April, then some pubs, particularly in rural areas with poor broadband, would be unable to take payments at all.\nWith the government also considering whether \"proof of immunity\" should be a requirement for entry, the groups warned that \"millions\" of people could be put off going to pubs and venues at a time when the hospitality industry is struggling.\n\"Pubs will already be trading at a loss when they reopen with all the existing restrictions and Covid-secure measures in place,\" they said. \n\"Adding further disproportionate and discriminatory measures threatens the very survival of thousands of businesses.\"\nHospitality businesses have been hit particularly hard by lockdown closures and restrictions. \nIn the year to February, 368,000 payroll jobs were lost in the accommodation and food service sectors. The next worst hit sector was retail where 123,000 jobs were lost.\nA government spokeswoman said: \"Public health rules are kept under constant review and we are providing as much flexibility for pubs and other hospitality businesses as possible. \n\"The roadmap [to reopening] set out that hospitality would open from step two, and removed any requirements for curfews or a substantial meal for customers.\"\nShe said no final decisions had been taken on whether Covid-status certification could play a role in reopening the economy.\nShe added that the government continued to support the hospitality sector through the pandemic with its new \u00a35bn Restart Grant scheme, the VAT cut, business rates relief, and by extending furlough."
