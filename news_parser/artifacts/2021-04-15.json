      "text": "A reclusive millionaire was \"completely in thrall\" to a live-in tenant who starved him to death to steal his fortune, a court has heard.\nAnthony Sootheran's body was found at his home, High Havens Farm, near South Newington, Oxfordshire, in March 2014.\nThe 59-year-old was \"controlled\" by Lynda Rickard, 62, who allowed his room to become a \"foul, unhygienic cell\", a prosecutor told Reading Crown Court.\nShe and her husband Wayne Rickard, 66, both from Banbury, deny murder.\nMrs Rickard admits forging wills in the names of both Mr Sootheran and his mother, Joy, as well as spending tens of thousands of pounds of their money, the jury has been told.\nOliver Saxby QC, prosecuting, said the millionaire apparently ate little food in the three weeks before his death.\nHe was \"virtually immobile\", allowing a large pressure sore to develop on his back, the prosecutor said.\nIn the view of a health expert, Mr Sootheran would have survived if he had been medically treated a week before his death, the jury heard.\nHe said a visitor in October 2013, Richard Stubbs, was \"horrified\" by Mr Sootheran's condition and the state of his room.\n\"The bed linen was stained and looked like it had not been changed in months. A window pane was broken. In the corner, there was a pile of Anthony's hair,\" Mr Saxby said. \n\"There was no television in the room. There were no books, or magazines. In short, it was a foul, unhygienic, cell.\"\nThe prosecutor said family members, Ian and Deborah Charles, met the millionaire in 2013 to discuss their suspicions about his mother's will.\nHe said: \"[Mrs Rickard] kept prompting Anthony with his answers - he seemed to be looking to her for his cue and, in Mrs Charles' eyes, was completely in her thrall.\"\nOther visitors were resisted or blocked by Mrs Rickard, who refused to give Mr Sootheran's daughter the code to the farm gates, the prosecutor said.\nThe victim died from a lung infection caused by malnutrition either on 18 March 2014 when his body was found or up to three days before, Mr Saxby added.\nHis forged will left the farm and a third of his \u00a33.5m estate to Mrs Rickard, the jury has been told.\nThe Rickards were denied probate, lost a court challenge over the will and were evicted from the farm in 2017, the court heard.\nAs alternatives to the murder charge, Mrs Rickard denies gross negligence manslaughter, while her husband denies causing or allowing the death of a vulnerable adult.\nThey both deny fraudulently using Ms Sootheran's money to buy a Mitsubishi Shogun car.\nThree of Mrs Rickard's friends, Shanda Robinson, 51, and Michael Dunkley, 49, from Banbury, and Denise Neal, 41, from Lower Tysoe, Warwickshire, deny fraudulently signing wills. However, another friend, June Alsford, 78, from Aynho, Northamptonshire, has admitted the charge.\nMr Rickard denies perverting the course of justice by attempting to pass off a will as genuine while Ms Robinson denies conspiring to do the same.\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "title": "Adam Toledo: Chicago police release video of officer shooting boy",
      "tags": "Chicago,US police killings,George Floyd death",
      "text": "Chicago police have released graphic footage of an officer shooting dead a 13-year-old boy in a dark alley.\nBodycam video shows the policeman shouting \"drop it\" before shooting Adam Toledo once in the chest on 29 March.\nThe boy does not appear to be holding a weapon in the split second he is shot, but police video shows a handgun near the spot where he falls.\nSmall protests were held on Thursday evening around Chicago, hours after the city's mayor appealed for calm. \nThe video's release follows the fatal police shooting on 11 April of Daunte Wright by an officer in a Minneapolis suburb. \nThat shooting has sparked violent protests as the city awaits the outcome of the trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer accused in the death of George Floyd.\nThe clip shows the officer jumping out of his squad car and chasing the Latino boy on foot down a dark alley as another suspect disappears from view. \nThe policeman shouts: \"Police! Stop! Stop right [expletive] now! Hands! Hands! Show me your [expletive] hands!\"\nThe boy turns and raises his hands. The officer shouts \"Drop it\" and fires his weapon - 19 seconds after exiting his squad car.\nSeparate CCTV footage appears to show the teenager throwing something through a gap in the fence as the officer runs up to him. Bodycam video shows officers shining a light on a handgun behind the wooden fence after the shooting.\nThe policeman calls for an ambulance while urging the fallen boy to \"stay awake\". Other officers arrive at the scene in the Little Village neighbourhood on the city's west side and CPR is performed.\nAccording to prosecutors, the teenager was with a 21-year-old man, Ruben Roman, who had just fired a gun at a passing car. The gunfire drew police to the area, resulting in the deadly confrontation. \nMr Roman appeared in court on Saturday charged with aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, reckless discharge of a firearm and child endangerment, according to local media reports. \nThe Civilian Office of Police Accountability released the bodycam footage on Thursday along with CCTV video, arrest reports and audio recordings of the shots fired in the area that alerted police.\nShortly before the video was released, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot held a press conference where she called the footage \"excruciating\" to watch.\n\"Simply put, we failed Adam,\" she said. \"And we cannot afford to fail one more young person in our city.\"\nMayor Lightfoot urged the public to remain peaceful.\n\"We live in a city that is traumatised by a long history of police violence and misconduct,\" the mayor said. \"So while we don't have enough information to be the judge and jury of this particular situation, it is certainly understandable why so many of our residents are feeling that all too familiar surge of outrage and pain.\"\nThe Toledo family also appealed for calm.\n\"We have heard reports in the media that more protests are planned today, and while we have no direct knowledge of such events, we pray that for the sake of our city, people remain peaceful to honour Adam's memory and work constructively to promote reform,\" they said in a statement. \nOn Thursday night, protestors called on Ms Lightfoot and the city's police superintendent David Brown to resign, alleging that authorities have dragged their feet in sharing information about the case and have not punished the officer involved.\nAt a news conference on Thursday, Toledo family lawyer Adeena Weiss Ortiz said the boy had not been holding a gun in the moment he was shot.\nBut she said they could not say with \"100% certainty\" whether the teenager had been carrying a weapon just beforehand, the Chicago Tribune reported.\nThe officer who fired the fatal shot, Eric Stillman, has not been officially accused of wrongdoing. He has been placed on administrative duty pending the outcome of an inquiry into whether he followed proper procedure on use of force.\nIn a statement, Mr Stillman's lawyer said there was \"irrefutable evidence\" his client had done the right thing because \"all prior attempts to deescalate and gain compliance with all of the officer's lawful orders had failed\".\nThe attorney added it was \"amazing and disheartening\" that nobody had asked about Mr Stillman's well-being after the incident.\nMr Stillman is a 34-year-old military veteran who joined the force in 2015. He has had four use of force reports and three complaints filed against him, according to the Invisible Institute, which publishes data about police misconduct in Chicago.\nThe Chicago-Sun Times reports that the Chicago Police Department has been on alert for potential retaliation against officers because the area where Adam Toledo was shot is a stronghold of the Latin Kings street gang.\nJohn Catanzara, president of the Chicago Police Union, alleged live on CNN that Toledo was a Latin Kings member and his shooting was \"100% justified\" and \"heroic\".\nAccording to a database compiled by the Washington Post Newspaper, 265 people have been killed by police so far this year in the US."

      "text": "Asda is to axe up to 1,200 jobs at its in-store bakeries as customers shun the traditional loaf in favour of speciality breads, bagels and pancakes.\nThe chain currently employs bakers who make bread in store from scratch.\nBut now it has said it plans to move to a central bakery and deliver pre-baked breads to its supermarkets.\n\"The current in-store bakery model has restricted our ability to respond to changing customer demands,\" said Derek Lawlor, Asda's head of merchandising.\nAs a result, he said, the supermarket chain had not been able to offer shoppers \"speciality products and freshly baked goods they want to buy throughout the day\".\nAsda said the change would mean it was able to bake fresh products several times a day, rather than once a day in store.\nIt will begin a formal consultation with its bakers and bakery managers.\n\"If the proposals are enacted, the priority will be to move as many colleagues as possible into alternative roles within Asda, with redundancy the last option,\" the supermarket chain said in a statement.\nThe move by Asda follows a similar decision by Tesco last year. \nUp to 1,800 were faced with the prospect of redundancy when Tesco said it would do less baking in store, citing a similar shift away from traditional loaves and bread.\nUntil last year, Asda was owned by US supermarket giant Walmart, but in December, it was sold to billionaire brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who bought it for \u00a36.8bn.\nHowever, the decision to scrap in-store bread ovens was taken independently of the Issa brothers, who are not allowed to exercise influence over the chain until the deal has been examined by the Competition and Markets Authority."

      "text": "The UK is to \"drawdown\" the number of troops in Afghanistan from next month, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said.\nConfirming the planned departure of forces, Mr Wallace also warned any attacks on existing troops would be \"met with a forceful response\".\nThe UK military has been in Afghanistan since 2001, with more than 450 British troops dying during the conflict with the Taliban and fighters from al-Qaeda.\nThe US has said it will withdraw all forces by 11 September.\nAnd Nato confirmed allies would begin withdrawing troops from 1 May.\nThe last UK combat troops left in 2014, but about 750 remain as part of the Nato mission to train Afghan forces.\nIn a statement, Mr Wallace said: \"The people of Afghanistan deserve a peaceful and stable future.\n\"As we drawdown, the security of our people currently serving in Afghanistan remains our priority and we have been clear that attacks on Allied troops will be met with a forceful response.\n\"The British public and our Armed Forces community, both serving and veterans, will have lasting memories of our time in Afghanistan.\n\"Most importantly we must remember those who paid the ultimate sacrifice, who will never be forgotten.\"\nUS President Joe Biden has announced that American troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September, saying it was \"time to end America's longest war\".\nThat would coincide with the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the US in 2001.\nMr Biden said while the US \"will not stay involved in Afghanistan militarily\", its \"diplomatic and humanitarian work\" would continue.\n\"We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create the ideal conditions for our withdrawal, expecting a different result,\" he said.\nUS Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, speaking to Nato allies in Brussels, said: \"I am here to work closely with our allies, with the (Nato) secretary general, on the principle that we have established from the start: In together, adapt together and out together.\"\nHe added that they would work closely in the coming months \"on a safe, deliberate and co-ordinated withdrawal of our forces from Afghanistan\".\nThe new deadline is four months later than the Trump administration previously agreed in a deal with the Taliban. \nOur defence correspondent Jonathan Beale says the UK, like most Nato allies, relies on the US's infrastructure, logistics and support in Afghanistan.\nThe US has some 2,500 troops in the country as part of a 9,600-strong Nato mission.\nAt the height of the war, Nato had more than 130,000 troops from 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had 9,500 personnel and 137 bases in Helmand province alone.\nThe speaker of the Afghan parliament, Mir Rahman Rahmani, has warned the withdrawal of foreign forces in the current circumstances will lead to civil war.\nIn February 2020, the US and the Taliban agreed a deal that would see the US and Nato allies withdraw all troops within 14 months if the Taliban upheld its promises, including not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks.\nAlthough the group stopped attacks on international forces as part of the agreement, it has continued to fight the Afghan government.\nLast month, the Taliban threatened to resume hostilities against foreign troops still in the country on 1 May."

      "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh's four children will walk alongside his coffin at his funeral on Saturday.\nPrinces Charles, Andrew, Edward and Princess Anne, as well as grandsons Princes William and Harry, will follow a Land Rover hearse in a procession to St George's Chapel, Windsor.\nThe guest list for the service includes 30 people, with three German relatives.\nThose attending will wear morning coats with medals, or day dress, but not military uniform.\nThe congregation will put on masks and socially distance in line with Covid lockdown rules, with the Queen seated alone.\nThe details of Prince Philip's ceremonial royal funeral at the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle at 15:00 BST were released by Buckingham Palace.\nA Palace spokesman said the plans have been modified to take into account current public health guidelines, but the ceremonial aspects of the day and the service remain in line with the duke's wishes.\nHe said the service will be a reflection of Prince Philip's military affiliations and personal elements of his life.\nThe other guests include the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cambridge, all of the duke's grandchildren and their spouses, the children of the Queen's sister Princess Margaret, and Bernhard, the Hereditary Prince of Baden; Donatus, Prince and Landgrave of Hesse; and Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.\nThe Countess Mountbatten of Burma, previously known as Lady Romsey and later Lady Brabourne, who was Philip's carriage driving partner and one of his closest friends will also be in attendance.\nThe 67-year-old countess is the wife of Earl Mountbatten, Norton Knatchbull - the grandson of Prince Philip's uncle the 1st Earl Mountbatten, who was killed by the IRA in 1979.\nBuckingham Palace said the Queen faced \"some very difficult\" decisions in selecting the guests permitted under Covid rules, from original plans for a 800-strong congregation, adding she wanted all branches of her husband's family to be represented.\nBy Daniela Relph, royal correspondent\nThis is the funeral the Duke of Edinburgh wanted for himself.\nThe guests, the music, the military representation are exactly what the duke requested for his own farewell. The one element he perhaps didn't account for was the family tension.\nThe Queen has decided that there will be no military uniforms worn by members of the Royal Family on Saturday.\nThis neatly avoids the Prince Harry and Prince Andrew problem. Both have stepped back from their military patronages and the issue of them wearing uniform was a dilemma that has now gone away.\nThe order of the funeral procession has revealed that the duke's grandsons, Prince William and Prince Harry, will not walk alongside one another. Instead, their cousin Peter Philips will walk between them.\nBuckingham Palace won't comment on this decision. Responding to questions from reporters, a spokesman said they would not be drawn into discussing \"perceptions of drama\". \nOf the tributes paid to Prince Philip over recent days, Buckingham Palace said the Queen and the family had been touched at the testimony around \"the remarkable life and lasting endeavours of the Duke of Edinburgh\".\nPrince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday 9 April aged 99. His body is now resting in the private chapel at the castle.\nOn the day of the funeral, the coffin will be moved to the State Entrance of Windsor Castle. It will be placed on the modified Jaguar Land Rover, that the duke himself helped design, to be carried the short distance to St George's Chapel.\nThe procession to the chapel will be headed by the Band of the Grenadier Guards, followed by the the Major General's party and military service chiefs.\nMembers of the Royal Family will walk behind the coffin. Princess Anne and Prince Charles will walk in the front row, followed by Prince Edward and Prince Andrew. \nIn the third row, the Duke of Cambridge and Duke of Sussex will be either side of their cousin Peter Philips. \nVice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence and the Earl of Snowdon will be in the next row, trailed by members of the duke's household staff. \nThe Queen will travel with a lady-in-waiting in the state Bentley at the end of the procession, and enter the chapel by a side door.\nThe duke's association with the Royal Navy will be reflected at the service, with buglers of the Royal Marines sounding Action Stations - a signal that all hands should be ready for battle - during the service.\nA reduced choir of four singers will feature but the congregation will follow Covid rules and not sing.\nThe funeral will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, with the Archbishop of Canterbury pronouncing the blessing.\nThe full order of service will be released on Friday evening.\nRead more: Who is going to Prince Philip's funeral?\nThe Duke of Edinburgh personally selected the regalia that will be on the altar for his funeral.\nIt is made up of the medals and decorations conferred on him by UK and Commonwealth countries - together with his Royal Air Force wings and Field Marshal's baton, and insignia from Denmark and Greece, highlighting his birth heritage as a prince of Greece and Denmark.\nHRH The Duke of Edinburgh Remembered: BBC One, Friday 16 April, 19:00-20:05\nThe Funeral of HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh: BBC One, Saturday 17 April, 12:30-16:20 and 20:10-21:10\nThe funeral will also be broadcast on Saturday 17 April from 14:00-16:10 on Radio 4 and Radio 5 Live, BBC World Service English, BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Radio Ulster. \nIt will also be broadcast on BBC Radio Wales and BBC local radio with some variation in start times."

      "tags": "Winchcombe",
      "text": "A rare, undiagnosed medical condition left a woman in \"excruciating\" pain for 16 months before an emergency operation saved her life. \nRebecca Bostock began to experience stomach swelling and had problems keeping down food in January 2020.\nThe mystery complaint was eventually found to be Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome (SMAS) when she was rushed into hospital on Good Friday this year.\n\"I don't want anyone to go through what I went through,\" she said. \nMs Bostock, 32, underwent the emergency operation at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where nurses told her they had only treated three cases of SMAS in 27 years, and that the condition affects fewer than 1% of the population.\nShe was told that if she had not been rushed into hospital for treatment on that day, then she may not have survived. \n\"My stomach was swollen so much that I couldn't breathe, I was being sick and couldn't keep any medication down,\" she said.\n\"I was on a downward spiral. They took me into imaging and diagnosed SMAS and I was taken away for the operation.\n\"They said I needed the operation straight away or I wouldn't survive even a couple more hours,\" she said.\nBefore the operation, Ms Bostock, from Winchcombe, said she had been in pain for 16 months, with stomach swelling, fever, sickness, diarrhoea and dizziness. She also lost almost three stone in weight.\nShe visited GPs and the emergency department several times but was told the pain was likely to be caused by endometriosis or irritable bowel syndrome.\n\"I was referred to a gynaecologist around the time of the first lockdown but everything shut down and I didn't see one for months.\n\"I was advised to change my diet, which seemed to help at first, but then the symptoms deteriorated again to the point where I struggled to walk and couldn't breathe.\"\nSMAS is a condition affecting the digestive system, which occurs when part of the small intestine is compressed between two arteries, causing a partial or complete blockage. \nThe operation involved releasing the blockage to open the pathway, or \"re-plumbing\" the stomach as Ms Bostock was told by her surgeon. \nShe is still unable to eat solid foods but hopes to introduce them to her diet soon and wants to raise awareness of the rare condition so that others can learn to spot the signs earlier.\n\"I want to tell my story to raise awareness I feel blessed and relieved,\" she said. \n\"I'm so thankful to the doctors and nurses who saved my life. I get so emotional thinking about it and I can't thank them enough.\n\"It is so rare and even doctors don't know about it, so helping people to spot the signs and be able to rule it out is so important.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Milford Haven,Greenhouse gas emissions,Swansea University,Wales business,Carbon dioxide,Clydach,Environment,Carbon footprint,Carbon neutrality",
      "text": "Major industries across south Wales have joined forces to work out how to slash their carbon emissions over the next 20 years.\nIt is a \"massive challenge\" that could protect tens of thousands of jobs while creating many more, they say.\nThe region is currently the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases from industry in the UK.\nHopes of ending Wales' contribution to global warming by 2050 will partly rely on this effort.\nSteelworks, oil refining, cement and chemical firms are among those working alongside energy companies, ports, universities and local councils on the \u00a340m project to create a \"roadmap to net zero\" carbon emissions for industry in south Wales.\nIt will allow them to see where resources and infrastructure are needed for businesses to transition to a greener way of working.\nWALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nIt is likely to lead to more renewable electricity generation and a surge in production of clean hydrogen fuel.\nThat will have a knock-on effect for homeowners, who could then also be linked up to hydrogen supplies and start using it for heating.\nEngineering studies will also focus on developing carbon capture technologies at sites where it is considered impossible to completely stop generating CO2.\nThe project's organisers suggested this could eventually result in the UK's first CO2 shipping industry, with boats transporting the gas from the region's ports to be buried underground in the North Sea.\nAs much as it is about helping fight climate change, this hugely complex rewiring of heavy industry is vital if it is to survive.\nThe companies involved in the South Wales Industrial Cluster project (SWIC) employ a combined workforce of more than 100,000 people.\nOther parts of the UK are also ploughing ahead with decarbonisation plans and the fear is firms could decide to relocate.\nChris Williams, head of industrial decarbonisation for Industry Wales and the SWIC project's lead, said its impact could be \"huge\".\n\"It's so important for us in south Wales to try and maintain our industries and accelerate as quickly as we can down the decarbonisation route,\" he said.\n\"If we're not developing the net-zero infrastructure that these industries are going to need then the risk is we will lose them to the regions that are.\"\nEach business faced its own options and challenges for cutting emissions, he said, and this was largely down to where they were located and the resources available nearby.\n\"By working as a group we have the ability to more easily help define the regional infrastructure to make sure it can provide what each individual industry needs to decarbonise.\"\nMapping out opportunities for more clean power sources using offshore wind, wave and tidal schemes, is one part of the plan.\nExcess electricity could then also be used to produce hydrogen fuel for zero-emission heating and transport.\nMilford Haven in Pembrokeshire is seen as a potential \"hydrogen gateway\" for the UK, while another \"hydrogen hub\" is already being set up on Anglesey, attached to marine energy projects there.\nJessica Hooper, programme manager at Marine Energy Wales, said sustainable energy projects could be driven forward quickly if demand from industry was linked up with the renewable energy potential in the Atlantic, reducing reliance on imports of oil and gas.\n\"Wind, wave and tidal really represent an incredible opportunity for sustainable decarbonisation - turning our heavy industry into pathfinder projects that could act as an exemplar for the world,\" she said.\nOnce hydrogen is being supplied to large industries, nearby homes could be the first to switch to the cleaner fuel too, explained Sarah Williams, director of regulation at Wales & West Utilities, which is in charge of the region's gas network.\nA total of 85% of homes currently use natural gas - which creates carbon emissions - for heating and hot water.\n\"The really great thing is that if we can deliver hydrogen to industry then we can actually start thinking about getting it to customers' homes too,\" she said, adding that there were \"a really exciting couple of decades ahead\".\nMeanwhile, at the Vale nickel refinery in Clydach, a pilot project with Swansea University is already under way to try and turn the carbon dioxide produced by the plant into useful products - such as colourings for sweets, medicine tablets and make-up. \nLines of 8ft-long (2.5m) tubes, filled with water, have been set up in polytunnels on site.  \nWaste CO2, that would otherwise be emitted by the refinery, will be pumped through them to grow various types of microalgae that can then be turned into high-value pigments and proteins.\n\"It's a really good example of industrial symbiosis,\" said Andrew Price, from consultancy firm CR Plus which is co-ordinating the planning stage of the SWIC project.\n\"Throughout the plan we'll be developing two real outcomes - how do these sites decarbonise to the fullest extent under their current economic restrictions, and then how do we develop the infrastructure to support the mopping up of residual CO2.\n\"It's an absolutely massive challenge and one that nobody has done before.\n\"But I think it's one we can rise to by leaning on the experience of all the different sectors.\"\nThe project has received match funding from the UK government's Industrial Decarbonisation Challenge fund - and will be expected to report its plan of action within three years.\nSimilar clusters have been set up in Merseyside, Teesside, Humberside, Southampton and Grangemouth in Scotland.\nSouth Wales' industries and energy generators currently produce about 16 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year, placing the area in second place behind Humberside in terms of UK regions with the highest emissions from industry.\nBoth the UK and Welsh governments have committed to legally binding net-zero targets by 2050 - effectively a 100% cut in CO2 emissions."

      "text": "The humanitarian crisis caused by volcanic eruptions on the Caribbean island of St Vincent will last for months, a UN official has warned.\nDidier Trebucq said nearby islands including Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda could also be badly affected.\nHe said the UN was setting up an international funding appeal.\nAbout 20,000 people have been evacuated from their homes since La Soufri\u00e8re volcano began erupting last Friday.\nIt had not previously erupted since 1979.\nMr Trebucq, the UN co-ordinator for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, said clouds of ash and smoke were continuing to pour from the volcano every day.  \n\"We are expecting that continuous explosions and ash fall will continue over the coming weeks in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, but also in neighbouring islands such as Barbados, which has also been severely affected... as well as Saint Lucia and Grenada,\" he told reporters.\nHe described the situation as \"a crisis that will require a humanitarian response but also a response in terms of rehabilitation\".\n\"This is a crisis that is going to last certainly more than six months in the sub-region, in Saint Vincent, and other islands,\" he said. \nThe UN says about 4,000 of those displaced are now living in 87 shelters - many of which lack basic services such as drinking water. Others have moved in with family or friends and some have taken boats to neighbouring islands.  \nMr Trebucq said water provision was the main priority for aid teams, followed by shelter.\n\"The clean-up of the ashes, finally, is another important priority, in terms of environmental health but also clean-up to make sure that life can come back to normal outside the red zone as soon as possible,\" he added.\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said that despite the dangers many residents were choosing to stay on the island rather than be evacuated by ship.\n\"There are some people who want to go to different countries but it is not a large number,\" he told a TV programme in Grenada.\n\"They said they want to stay at home. I have been around several of the camps and that's the message.\" \nThe volcano had been dormant for decades, but in late 2020 it started rumbling and then began spewing steam and smoke.\nThe first sign that an eruption was imminent came last Thursday evening, when a lava dome became visible on La Soufri\u00e8re.\nJust before 09:00 on Friday (13:00 GMT), seismologists from the University of the West Indies confirmed that an \"explosive eruption\" was under way."

She told the BBC they had just hours to leave before La Soufriere erupted on Friday.\n\"We felt tremors in the days leading up to the eruption but we were not told to evacuate until the last minute. \n\"We were frantic when we heard the call to leave. We had to gather our things so quickly,\" she said.\nShellisa said it was painful to leave the home she shared with her mother, sister, her sister's partner and their two-year-old child.\n\"We were all scrambling to get our belongings together and we could feel the heat. It was heart wrenching and overwhelming to just leave our home like that, leaving behind so many memories. \n\"We've had hurricanes before but nothing like this.\"\nShellisa says they were lucky that they were able to leave the red zone in their truck. Many others did not have any transportation.\n\"When we finally got the truck going we passed many people on the narrow roads, who like us were leaving, but on foot and carrying what they could. It was so sad and depressing to see.\n\"We were on the road all night until we reached the south. I don't know how many people made it out.\"\nShellisa and her family are now living with a family friend in the south of the island in Campden Park. She says this is their home for now.\n\"We don't know if we can go home. We don't know if there's a home to go back to.\n\"We are planning to stay here for at least a few months. We just don't know yet the extent of the damage. It's very sad.\"\nOn the island's green zone away from the La Soufriere volcano Shanniel Johnson lives with her extended family. \nShe told the BBC despite living in the safer' green zone the ash from the eruption caused massive devastation which has only just improved somewhat thanks to the rain.\n\"Roofs caved in on homes because of the heavy ash fall. It's been dark for a few days and there have been more eruptions since Friday,\" she told the BBC.\nShanniel says the ash carpeting the island had left them without water to drink, cook or wash.\n\"The ash contaminated the water but thankfully it has rained recently so the ash is clearing in some areas.\n\"But we need humanitarian aid. A lot of people have been displaced and are in shelters.\"\n\"Many of my family members live in red zones in the north of the island and I've been helping them to move down south where I live,\" Jomo Thomas told the BBC.\n\"It's an horrific scene - since Friday there has been a series of eruptions,\" the lawyer explained.\n\"About four or five thousand are in shelters. But the problem is that many of the shelters are schools and because they are in the tropics there is a lot of ventilation, so the dust can easily come through.\"\nMany of those who can are trying to leave the island.\nRhiannon West and her family are British nationals, living on the island under temporary residency rules.\nThe teacher hopes to return to the UK with her partner and six-month-old baby.\n\"We stood outside our home on Saturday and watched as the volcano erupted and a huge billowing cloud of ash was sent into the air. It was incredible but also terrifying.\n\"Since then we've been sheltering indoors with everything closed. \n\"It's scary thinking about what we can do to protect the baby\n\"We keep losing electricity, have no water supply and no bottled water left at the closest shops.\"\n\"This could go on for weeks and neither of us can work because of the power supply issues.\n\"The atmosphere is just very eerie.\""

      "text": "Government departments have been ordered to find out by the end of the week whether senior officials have rule-breaking second jobs.\nCabinet Secretary Simon Case has asked colleagues to declare paid roles or outside interests that \"might conflict\" with Civil Service rules.\nThe move comes after it emerged a top official joined a financial firm while still working for the government. \nBill Crothers says his recruitment by Greensill Capital was \"transparent\". \nLetters to an appointments watchdog published on Tuesday revealed his part-time role as an adviser at the firm had been signed off by the Cabinet Office.\nBut Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs on Wednesday it was \"not clear\" that \"boundaries have been properly understood\".\nLabour has described Mr Crothers' dual employment, which happened in 2015, as \"extraordinary and shocking\".\nMr Crothers had been the government's chief procurement officer prior to being taken on by Greensill, which has since collapsed.\nRevelations about the firm's attempts to influence government have led to Mr Johnson launching a lawyer-led review into its access to ministers and civil servants.\nLabour argues a special House of Commons committee should investigate instead - but the government rejects this, and voted down the plan on Wednesday. \nIn a letter to senior officials, seen by the BBC, Mr Case - the UK's top civil servant - said there were issues of \"acute concern\" over recruitment.\nHe said the need to give civil servants the chance to gain experience life outside Whitehall has been \"recognised for many decades by successive governments\".\n\"But this must only be done in a way which can maintain the integrity and impartiality of the Civil Service,\" he wrote. \nHe added: \"In particular, there needs to be transparency and full and proper management of any outside interests.\"\nMr Case ordered colleagues to declare by the end of the week if they \"come across\" instances of senior civil servants with second jobs or outside interests \"which might conflict with their obligations under the [Civil Service] Code\".\nThis sets outs the rules on \"honesty\", \"integrity\", \"objectivity\" and \"impartiality\".\nMr Crothers joined Greensill as an adviser to its board in September 2015, while he remained a Civil Service employee. \nLetters to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) watchdog published on Tuesday show the move was approved by the Cabinet Office under its internal conflicts of interest policy.\nMr Crothers later went on to join the company as a director in late 2016, after leaving government in November 2015.\nIn a letter to Acoba's chairman, Lord Pickles, Mr Crothers wrote: \"I am concerned that there may be a view that I did not follow proper process regarding my role with Greensill Capital.\n\"I assure you that I completely respect the required process and your office, took steps to comply, and believe that I did so.\"\nHe adds: \"I was transparent about the move to Greensill Capital, and it was well known at the time.\"\nBut in a letter to the current head of the Cabinet Office, Lord Pickles said there had been a \"lack of transparency\" about the process - and called for more details. \nConcerns about Greensill's access to government were sparked by revelations last month that former Prime Minister David Cameron had lobbied on behalf of the company after leaving office.\nHis efforts involved texting Chancellor Rishi Sunak and contacting other ministers about a government-backed Covid loan scheme on behalf of the firm. \nAlong with the company's founder, Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron also met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a \"private drink\" in 2019 to discuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff.\nThe former prime minister began working as an adviser to the company in August 2018, two years after leaving Downing Street in July 2016.\nMr Cameron has said he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying, and welcomes the government's review. \nOn Wednesday, the Commons Treasury select committee said it planned to launch an inquiry into the \"lessons\" from Greensill Capital's demise.\nOther parliamentary committees are reportedly considering bids to invite the former prime minister to give evidence. \nA spokesman for Mr Cameron said he would \"respond positively\" to such requests \"when the terms of reference of each inquiry are clear\".

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nLatest figures show the number of people waiting for routine operations in England in February reached 4.7 million - the highest total since current records began 14 years ago. Nearly 388,000 people were waiting more than a year for non-urgent surgery, compared with just 1,600 before the pandemic began. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the government will ensure the NHS in England has the funds it needs to address the backlog.\nHospitality businesses in Northern Ireland will be allowed to open earlier than initially proposed, after new indicative dates were agreed by ministers. Unlicensed and licensed premises such as restaurants, beer gardens, coffee shops and cafes can open outdoors on 30 April. Indoor hospitality venues are then set to reopen on 24 May. Proposed dates leaked to the media earlier had suggested outdoor hospitality would have to wait until 10 May, with indoor venues not reopening before 1 June. \nBenefit Cosmetics has backtracked on a policy that reportedly saw NHS workers turned away for beauty treatments because of their contact with people with coronavirus. A nurse posted on Facebook about being refused treatment, which prompted a backlash on social media. Responding to the post, the beauty brand said it was a \"blanket policy\" to refuse service to anyone who has been in contact \"with anyone suspected of Covid or having its symptoms\". But it has now announced it is changing its policy and will allow NHS workers to receive treatments if they were wearing medical grade PPE when in contact with Covid patients.\nIndia has registered a daily total of more than 200,000 new coronavirus cases for the first time, as it suffers a huge surge in cases and deaths with figures doubling in the past 10 days. Some parts of the country have begun imposing restrictions, including Mumbai and the western state of Maharashtra. However, huge crowds have continued to participate in the Kumbh Mela religious festival, where hundreds of devotees, including nine top saints, tested positive for Covid-19.\nWith lockdown restrictions easing, visits to care homes are now possible for families. Eileen Fuller, who lives in a care home near Sittingbourne, Kent, has not seen the two youngest members of her family for over a year.

      "text": "A 23-year-old woman who begged doctors to remove her womb to relieve chronic pain says the surgery is being refused due to her age and childless status.\nHannah Lockhart has endometriosis, a condition that can cause debilitating pain, heavy periods and infertility.\nAlthough she has always wanted her own children, Hannah says her daily pain is now so severe she wants a hysterectomy.\n\"It's heartbreaking that just because I'm so young I have to keep suffering,\" she told the BBC's Evening Extra.\nMs Lockhart, from Bangor in County Down, has been in hospital seven times in the past year because of crippling pain from endometriosis.\n\"Every single day I'm taking morphine, I'm taking different tablets for nerves to try and stop the pain and nothing works,\" she said.\nThe condition occurs when bodily tissue similar to the lining of the womb starts to grow in other parts of the body.\nMs Lockhart's problems began in her early teens. By the end of last year she was having difficulty walking and had to use a wheelchair just to be able to leave her house.\n\"This is far, far more than a sore, heavy period every month - it has damaged several different areas of my body now,\" she said.\nComplications from the disease mean she needs a urinary catheter to go to the toilet and, after emergency surgery last summer, she is already going through the menopause.\n\"Endometriosis affects a lot more than just your ovaries and your womb,\" she said.\n\"Mine has spread to my bowel, it's right through to my back and it has also completely damaged my bladder to the point that I can no longer use the bathroom myself.\"\nMs Lockhart is engaged to be married and she and her husband-to-be had been looking forward to starting a family in a few years' time.\nHowever, the severity of her recent symptoms led to Hannah \"pleading\" with doctors for a hysterectomy.\n\"Last June after I had the surgery, I was put into early menopause so that's something that I've been going through... and I will go through for at least another year now.\n\"Being in menopause at 23 - it's not very nice at all.\n\"I have to take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) every day to try and calm down my symptoms that come with it.\"\nAt first she found the prospect of infertility more of a struggle than coping with her physical pain, but the couple have since made inquiries about adoption.\n\"I don't think I will ever get over the fact that I won't have my own children naturally - that's hard to come to terms with.\n\"But at the end of the day I know that it's not giving birth to a child that makes you a mum - it's the love and the life that you provide for that child that makes you a mother.\n\"So I hold on to that and the hope that some day I'll be able to give that child a loving home.\"\nMs Lockhart's father, Peter, agrees with her belief that doctors' reluctance to perform a hysterectomy is due to her young age and the fact she is childless.\n\"Had she been an older woman who already had children, not a problem - they can deal with it in a more aggressive manner,\" he said.\nHe said it was \"very, very difficult\" to witness his daughter in such pain and has called on medics to treat her as an individual, rather than making decisions solely based on her age.\n\"How I see it is: If I'm in this much pain, what use am I to any child as a mother?\" said Ms Lockhart.\n\"I couldn't pick my child up, I couldn't do what a mother is supposed to do.\n\"So I need them to do whatever it takes to make me better in order for me to be able to be a mother to a child in later years.\"\nBBC News NI has contacted Ms Lockhart's health trust for a response to the issues she raised."

Sotheby's, a global auction house, held its first ever sale dedicated entirely to sneakers in 2019.\nBrahm Wachter, head of streetwear and modern collectibles at Sotheby's, said in a statement that the shoes were \"critical to the development of the Yeezy franchise, which became one of the most important sneaker and lifestyle brands in history\".\nThe sneakers are a US size 12, or a UK 11 - West's shoe size.\nThe seven-figure estimate for the Yeezys beats the previous record sale price for sneakers - a pair of 1985 Nike Air Jordan 1s, which were sold by Christie's last year for $615,000 (\u00a3446,000).\nHowever, there are no records for shoes that have been bought privately. \nIt is believed that the most expensive sneakers ever created were designed by Bicion and Mache Custom Kicks in 2016. The shoes, which are embellished with diamonds and sapphires, were estimated at $4 million.\nThe Yeezys are being sold as part of a private sale, which means neither the buyer nor the final sale price will be publicised unless the buyer themselves comes forward.\nThe sneaker range was developed with Nike between 2007 and 2009. This was the first time Nike had collaborated with someone who wasn't an athlete.\nWest wore the Prototypes during an emotional performance of Stronger and Hey Mama at the Grammys in 2008, just a few months after the death of his mother. \nThe Air Yeezy 1 was then launched in a limited series in 2009, followed by the Air Yeezy 2 in 2012.\nBut in 2013 West ended his partnership with Nike, saying that his share of the revenue from the shoes was insufficient. The following year, he began working with Adidas.\nPartnering with Adidas proved to be a lucrative decision. The collaboration generated almost $1.7 billion in 2020, Forbes and Bloomberg report."

      "tags": "Retailing,Coronavirus pandemic,UK High Streets",
      "text": "People should call and check before they drop off donations at charity shops, a trade association has warned. \nThere are fears the pent-up demand to donate after lockdown could lead to overcrowding in shops, the Charity Retail Association said.\nChief executive Robin Osterley said \"we have two asks of the generous public\".\n\"Be thoughtful - is this stuff you'd be prepared to buy yourself? And the second is to contact the shop before you roll up with armfuls of goods.\" \nThe Salvation Army made record sales on Monday, after non-essential shops reopened in England and Wales. \nMeanwhile Oxfam reported a 77% increase in sales compared with 2019, and Cancer Research UK took half a million pounds - more than double what it was expecting. \nBut the same big names are encouraging would-be donors to phone and book a slot to drop.\nManaging donations has been a Covid learning curve for the sector, as lockdowns have prompted mass clear-outs of unwanted goods.\nHowever, charity shops are better prepared this time, Mr Osterley said. Take for example Stockport hospice charity, Beechwood Cancer Care. There's been a queue of customers at its Heald Green precinct. But it is only open to shoppers, not droppers, this week.  \nIts manager, Sara Tilston, said it had been really busy: \"Yesterday was brilliant, we loved it.\n\"People have really struggled for money this year and being able to get extra supplies a lot cheaper is important.\" \nShe was turning away donations this week, but said that from next week she would accept donations on Tuesdays and Fridays, from the back door. \"We want to use up to the donations that we've collected through lockdown.\" \nThere's extra pressure on these volunteer-run services to be safe and compliant. \nIn all the fanfare of the 12 April reopening in England, the return of the humble charity shop was anticipated for a variety of reasons. \nThe stores offer valuable employment and volunteering experience to thousands of people, many of whom are likely to be vulnerable or isolated otherwise. \nSecond-hand fashion has gained a big following among the environmentally conscious - as well as bargain hunters. \nMoreover, for many making a purchase, this is a need not a desire. The pandemic has nudged 3.5 million more people into financial dire straits. \nBut lockdown has also given many of us yet another chance to have a good old clear out. \nTake Susanne Burwell, in Hull, who has a haul of good quality items that stretches across her dining table and all over her sofa. \n\"I've got a suitcase full of clothes and all my shoes ready to go,\" she told the BBC. She also has a range of sporting items to pass on - a wetsuit, a bike and badminton rackets.\n\"It's become a weight on my mind. I just want to have the space again, but I am quite excited that things might get another life.\" \nHowever, she said she wouldn't be taking them to the charity shop this time. \n\"I remember last time it was 'please don't bring us any more stuff, we don't have room for it'. I've heard charity shops are quite full again, so I'm booking a car boot.\" \nAlthough it has got more difficult to donate, with set days and queues to hand on unwanted items, Robin Osterley said most people were still willing to wait to give their things away, rather than sell them.\nHe said there had been a steady stream of donations this week already. He simply wishes his members could have stayed open throughout lockdown, like supermarkets.\n\"People have been sitting on piles of clothes for a long time, and we are grateful they have been doing that.\n\"For us it's been more frustrating to be classed as non-essential retail. We feel we are very much essential.\" \nHis organisation is keen to stress the contribution charity shops make to UK life, listing their presence on struggling high streets, the volunteering skills people can earn, as well as the cash boost to hundreds of good causes. \nLast year, a government committee warned that the funding gap left by closing charity shops would create irreparable damage to the sector.  \nIts survival will rely on the support of shoppers and droppers alike.  \nMs Tilson, in Stockport, said charity shops weren't just about donations and bargains: \"We also help those who want to come out for a chat, just to see us.\n\"It was so good to see regular customers when we opened. Who needs Primark anyway?\""

      "tags": "US election 2020,Russia,Cyber-attacks,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The US has announced sanctions against Russia in response to what it says are cyber-attacks and other hostile acts.\nThe measures, which target\u00a0dozens of Russian entities and officials, aim to deter \"Russia's harmful foreign activities\", the White House said.\nThe statement says Russian intelligence was behind last year's massive \"SolarWinds\" hack, and accuses Moscow of interference in the 2020 election.\nRussia denies all the allegations and says it will respond in kind.\nThe sanctions announced on Thursday are detailed in an executive order signed by President Joe Biden. They come at a tense time for relations between the two countries. \nLast month the US targeted seven Russian officials and more than a dozen government entities over the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Russia says it was not involved.\nIn a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, Mr Biden vowed to defend US national interests \"firmly\", while proposing a meeting with Mr Putin to find areas where the two countries could work together.\nOn Thursday, Mr Biden described his decision to impose sanctions on Russia as \"proportionate\". \n\"I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so,\" Mr Biden told reporters. \"The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia.\"\nHe added that the way forwards is through \"thoughtful dialogue and diplomatic process\". \nA statement from the White House said the new sanctions show the US \"will impose costs in a strategic and economically impactful manner on Russia\" if it continues its \"destabilising international action\".\nIt reaffirms the administration's view that the Russian government is behind cyber-attacks and has been trying to \"undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections\" in the US and allied nations.\nIt specifically blames Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR, for the SolarWinds attack, which gave cyber-criminals potential access to 18,000 government and private computer networks. \nLast December, then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he believed Russia was behind it.\nThe latest sanctions target 32 entities and officials accused of trying to influence the 2020 US presidential election \"and other acts of disinformation\".\nTen diplomats are being expelled. The executive order also bars US financial institutions from purchasing rouble-denominated bonds from June.\nThe Biden administration is trying to tread a careful line. US officials want to impose costs for a range of unacceptable behaviour from Moscow and deter further acts. They also want to signal they are going to take a tougher line than the Trump administration. But they also say they do not want to see a downward spiral in relations. The message they have is that their response is \"resolute but proportionate\".\nThe SolarWinds cyber-espionage campaign was a primary concern. To maximise the impact they have combined response to this with sanctions over election interference and other issues.\nDiplomatic expulsions and sanctions against individuals will largely be shrugged off by Moscow as expected. The financial sanctions regarding Russian sovereign debt are a step-up though.\nThe US has also published a huge amount of detail about Russian intelligence activities ranging from front companies involved in spreading disinformation to Russian tech companies allegedly supporting its intelligence services. \nThe hope will be that this also makes it harder for the Russians to operate. But past experience suggests all of this is unlikely to deter the Kremlin. \nThe White House meanwhile acknowledged there was little evidence to support claims that Russia had offered bounties to Taliban militants for killing American soldiers.\nThe intelligence assessment was first reported last June by the New York Times, and was cited by Mr Biden on the campaign trial last year to accuse then-President Donald Trump of not standing up to Russia. Mr Trump at the time called it \"fake news\".\nOn Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the intelligence community had determined it had only \"low to moderate confidence\" in the claims, which are said to have come from interrogations of Afghan detainees.\nShortly after the sanctions were announced, Russia's foreign ministry called them \"hostile steps which dangerously raise the temperature of confrontation\".\n\"Such aggressive conduct will of course get a decisive response,\" the statement added.  \nThe US ambassador has been called to the foreign ministry.\nThe EU, Nato and the UK have all issued statements in support of the US measures.\nIn his first foreign policy speech in February, Mr Biden vowed to stand up to Russia. \"The days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions\u2026 are over,\" he said.\nThe Obama-Biden administration was accused of standing by while Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. \nBut in recent days Mr Biden has warned the Kremlin against aggressive actions in Ukraine. Russia is beefing up its military presence in the border area.\nMr Biden's predecessor rarely criticised Mr Putin. In a report last month US intelligence agencies concluded the Russian president had probably directed online efforts to help Mr Trump win a second term as US president.\nAnd yet, according to the Carnegie Moscow Center, Mr Trump imposed a record total of more than 40 rounds of sanctions on Moscow. In 2018 he expelled 60 Russian diplomats from the US."

      "text": "Two key European Parliament committees have overwhelmingly approved the UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, bringing its ratification closer.\nThe wide-ranging EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement was clinched on 24 December. It is in force provisionally.\nThe EU still has concerns about the way the UK is implementing the separate protocol for Northern Ireland. \nMEPs are yet to vote on the trade deal in a full session. The deadline for that is the end of this month.\nThere were 108 votes in favour, one against and four abstentions in the parliament's trade and foreign affairs committees.\nThere was relief on both sides when the deal was finally struck before Christmas, because a no-deal scenario on 1 January would have meant the imposition of many tariffs (import taxes) and quotas under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.\nEven with the deal, Brexit has brought extra paperwork and other administrative costs for UK and EU businesses. But without the deal the costs would have been greater, along with disruption to transport and various other EU-UK links.\nThe EU is in a legal row with the UK because the UK government unilaterally extended a series of \"grace periods\" to ease trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. Under the protocol, new EU checks are to be imposed on that trade, but the UK's move has delayed them. \nThe controversial protocol, which followed years of legal wrangling, is designed to keep Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. But as Britain is now outside, various bureaucratic hurdles have arisen. And that has fuelled political tensions. The protocol is seen as a factor in the recent street clashes in Belfast.\nThe different rules are aimed at maintaining an open border - and smooth trade - between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which remains in the EU.\nThe threat of non-ratification is still there. EU governments approved the deal, but MEPs still have to ratify it, otherwise no-deal becomes reality.\nAustrian MEP Andreas Schieder gave a mixed message. He said the deal would \"bind the UK to our current high labour and environmental standards\", but warned that \"all progress could be lost if the UK continues to unilaterally breach the Withdrawal Agreement and the protocol on Northern Ireland\".\nThe BBC's Kevin Connolly in Brussels says the parliament's threat is the only real tool for applying pressure on the UK - but now ratification looks more likely. \nUK Brexit Minister Lord Frost is to hold talks over dinner in Brussels shortly with EU Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic, in a further bid to resolve the protocol dispute.

      "text": "France has urged all its citizens in Pakistan to leave the country temporarily amid violent anti-French protests across the country.\nThe country's embassy in Pakistan warned of \"serious threats to French interests in Pakistan\", saying protests were increasing nationwide.\nTwo police officers died this week in renewed clashes with protesters.\nThe protests were sparked months ago after France defended the right to show cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.\nIn October last year, French President Emmanuel Macron strongly defended freedom of expression after the beheading of a teacher who showed such cartoons during a class discussion.\nThis prompted anger in parts of the Muslim world, including Pakistan, where there were calls for a boycott of French goods.\nDepictions of the Prophet Muhammad are widely regarded as taboo in Islam, and are considered highly offensive by Muslims.\nThe protests escalated this week after the Pakistani government arrested Saad Hussain Rizvi, leader of the hard-line political party Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP), which has called for the expulsion of the French ambassador.\nMr Rizvi's arrest, and a move by the Pakistani authorities to ban the TLP, brought thousands of the party's supporters into the streets in Pakistan to protest. Police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon at the crowds. \nThe TLP has previously gathered huge crowds to protest over blasphemy issues. Under Pakistani law those found guilty of insulting the Prophet Muhammad can face the death penalty.\nSpeaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Pakistani Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said the nation was \"in favour of protecting the Prophet's honour\" but that the TLP's demands \"could have portrayed Pakistan as a radical nation worldwide\".\nOn its website, the French embassy in Pakistan said on Thursday: \"Demonstrations are increasing across the country. \n\"In this context, and because of the serious threats to French interests in Pakistan, French nationals are recommended to temporarily leave the country via existing commercial airlines.\"\nIn France, state secularism (la\u00efcit\u00e9) is central to the country's national identity. Freedom of expression in schools and other public spaces is part of that, and curbing it to protect the feelings of a particular religion is seen as undermining national unity. \nThe satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which was targeted in a deadly jihadist attack in Paris in 2015 over its cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, also mocks other religions.\nComments by Mr Macron in October in support of the magazine's right to publish the cartoons triggered anger across the Muslim world, with tens of thousands in Pakistan, neighbouring Iran and other Muslim countries flooding the streets and organising anti-French boycotts.\nThe TLP temporarily called off protests in Pakistan in November, claiming that government ministers had agreed to boycott French products.\nPakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan criticised Mr Macron, but the government denied it had agreed to a boycott, saying no decision had been made.\nThe TLP is the political arm of the Tehreek-e-Labaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLYRA) movement. \nLed by Mr Rizvi's father - Khadim Rizvi, who died in November - it came to prominence for its opposition to the hanging of Mumtaz Qadri, a policeman who killed the governor of Punjab province Salman Taseer in 2011 because he had spoken out against the country's blasphemy laws.\nYou might also be interested in:"

      "tags": "David Cameron,Greensill Capital,UK Parliament",
      "text": "Westminster has been bursting with rebellions, U-turns and resignations this week after the Tory MP Owen Paterson was found to have broken parliamentary rules on lobbying. But what does the term mean? \nLobbying is when individuals, businesses, trade unions, groups or charities try to get a government to change its policies. \"Political persuasion\" might be a better term.\nLobbyists make their case to ministers, MPs or officials. They can write, email, text, phone, video call or turn up in person in Parliament to do it, although the latter hasn't happened much over the past two years due to Covid-19 restrictions.\nNot always. Changing politicians' minds can take a long time. That's why organisations and firms often hire professional lobbyists to make arguments on their behalf. Some of these are former politicians themselves and \"know the game\" - that is, who's who and where to find them.\nBut it's important to re-emphasise that individual citizens - unpaid - can also lobby politicians about issues that are important to them. Anyone can be a lobbyist, in other words.\nSupporters say professional lobbying is a vital and valid part of democracy - that it stimulates debate and keeps politicians in touch with the latest developments in areas like science and business.\nBut critics argue that the current system is open to corruption and that wealthy interests - the ones who can afford professionals to make their case - have an unfair advantage.\nMinisters and top civil servants are effectively banned from lobbying their former colleagues for two years after leaving government. Lobbyists also have to join a register, which was set up by David Cameron as prime minister.\nBut Mr Cameron, who left Downing Street in 2016, became the centre of a row about lobbying earlier in 2021 over his work for Greensill Captial. \nIn Mr Paterson's case, he was found to have broken the rules by approaching and meeting officials at the Food Standards Agency and ministers at the Department for International Development a number of times over issues involving two firms he was a consultant for. \nThe Commons Standards Committee also said he used his parliamentary office and stationery for his consultancy work and failed to declare his interests in some meetings.\nThe commissioner decided that the contact with officials and ministers were \"serious breaches\" of the rules.\nFollowing the disclosures about Mr Cameron's work, the government set up a review of lobbying, led by lawyer Chris Boardman. \nHe said some of the accusations that the government's processes for managing lobbying were \"insufficiently transparent\", had \"loopholes\" and allowed \"a privileged to few have a disproportionate level of access to decision makers in government\" were \"justified\". \nBut he said Mr Cameron did not break any of the rules. \nAfter the incident involving Mr Paterson, the focus from the government was not on his lobbying but in the need for an overhaul of the system policing MPs' conduct instead - giving members more chances to appeal findings against them.\nInitially, Downing Street backed an amendment to shake-up the watchdog and blocked Mr Paterson's suspension too. \nBut within 24 hours, and after a furious backlash from opposition MPs, No 10 U-turned, and now government is appealing to other parties to hold cross-party talks about any chances.\nThese would not be retrospectively applied to Mr Paterson's case though, and soon after the announcement, the MP resigned his seat. \nIt started long ago when members of the public turned up in Parliament's lobby areas to let MPs know what needed to change.\nIt's harder to get into that part of the building than it used to be because of tougher security, so meetings are just as likely to take place elsewhere, such as over dinner, in MPs' constituencies or via the phone."

      "tags": "Denmark,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Denmark has ceased giving the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine amid concerns about rare cases of blood clots, the first European country to do so fully.\nThe move is expected to delay the country's vaccination programme by several weeks.\nDrug watchdog the European Medicines Agency last week announced a possible link with clots but said the risk of dying of Covid-19 was much greater.\nSeveral European countries had previously briefly suspended the jab.\nMost have now resumed vaccinations with AstraZeneca, but often with limits to older age groups.\nOn Tuesday, the US, Canada and the European Union paused the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for similar reasons over clotting. \nSouth Africa has also paused its use, despite the Johnson & Johnson being its preferred vaccine because of its effectiveness against the South African variant.\nFor both AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, the blood clot side effects are extremely rare.\nThe EU's vaccine roll-out has been criticised by the World Health Organization (WHO) for being too slow, and there are concerns this latest delay could throw it into further turmoil. \nBoth vaccines work by a similar method, known as adenoviral vectors.\nDanish officials said that all 2.4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine would be withdrawn until further notice.\nThe Danish Health Authority said studies had shown a higher than expected frequency of blood clots following doses, affecting about one in 40,000 people.\nIt comes after two cases of thrombosis in Denmark were linked to vaccinations, AFP reported. One of the cases, in a 60-year-old woman, was fatal.\nDirector General Soren Brostrom said it had been a \"difficult decision\" but Denmark had other vaccines available and the epidemic there was currently under control.\n\"The upcoming target groups for vaccination are less likely to become severely ill from Covid-19,\" he said. \"We must weigh this against the fact that we now have a known risk of severe adverse effects from vaccination with AstraZeneca, even if the risk in absolute terms is slight.\"\nHowever, the authority said it could not rule out using it again at another time.\nDuring the press conference the head of Denmark's Medicines Agency, Tanja Erichsen, fainted and was taken to hospital as a precaution. The agency later tweeted that she had recovered.\nAlmost one million people in Denmark have been vaccinated, with approximately 150,000 of them receiving the AstraZeneca jab. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are also in use.\nAdenoviruses are found in humans and other animals. Scientists use a modified version of one of these adenoviruses, known as a vector, to deliver important instructions to cells, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\nThey work by entering cells and using the cell's machinery to produce a harmless piece of the virus that causes Covid-19, known as a spike protein. The cell then recognises that the spike protein does not belong there and this triggers the immune system to fight back against what it thinks is an infection. \nThis process allows our bodies to learn how to protect us against Covid-19, according to the CDC.\nRegulators are now investigating whether an unusual immune response to the adenovirus vaccines is causing the rare but severe incidences of blood clotting.\nAn official from the US Food and Drug Administration told Reuters it was \"plainly obvious\" that the cases of blood clots linked to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine were \"very similar\" to those linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThe US paused rollout of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after six women under 50 developed rare blood clots after getting the shot. In the UK 79 people had developed unusual blood clots and 19 of them had died after getting the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, out of a total of 20 million vaccinated.\nSome European countries have limited the use of adenovirus vaccines to older people, who have been less affected by the rare blood clotting condition.\nAfter the Danish announcement, France said it viewed the AstraZeneca vaccine as an \"essential tool\".\n\"It is important that this vaccine continue to be deployed. It is a vaccine that is safe and works,\" a French government spokesman said.\nFrance will also go ahead with plans to give the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to those aged over 55, the spokesman said. The country has already received 200,000 doses. Belgium will also give the doses it has received, while Greece and Italy will not.\nMeanwhile the Czech Deputy Prime Minister Jan Hamacek said he had instructed the Czech ambassador in Denmark to try to buy the 2.4 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses that the Danes would no longer be using.\nMr Hamacek said he would also travel to Moscow to arrange deliveries of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine - another adenovirus vaccine - once its use is approved by the EMA.\nThe developer of the Sputnik V vaccine, the Gamaleya Center, told the BBC it had found no cases of blood clots in connection with its jab. It said all vaccines based on adenoviruses were \"different and not directly comparable\".\nDenmark was the first country to postpone use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in March. It was followed by numerous other European countries.\nIn a separate development, the European Commission said Pfizer-BioNTech would deliver an extra 50 million doses to the EU in the next few weeks.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech is an RNA vaccine - a new type of vaccine that uses genetic material to teach cells how to make copies of the virus causing Covid-19, triggering an immune response. \nCommission President Ursula von de Leyen also said the EU was discussing a new deal with Pfizer-BioNTech to deliver 1.8 billion doses in 2022 and 2023 which would all be produced within the EU. \nSo far 27 million people in the EU have been fully vaccinated.

      "tags": "David Cameron,Greensill Capital,Lobbying in the United Kingdom",
      "text": "Former Prime Minister David Cameron made about \u00a33.3m from shares in the collapsed finance company Greensill Capital, documents obtained by BBC Panorama suggest.\nLast month an MPs' report accused Mr Cameron of \"a significant lack of judgement\" in lobbying the government on behalf of the company, although it said he did not break any rules.\nIn 2020, Mr Cameron tried to persuade ministers to allow Greensill - who employed him as an adviser - to join a scheme called the Corporate Covid Financing Facility (CCFF). \nThis would have allowed the company to issue loans, insured by the government, to help firms through the pandemic.  \nHowever, Mr Cameron - and the company's founder, Lex Greensill - were unsuccessful in their attempts. \nGreensill Capital collapsed this year, with the loss of 440 jobs, and possible billion-pound losses for investors.\nMr Cameron has consistently declined to say how much he was being paid by Greensill, except that it was \"far more\" than his salary as PM. \nHowever, BBC's Panorama has obtained a letter from Greensill Capital to the former PM which suggests that he made \u00a33.29m after selling a tranche of Greensill shares in 2019.  \nAs well as the shares, Mr Cameron is reported to have received a salary of $1m (\u00a3720,000) a year as a part-time adviser.\nThe programme also understands that the former prime minister was paid a bonus of $700,000 (\u00a3504,000) in 2019 on top of his salary.\nIn total, it looks like he made around $10m before tax for two-and-a-half years' part-time work.\nMr Cameron's spokesman said his remuneration was a private matter.\nMr Cameron has been accused of trying to exploit private contacts with former government colleagues, for his own benefit.\nThe former PM used private channels to lobby ministers and former colleagues.\nHe and his staff sent 45 emails, texts and WhatsApp messages concerning Greensill between 5 March and 26 June 2020.\nAmong these were nine WhatsApp messages to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and 12 text messages to Sir Tom Scholar, the Treasury's top civil servant.\nThe Bank of England has published correspondence showing that Mr Cameron had contacted senior officials several times, in an unsuccessful attempt to win their support.\nAlong with Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a \"private drink\" in 2019 to discuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff.\nA report last month by the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee said that while no lobbying rules were broken, Mr Cameron's actions showed there was a \"good case for strengthening them\", with the current ones offering \"insufficient strength\".\nIt also said that the Treasury was right to reject the former PM's proposals, but it \"should have encouraged\" him into \"more formal lines of communication as soon as it had identified his personal financial incentives\".\nA Cabinet Office review commissioned by Boris Johnson also criticised Mr Cameron, and said he had understated his relationship with Greensill when lobbying the Treasury. However, it said that \"his actions were not unlawful\".\nSeveral other reviews are investigating matters related to lobbying and Greensill. \nResponding to the Treasury Committee report, Mr Cameron admitted that he should have used more formal channels, but said he had worked for Greensill primarily because he thought the firm could help small businesses during an economic crisis.\nHowever, Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner said the fact that Mr Cameron had been cleared of breaking rules proved \"that the rules that are supposed to regulate lobbying are completely unfit for purpose\".\nCurrent rules state that \"on leaving office, ministers will be prohibited from lobbying government for two years\".\nBefore accepting new jobs, former ministers are supposed to inform a body called the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).\nAcoba advises civil servants and politicians on what they can and can't do after leaving public service. \nHowever, although former ministers are required to contact Acoba, they are not obliged to act on its advice.\nAcoba's head, Lord Pickles, has called for ex-ministers who work as lobbyists to go on a register for up to 10 years to ensure \"transparency\",\nThe company's collapse earlier this year was triggered after its insurer refused to renew cover for the loans Greensill was making. \nGreensill was the principal financial backer of Liberty Steel, which employs 3,000 people in England, Scotland and Wales.\nTalks are now underway to try to secure Liberty's future."

      "text": "The ex-officer accused of killing George Floyd says he will not testify on his own behalf as the defence rests their case and court is adjourned.\nDerek Chauvin denies killing Mr Floyd. Jurors are due to begin deliberating his fate on Monday morning.\nVideo of Mr Chauvin kneeling on the neck of Mr Floyd led to worldwide protests against racism and policing.\nTensions in Minneapolis are running high after an unrelated police shooting of a black man in a nearby suburb.\nExperts say it would be unusual for a suspect to take the stand in their own defence during a trial.\nBefore the jury was brought into the courtroom on Thursday, Mr Chauvin was asked a series of questions about his decision not to testify.\nHis defence lawyer, Eric Nelson, began by asking whether he and Mr Chauvin had previously discussed his decision.\n\"Correct,\" Mr Chauvin said several times.\n\"To say we've gone kind of back and forth on the matter is kind of understatement, isn't that right?\" asked Mr Nelson.\n\"Yes it is,\" Mr Chauvin responded, as they both briefly smiled.\n\"I will invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege today,\" Mr Chauvin then told the court, referring to the constitutional right to stay silent in fear of self-incrimination.\nAsked by the judge whether this was his decision alone, and whether anyone else had unfairly influenced his decision, Mr Chauvin responded: \"No promises or threats, your honour.\"\nAfter prosecutors recalled an earlier witness - Dr Martin Tobin, who disputed the notion that Mr Floyd died of carbon monoxide poisoning - the judge adjourned the court until Monday.\nThe defence rested on Thursday, setting the stage for closing arguments from each side to happen on Monday.\nOnce the state and Mr Chauvin's defence have presented their closing arguments, the judge will send the jury into sequestration.\n\"Expect that when you report for duty on Monday that it will be followed by sequestration,\" Judge Peter Cahill told the jury this week. \"So pack your bag.\"\nWhile sequestered, the jury will be kept in a private location - typically a hotel - and must rely on their own memories of the lawyer's arguments and witness testimonies to render their verdict. They are given computers that contain all of the video and audio evidence that has been heard in court.\nThe jury has been only partially sequestered until now.\nThey are allowed to return home every night but are escorted into the courthouse everyday from a secure location. They are forbidden from reading media reports about the case, and every move they make inside the courthouse is watched by a bailiff.\nOn Monday, Mr Chauvin's lawyer argued that unrest over the shooting of Duante Wright in the nearby suburb of Brooklyn Center just 10 miles (16km) from the courthouse should trigger full sequestration during the final week of arguments.\nBut the judge disagreed, saying \"this is a totally different case\".\nAll 12 jurors must agree to Mr Chauvin's guilt in order for him to be convicted. There are three separate charges that they must consider.\nWith the manslaughter charge, prosecutors do not need prove he actually caused Mr Floyd's death. Someone found guilty of this charge may be sentenced to up to 10 years in jail.\nIt's unknown how long jury deliberation may last. Experts say it could be brief - as little as one hour - or it could take weeks.\nJudge Cahill has said that if verdict comes late in the day, the result will be announced the following morning.\nFourteen jurors have sat in the courtroom over the past three weeks. They are never shown on camera and must remain anonymous for their own safety and privacy.\nSelecting them was no easy feat due to the high-profile nature of the case. Over 11 days of jury summons, lawyers for both sides settled on a panel that skews younger, more white and more female.\nIt also includes a black grandmother in her 60s who once lived a few blocks from where Mr Floyd died.\nAnother juror, a white woman in her 50s, worked at a suburban business damaged last summer after Mr Floyd's death.\nAnd a black man in his 40s was added to the jury after he agreed that minorities are mistreated by the police, but police departments should not under any circumstances be defunded.\nAt least one of them lives in Brooklyn Center, the suburb that has seen police deploy tear gas after protesters took to the streets following the death of Mr Wright, who was allegedly shot after the officer mistook her gun for her Taser.\nWhat questions do you have about the Derek Chauvin trial?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "A top civil servant joined financial firm Greensill Capital as an adviser while still working for the government, a lobbying watchdog has revealed.\nBill Crothers's part-time position had been \"agreed\" to by the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments added.\nIts chairman Lord Pickles complained of a \"lack of transparency\" over the situation.\nBut Mr Crothers said he had been taken on by Greensill in a \"transparent\" way.\nLabour called his dual employment \"extraordinary and shocking\".\nThe disclosure about Mr Crothers - who had been the government's chief procurement officer prior to being taken on by Greensill - is the latest of several stories involving the now-collapsed financial firm.\nIt employed former prime minister David Cameron as an adviser from 2018. \nThe Financial Times and the Sunday Times revealed that Mr Cameron had contacted several ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, to push for greater involvement in government loans schemes for the company.\nBoris Johnson has set up an inquiry into lobbying - attempts to persuade governments to change policy - including Greensill's role.\nGovernment sources said this would also now look at the situation surrounding Mr Crothers.\nMr Crothers, who had already left his job as chief procurement officer but remained a Civil Service employee, joined Greensill as an adviser to its board in September 2015.\nThe letter from Conservative peer Lord Pickles to leading civil servant Alex Chisholm says: \"This was agreed by the Cabinet Office under its internal conflicts-of-interest policy.\"\nLord Pickles asks for \"guidance on the conflicts-of-interest process\" undertaken.\nThe letter adds: \"The lack of transparency around this part-time employment with Greensill may have left the misleading impression that Mr Crothers had wilfully ignored the obligation to seek advice.\"\nMr Crothers left the Civil Service in November 2015, two months after taking up his role at Greensill. He became a director of the firm in late 2016.\nA letter from Mr Crothers to Lord Pickles, a former Conservative Party chairman, written earlier this week, has also been published.\nIn it, he says: \"I am concerned that there may be a view that I did not follow proper process regarding my role with Greensill Capital.\n\"I assure you that I completely respect the required process and your office, took steps to comply, and believe that I did so.\"\nHe adds: \"I was transparent about the move to Greensill Capital, and it was well known at the time.\"\nThe shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said: \"This is an extraordinary and shocking revelation.\n\"The Conservatives have weakened the rules so much they may as well rip them up and start again.\"\nThe government inquiry in to lobbying is expected to report  by the end of June, but Labour says it does not go far enough.\nIt will use an opposition day debate on Wednesday to force a vote on whether to establish a new Commons select committee to investigate the issue.  \nUnlike regular opposition day votes which are symbolic, this one would be binding if it passes because Parliament would be deciding if it should do something. \nA Cabinet Office spokesperson said there would be a response to Mr Pickles's letter \"in due course\".\nThey added that the \"review into Greensill Capital and supply-chain finance\" would be \"wide-ranging\".\nMr Cameron has said he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying and that he welcomes the investigation launched by Mr Johnson."

      "text": "A man has admitted harassing BBC reporter Sima Kotecha as she prepared to broadcast on live television.\nRussell Rawlingson, from Leicester, was originally charged with causing racially-aggravated harassment, alarm or distress, as Ms Kotecha believed his behaviour was \"racist and abusive\".\nHowever, he pleaded guilty to a lesser non-racially aggravated version of the offence.\nHe is due to be sentenced on 11 May.\nNo details were given about what Rawlingson said to Ms Kotecha when he pleaded guilty at Leicester Crown Court.\nThe charge was put to him as follows: \"You are charged with racially aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress.\n\"On 10 May 2020, with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress, you used threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour towards Sima Kotecha.\"\nWhen asked how he pleaded, Rawlingson said: \"Guilty, but not to the racial.\"\nThe prosecution did not initially accept his plea to the lesser charge, which meant Rawlinson would have had to stand trial for the original offence, and Ms Kotecha would have had to give evidence in court.\nHowever, the prosecution then said Ms Kotecha did not wish it to go to trial, and the plea to the lesser charge was therefore accepted.\nThis charge was using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear or provoke violence.\nRawlingson, 51, of Glenfield Road, Leicester, also entered guilty pleas to offences relating to two other cases.\nHe admitted having a bladed article in a public place in June.\nHe also pleaded guilty to assaulting an emergency worker and another charge of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear or provoke violence in October.\nMs Kotecha had been due to interview people at Leicester's Clock Tower following a government statement on coronavirus lockdown restrictions but the segment was cancelled. \nA BBC News spokesperson said: \"It's completely unacceptable that our journalists should suffer abuse for doing their jobs. \n\"The BBC stands by our brave and talented correspondent Sima Kotecha, her colleagues, and her guest.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "MPs and peers are calling for funding for families forced to buy medicinal cannabis for their children privately.\nThe treatment was made legal with a prescription in 2018 for those with an \"exceptional clinical need\". \nBut a cross-party letter from 100 politicians says only three NHS prescriptions have been given out since, forcing families to spend thousands on private treatments. \nThe government said it sympathised with those facing hard-to-treat conditions.\nThe change in law came about after the cases of Alfie Dingley and Billy Caldwell, who had both been denied access to cannabis oil to treat their rare forms of epilepsy. \nThe Home Office later granted the boys licences to access the treatment.\nBut after a review by experts, the then home secretary Sajid Javid introduced legislation to make it legal for specialist doctors to provide prescriptions for cannabis-derived medicinal products in \"exceptional circumstances\".\nOver two years have passed since the law changed, but the All Parliamentary Group on Access to Medical Cannabis Under Prescription said dozens of families were not seeing the benefit. \nIn a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the group's chair, Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, said instead, parents were having to fund raise up to \u00a32,000 a month to pay for the treatment privately.\n\"In any circumstance, this is a severe financial burden for families already having to cope with very sick children and Covid restrictions have rendered most fund-raising impossible,\" she added.\n\"The reasons for the lack of NHS prescriptions appear to be complex and will inevitably take time to resolve. However, the families to which we refer simply do not have time. \n\"They are emotionally and financially broken and their children are at risk of being without their life-transforming medicine within weeks.\"\nBacked by 100 MPs and peers from all parties, Ms Antoniazzi appealed to the PM to \"grant access to some form of compassionate funding until the wider issues can be resolved\".\nThe APPG receives help with its administration from campaign group End Our Pain, which has welcomed the intervention. \nGroup director Peter Carroll said the situation was \"desperate\" for the families, telling the BBC: \"When the law was changed, we thought as campaigners 'job done', there will be prescriptions - but it didn't happen.\"\nHe claimed the advice given out by various medical bodies on prescriptions for the treatment had been \"extremely cautious\", and as a result, \"we are in this crazy situation where it is totally legal, but hardly any specialist doctors will prescribe it\". \nBut Mr Carroll said the call for funding for the families was \"the only thing that can work in very short term\".\nHe added: \"We can't fight the other battles and win in weeks - the only way forward right now is to give these families the money to pay for prescriptions in the short term.\n\"I appeal to the government, give them money, stop them having to do online raffles for fundraising so they can focus on caring for some of the sickest children in the country.\"\nA spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"We sympathise with every patient and every family courageously confronting life with hard-to-treat conditions.\"\nThe spokesman added that after the law was changed in 2018 on prescriptions, the department was considering \"what further action we can take with regard to broader access to unlicensed cannabis-based products, while giving immediate priority to resolving the supply of Bedrocan oils from the Netherlands, which many patients are receiving.\""

      "tags": "David Cameron,UK government,Greensill Capital,Lobbying",
      "text": "David Cameron has said he will \"respond positively\" to any requests from MPs for him to give evidence about Greensill Capital.\nThe former prime minister has faced criticism for lobbying on behalf of the finance firm, which recently collapsed.\nIt has sparked a wider row over private companies' attempts to influence ministers and officials.\nThe government has asked a senior lawyer to conduct a review into the issue and to report by the end of June.\nBut on Wednesday the Commons Treasury committee announced plans for its own probe, with other committees reportedly planning to do the same. \nA spokesman for Mr Cameron said he would \"respond positively\" to requests to give evidence \"when the terms of reference of each inquiry are clear\".\nIt is not yet clear whether the former Tory leader will be asked to appear in person, or to provide a committee with evidence such as documents. \nLabour had wanted a \"full\" probe, including public hearings by a cross-party panel of MPs - but the government rejected this, and voted down the plan.\nMeanwhile, the head of a watchdog which advises former ministers and officials on outside employment will make a long-planned appearance in front of MPs later on Thursday. \nThe Conservative peer Lord Pickles chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).\nThe Greensill affair has led to renewed focus on the regulator, which has previously been described as \"toothless\" by a committee of MPs. \nCurrent rules ban former ministers from lobbying government for two years after they leave office - a rule Mr Cameron appears to have followed.\nBut critics of the current system, including former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, have suggested a longer ban is required. \n\"Former prime ministers must never be lobbying for commercial purposes. Current ministers should not be entertaining such lobbying,\" said Mr Brown.\nWhat is lobbying?\nMr Cameron began a role as an adviser to Greensill Capital in August 2018, just over two years after he left Downing Street in July 2016. \nThe firm's founder, Australian financier Lex Greensill, had previously worked as an unpaid adviser to Mr Cameron's government.\nMr Cameron's work saw him text Chancellor Rishi Sunak on behalf of the firm asking for it to be included in a Covid-related government loan scheme.\nAlong with Mr Greensill, he also met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a \"private drink\" in 2019 to discuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff.\nMr Cameron has said he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying - and welcomes the government's review, to be led by lawyer Nigel Boardman.\nOn Wednesday, it was also revealed that government departments have been ordered to find out whether senior officials have rule-breaking second jobs.\nCabinet Secretary Simon Case has asked colleagues to declare paid roles or outside interests that \"might conflict\" with Civil Service rules by the end of the week.\nThe move came after news that Bill Crothers, a former civil servant, joined Greensill as an adviser in 2015 whilst still working for the government. \nMr Crothers says his recruitment by the firm was \"transparent\" and had been approved by the Cabinet Office under its internal conflicts of interest policy.\nHe later went on to join the company as a director in late 2016, after leaving the Civil Service in November 2015.\nBut Lord Pickles has said there had been a \"lack of transparency\" about the process - and has asked the Cabinet Office to provide further details. \nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former permanent secretary and Civil Service commissioner for public appointments Sir David Normington said it was \"absolutely baffling\", adding that he had \"never come across anything like it in my 40 years in Whitehall\". \nHe said: \"There may be an explanation for this which we don't yet know, but we're not just talking here about any old civil servant.\n\"We're talking about someone who was responsible for commercial dealings in government, had oversight of relationships with a large number of major contractors and the handling of lots of public money.\n\"It's essential that people like that when they leave the Civil Service are subject to scrutiny and subject to rules which mean that they can't take up appointments immediately.\"\nHe added: \"We've heard a lot about was this behaviour within the rules. Well, it's not just about the rules.\n\"It's about the principles of standards in public life, what we need is good behaviour in public life not just the following of rules.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs on Wednesday it was \"not clear\" that \"boundaries have been properly understood\".

      "tags": "Television,BBC,Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Radio",
      "text": "The BBC has confirmed it received 109,741 complaints from the public over its coverage of the Duke of Edinburgh's death.\nThe corporation cleared its schedules to cover the news when Prince Philip died on Friday, at the age of 99.\nEastEnders and the MasterChef final were replaced by news programmes, while BBC Four was taken off air completely.\nThe BBC said it was \"a significant event which generated a lot of interest both nationally and internationally\".\nIt added: \"We acknowledge some viewers were unhappy with the level of coverage given, and impact this had on the billed TV and Radio schedules. \n\"We do not make such changes without careful consideration and the decisions made reflect the role the BBC plays as the national broadcaster, during moments of national significance.\n\"We are grateful for all feedback, and we always listen to the response from our audiences.\" \nThe corporation's fortnightly complaints report was published on Thursday.\nThe figure makes the coverage of Prince Philip's death the most complained-about piece of programming in BBC history.\nBBC One moved the MasterChef final to 14 April, so viewers were then able to find out who had won the amateur cookery series hosted by Gregg Wallace and John Torode. \nOther programmes that have previously attracted a high volume of correspondence included the broadcast of Jerry Springer: The Opera, which received 63,000 complaints in 2005; and Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand's prank call to actor Andrew Sachs, which drew 42,000 complaints in 2008. \nThe BBC was not alone in adjusting its schedule to reflect Prince Philip's death, with ITV and Channel 4 both broadcasting extended news coverage.\nHowever, many viewers turned away as the day wore on, with ITV's Friday night audience declining by 60% in comparison to the previous week, according to overnight figures. \nFor a significant number of viewers, replacing the final of MasterChef with programming celebrating the life of Prince Philip was the wrong decision. Quite how many would have complained if the BBC had done the opposite is the unanswered question.\nWhat is also interesting is how many older viewers have complained. Traditional \"linear\" TV has been a reliable friend during months of lockdown, and while younger viewers have embraced streaming around 20 million of us are still watching at peak time each evening. Schedules, even in an age of YouTube, iPlayer and Netflix, still matter.  \nIt is also worth mentioning that, in these days of online complaints forms, it is rather easier to register a complaint than it was in the era of trying to get through to the BBC switchboard. Indeed, some people contacted the BBC to complain that the BBC was making it too easy to complain.\nBBC One's audience also dropped six per cent week-on-week during the coverage about Prince Philip, while BBC Two lost two-thirds of its audience, with just 340,000 people tuning in at any time between 7pm and 11pm.\nThe most-watched programme on a single channel that evening was Channel 4's Gogglebox, with 4.2 million viewers.\nThe BBC put a dedicated form on its website later that evening to allow viewers to complain about the TV coverage, in recognition of the volume of complaints.\nThe form was removed the following afternoon, after the number of complaints began to fall, the corporation said.\nBroadcaster Andrew Marr has also apologised for a phrase he used about the Duke of Edinburgh while speaking on the BBC News Channel, which angered some viewers.\nThe BBC said: \"When reflecting on the life of HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Andrew Marr gave his analysis of Prince Philip's role within the monarchy and relationship with the Queen. While doing this, Andrew made a remark which he accepts was poorly phrased, for which he apologises.\"\nThe BBC also said it received complaints from viewers who \"feel it's inappropriate for Prince Andrew to feature in our news coverage\".\nThe corporation responded by saying: \"All of Prince Philip's children gave a tribute to their father following his passing, which we have covered in our news programming. \n\"We have fully reported on the allegations against Prince Andrew, and we have also made it clear that he has not been charged with any crime. We consider we have appropriately covered his comments.\"\nPrince Philip's funeral will be held at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, at 15:00 BST on Saturday 17 April. The procession and funeral will be televised and the BBC has  published its broadcast plans for its coverage.\nIt will devote coverage on BBC One to the funeral between 12:30 BST and 16:20 BST and BBC Two will broadcast a special programme fronted by Huw Edwards at 20:10 GMT.\nDuring the day, BBC Two will air alternative programming such as Saturday Kitchen and Football Focus. \nBBC One is also carrying news bulletins either side of the programming, as well as a programme on Saturday morning called The Duke: In His Own Words at 11:00 GMT.\nOn 16 April, BBC One will show HRH The Duke of Edinburgh Remembered between 19:00 GMT and 20:05 GMT.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The risk of developing a serious brain clot - known as a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) - is 8 to 10 times higher in people with Covid than those who get a vaccine, a study suggests.\nBased on US data, the Oxford research team says people being vaccinated should be reassured by the findings.\nIt follows investigations into links between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots.\nThe study only looked at those who had had a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.\nThe research, which involved electronic health records of 81 million people in the US, looked at the number of CVST cases seen in the two weeks following a diagnosis of coronavirus and the number of cases occurring in the two weeks after people had their first coronavirus vaccine.\nIt estimates that while these blood clots are uncommon after Covid - with 39 in every million people developing one within two weeks of being ill - they are much rarer still after a vaccine.\nBut researchers say their study - which has not been through a formal review and is separate from the Oxford vaccine group - is still a work in progress and must be interpreted cautiously because it is difficult to calculate with certainty how common CVSTs are in the general population, partly because of just how rare they are. \nThe study also found:\nThe European Medicines Agency says a particular type of CVST occurs in around five in a million people after the first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - but the populations vaccinated were not the same as in the US and the rates cannot be compared.\nPaul Harrison, professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford, said their study had important conclusions for people deciding on vaccines.\nHe said: \"Firstly, Covid-19 markedly increases the risk of CVST, adding to the list of blood clotting problems this infection causes. \n\"Secondly, the Covid-19 risk is higher than seen with the current vaccines, even for those under 30; something that should be taken into account when considering the balances between risks and benefits for vaccination.\"\nFrom their database they were unable to investigate whether the CVST clots they were seeing had similar features to those seen in rare cases after vaccines - which all had a peculiar pattern of blood cells associated with them, where certain cells called platelets were diminished.\nProf Beverley Hunt, of Thrombosis UK, said the mechanisms behind people getting clots after Covid and those experiencing clots after vaccines were likely to be different. \nShe said: \"Patients who are hospitalised with Covid-19 have very pro-thrombotic (sticky) changes in their blood, which persist after they have been discharged.  This will lead to an increased rate of blood clots.  \n\"The mechanism for the very rare blood clots and low platelet counts seen after the AstraZeneca vaccine is different. It is associated with an immune response.\""

It was quite obvious he wasn't going to stop.\"\nMs Rowbotham said she hunched down to try to protect herself but was stabbed multiple times. \n\"It felt more like punches, I guess,\" she continued. \"His final stabs were in my neck.\n\"It felt like he thought they were the final stabs, as if they were intended to finish me.\"\nThe court heard she lay on the floor and \"decided to play dead in case he came back again...I tried to slow down my breathing.\"\nMs Rowbotham said she wanted to call the police on her mobile but \"there was too much blood to press the screen.\"\nSaskia Jones, 23, and 25-year-old Mr Merritt both died after being stabbed by Khan at the prisoner rehabilitation conference being held in Fishmongers' Hall.\nThe inquest also heard that Mr Merritt had rebooked a rail ticket for his killer after Khan's train to London was cancelled.\nSimon Larmour, a Learning Together research associate, said he received a panicked phone call from Khan on the day of the attack saying his train from Stafford had been cancelled.\nThe court previously heard that during the journey, Khan strapped a fake suicide bomb to his waist whilst in the train toilet.\nKhan was met at Euston station by Mr Larmour and John Crilly - who would later help with attempts to subdue Khan on London Bridge.\n\"I saw Usman coming towards Issy (Isobel Rowbotham) and me with two knives,\" Mr Lamour said. \n\"He was yelling but I didn't really understand what he was saying.\"\nMr Larmour said he leapt over the table and ran to the reception area where he gave first aid to Mr Merritt. \n\"I couldn't see all the places he had been stabbed. I was stunned at that point. I tried to find the nearest material I could to put pressure on the wounds. \n\"He passed out quite quickly. He was moaning a little bit. His eyes were glazed over. He was pale.\"\nThe inquest also heard from retired judge John Samuels, who saw Ms Jones lying at the foot of a staircase with a \"chalk-white\" face.\nHe was attending the conference, having previously run a training course for prisoner rehabilitation organisation Learning Together in 2018\nHe told the inquest how he was on the balcony of the building's grand entrance hall as the attack unfolded.\n''I heard shouts and screams coming from downstairs and I could not understand what was happening,\" he said.\n\"The first sounds were male shouts, the shouts were angry and confused.\"\nMr Samuels described how he then saw Ms Jones lying on the floor.\n\"I noted particularly her face was chalk-white, she appeared unconscious to me or perhaps even dead,\" he said.\nMr Samuels then saw one of the organisers of the event, Dr Amy Ludlow, shouting ''police, ambulance, now'' into her mobile phone.\nHaving been told to evacuate, Mr Samuels said he then heard an ''authoritative voice'' outside saying that there was a bomb and he should find shelter.\nMr Samuels said he now assumed the voice had been that of a police officer.\nThe inquest is scheduled to last nine weeks and is expected to be followed by a separate jury inquest into the death of Khan."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

Meanwhile, guns will be fired in salute and a bell will toll.\nInside the chapel, the Royal Family will wear face masks and keep to social distancing rules. Only 30 people will be able to attend, in line with coronavirus regulations.\nThe Duke of Sussex has returned to the UK from his home in the US to attend the funeral, although the Duchess of Sussex will not make the trip on medical advice."

People are still being infected, hospitals are still receiving patients and unfortunately people are still at risk of serious illness and death.  \n\"So we ask everyone to be mindful.  Step out, but step carefully.\"\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a day of optimism. \n\"The restrictions have been a necessary way to supress the virus, to save lives and protect our health service. But they have taken their toll. And it is incumbent on us to move forward as soon as circumstances allow,\" she said. \n\"But we must do so with caution and have maximum mitigations in place to avoid the virus reclaiming its grip on our society.\"\nNI Retail Consortium director Aodh\u00e1n Connolly said the announcement on the reopening of retail had brought clarity.\nRetail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said the announcement was a \"very significant step forward for the reopening of our high streets\".\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said it was \"important to bring optimism and certainty to this improving picture\".\n\"Every one of us has a part to play in maintaining progress - by getting vaccinated when our turn comes and by sticking with the actions that have served us well for the past year - including social distancing, wearing a mask, washing hands. It's also vital to remember that outdoor settings are significantly safer than indoors,\" Mr Swann said. \nMr Swann said on Wednesday that the time was right for the NI Executive to further ease restrictions, after some outdoor retail reopened on Monday.\nIt is understood Northern Ireland's R-number for community transmission is now sitting between 0.9 and 1.4, compared to 0.4 to 0.6 last week. \nThere have been two more Covid-19-related deaths recorded in Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours, with a further 159 people testing positive.\nAdvice from health officials states this may be partly due to a \"rebound effect\" after the Easter holidays, the extent of which should become apparent in the next week.\nThe pace of today was surprising. \nWe seemed to have gone from a slow and cautious waltz to a fast moving jive. All along for the last couple of weeks we were told by the health minister and the chief medical officer that it had to be slow and it had to be cautious. \nBut now today the reopening dates came a lot sooner than what we had envisaged, which is good news and can happen, as long as people remain vigilant. \nWe can go to the hairdressers and can go out for a drink and enjoy a coffee in cafes, but officials are concerned about what will happen behind closed doors. \nWe don't have any assurances that there will not be another lockdown. \nThe fear is that as we go into the summer, perhaps we will mostly staycation, but if people travel and come back with another variant, something we don't know of yet, we will perhaps see more people getting sick because the vaccine won't stand the type of variant. \nWhile this is a good day and one we have all been looking forward to, to enjoy the restrictions being lifted in the long term, we are still being advised that we have to be cautious. \nMrs Foster said decisions are aimed at lifting restrictions \"where we can\".  \n\"We cannot do everything people would want.  We are sorry about that and we know it will be disappointing for some,\" she said. \n Ms O'Neill said decisions had been made \"carefully\". \n\"We know that everyone out there is looking for certainty on next steps.  We cannot guarantee every step towards the end of this but we do want to give hope,\" the deputy first minister said. \nProposed dates leaked to the media earlier had suggested outdoor hospitality for pubs would have to wait until 10 May before being allowed to welcome back customers, with indoor venues not reopening before 1 June. \nHowever, Economy Minister Diane Dodds had raised concerns via a letter to the first and deputy first ministers about the proposed dates, saying it was her preference for unlicensed premises to open earlier, on 23 April, followed later by licenced premises. \nNorthern Ireland took some further gradual steps out of lockdown on Monday, when all pupils returned to school for the first time since Christmas. \nNorthern Ireland was the last part of the UK to lift its stay-at-home rule, which came into effect in January, in a bid to suppress a large rise in cases of coronavirus."

      "text": "Successful vaccine programmes will prevent another washout for summer holidaymakers, the boss of Europe's largest tour company has told the BBC.\n\"We are optimistic about the summer,\" said Friedrich Joussen, who runs TUI.\nThe firm - which owns a fleet of aircraft, cruise ships and a chain of travel agencies - said bookings in March alone had hit 2.8 million.\nAs a result, it expected to operate up to 75% of its normal schedule for the summer season. \n\"We are still confident that we will have a decent summer,\" said Mr Joussen, pointing to coronavirus vaccination programmes in the UK, US and Europe.\nThe company, which sells holidays to 180 different countries, suffered heavy losses during the pandemic.\nAcross the industry, income slumped by almost $4.5 trillion last year, leaving more than 62 million people without work, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).\nThe industry body is pressing for international travel to resume in June to stem further job losses.\nBut Mr Joussen said he expected some countries to ask travellers to prove they had been vaccinated before they were allowed to cross the border. Although he thinks demonstrating a negative test result would be just as effective in preventing the spread of the virus.\nHowever, for that strategy to be successful, he said the cost of those tests should be reduced.\n\"The cheaper it gets, the better it works and the less harmful it is for the general economy,\" he said.\nEuropean countries have ramped up their vaccination programmes in recent weeks, as the continent experiences a third wave of infections in the face of new variants. Nevertheless, Mr Joussen is optimistic about the summer.\n\"All medical advice we are getting as a company says that existing vaccines are working with existing variants,\" Mr Joussen said.\n\"Now they might be less efficient sometimes, but still it's much better than not being vaccinated.\"\nIn the past year, TUI has been forced to borrow billions from the German government just to stay afloat. But analysts have warned that in the wake of the crisis, the part-nationalised firm may struggle to compete against leaner rivals, as the industry reels from more than 12 months of international travel bans.\nMr Joussen said the German state stepped in at a time of great uncertainty, when the firm was struggling to survive and could not raise money from private investors. \n\"Berlin is a very rational investor,\" he said, adding: \"Germany would want to exit the loan as soon as possible.\"\nYou can watch Friedrich Joussen's  full interview on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst this weekend on BBC World News at Saturday 23:30 GMT, Sunday 05:30 and 16:30 GMT, Monday 06: 30 GMT & 10:30 GMT, Tuesday at 12:30 GMT and Thursday at 07:30 GMT."

      "text": "A US former police officer who shot dead a black motorist in Minnesota has been charged with second-degree manslaughter, prosecutors say.\nKim Potter was arrested and later released on $100,000 (\u00a372,000) bail.\nPolice say Mrs Potter shot Daunte Wright accidentally, having mistakenly drawn her gun instead of her Taser.\nResponding to the charges, the Wright family's lawyer Ben Crump said the killing was an \"intentional, deliberate, and unlawful use of force\".\nBoth Mrs Potter and local police chief Tim Gannon have resigned. The killing has sparked clashes between police and protesters in Brooklyn Center - a suburb of Minneapolis - and late on Wednesday, several hundred demonstrators again defied a curfew to gather outside police headquarters. \nAs on previous nights, protesters threw bottles and other projectiles at police who responded with stun grenades and pepper spray.\nMinneapolis is already on edge amid the trial of a white ex-police officer accused of murdering African-American George Floyd. \nMinnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said Mrs Potter was taken into custody on Wednesday morning. She was booked into Hennepin County Jail on probable cause second-degree manslaughter before bail was posted.\nIn Minnesota state law, a person can be found guilty of second-degree manslaughter if they can be proven to have shown culpable negligence whereby they create an unreasonable risk and \"consciously take chances of causing death or great bodily harm\" to someone else.\nMrs Potter is due to make her first court appearance on Thursday.\nThe charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $20,000 (\u00a314,500) fine. Prosecutors must show that Mrs Potter was \"culpably negligent\" and took an \"unreasonable risk\" in her actions, Reuters reported.\nAt a news conference, Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott called for people to protest peacefully.\n\"With the news of the decision to charge the former Brooklyn Center police officer with manslaughter comes a prolonged period of continued grieving, hurt and understandable anger,\" he said.\n\"Our task as a city and as a leadership is to allow for the expression of those very legitimate voices and to also create a pathway forward toward healing and renewal of our stability and strength as a community.\"\nTara McKelvey, BBC News, Minneapolis\nFor days outside the police station in Brooklyn Center, activists have stamped their feet to ward off the cold, and kept a vigil on the sidewalk. \nFor them, the news that the former officer, Kimberly Potter, will be charged with manslaughter, has been a positive development. Mrs Potter says that she mistakenly brandished a gun, instead of a Taser, killing Daunte Wright.\nEarlier in the week, the protesters had made dark jokes about Tasers and guns, pointing out that they look and feel distinct: \"They're different colours,\" said one activist, disgusted, as he spoke with a friend. \nLike others who stood outside the police department, they were both angry that Mrs Potter was allowed to resign, saying that she should have been fired. \n\"If I don't do my job, I get fired,\" said another protester. \"If I kill someone, I get fired.\"\nIn a statement, lawyer Mr Crump said \"no conviction can give the Wright family their loved one back\".\n\"A 26-year veteran of the force knows the difference between a Taser and a firearm. Kim Potter executed Daunte for what amounts to no more than a minor traffic infraction and a misdemeanour warrant,\" he said.\nOn Tuesday the families of Mr Wright and Mr Floyd came together to demand an end to the killing of unarmed black Americans by police.\n\"The world is traumatised watching another African-American man being slain,\" Floyd's brother Philonise Floyd said.\nOn Monday, Police Chief Gannon said the shooting of Mr Wright - who had a one-year-old son - appeared to be an \"accidental discharge\" after Mrs Potter mistook her service pistol for a stun gun.\nBut the families have rejected the explanation.\nMr Wright's aunt Naisha said: \"I watched that video like everybody else watched that video. That woman held that gun in front of her a long damn time.\"\nDaunte Wright was pulled over for an expired tag on his car licence plate. Family members say he was racially profiled.\nBodycam footage showed Mr Wright fleeing from officers after they told him he was being arrested for an outstanding warrant.\nAs Mr Wright re-enters his car, Mrs Potter is heard shouting \"Taser\" several times before firing a shot.\nMr Wright's mother told reporters her son had called her after he was pulled over and that she had offered to give insurance details to police over the phone.\nShe said she heard police order him to get out of the vehicle. There was a scuffling sound and an officer told him to hang up the phone.\nWhen she was eventually able to call back, his girlfriend answered and told her he had been shot.\n\"She pointed the phone toward the driver's seat and my son was laying there, unresponsive,\" she said in tears.\n\"That was the last time that I've seen my son.\""

All along for the last couple of weeks we were told by the health minister and the chief medical officer that it had to be slow and it had to be cautious. \nBut now today the reopening dates came a lot sooner than what we had envisaged, which is good news and can happen, as long as people remain vigilant. \nWe can go to the hairdressers and can go out for a drink and enjoy a coffee in cafes, but officials are concerned about what will happen behind closed doors. \nWe don't have any assurances that there will not be another lockdown. \nThe fear is that as we go into the summer, perhaps we will mostly staycation, but if people travel and come back with another variant, something we don't know of yet, we will perhaps see more people getting sick because the vaccine won't stand the type of variant. \nWhile this is a good day and one we have all been looking forward to, to enjoy the restrictions being lifted in the long term, we are still being advised that we have to be cautious. \nMrs Foster said decisions are aimed at lifting restrictions \"where we can\".  \n\"We cannot do everything people would want.  We are sorry about that and we know it will be disappointing for some,\" she said. \n Ms O'Neill said decisions had been made \"carefully\". \n\"We know that everyone out there is looking for certainty on next steps.  We cannot guarantee every step towards the end of this but we do want to give hope,\" the deputy first minister said. \nProposed dates leaked to the media earlier had suggested outdoor hospitality for pubs would have to wait until 10 May before being allowed to welcome back customers, with indoor venues not reopening before 1 June. \nHowever, Economy Minister Diane Dodds had raised concerns via a letter to the first and deputy first ministers about the proposed dates, saying it was her preference for unlicensed premises to open earlier, on 23 April, followed later by licenced premises. \nNorthern Ireland took some further gradual steps out of lockdown on Monday, when all pupils returned to school for the first time since Christmas. \nNorthern Ireland was the last part of the UK to lift its stay-at-home rule, which came into effect in January, in a bid to suppress a large rise in cases of coronavirus."

The \u00a316m thank-you fund has been paid in full and is a sign of our appreciation of their contribution.\"\nDeliveroo declined to say whether riders who had been paid extra in error would be able to keep additional money.\nDeliveroo has been rapidly gaining customers as people have looked for food delivery options during the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn the first three month of the year the number of customers using the delivery firm each month rose by 91% year-on-year to 7.1 million.\nBut Deliveroo shares dived when it listed on the London Stock Exchange last month, and fell more than 4% in afternoon trading on Thursday.\nThe firm said in a statement it was unsure how much of the quarterly growth was due to lockdown.\nBut it still expects full year sales to rise by 30% to 40%.\nThe firm is loss making and as this was trading update did not offer guidance on future profits.\nFounder and chief executive Will Shu said: \"This is our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, but we are mindful of the uncertain impact of the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. \n\"So while we are confident that our value proposition will continue to attract consumers, restaurants, grocers and riders throughout 2021, we are taking a prudent approach to our full year guidance.\"\nDeliveroo said that orders soared by 121% in the UK in the past three months to 34 million as the pandemic takeaway boom continued during the third national lockdown. In its overseas markets orders were up 108% to 37 million.\nHowever, the company said it expects its current rate of growth \"to decelerate as lockdowns ease\", although the extent of the slowdown remains \"uncertain\".\nThe update comes weeks after the group's flotation on the London Stock Exchange, which saw the value of its shares cut by a third in a week amid investor concerns over corporate governance and worker rights.\nDeliveroo riders are self-employed, meaning they are not entitled to earn a minimum wage from the company, or holiday and sick pay.\nMr Shu said on an analyst call on Thursday that self-employment was \"the only way you can give complete rider flexibility, which is what they want\".\n\"I'm very supportive of pensions and holiday pay, but in a manner that is congruent with [riders] being able to log in and log out,\" he said. \"I don't personally support one model.\"\n\"There is a trade-off between flexibility and security,\" Mr Shu added. \"Riders want to have flexibility and they value that above everything else.\"\nIn its update the firm said rider satisfaction in the UK was at an all time high of 89% at the end of March.\nMichael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets, said: \"This morning's update is certainly encouraging, and shows the business is heading in the right direction. \n\"It remains to be seen whether it will be enough to tempt shareholders back on board after the losses [in the share price] seen since the beginning of the month.\"   "

Utterly shameful.\"\nAnother user wrote: \"Very disappointing that you tried to exclude NHS staff after everything we have been through this past year. I will not be purchasing from this brand again after being a loyal customer for the past decade.\"\nCurrent guidance from Public Health England (PHE) states that a healthcare worker wearing the correct personal protective equipment (PPE) does not count as a Covid exposure if they are caring for a suspected or confirmed case of the virus.\nOthers pointed out that many key workers also take regular lateral flow tests.\nOn Thursday, Benefit Cosmetics announced it had changed its policy. \nAll customers will be asked a series of \"screening questions\", which have now been updated, on arrival for their appointments.

      "tags": "George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "George Floyd's death should have been classified as \"undetermined\", an expert has told the murder trial of former US police officer Derek Chauvin.\nForensic pathologist David Fowler told the court in Minnesota that the cause of Mr Floyd's death was not clear.\nMr Fowler said in his view, drug use, heart disease and other factors contributed to Mr Floyd's death.\nMr Fowler was a key witness for the defence of Mr Chauvin, who has denied charges of murder and manslaughter.\nHis defence team is trying to contradict earlier expert testimony that Mr Floyd died from lack of oxygen during his arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota last May.\nProsecutors argue that Mr Floyd died of asphyxia after Mr Chauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes.\nThe footage of Mr Chauvin, who is white, restraining Mr Floyd, a black man, on the floor as he shouted \"I can't breathe\" spurred global protests against racism.\nThis week the anger that exploded in the wake of Mr Floyd's death was reignited by the fatal shooting of a black man, Daunte Wright.\nThe shooting happened on Sunday in a Minnesota suburb only 10 miles (16 km) away from the court where Mr Chauvin's trial is taking place, setting off days of protests.\nOn Wednesday, a prosecutor charged Kim Potter, a white police officer who shot dead Mr Wright during a traffic stop, with second-degree manslaughter.\nDr Fowler, who was chief medical examiner for the state of Maryland until his retirement in 2019, was called to testify by Mr Chauvin's defence on the 13th day of the trial.\nHe was questioned about the findings of the Hennepin County medical examiner, who ruled Mr Floyd's death a homicide.\n\"I would fall back to undetermined, in this particular case,\" Dr Fowler testified.\nHe said, in his opinion, the cause of death was not clear because there were \"so many conflicting different potential mechanisms\". These complicating factors, he said, could be considered homicide in some cases, and accidental in others.\nMr Floyd's consumption of fentanyl and methamphetamine, and his possible exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning from the police car's exhaust, were among the complicating factors cited by Dr Fowler. \nAsked about the cause of death, Dr Fowler said he believed Mr Floyd suffered \"a sudden cardiac arrest\" while struggling with the officers.\nDr Fowler said Mr Floyd's health problems contributed to an erratic beating of his heart, known as sudden cardiac arrhythmia.\nIn response, prosecutor Jerry Blackwell launched an aggressive cross-examination of Dr Fowler, questioning his conclusions and credibility as a witness.\nUnder questioning, Dr Fowler admitted that someone who dies from being deprived of oxygen ultimately dies of an arrhythmia.\n\"Every one of us in this room will have a fatal arrhythmia at some point,\" Dr Fowler testified.\nDr Fowler also agreed that Mr Floyd should have been given immediate medical attention when he went into cardiac arrest, as there still was a chance to save his life.\nMr Chauvin has been charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.\nHe faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge - second-degree murder.\nA conviction on any of the counts against Mr Chauvin will require the nine-woman, five-man jury to return a unanimous verdict.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the judge presiding over the trial denied a defence motion to acquit Mr Chauvin of all charges.\nDefence attorney Eric Nelson said prosecutors had failed to prove their case against Mr Chauvin beyond reasonable doubt.\nThe motion is a standard request in criminal trials at the end of the presentation of the prosecution case and it was rejected by Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill.\nJudge Cahill also said he would allow a potential defence witness to invoke his right - under the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution - not to testify.\nMorries Hall was with Mr Floyd on the day of his arrest and his lawyer told the judge that his client could \"not answer any questions without incriminating himself\".\nLast week the court heard from several expert witnesses who testified that Mr Chauvin's use of force was excessive.\nThey were also steadfast in their belief that Mr Floyd died from being subdued and not from drug use or ill health.\nThe police chief who fired the officer after seeing the video of him kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck told the court his actions went against all police training.\nThere were also eyewitnesses who described their concerns for Mr Floyd as they watched the arrest taking place.\nWhat questions do you have about the Derek Chauvin trial?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "The rules on ministers and top officials taking jobs with private firms need urgent reform, the government's adviser on them has said.\nLord Pickles said there did not appear to be \"any boundaries at all\" between civil servants and the private sector.\nIt comes after news a top civil servant worked for Greensill Capital while still on the government payroll.\nLabour says things are becoming \"murkier\" and lobbyists have an \"open door\" to government. \nGreensill Capital is at the centre of a row about access, influence and lobbying that has engulfed Westminster.\nThe government has announced a review of contacts between top officials and ministers, including former prime minister David Cameron, and the now failed finance firm.\nIt will be led by Nigel Boardman, a non-executive board member of the department for business. \nSpeaking on a visit to Dartmouth College in Devon, Boris Johnson said he agreed with Lord Pickles that reform was needed. \nThe PM said: \"I think the most important thing is for us to get to the bottom of it properly and I want all ministers and civil servants to be making the information that needs to be known known to Mr Boardman and let's see what he has to say.\n\"We need to understand what's gone on here.\"\nOn Wednesday, Mr Johnson ordered Conservative MPs to vote down Labour's call for a \"full\" MP-led inquiry into Greensill and lobbying more widely.\nTory peer Lord Pickles chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) which advises former ministers and civil servants on outside employment. \nHe told the Commons public administration committee he had warned of a scandal but \"this is not where I expected it to come from\".\nHe added: \"There is nothing wrong with lobbyists. What is wrong is with unregulated lobbying, secret lobbying - people getting an undue advantage.\n\"Our entire political careers have been built by lobbying of some sort... it becomes wrong when it is not properly regulated, recorded and transparent.\"\nBy political reporter Brian Wheeler\nFormer government ministers - and top civil servants - are never short of job offers, but what sort of work should they be allowed to do after leaving the corridors of power?\nLord Pickles' Acoba committee is meant to ensure that they don't use their insider knowledge and contacts to enrich themselves for two years after leaving the government.\nThe danger is that if they get too cosy with business it could lead to bias and corruption.\nThe Acoba committee has long been criticised for being toothless - and Eric Pickles appears to agree. As things stand, he is neither a watchdog nor a regulator, he says. \nHis committee is there to offer advice, which is not always sought. \nHe appears determined to change this, although he says there is no need for the \"thermonuclear\" option of fines and new laws. \nOnly that if you break the rules, there must be \"consequences\".\nOn Tuesday it emerged that a former government procurement officer, Bill Crothers, joined Greensill as an adviser in 2015 while still working as a civil servant - after getting the go-ahead from the Cabinet Office. \nLord Pickles said that while it was not unusual for civil servants to have second jobs and to share their expertise, Mr Crothers' \"excuse\" when justifying his work with Greensill surprised him.\n\"It did seem, talking to other colleagues who had enjoyed being civil servants in the past, that they also shared my surprise - this seems to be a new thing, or a new excuse.\" \nHe said contractors and consultants to the government should have to sign a memorandum of understanding about the restrictions that would be placed on them after completing their public sector work.\n\"Simple steps could be taken now\" he said to tighten things up including \"looking carefully at contracts of employment\" and changes could be put in place \"well before the summer\". \nHe said the public was \"entitled\" to know the arrangements for second jobs.\n\"I mean, if Mr Crothers had decided he wanted to have a milk round or something, I don't think we would be terribly worried.\n\"But his particular position, in terms of running procurement and working for a commercial organisation, is something that does require a full and frank and transparent explanation,\" he added. \nHe  expressed his frustration that Acoba had a \"very limited and defined role,\" but added that most people do follow the rules and it is \"only a tiny minority\" who cause problems.\nWhat inquiries are being held?\nIt was possible to create a \"robust system\" without spending \"enormous sums\" of money and creating layers of bureaucracy, Lord Pickles told MPs. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said more and stronger lobbying rules are needed because the current system \"is not working\".\nHe said ministers were being lobbied for \"massive\" procurement contracts \"involving millions sometimes billions of pounds\". \nHe added: \"Increasingly we're seeing a murkier and murkier picture whether it's the way contracts are handed out, the lack of due process or the lobbying which is not a revolving door, it's an open door now in to government\". \nCorrection 27/4/21: Lord Pickles' quote regarding lobbying has been corrected"

      "tags": "Retailing,Coronavirus pandemic,UK High Streets",
      "text": "People should call and check before they drop off donations at charity shops, a trade association has warned. \nThere are fears the pent-up demand to donate after lockdown could lead to overcrowding in shops, the Charity Retail Association said.\nChief executive Robin Osterley said \"we have two asks of the generous public\".\n\"Be thoughtful - is this stuff you'd be prepared to buy yourself? And the second is to contact the shop before you roll up with armfuls of goods.\" \nThe Salvation Army made record sales on Monday, after non-essential shops reopened in England and Wales. \nMeanwhile Oxfam reported a 77% increase in sales compared with 2019, and Cancer Research UK took half a million pounds - more than double what it was expecting. \nBut the same big names are encouraging would-be donors to phone and book a slot to drop.\nManaging donations has been a Covid learning curve for the sector, as lockdowns have prompted mass clear-outs of unwanted goods.\nHowever, charity shops are better prepared this time, Mr Osterley said. Take for example Stockport hospice charity, Beechwood Cancer Care. There's been a queue of customers at its Heald Green precinct. But it is only open to shoppers, not droppers, this week.  \nIts manager, Sara Tilston, said it had been really busy: \"Yesterday was brilliant, we loved it.\n\"People have really struggled for money this year and being able to get extra supplies a lot cheaper is important.\" \nShe was turning away donations this week, but said that from next week she would accept donations on Tuesdays and Fridays, from the back door. \"We want to use up to the donations that we've collected through lockdown.\" \nThere's extra pressure on these volunteer-run services to be safe and compliant. \nIn all the fanfare of the 12 April reopening in England, the return of the humble charity shop was anticipated for a variety of reasons. \nThe stores offer valuable employment and volunteering experience to thousands of people, many of whom are likely to be vulnerable or isolated otherwise. \nSecond-hand fashion has gained a big following among the environmentally conscious - as well as bargain hunters. \nMoreover, for many making a purchase, this is a need not a desire. The pandemic has nudged 3.5 million more people into financial dire straits. \nBut lockdown has also given many of us yet another chance to have a good old clear out. \nTake Susanne Burwell, in Hull, who has a haul of good quality items that stretches across her dining table and all over her sofa. \n\"I've got a suitcase full of clothes and all my shoes ready to go,\" she told the BBC. She also has a range of sporting items to pass on - a wetsuit, a bike and badminton rackets.\n\"It's become a weight on my mind. I just want to have the space again, but I am quite excited that things might get another life.\" \nHowever, she said she wouldn't be taking them to the charity shop this time. \n\"I remember last time it was 'please don't bring us any more stuff, we don't have room for it'. I've heard charity shops are quite full again, so I'm booking a car boot.\" \nAlthough it has got more difficult to donate, with set days and queues to hand on unwanted items, Robin Osterley said most people were still willing to wait to give their things away, rather than sell them.\nHe said there had been a steady stream of donations this week already. He simply wishes his members could have stayed open throughout lockdown, like supermarkets.\n\"People have been sitting on piles of clothes for a long time, and we are grateful they have been doing that.\n\"For us it's been more frustrating to be classed as non-essential retail. We feel we are very much essential.\" \nHis organisation is keen to stress the contribution charity shops make to UK life, listing their presence on struggling high streets, the volunteering skills people can earn, as well as the cash boost to hundreds of good causes. \nLast year, a government committee warned that the funding gap left by closing charity shops would create irreparable damage to the sector.  \nIts survival will rely on the support of shoppers and droppers alike.  \nMs Tilson, in Stockport, said charity shops weren't just about donations and bargains: \"We also help those who want to come out for a chat, just to see us.\n\"It was so good to see regular customers when we opened. Who needs Primark anyway?\""

      "title": "Covid: How ready is Scotland to unlock?",
      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid travel restrictions around Scotland are due to be eased on Friday, earlier than expected, but there will be a much more significant relaxation in the rules from 26 April. As Scotland prepares to unlock, here are five things about the state of the epidemic. \nThe emergence of the Kent Covid variant in the weeks before Christmas drove a massive spike in cases in Scotland.\nAt the beginning of the year, the number of weekly cases per 100,000 people in Scotland almost reached 300, triggering a full lockdown which has now lasted almost four months.\nBut there has been a sustained decline in weekly cases since January, with the rate falling to below 35 on 13 April.\nUsing a World Health Organization (WHO) system for measuring infection levels, this indicates Scotland has a \"moderate\" level of community transmission of the virus.\nThe rate is now the lowest it has been since September and still appears to be falling.\nScotland's death rate also spiked in January after the Kent variant spread rapidly among the population.\nIt is believed that the variant can lead to a higher chance of hospitalisation and death, as well as being much more infectious.\nTowards the end of January the number of weekly Covid deaths per 100,000 people within 28 days of a positive test went higher than eight.\nThis figure went below 1.0 on 14 March and by 12 April it had fallen to 0.1.\nThe Scottish government says this sustained decline in the death rate has been achieved through a combination of people sticking to lockdown rules, and the vaccination of those most vulnerable to becoming severely ill or dying from Covid-19.\nAccording to the WHO's thresholds, the death rate in Scotland indicates \"low\" levels of community transmission.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nBy this measure the 14-day average on 12 April was 1.9% - just below the WHO's 2% threshold indicating a \"low\" level of community transmission.\nIt's worth pointing out that the WHO's preferred way of measuring the positivity rate is through \"sentinel surveillance\", or random community testing, which is not how the Scottish government reports it in its daily figures.\nHowever, the organisation lists \"overall test positivity\" as an additional measure if a comprehensive testing system is in place.\nIt's expected that all of Scotland will harmonise at level three from 26 April.\nRates in all local authorities have fallen in the last couple of months, but there are still significant differences between areas.\nThere have been very few cases recently in Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles or in Dumfries and Galloway, contrasting with much higher rates in Clackmannanshire, North Lanarkshire and West Lothian.\nThis variation in rates is one the Scottish government will continue to watch carefully, as public health officials try to avoid importing cases from areas of high levels of the virus to communities with low levels. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that there may still be a need in future for some \"limited travel restrictions\" within Scotland to prevent this happening.\nOn 9 April, there were 10 local authorities with a higher level of cases than the Scotland-wide rate - and six are still categorised as having \"high\" levels of community transmission according to the WHO.\nThe WHO outlines five \"situational levels\" ranging from level zero, when there should be \"no restrictions\" on daily activities, up to level four which requires a full lockdown to tackle an \"uncontrolled epidemic\".\nUsing measures like the death rate and the percentage of positive cases, the WHO system indicates that Scotland is currently sitting in level one or two, which is when more stringent rules like travel restrictions can be lifted.\nIn other words, Scotland does appear ready to come out of a full lockdown.\nThe WHO says that in level two some additional measures may be required to control transmission, however, \"disruptions to social and economic activities can still be limited\".\nIn level one, \"basic measures\" should remain in place to prevent Covid infections spreading, but any disruptions to social and economic life should be \"limited and transient\".\nBut there is an important caveat to the WHO document, which possibly casts an even more optimistic light on Scotland's situation - it was written in November and so does not take into account a country's vaccination programme.\nAbout 60% of people aged 16 or over in Scotland have now received at least a first dose of a Covid vaccine, with hopes that the programme will be complete by the end of July.\nIn recent weeks there has been a focus on administering second doses of the vaccine, with more than 600,000 people in Scotland now fully vaccinated.\nThe Scottish government also says that everyone in the nine priority groups, as set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, has now been offered a vaccine, with almost all the over-50s having received a first dose."

It will come in zero-plastic packaging made from paper and wood fibre.\nThe aim of the sets is to raise \"environmental consciousness\" among children, and \"empower the next generation of Matchbox fans to help steer us towards a sustainable future,\" Roberto Stanichi, global head of vehicles at Mattel, told the BBC. \n\"Since the inception of the modern-day die-cast car nearly 70 years ago, Matchbox has been using design and innovation to connect kids with the real world around them through play,\" he added.\nThe formerly UK-based Matchbox, which is now owned by US toymaker Mattel, was created in 1953 and sells more than 40 million die-cast vehicles each year.\nMattel, which also owns the Hot Wheels brand, plans to use 100% recycled, recyclable or bio-based plastic materials in the manufacturing of all its products and packaging by 2030.\nLego has said it will start replacing plastic packaging with paper bags this year as the toy brick maker aims to become more sustainable.\nThe Danish company said it had been prompted by letters from children asking it to remove the single-use plastic bags.\nLego will also be investing up to $400m (\u00a3310m) over three years to improve its sustainability efforts.\nLego bricks themselves are made of plastic, although the company is exploring alternative materials.\nWaitrose has said it will no longer sell children's magazines with plastic disposable toys to help tackle pollution.\nThe retailer said the free plastic toys have a short lifespan and cannot easily be recycled.\nThis comes amid calls from some of the children they are aimed at to stop giving away free plastic toys."

      "text": "Driving to Taliban-controlled territory doesn't take long. Around 30 minutes from the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, passing large craters left by roadside bombs, we meet our host: Haji Hekmat, the Taliban's shadow mayor in Balkh district.\nPerfumed and in a black turban, he's a veteran member of the group, having first joined the militants in the 1990s when they ruled over the majority of the country. \nThe Taliban have arranged a display of force for us. Lined up on either side of the street are heavily armed men, one carrying a rocket propelled grenade launcher, another an M4 assault rifle captured from US forces. Balkh was once one of the more stable parts of the country; now it's become one of the most violent. \nBaryalai, a local military commander with a ferocious reputation, points down the road, \"the government forces are just there by the main market, but they can't leave their bases. This territory belongs to the mujahideen\".\nIt's a similar picture across much of Afghanistan: the government controls the cities and bigger towns, but the Taliban are encircling them, with a presence in large parts of the countryside.\nThe militants assert their authority through sporadic checkpoints along key roads. As Taliban members stop and question passing cars, Aamir Sahib Ajmal, the local head of the Taliban's intelligence service, tells us they're searching for people linked to the government.\n\"We will arrest them, and take them prisoner,\" he says. \"Then we hand them over to our courts and they decide what will happen next.\"\nThe Taliban believe victory is theirs. Sitting over a cup of green tea, Haji Hekmat proclaims, \"we have won the war and America has lost\". The decision by US President Joe Biden to delay the withdrawal of remaining US forces to September, meaning they will remain in the country past the 1 May deadline agreed last year, has sparked a sharp reaction from the Taliban's political leadership. Nonetheless, momentum seems to be with the militants. \n\"We are ready for anything,\" says Haji Hekmat. \"We are totally prepared for peace, and we are fully prepared for jihad.\" Sitting next to him, a military commander adds: \"Jihad is an act of worship. Worship is something that, however much of it you do, you don't get tired.\" \nFor the past year, there has been an apparent contradiction in the Taliban's \"jihad\". They stopped attacks on international forces following the signing of an agreement with the US, but continued to fight with the Afghan government. Haji Hekmat, though, insists there is no contradiction. \"We want an Islamic government ruled by the Sharia. We will continue our jihad until they accept our demands.\"\nOn whether or not the Taliban would be willing to share power with other Afghan political factions, Haji Hekmat defers to the group's political leadership in Qatar. \"Whatever they decide we will accept,\" he repeatedly says.\nThe Taliban don't see themselves as a mere rebel group, but as a government-in-waiting. They refer to themselves as the \"Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,\" the name they used when in power from 1996 until being overthrown in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. \nNow, they have a sophisticated \"shadow\" structure, with officials in charge of overseeing everyday services in the areas they control. Haji Hekmat, the Taliban mayor, takes us on a tour. \nWe're shown a primary school, filled with young boys and girls scribbling in UN-donated textbooks. While in power in the 1990s, the Taliban banned female education, though they often deny that. Even now, there are reports that in other areas older girls are not allowed to attend classes. But here at least the Taliban say they're actively encouraging it. \n\"As long as they wear hijab, it's important for them to study,\" says Mawlawi Salahuddin, in charge of the Taliban's local education commission. In secondary schools, he says, only female teachers are allowed, and the veil is mandatory. \"If they follow the Sharia, there is no problem.\" \nLocal sources told us the Taliban removed art and citizenship classes from the curriculum, replacing them with Islamic subjects, but otherwise follow the national syllabus. \nSo do the Taliban send their own daughters to school? \"My daughter's very young, but when she grows up, I will send her to school and the madrassa, as long as it's implementing the hijab and Sharia,\" says Salahuddin. \nThe government pays the salaries of staff, but the Taliban are in charge. It's a hybrid system in place across the country. \nAt a nearby health clinic, run by an aid organisation, it's a similar story. The Taliban allow female staff to work, but they must have a male chaperone at night, and the male and female patients have been segregated. Contraception and information about family planning is readily available. \nThe Taliban clearly want us to see them in a more positive light. When we drive past a crowd of schoolgirls making their way home, Haji Hekmat gestures excitedly, proud to be contradicting our expectations. Concerns over the Taliban's views on women's rights remain, however. The group has no female representation at all, and in the 1990s prevented women from working outside the home. \nDriving through the villages in Balkh district, we do see plenty of women, not all of whom are wearing the all-encompassing burqa, walking around freely. At the local bazaar, however, there are none. Haji Hekmat insists there is no ban on them, though in a conservative society he says they generally wouldn't attend in any case. \nWe are accompanied by the Taliban at all times, and the few local residents we speak to all profess their support for the group, and gratitude to them for improving security and decreasing crime. \"When the government were in control, they used to jail our people and demand bribes to free them,\" says one elderly man. \"Our people suffered a lot, now we are happy with the situation.\" \nThe Taliban's ultra-conservative values do clash less with those in more rural areas, but many, particularly in the cities, fear they want to resurrect the brutal Islamic Emirate of the 1990s, undercutting freedoms that many young people have grown up with over the past two decades. \nOne local resident spoke to us later, on condition of anonymity, and told us the Taliban were far stricter than they admitted in our interviews. He described villagers being slapped or beaten for shaving their beards, or having stereos smashed for listening to music. \"People have no choice but to do what they say,\" he told the BBC, \"even over minor issues they get physical. People are scared.\"\nHaji Hekmat was part of the Taliban in the 1990s. While the younger fighters milling around us are happy snapping photos and selfies, he initially moves to cover his face with his turban when he sees our camera. \"Old habits,\" he says with a grin, before later allowing us to film his face. Under the Taliban's old regime, photography was banned. \nDid they make mistakes when in power, I ask him? Would they behave in the same way again now?\n\"The Taliban before and the Taliban now are the same. So comparing that time and now - nothing has changed,\" says Haji Hekmat. \"But,\" he adds, \"there are changes in personnel of course. Some people are harsher and some are calmer. That's normal.\"\nThe Taliban have appeared to be deliberately vague about what they mean by the \"Islamic government\" they want to create. Some analysts see that as a deliberate attempt to avoid internal frictions between hardline and more moderate elements. Can they both accommodate those with different views and not alienate their own base? Coming into power could prove their biggest test. \nAs we eat a lunch of chicken and rice, we hear the rumble of at least four separate airstrikes in the distance. Haji Hekmat is unperturbed. \"It's far away, don't worry,\" he says. \nAirpower, particularly that provided by the Americans, has been crucial over the years in holding back the Taliban's advance. The US already drastically cut back its military operations after signing an agreement with the Taliban last year, and many fear that following their withdrawal the Taliban will be placed to launch a military takeover of the country. \nHaji Hekmat derides the Afghan government, or \"Kabul administration\" as the Taliban refer to it, as corrupt and un-Islamic. It's hard to see how men like him will reconcile with others in the country, unless it's on their own terms.\n\"This is jihad,\" he says, \"it is worship. We don't do it for power but for Allah and His law. To bring Sharia to this country. Whoever stands against us we will fight against them.\" "

      "tags": "David Cameron,Eric Pickles,Greensill Capital,Lobbying in the United Kingdom,Lobbying,Civil Service",
      "text": "A former senior civil servant embroiled in a row over his job at Greensill Capital took another post without reporting it, it has emerged.\nBill Crothers has come under fire for working at the now-failed finance firm while still on the government payroll.\nIt has now come to light he took on another trustee role without seeking the advice of the necessary committee.\nMr Crothers apologised to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments for what he called an \"honest mistake\".\nBut the chair of the committee, Lord Eric Pickles, said he had breached government rules.\nThe news comes after Lord Pickles warned the existing guidelines on ministers and top officials taking jobs with private firms needed urgent reforms as there did not appear to be \"any boundaries at all\" between civil servants and the private sector.\nLabour says things are becoming \"murkier\" and lobbyists have an \"open door\" to government. \nThe government has announced a review of contacts between top officials and ministers after the row over Greensill Capital, access, influence and lobbying has engulfed Westminster.\nThe review will include former prime minister David Cameron's dealing with the firm, as well as Mr Crothers.\nIt will be led by Nigel Boardman, a non-executive board member of the department for business. \nA number of Commons Select Committees have also announced their own inquiries. \nOn Wednesday, Mr Johnson ordered Conservative MPs to vote down Labour's call for a \"full\" MP-led inquiry into Greensill and lobbying more widely.\nIt emerged on Tuesday that Mr Crothers - a former government procurement officer - joined Greensill as an adviser in 2015 while still working as a civil servant, after getting the go-ahead from the Cabinet Office. \nBut an exchange of letters between him and Lord Pickles, published on Thursday, also revealed he had failed to alert the committee about a different job he took in 2016 as a trustee with the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply\nMr Crothers apologised in his letter for what he described an \"honest mistake\", saying he did not think he had to report the role as it was unpaid and with a not-for-profit charity.\nBut Lord Pickles said the rules applied to both paid and unpaid jobs and it was therefore a breach of the regulations.\nEarlier, the Tory peer Lord Pickles told the Commons public administration committee he had warned of a scandal but the Greensill lobbying affair was \"not where I expected it to come from\".\nHe added: \"There is nothing wrong with lobbyists. What is wrong is with unregulated lobbying, secret lobbying - people getting an undue advantage.\n\"Our entire political careers have been built by lobbying of some sort. But where it becomes wrong is where it is not properly regulated and is transparent.\"\nSpeaking about Mr Crothers, Lord Pickles said it was not unusual for civil servants to have second jobs and to share their expertise.\nBut he said the former civil servant's \"excuse\" when justifying his work with Greensill surprised him.\n\"It did seem, talking to other colleagues who had enjoyed being civil servants in the past, that they also shared my surprise - this seems to be a new thing, or a new excuse,\" he said.\nHe said contractors and consultants to the government should have to sign a memorandum of understanding about the restrictions that would be placed on them after completing their public sector work.\nLord Pickles also expressed his frustration that his committee had a \"very limited and defined role\", but added that most people do follow the rules and it is \"only a tiny minority\" who cause problems.\nSpeaking on a visit to Dartmouth College in Devon, Boris Johnson said he agreed with Lord Pickles that reform was needed. \nThe PM said: \"I think the most important thing is for us to get to the bottom of it properly and I want all ministers and civil servants to be making the information that needs to be known known to Mr Boardman and let's see what he has to say.\n\"We need to understand what's gone on here.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said more and stronger lobbying rules are needed because the current system \"is not working\".\nHe said ministers were being lobbied for \"massive\" procurement contracts \"involving millions sometimes billions of pounds\". \nHe added: \"Increasingly we're seeing a murkier and murkier picture whether it's the way contracts are handed out, the lack of due process or the lobbying which is not a revolving door, it's an open door now in to government\".

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nMost positive rapid coronavirus tests taken since 8 March appear to have returned a correct result, according to data seen by the BBC. Analysis of data from Public Health England shows 82% sent off for a confirmatory PCR test returned the same positive result. \"This suggests that people who test positive using a lateral flow device should definitely take that result seriously, and isolate while waiting for a follow-up PCR test,\" says Prof Oliver Johnson, director of the institute for statistical science at the University of Bristol. All secondary schools and colleges in England have been using the devices since 8 March along with care homes, universities and some workplaces. There had been concerns that many people would have to self-isolate needlessly but this data suggests these fears may be unfounded.\nIntroducing Covid status certificates to help reopen society risks discriminating against some groups, the UK equality watchdog has warned. The certificates, also known as Covid passports, which prove who is vaccinated could help to ease restrictions \"in principle\", the Equality and Human Rights Commission says. But they could create a \"two-tier society whereby only certain groups are able to fully enjoy their rights\". The commission also raises concerns about proposals to make vaccination a condition of employment for some workers, saying \"a blanket policy requiring workers to be vaccinated, applied inflexibly, is likely to be unlawful\" because there are a small number of people who are not able to have the jab.\nStormont ministers will be asked to approve the full reopening of retail outlets in Northern Ireland on 30 April, the BBC understands. Close contact services such as hairdresser and beauty salons will reopen the week before. Outdoor visitor attractions will also open that week, if the dates being proposed are agreed by the executive on Thursday.  It's thought that outdoor hospitality for pubs will have to wait until 10 May before being allowed to welcome back customers. Details will be outlined to assembly members at a special sitting.\nMore than a year into the pandemic, deaths in Brazil are now at their peak. But despite the overwhelming evidence that Covid-19 rarely kills young children, in Brazil 1,300 babies have died from the virus. One doctor refused to test Jessika Ricarte's one-year-old son for Covid, saying his symptoms did not fit the profile of the virus. Two months later he died of complications from the disease. Nathalia Passarinho and Luis Barrucho from BBC Brazil look at what's going on.\nIt's said that strength comes in numbers, and that is what award-winning food producer Angharad Underwood found during the pandemic. When Covid-19 hit last year, Ms Underwood was faced with having to temporarily close her business, The Preservation Society. With other local food producers in the same precarious position, 25 of them decided that instead of shutting up shop, they would pool their resources and join together. So in May 2020 they formed the Wye Valley Producers co-operative. \"It's likely that many of us would have furloughed for the duration otherwise,\" says Ms Underwood, who makes jams, chutneys and other preserves in south-east Wales. \"Instead, we had people to lean on - guidance, encouragement and ideas. We realised that by joining together we could make a difference.\"\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nIf you're not sure about how many people you can have a drink with now that some restrictions have eased in England, have a read of this to find out.

      "tags": "Surgery,Waiting times,NHS England,Cancer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Around 4.7 million people were waiting for routine operations and procedures in England in February - the most since 2007, NHS England figures show.\nNearly 388,000 people were waiting more than a year for non-urgent surgery compared with just 1,600 before the pandemic began.\nDuring January and February, the pressure on hospitals caused by Covid-19 was particularly acute.\nNHS England said two million operations took place despite the winter peak.\nHowever, surgeons said hospitals were still under huge pressure due to the second wave of Covid, which had led to \"a year of uncertainty, pain and isolation\" for patients waiting for planned treatment.\nSpeaking on a visit to Dartmouth, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would \"make sure that we give the NHS all the funding that it needs... to beat the backlog\".\nHe said the situation had been \"made worse by Covid\", and added: \"We do need people to take up their appointments and to get the treatment that they need.\"\nNHS England recently announced that a \u00a31bn fund would be used to help trusts restore operations and other services to get as many people treated as possible.\nProfessor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS in England, said treating 400,000 patients with Covid-19 over the course of the last year had \"inevitably had an impact on the NHS\".\nAround 40% of all patients who have received hospital treatment for Covid since the pandemic began were admitted in the first two months of the year.\nBut he said \"the hard work and dedication of staff\" helped to deliver almost two million operations and procedures \"in the face of the winter wave\".\nTim Mitchell, vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: \"Although the most urgent operations, for cancer and life-threatening conditions went ahead, hundreds of thousands of patients waiting for routine surgery such as hip and knee operations, cochlear implants and vascular operations had their treatment cancelled or postponed.\n\"People have been patient as they've seen the battering the pandemic has given the NHS, but how much longer can they be expected to wait?\" \nSurgeons are calling for massive investment in the health service so that vital operations can continue no matter what comes its way in the future.\nZen Kahn, from London, spent much of the past year in pain waiting for a vital, but not urgent, operation to remove a mass on his pancreas.\nThe 23-year-old, who has severe learning difficulties and mental health issues, was originally told he would have surgery in September 2020 - but in the end he waited until March 2021.\n\"He was losing weight, turning yellow, and getting weaker and weaker,\" his older brother Waqas says of that time.\nZen continued to be in pain and was on strong painkillers for a long time.\n\"It definitely affected my mum a lot - she was completely devastated,\" his brother says.\n\"Just to see him deteriorate daily, it was hard on us as a family.\"\nDr Katie Urch, divisional director of surgery at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, where Zen was treated, said surgery that was \"absolutely time-critical\" was prioritised.\n\"As our services begin to resume, our clinical teams are constantly reviewing our waiting lists to ensure we're managing care as safely and effectively as possible,\" she said.\nThe full scale of the backlog of non-Covid work which has built up because hospitals had to focus on coronavirus patients has been laid bare again.\nThings are likely to get worse before they get better as the NHS tries to deal with new patients being referred for treatment as well as those already on waiting lists.\nThere is no obvious quick fix. The workforce is already over-stretched and training more staff takes years. The government has allocated some extra cash to the NHS in England to try to help deal with the backlog. \nBut there have been calls for significant extra investment to fund overtime payments and make maximum seven-days-a-week use of operating theatres. \nThere have been warnings that the NHS in all parts of the UK will take years to recover from the consequences of Covid care and longer-term plans to expand the workforce and build new hospital facilities will be needed soon.\nCancer figures for England show that the number of people starting treatment for the disease in February 2021 was 6% lower compared with the same time last year.\nAlthough there has been a slight improvement in the numbers referred to a cancer specialist by their GP since January, the total number over the past year is more than 370,000 down on normal, Macmillan Cancer Support said. \nSara Bainbridge, head of policy at the charity said: \"Tens of thousands of people are still missing a diagnosis due to disruption caused by the pandemic, which could affect their prognosis. \n\"It's vital that cancer services continue to be prioritised and that those with cancer are not forgotten.\"\nCancer Research UK said without the funding and resources the NHS needs, \"the UK faces the prospect of cancer survival going backwards for the first time in decades\"."

      "text": "The owner of Edinburgh's Jenners building has begun an investigation after signs bearing its name were removed from the landmark shop.\nWitnesses spotted the distinctive gold-coloured lettering being taken down on Wednesday. \nA spokesman for the Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, who owns the listed building, said they were \"very surprised\" the signs had been removed. \nFrasers Group, which operates the store, has been asked for comment.\nCity of Edinburgh Council said it was also investigating whether the removal of the signs was a breach of planning rules \"given the historical significance of the building\". \n\"We'll take action if appropriate,\" Neil Gardiner, the planning convener added. \nThe Jenners building has occupied a prime location on Princes Street for 183 years.\nIt was bought by Mr Povlsen - who is one of Scotland's biggest landowners - in 2017, reportedly for \u00a353m.\nThe store is currently operated by the Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, which owns the commercial rights to the Jenners trading name.\nIt said it would be quitting the site in May after the two sides were unable to come to an agreement.\nFrasers Group includes Sports Direct, House of Fraser and Evans Cycles.\nAnders Krogh Vogdrup - the director of AAA United, which owns the Jenners building - told BBC Scotland: \"We are very surprised seeing the signage being taken down. We are convinced that the signage is part of the listed building.\n\"We have not discussed any such step with Sports Direct, and certainly not given any authorisation to do so. We will look in to this matter, contacting Sports Direct. \n\"We can only once again emphasise that the Jenners building of Edinburgh is an institution and, despite the changing face of retail, it is our aspiration that there will continue to be a retail store for as long as we are its stewards.\n\"Our involvement in the Jenners building, is first and foremost about helping to preserve a unique historic building in Edinburgh. Already when we acquired the building, we knew that it came with a great deal of responsibility. \n\"Jenners is an iconic building in Edinburgh, and we take the responsibility very seriously. \"\nThe building owner is currently in advanced talks with a new tenant to move into the department store."

      "tags": "ITV,Stalking",
      "text": "The ex-husband of an ITV Wales presenter has been jailed after a nine-year campaign of harassment and stalking during their marriage.\nJonathan Wignall, 54, set alerts for Ruth Dodsworth's TV appearances, accessed her phone with her fingerprint as she slept and tracked her car.\nLast month Wignall pleaded guilty to one count of coercive and controlling behaviour and stalking.\nOn Wednesday he was jailed for three years at Cardiff Crown Court.\nHe was also given a restraining order against contacting Ms Dodsworth. \nThe court was told Wignall had a \"fragile ego\" and repeatedly accused Ms Dodsworth, 45, of being unfaithful.\nHe refused to let her go to filming locations without him, would turn up at ITV Wales' Cardiff studio unannounced and forced her to spend her lunch hour with him in the company's car park.\nThe court heard the couple met in 2001, a year after Ms Dodsworth started her job as a weather presenter, and were married in 2002.\nWignall's controlling behaviour began in about 2010 when the couple moved from Swansea to Cowbridge in the Vale of Glamorgan. \nShe had become the family's main breadwinner as his nightclub business began failing.\nProsecutor Claire Pickthall said: \"His alcohol intake increased as did his controlling and coercive behaviour towards Ms Dodsworth.\"\nIn October 2016, the court heard, family members witnessed Wignall pushing his wife over, causing her to fracture a rib. \nAnother time, it was told, he pushed her and grabbed her by the neck.\nWignall was said to have called his wife \"incessantly\" when she was working away, and that while home he would open her mail and stand outside the door as she used the bathroom.\nHe would accompany her to doctors' appointments and quiz contacts on her phone about the nature of their relationship.\nMs Pickthall said: \"On one occasion she woke during the night to find him pressing her fingertip against her phone to access the fingerprint ID feature, and ultimately her phone.\"\nWhen Ms Dodsworth decided not to return home after a shift on 17 October 2019, Wignall called her 155 times and threatened to kill himself.\nWhen Wignall was arrested on suspicion of harassment, he told police: \"Harassment? But she's my wife.\"\nWignall was later released on bail on condition he did not contact Ms Dodsworth, but messages he sent to family members raised suspicions he had planted a tracker on her car by December 2019.\nThat was found and police found an app on his phone and laptop linked to it, as well as an alarm set to go off when Ms Dodsworth was on television.\nMs Dodsworth told the court via video link she had been left with \"heavy debts\" after discovering Wignall had borrowed money under their name.\nAfter his arrest she was told she was being evicted because Wignall had not paid bills.\nMs Dodsworth also discovered he had pawned her jewellery.\nShe said: \"Because of my television career I've had to try and portray a smiley, happy, sunshine-like personality every day, when how I felt was everything but.\"\nMs Dodsworth said she was left feeling \"degraded\" at work by her ex-partner's behaviour, and her confidence and health had deteriorated.\nDyfed Thomas, defending, said Wignall previously ran a \"phenomenally successful business\" with the Escape nightclub in Swansea and the city's annual Escape In The Park festival.\nWhen both came \"crashing down\" it affected his relationship with Ms Dodsworth.\nHe said Wignall had been \"besotted\" with her and was \"sorry for his behaviour\".\nBut Judge Daniel Williams told Wignall it was \"clear you have no remorse\".\nHe said: \"You affect the air of a respectable and beleaguered but successful businessman. You're not.\n\"You're a fantasist with a fragile ego which makes you an unrepentant, possessive bully.\"\nWignall was sentenced to three years in custody and will serve half before being released on licence.\nHe was also given a restraining order against contacting Ms Dodsworth."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Introducing Covid status certificates to help reopen society risks discriminating against some groups, the UK equality watchdog has warned.\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission says certificates to prove who is vaccinated could help to ease restrictions \"in principle\".\nBut they could create a \"two-tier society whereby only certain groups are able to fully enjoy their rights\".\nBlanket mandatory vaccination policies are \"likely to be unlawful\", it added.\nThe independent commission says Covid status certificates - sometimes called Covid passports - could discriminate against marginalised groups where take-up of the vaccine is lower, as well as the small number of people who cannot have the vaccine for medical reasons.\nRequiring the certificates for travel, going to work, enjoying social activities or accessing essential services could risk further excluding people from some ethnic minority groups, migrants and people from lower socio-economic groups, the watchdog said.\nBaroness Kishwer Falkner, chair of the EHRC, said if the certificates are introduced, they must be time-limited and regularly reviewed by Parliament to ensure they are proportionate. She said those who cannot take the vaccine must have easy access to exemption documentation.\n\"We would monitor the rollout to ensure the right balance is struck between protecting the public's health and our individual freedoms,\" she said.\nMore than 32m people in the UK have now received a first dose of the vaccine, and more than 8m have received both doses. The government has said it is on course to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July.\nMinisters have suggested that Covid status certificates would be introduced for a limited time only, and that they would allow people to record whether they had been vaccinated, recently tested negative or had natural immunity from a confirmed infection in the last six months.\nThe FA Cup final in May is one large-scale event where certification will be trialled.\nThe equality watchdog also raised concerns about proposals to make vaccination a condition of employment for some workers.\nMandatory vaccination is a \"significant departure from current public health policy\" and it might lead to employers placing contractual requirements on staff to have other vaccinations, such as the flu jab, the EHRC said.\nIt said \"a blanket policy requiring workers to be vaccinated, applied inflexibly, is likely to be unlawful\" because there are a small number of people who are not able to be vaccinated.\nThey include people with severe allergies to ingredients in the vaccine, while pregnant women cannot routinely be offered Covid vaccines, the EHRC said.\nAny policy would also need to reflect the progress of the vaccine rollout, so it does not discriminate against younger people who have not been offered immunisation yet.\nThe watchdog said that, with a few exceptions, it is against the law for an employer to ask questions about a job applicant's health - including vaccination status - before making an offer of employment.\nA job advert which requires Covid-19 vaccination may be seen as discriminating against pregnant women who cannot be vaccinated, which would also be against the law, the EHRC said.\nMinisters are considering a proposal to require care home staff to be vaccinated in order to protect vulnerable residents, as nearly half of all care homes for older adults do not meet the recommended vaccination threshold.\nCare home staff who cannot take the vaccine for medical reasons would be exempt from the plan, however.\nThe chairman of Pimlico Plumbers, a large plumbing firm employing self-employed contractors in London, has also said the company plans to rewrite its workers' contracts to require them to be vaccinated against Covid-19.\nAny mandatory vaccine policy must be \"objectively justified\" and applied in a way that is \"proportionate\", it said."

      "text": "A pub owner has been jailed after admitting responsibility for the death of a seven-year-old boy who was electrocuted in a beer garden. \nHarvey Tyrrell suffered a huge electric shock when he touched \"defective\" lighting at the King Harold in Romford, east London, on 11 September 2018. \nDavid Bearman, 73, pleaded guilty to Harvey's manslaughter and to stealing electricity from an unmetered supply.\nHe was sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court to nine years in prison.\nThe electrician who installed the lighting, Bearman's brother-in-law Colin Naylor, was jailed for a year after being found guilty of failing to discharge a duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act.\nThe 74-year-old, of Hockley Road, Rayleigh, Essex, was previously acquitted of gross negligence manslaughter.\nHis trial had heard he had installed the lighting circuit around the garden's perimeter in June 2018, three months before Harvey died.\nAn investigation into Harvey's death found 12 defects at the pub which posed a risk of injury including electric shock, and 32 potentially dangerous defects, with one expert describing it as \"the most dangerous thing he's ever seen in 40 years\".\nBearman, who himself suffered an electric shock in the pub's basement in May 2018, never engaged a \"competent person\" to fix numerous electric defects, the court heard. \n\"He [Harvey] was electrocuted as a result of the unsafe installation of a lighting unit in that garden combined with a catalogue of electrical failures,\" prosecutor Duncan Penny QC said.\nIn a victim impact statement, Harvey's mother Danielle Jones said she had lost her \"perfect seven-year-old\".\n\"We feel like life's just not fair. We can't describe how much we miss our larger-than-life, cheeky, happy, loving son. \n\"Our lives will never be the same,\" she said.\nNaylor denied any wrongdoing and told police in an interview that he was an electrician with 50 years' experience and believed his work to be \"first class\".\nBearman's barrister, Neil Fitzgibbon, said his client's guilty plea was an acceptance of \"full responsibility\" for Harvey's death and he was a \"broken man, consumed with guilt about what happened\".\nSentencing the two men, Judge Martyn Zeidman QC said: \"This pub was a disgrace. And as has been said sums it up, in my view, a timebomb waiting to go off.\""

      "text": "More families and friends have been able to reunite in parks, gardens and beaches across Scotland after months in lockdown. \nRestrictions have been eased allowing people to travel between council areas and meet more people outdoors.\nMichael Mancini, who runs the Ice Cream Factory at Troon, South Ayrshire, said the beach was \"heaving\" with visitors. \n\"We have been absolutely flying today. It has been brilliant, absolutely brilliant,\" he told BBC Radio Scotland. \nThe change to the rules means it is now possible to travel out of your local area for non-essential reasons and for six people from up to six households to meet up outdoors.\nThe relaxation had not been due to come into force until 26 April but the government said the changes were being made earlier in an effort to boost people's mental health and wellbeing.\nHowever, significant restrictions remain in place.\nPeople cannot stay overnight outside their council area - even in a tent or caravan.\nAnd the advice remains to shop within your own council area unless there are no practical alternatives.\nWhile six people can meet up outdoors, the guidance is to minimise meetings, maintain 2m distancing and \"use common sense\".\nSt Andrews' famous West Sands beach was one popular spot for family reunions.\nAnn Buchanan, who lives near Stirling, met up with relatives from East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, whom she had not seen since last year.\nShe told BBC Scotland: \"We have not been able to meet up for ages, for such a long time, and it is really nice to get together here.\n\"This is such a lovely place to come and relax and have a bit of a catch up.\"\nMs Buchanan joked: \"This is the furthest I have driven in a year. It's just like passing your driving test again.\"\nAndrew McVie, 27, from Glasgow, said he was \"super excited\" to be visiting Millport, on the Isle of Cumbrae, to cycle round the island for the first time in more than two years.\nThe clerical assistant said: \"You can do it in about two hours if you don't stop. It's why a lot of people like it.\n\"There's great scenery and it's a really nice, friendly, welcoming place and it's a beautiful day.\n\"I've missed it so much not being able to go because of the travel restrictions but I'll still be taking precautions.\"\nMr McVie added that he plans to visit Edinburgh with friends on on Saturday for the first time in more than a year.\nJames Fraser, chairman of The Friends of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime the national park was not as busy as he had anticipated.\nMr Fraser put this down to people prioritising meeting up with their loved ones on day one of the travel restrictions being eased.\nBut he added: \"I think it will be a lot busier over the weekend if this weather holds up. There is no doubt about that so we would advise people to travel early.\n\"I am sure we will get to a stage where all the car parks are full and people will be getting turned away.\"\nDouglas Cairns, of Traffic Scotland's control centre, urged people to allow extra time for their journeys.\nHe told the programme: \"This is the first relaxation where we are allowed to travel outwith our local authority area so there will be a slight increase in demand and, obviously, that is based around weather as well.\"\nEarlier, Scotland's chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that people may be uncertain about using another household's toilet during a meet up - but that \"pragmatism\" was important.\nHe said: \"Of course there might be a risk going into someone's house but if people are very, very careful and they make sure they're taking precautions - washing their hands afterwards -  nipping in to use someone's toilet is not something I think anyone would frown on. \n\"What we don't want to see is people using that as an excuse to nip inside for cup of tea with people and sitting in unventilated areas.\"\nHe said the outdoors - with \"free circulating air\" - was much safer than indoors. \nThe next significant easing of restrictions on 26 April should see all shops and some hospitality reopen.\nAt that point, someone visiting a friend in another part of the country will be able choose to book into a hotel or bed and breakfast for the night.\nAll remaining shops and close contact services like nail salons are also due to reopen on 26 April.\nPubs, bars, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and bars will be able to serve people outdoors - in groups of up to six from six households - until 22:00 from that date.\nAlcohol will be permitted, and there will be no requirement for food to be served.\nTakeaways will be able to resume normal service, with physical distancing and face masks worn in premises\nThere will also be a partial resumption of indoor hospitality, with food and non-alcoholic drinks being served until 20:00 for groups of up to four people from no more than two households.

      "title": "Prince Philip: An extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life",
      "tags": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Queen Elizabeth II",
      "text": "He outlived nearly everyone who knew him and might explain him.\nAnd so we have been left with a two-dimensional portrait of the duke; salt-tongued and short-tempered, a man who told off-colour jokes and made politically incorrect remarks, an eccentric great-uncle who'd been around forever and towards whom most people felt affection - but who rather too often embarrassed himself and others in company.\nWith his death will come reassessment. Because Prince Philip was an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life; a life intimately connected with the sweeping changes of our turbulent 20th Century, a life of fascinating contrast and contradiction, of service and some degree of solitude. A complex, clever, eternally restless man.\nHis mother and father met at the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. At a time when all but four of Europe's nations were monarchies, his relatives were scattered through European royalty. Some royal houses were swept away by World War One; but the world into which Philip was born was still one where monarchies were the norm. His grandfather was the King of Greece; his great-aunt Ella was murdered along with the Russian tsar, by the Bolsheviks, at Ekaterinberg; his mother was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. \nHis four older sisters would all marry Germans. While Philip fought for Britain in the Royal Navy, three of his sisters actively supported the Nazi cause; none would be invited to his wedding.  \nWhen peace came, and with it eventual economic recovery, Philip would throw himself into the construction of a better Britain, urging the country to adopt scientific methods, embracing the ideas of industrial design, planning, education and training. A decade before Harold Wilson talked of the \"white heat of the technological revolution\", Philip was urging modernity on the nation in speeches and interviews.  And as the country and the world became richer and consumed ever more, Philip warned of the impact on the environment, well before it was even vaguely fashionable.\nHe was forged by the turmoil of his first decade and then moulded by his schooling. His early years were spent wandering, as his place of birth ejected him, his family disintegrated and he moved from country to country, none of them ever his own. When he was just a year old, he and his family were scooped up by a British destroyer from his home on the Greek island of Corfu after his father had been condemned to death. They were deposited in Italy.  One of Philip's first international journeys was spent crawling around on the floor of the train from an Italian port city, \"the grubby child on the desolate train pulling out of the Brindisi night,\" as his sister Sophia later described it.\nIn Paris, he lived in a house borrowed from a relative; but it was not destined to become a home. In just one year, while he was at boarding school in Britain, the mental health of his mother, Princess Alice, deteriorated and she went into an asylum; his father, Prince Andrew, went off to Monte Carlo to live with his mistress; and his four sisters married and went to live in Germany.  In the space of 10 years he had gone from a prince of Greece to a wandering, homeless, and virtually penniless boy with no-one to care for him.\n\"I don't think anybody thinks I had a father,\" he once said. Andrew would die during the war. Philip went to Monte Carlo to pick up his father's possessions after the Germans had been driven from France; there was almost nothing left, just a couple of clothes brushes and some cuff-links.\nBy the time he went to Gordonstoun, a private school on the north coast of Scotland, Philip was tough, independent and able to fend for himself; he'd had to be. Gordonstoun would channel those traits into the school's distinct philosophy of community service, teamwork, responsibility and respect for the individual.  And it sparked one of the great passions of Philip's life - his love of the sea.\nPhilip adored the school as much as his son Charles would despise it.  Not just because the stress it put on physical as well as mental excellence - he was a great sportsman.  But because of its ethos, laid down by its founder Kurt Hahn, an exile from Nazi Germany. \nThat ethos became a significant, perhaps the significant, part of the way that Philip believed life should be lived. It shines through the speeches he gave later in his life. \"The essence of freedom,\" he would say in Ghana in 1958, \"is discipline and self-control.\" The comforts of the post-war era, he told the British Schools Exploring Society a year earlier, may be important \"but it is much more important that the human spirit should not be stifled by easy living\". And two years before that, he spoke to the boys of Ipswich School of the moral as well as material imperatives of life, with the \"importance of the individual\" as the \"guiding principle of our society\".\nAnd at Gordonstoun was born one of the great contradictions of Philip's fascinating life. The importance of the individual was what in Kurt Hahn's eyes differentiated Britain and liberal democracies from the kind of totalitarian dictatorship that he had fled. Philip put that centrality of the individual, and individual agency - the ability we have as humans to make our own moral and ethical decisions - at the heart of his philosophy. \nAnd yet he was throughout his life, first in the navy and then in the many decades of life in the Palace, tightly bound by rules of tradition, of precedent, of command and hierarchy. He had little, if anything, in the way of agency. Did he say one thing and do another, as members of the Royal Family are often accused of? Or was his first choice - to serve - by necessity his last?\nAt Dartmouth Naval College in 1939, the two great passions of his life would collide. He had learned to sail at Gordonstoun; he would learn to lead at Dartmouth. And his driving desire to achieve, and to win, would shine through. Despite entering the college far later than most other cadets, he would graduate top of his class in 1940. In further training at Portsmouth, he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the exam. He became one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy.\nThe navy ran deep in his family. His maternal grandfather had been the First Sea Lord, the commander of the Royal Navy; his uncle, \"Dickie\" Mountbatten, had command of a destroyer while Philip was in training. In war, he showed not only bravery but guile. It was his natural milieu. \"Prince Philip\", wrote Gordonstoun headmaster Kurt Hahn admiringly, \"will make his mark in any profession where he will have to prove himself in a trial of strength\".   \nOthers had their reservations about the brilliant and ambitious young officer. In peace, once he had his own command, he drove his men hard, much too hard for some.  \"If he had a fault, it was a tendency to intolerance,\" wrote one biographer.  That kind of comment would recur. Contemporaries were more blunt. \"One of his crew,\" writes another biographer, \"said he would rather die than serve under him again.\"\nIn Dartmouth in 1939, as war became ever more certain, the navy was his destiny.  He had fallen in love with the sea itself. \"It is an extraordinary master or mistress,\" he would say later, \"it has such extraordinary moods.\"  But a rival to the sea would come. \nWhen King George VI toured the Naval College, accompanied by Philip's uncle, he brought with him his daughter, Princess Elizabeth. Philip was asked to look after her. He showed off to her, vaulting the nets of the tennis court in the grounds of the college. He was confident, outgoing, strikingly handsome, of royal blood if without a throne.  She was beautiful, a little sheltered, a little serious, and very smitten by Philip.\nDid he know then that this was a collision of two great passions? That he could not have the sea and the beautiful young woman? For a time after their wedding in 1948, he did have both. As young newlyweds in Malta, he had what he so prized - command of a ship -  and they had two idyllic years together. But the illness and then early death of King George VI brought it all to an end.\nHe knew what it meant, the moment he was told.  Up in a lodge in Kenya, touring Africa, with Princess Elizabeth in place of the King, Philip was told first of the monarch's death. He looked, said his equerry Mike Parker, \"as if a tonne of bricks had fallen on him\". For some time he sat, slumped in a chair, a newspaper covering his head and chest. His princess had become the Queen.  His world had changed irrevocably.\nFor someone who almost never displayed anything close to self-pity, and rarely spoke of his own emotions, he was by his own standards candid about the loss of his naval calling. \"There's never been 'if only',\" he said once, \"except perhaps that I regret not having been able to continue a career in the navy\". Those who knew the man and his passions are blunter.  The former First Sea Lord, Admiral Lord West, says Philip did his duty; but of the end of his time in the navy he says, \"I know it was a huge loss to him.  I know it.\"\nThat moment, when princess became Queen, revealed another great contradiction of Philip's life. He was born and brought up in a world almost entirely run by men.  He was a rugged, physical man who was brought up and then worked in an entirely male environment. He celebrated masculinity, telling Mike Parker on the birth of his first son Charles, \"It takes a man to have a boy.\" But literally overnight, and for 65 years to follow, it became his life to support his wife, the Queen.\nHe would walk behind her. He would give up his job for her. He would apologise if he came into a room after her. At her coronation he knelt before her, his hands enclosed by hers, and swore to be her \"liege man of life and limb\". His children would not bear his name, Mountbatten. \"I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba,\" he exclaimed at that. But there was nothing to be done. She was the Queen. He was her husband.\nPrince Philip talked of the upending of circumstance little. \"Within the house,\" he said of the time before the Queen's accession, \"I suppose I naturally filled the principal position. People used to come and ask me what to do.  In 1952 the whole thing changed very, very considerably.\" \nThe transition to life in the Palace was brutal. \"Philip,\" said his equerry, \"was constantly being squashed, snubbed, ticked off, rapped over the knuckles... I felt Philip did not have any friends or helpers.\" Philip may not have helped himself; one biographer writes that in the early years Palace staff felt he was \"difficult to deal with... prickly... arrogant... defensive\". He was looked upon with suspicion by some in the court, as something of an adventurer, as perhaps a fortune hunter.  He had German blood, and this was just after the herculean effort of defeating Nazi Germany.\nIn response, Philip began what would become a lifetime of near-ceaseless activity; abroad he was at the side of the Queen on the long tours they undertook, sometimes breaking off to pursue interests particular to him - sporting, industrial or research. She nearly always travelled with him as her companion; but he also travelled alone.  It was he, not she, that made the farewells to colonial possessions in the 1950s and 1960s.\nAt home there were patronages and projects, hundreds upon hundreds of them, with a focus on youth, science, the outdoors and sport. He played cricket, squash, polo; he swam, sailed, rowed and rode horses and carriage drove. He learnt to fly, and developed his own photographs. \nWithin the Palace he was a moderniser, striding the corridors, rootling around the cellars, trying to find out what everyone did. He took over the management of the estate at Sandringham and over the years significantly redeveloped it. \n\"He believes he has a creative mission,\" wrote an early biographer, \"to present the monarchy as a dynamic, involved and responsive institution that will address itself to some of the problems of contemporary British society.\"\nHe was young and very good looking; he smiled and joked and was at ease in front of the cameras. When he visited a boys' club in London in the late 1950s, a photo shows him with a broad smile on his face, looking crisp in a double-breasted pinstripe suit, his hair slicked back with brilliantine, surrounded by the upturned faces of boys and their mothers all shoving and trying to get close to him. There is more than a whiff of Beatlemania to the moment.\nIn his study on the first floor of Buckingham Palace, overlooking the gardens and Green Park, surrounded by thousands of books, with a model of his first command HMS Magpie to one side, he would research and write and type out his speeches. (In 1986 he would buy, always the moderniser, what he called a \"splendid gadget\" that he called \"a miniature word processor\".) He gave between 60 and 80 speeches every year, decade after decade, on topics that reflected his vast range of interests. \nOut of the speeches comes a picture of the man.  For someone who sat through so much of it, he was clearly impatient with ceremony. \"A lot of time and energy,\" he told students and staff at the Chesterfield College of Technology, \"has been spent on arranging for you to listen to me to take a long time to declare open a building which everyone knows is open already.\"\nReflecting his dizzying range of interests, there was sometimes a touch of the gentleman-farmer to his thoughts - well-organised arguments that don't really go anywhere, a lot of anecdotal evidence (\"it seems to me...\") garnered from his extensive travels.\nDespite modernising instincts, he was a conservative, somewhat suspicious of the machinations of the big city. He spoke of \"urban dwellers\" and of the \"average citizen\" dumping rubbish from their car. He preferred practical solutions to highfalutin theory - \"The enterprise is doomed,\" he told the Commonwealth Conference on Industrial Relations, \"if it is allowed to enter the rarefied atmosphere of theory.\"\nHe was an environmentalist before anyone really knew what that was. He warned of the \"greedy and senseless exploitation of nature.\" And in 1982 he brought up a topic that now grips us, but back then was almost never spoken of, \"a hotly-debated issue directly attributable to the development of industry... the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\" which he referred to as the \"greenhouse effect\".\nAnd he constantly did himself down, shrugging as to why anyone should want to hear him speak: \"I have very little experience of self-government,\" he told one audience, \"I am one of the most governed people you could meet....\" His example of irrational behaviour? - \"making and listening to speeches on important occasions\". Or speaking before the Brussels Expo in 1958 - \"I feel I can claim to be an expert at going round exhibitions.\" He knew most speeches were a dull formality that had to be got through - and he was happy to let his audience have a laugh at his expense. \nIt is another contradiction in a life of them; that someone who cared so much about how we live our lives, about how to pursue a good and moral life, about how government and society might try to channel our instincts, should end up being popularly portrayed as a saloon-bar bore, his retirement from public life in 2017 accompanied by lists of his \"gaffes\", off-colour comments and salty jokes.\nThat he could be rude, startlingly so at times, there is no doubt. Part of it was impatience, that dynamo whirring away, the desire to get things done double-quick. Part of it may have been deafness, inherited from his almost wholly deaf mother. But part of it was just plain bad manners, a disregard for what others felt and a thoughtlessness that came from position and temperament. \nThere was for a long time a fair amount of barking and shouting at those who failed to please him, and not a lot of thanking those that did.\nLooking back down the decades, two great contrasts stand out. The first, that between a life led in the public eye, and a really quite private man. The boy shuttling between guardians and schools and countries quickly learnt to seal off his private side from public view. Inside the Palace it became his world view. Most of his biographers' personal queries were met with a shrug, as if to say \"I don't know why you are bothering\". He once said of his son Charles: \"He is a romantic, I am a pragmatist. And because I don't see things as a romantic would, I'm [perceived as] unfeeling.\" There can be little doubt that he was stung by the accusation. But his inner thoughts were not for public consumption. \nAnd the second great, related, contrast is that between the near unceasing whirl of his public life, and a degree of solitude in his private. Of course there was family, though all his sisters pre-deceased him. But few, if any, great friendships are recorded, a corollary of his private nature and the pattern of his many decades. \"Life,\" wrote one biographer, \"hasn't enabled him to build up friendships. He is going round the world at such a lick.\" And royalty is its own curious cage, repelling outsiders. \"What the royal family offers you is friendliness,\" said the late James Callaghan, prime minister in the 1970s, \"not friendship.\"  \nMajor General Charles Stickland of the Royal Marines, of which for 64 years Philip was Captain General, tells of when the duke flew into an exercise in Norway. He was supposed to say a quick hello to the enlisted men and then have lunch with the commanding officer. Instead he \"asked two of the corporals to spoon food into his mess tin, sat on a Bergan [rucksack], told stories and chatted away with my troops when he was supposed to be having a posh lunch and then got back on the helicopter, having inspired a group of young men as to why it was great to be a Royal Marine\".  \nIt was vintage Philip; no ceremony, hierarchy pushed to one side, the big group over the more intimate gathering. \nBecause of his desire for privacy, because of his position, and because nearly all who knew him best have gone, our understanding of him will always be incomplete. But that's also because of what kind of person he was, because of the contradictions and contrasts that emerged over the decades. \"A mercurial man like His Royal Highness,\" said the artist and architect Sir Hugh Casson, \"needs a loose fit portrait.\"\nHe was asked once what his life had been about (the sort of question that normally received an incredulous snort). Had it been about supporting the Queen? \"Absolutely, absolutely,\" he replied. He didn't see himself as a leader, though lead he could. And his own achievements he consistently played down. Accepting the Freedom of the City of London in 1948, he spoke for himself and for what he called other \"followers\", with trademark modesty. \"Our only distinction,\" he said, \"was that we did what we were told to do, to the very best of our ability, and kept on doing it.\""

But if you do not have that much money then you can receive financial help depending on your income.\nPeople who need an element of nursing care for a \"health need\" can get a contribution from the NHS towards their costs.\nOther individuals with complex primary healthcare needs, rather than a residential requirement, can be eligible for all their fees being paid by the NHS under a scheme called Continuing Healthcare.\nCouncils must ensure you are left with at least \u00a333 a week to spend on personal items."

But whether these embryos are human or not is open to question.\"\nProf Julian Savulescu, director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics and co-director of the Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities, University of Oxford, said the research \"opens Pandora's box to human-nonhuman chimeras\".\nHe added: \"These embryos were destroyed at 20 days of development but it is only a matter of time before human-nonhuman chimeras are successfully developed, perhaps as a source of organs for humans. That is one of the long-term goals of this research.\"\nSarah Norcross, director of the Progress Educational Trust, said that while \"substantial advances\" are being made in embryo and stem cell research, which could bring equally substantial benefits, \"there is a clear need for public discussion and debate about the ethical and regulatory challenges raised\". \nFollow Helen on Twitter."

      "text": "Introducing Covid status certificates to help reopen society risks discriminating against some groups, the UK equality watchdog has warned.\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission says certificates to prove who is vaccinated could help to ease restrictions \"in principle\".\nBut they could create a \"two-tier society whereby only certain groups are able to fully enjoy their rights\".\nBlanket mandatory vaccination policies are \"likely to be unlawful\", it added.\nThe independent commission says Covid status certificates - sometimes called Covid passports - could discriminate against marginalised groups where take-up of the vaccine is lower, as well as the small number of people who cannot have the vaccine for medical reasons.\nRequiring the certificates for travel, going to work, enjoying social activities or accessing essential services could risk further excluding people from some ethnic minority groups, migrants and people from lower socio-economic groups, the watchdog said.\nBaroness Kishwer Falkner, chair of the EHRC, said if the certificates are introduced, they must be time-limited and regularly reviewed by Parliament to ensure they are proportionate. She said those who cannot take the vaccine must have easy access to exemption documentation.\n\"We would monitor the rollout to ensure the right balance is struck between protecting the public's health and our individual freedoms,\" she said.\nMore than 32m people in the UK have now received a first dose of the vaccine, and more than 8m have received both doses. The government has said it is on course to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July.\nMinisters have suggested that Covid status certificates would be introduced for a limited time only, and that they would allow people to record whether they had been vaccinated, recently tested negative or had natural immunity from a confirmed infection in the last six months.\nThe FA Cup final in May is one large-scale event where certification will be trialled.\nThe equality watchdog also raised concerns about proposals to make vaccination a condition of employment for some workers.\nMandatory vaccination is a \"significant departure from current public health policy\" and it might lead to employers placing contractual requirements on staff to have other vaccinations, such as the flu jab, the EHRC said.\nIt said \"a blanket policy requiring workers to be vaccinated, applied inflexibly, is likely to be unlawful\" because there are a small number of people who are not able to be vaccinated.\nThey include people with severe allergies to ingredients in the vaccine, while pregnant women cannot routinely be offered Covid vaccines, the EHRC said.\nAny policy would also need to reflect the progress of the vaccine rollout, so it does not discriminate against younger people who have not been offered immunisation yet.\nThe watchdog said that, with a few exceptions, it is against the law for an employer to ask questions about a job applicant's health - including vaccination status - before making an offer of employment.\nA job advert which requires Covid-19 vaccination may be seen as discriminating against pregnant women who cannot be vaccinated, which would also be against the law, the EHRC said.\nMinisters are considering a proposal to require care home staff to be vaccinated in order to protect vulnerable residents, as nearly half of all care homes for older adults do not meet the recommended vaccination threshold.\nCare home staff who cannot take the vaccine for medical reasons would be exempt from the plan, however.\nThe chairman of Pimlico Plumbers, a large plumbing firm employing self-employed contractors in London, has also said the company plans to rewrite its workers' contracts to require them to be vaccinated against Covid-19.\nAny mandatory vaccine policy must be \"objectively justified\" and applied in a way that is \"proportionate\", it said."

We want to help them do that in a safe and age-appropriate way, and find practical solutions to the ongoing industry problem of kids lying about their age to access apps,\" the social media giant told the BBC.\n\"We're working on new age verification methods to keep under-13s off Instagram, and have just started exploring an Instagram experience for kids that is age-appropriate and managed by parents.  \n\"We agree that any experience we develop must prioritise their safety and privacy, and we will consult with experts in child development, child safety and mental health, and privacy advocates to inform it. We also won't show ads in any Instagram experience we develop for people under the age of 13.\" \nIn March, Buzzfeed reported on an internal company post in which executives discussed plans to build a version of the photo-sharing app that could be used by children who are under the legal age to join Instagram.\nFacebook, along with other social media platforms, is under growing pressure to find ways to stop the under-13s joining. But children can do so by lying about their age.\nIn the letter, the signatories point out that those under the age of 13 already on Instagram are unlikely to \"abandon it for a new site that seems babyish\".\n\"The real target of Instagram for kids will be much younger children,\" it said.\nJosh Golin, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood executive director, said: \"Instagram's business model relies on extensive data collection, maximising time on devices, promoting a culture of over-sharing and idolising influencers, as well as a relentless focus on often altered physical appearance. It is certainly not appropriate for seven-year olds.\"\nKathryn Montgomery, senior strategist at the US digital rights group Center for Digital Democracy, said: \"Facebook claims that creating an Instagram for kids will help keep them safe on the platform.\n\"But the company's real goal is to expand its lucrative and highly profitable Instagram franchise to an even younger demographic, introducing children to a powerful commercialised social media environment that poses serious threats to their privacy, health and wellbeing.\"\nThe letter cites research from the The Royal Society for Public Health which rated Instagram as the worst social media platform for youth mental health.\nThe report claims Instagram is linked to a increased risk of eating disorders, cyber-bullying and sexual grooming.\nJust this week, Instagram was forced to apologise after a \"mistake\" meant diet content was promoted to users with eating disorders.\nAnd the father of UK teenager Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017, said that the platform was partly responsible, because she had viewed material about depression and suicide on it, even though such content is banned.\n\"Instagram's focus on photo-sharing and appearance makes the platform particularly unsuitable for children who are in the midst of crucial stages of developing their sense of self,\" the letter reads.\n\"Children and teens (especially young girls) have learned to associate overly sexualised, highly edited photos of themselves with more attention on the platform, and popularity among their peers.\"\nThere is also unnecessary commercial pressure on children, says the letter, quoting analysis by digital monitoring agency Sprout Social that suggests one in every three Instagram posts is an advert.\nYouTube for Kids, which doesn't show adverts, was recently criticised for \"smuggling in\" marketing and advertising with product placements. Instagram has also faced criticism for not making it clear when posts are paid-for ads.\nThe letter added that Facebook had \"a long track record of exploiting young people\", citing a design flaw in Messenger Kids which allowed young children to circumvent parental controls.\nThe letter, addressed to Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, is signed by 35 organisations and 64 individual experts, including the Electronic Privacy Information Center, Global Action Plan and Kidscape.\nFacebook is not the only platform under fire for the way it treats young people. \nDutch privacy group the Foundation for Market Information Research has alleged that TikTok violates children's privacy under GDPR rules. It plans to file a formal complaint. "

      "text": "A former Nando's worker has become the latest winner of BBC One's amateur cookery series MasterChef.\nTom Rhodes was crowned champion after cooking a five-course lunch for lockdown heroes and serving up a dish at renowned restaurant Le Gavroche.\nThe 31-year-old from Newcastle saw off competition from fellow finalists Mike Tomkins and Alexina Anatole.\nThe final had been postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday.\nThe BBC replaced scheduled programming with news coverage about Prince Philip, with EastEnders among the other programmes affected and BBC Four taken off air completely.\nHowever, the scale of content devoted to the 99-year-old duke's death reportedly sparked a large number of complaints.\nThe rescheduled show saw the final trio fight to impress hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode with three signature dishes.\nBut it was Rhodes' Japanese-infused starter, main and dessert which proved victorious, making him the long-running programme's 17th winner.\nComplimented for \"a style bordering on minimalism\" by Wallace, Rhodes served a trio of oysters for the starter, including a beer-battered oyster with a Japanese sour plum mayonnaise.\nFor Torode, it was Rhodes' main of reverse-seared ribeye steak topped with beetroot pickled in a Japanese seaweed and a wasabi leaf that was \"modern\" and \"really very clever indeed\".\nHis dessert of a lemon tart topped with black olive meringue also received universal praise from the hosts.\n\"What he's absolutely brilliant at is European-style of cookery, with Japanese flavourings,\" Wallace said.\nSpeaking after filming ended, Rhodes said he would one day \"love to write a cookbook and have a cookery school\".\n\"During the competition, I have realised my love for developing recipes and cooking for other people outside of my friends and family, so would love to do more of this after the show,\" he said.\nTom Rhodes' winning menu\nFirst broadcast in 1990, MasterChef is one of the BBC's longest-running reality series and has inspired the popular spin-off MasterChef: The Professionals.\nThe latest series was produced under coronavirus restrictions, with many of the series' traditional assignments adjusted to allow for social distancing.\nWhile viewers found out who won last night, Rhodes has had to keep his victory a secret since the end of last year, when filming concluded. \nHe told BBC Breakfast on Thursday that the only other people who knew the result were his parents who were sworn to secrecy.\n\"You've seen the clip last night where I rang my mum on screen,\" he said. \"They've found it more difficult to keep secret than I have\".\nRhodes said taking the trophy was \"a dream come true\" and confirmed his further ambitions to become a food writer and maybe even open his own restaurant one day.\nHe said he was able to practise his winning dish two or three times before the final, but has not cooked it again at home since.\n\"I'm waiting until I can cook it for somebody and I've got a lot of requests for that so far,\" he grinned.\nWhen possible though, he plans to celebrate with \"a really good pizza\" and \"maybe a bottle of red\".\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Heathrow has said that long queues caused by extensive Covid checks at the airport are becoming \"untenable\". \nChris Garton, chief solutions officer at Heathrow, told MPs on the transport committee that some travellers faced waits of up to six hours.\nOn more than one occasion police had had to intervene because queuing was \"not something passengers want to do\", he added. \nThe Home Office said people shouldn't travel \"unless absolutely necessary\".\nA spokesperson said: \"Border Force has ensured it has the right level of resources to check that passengers are compliant with our border health measures, but queues and wait times will currently be longer as we undertake these vital checks to keep us all safe.\"\nForeign travel is only permitted for certain reasons at the moment. \nMr Garton said that all passengers, regardless of nationality, had to be thoroughly vetted before they left or entered the UK to ensure they complied with coronavirus legislation.\nHowever, he said that the queues would become a \"much bigger\" problem if rules on foreign travel are relaxed on 17 May, as the government is planning. \nCurrently, he said about 10-15,000 people arrive at the airport each day, and \"certainly more than half are having delays in excess of 2-3 hours each day\".\nHe said the current system is a \"tremendous burden on officers at the border\" and that the Home Office had not provided enough officers. \n\"We would like to see more resources at the border,\" he told the MPs.\nHe said maintaining social distancing was hard as the airport was never built to \"have so many people held up\" in queues.\nPeople in England can start thinking about booking foreign holidays again this summer, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said last week.\nBut he said the cost of the Covid tests required needed to be driven down, amid criticism from the travel industry.\nMr Shapps gave more detail on the traffic light system which will see countries graded on their risk.\nPassengers will have to take the tests before leaving and on returning - even from low-risk \"green\" countries."

      "tags": "DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Arlene Foster",
      "text": "Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster is suing TV presenter Dr Christian Jessen for defamation, saying he made an \"attack\" on her marriage.\nOn 23 December 2019, Dr Jessen tweeted an allegation that Mrs Foster had been having an extra-marital affair.\nThe post remained online until Dr Jessen deleted it on 7 January 2020.\nOn Wednesday Mrs Foster told the High Court in Belfast it had been a \"very humiliating\" time for her. Judgement has been reserved in the case.\nMrs Foster is a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and the first minister of Northern Ireland.\nDr Jessen is best known for presenting Channel Four programme Embarrassing Bodies.\nThere was no representation on behalf of Dr Jessen in court on Wednesday and the court was told 13 separate approaches by letter and email to Dr Jessen had gone \"unanswered\".\nGiving evidence to the court, Mrs Foster said she had initially been made aware of the tweet by her director of communications, who handles her social media accounts.\nThe first minister described it as \"an attack on me personally and my marriage, meant to destabilise me at a very critical time\".\nAt that time Mrs Foster was heavily involved in talks to restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland.\nThe court was told Dr Jessen's tweet was published at about the same time that anonymous Twitter users were claiming that Mrs Foster had been having an affair with one of her security guards.\nShe said having to explain to her husband what had happened was \"very upsetting\".\n\"It was very humiliating to see that the relationship that's most important to me had been trashed if you like and put out there in the public domain in that fashion,\" she told the court.\n\"One of the things that gives me stability is my home relationship - it was almost as if this cut to the very core of my life.\"\nThe court heard Dr Jessen had more than 300,000 followers on Twitter in December 2019 and that the tweet had been retweeted more than 500 times.\nMrs Foster said \"there wasn't much sleep on the night of the 23rd\" of December when the tweet was posted and that she had to have conversations with her children, husband and mother about what was happening.\nShe said her family had attended church together on Christmas Day and that she later found out that a journalist had contacted her church minister to ask how her family \"had appeared\" that day.\nThe court was also told Dr Jessen's tweet had referred to Mrs Foster as \"the sanctity of marriage preaching woman\", adding: \"It always comes back to bite them on the arse in the end.\"\nIt was in relation to the DUP's opposition to same-sex marriage.\nAsked if she believed in the sanctity of marriage, Mrs Foster said she did but rejected accusations that she was homophobic.\nThe judge said there was a \"big difference between holding strong religious views on the sanctity of marriage and having an irrational hatred of homosexuals\", and said the DUP leader would have been aware of that.\nMrs Foster replied: \"I do get distressed when people call me a homophobe because that's something I am not.\n\"I have many friends who are homosexual, they know my views and in any event same-sex marriage is now the law in Northern Ireland and has to be upheld.\n\"I have never in my own utterances said anything in relation with people who are homosexual and that's why I do get upset when people call me a homophobe.\"\nShe told the court she did not know Dr Jessen and that even when he had removed the tweet there was \"no acknowledgment of wrong-doing\".\nMrs Foster's barrister David Ringland QC said a solicitor for the DUP leader had contacted Dr Jessen on Twitter instructing him to remove the post on 24 December but he had refused to do so.\nMr Ringland said the tweet was not removed until 7 January, when Dr Jessen responded to follow-up requests in a \"pithy email\".\nThe court was told Dr Jessen had said he did not agree with the suggestion his claim gave rise to defamation and that he had removed it without admission of liability.\nMr Ringland said there was \"no correction, retraction or apology\" and that Dr Jessen had taken a \"head-in-the-sand approach\".\nThe judge reserved judgement but said he would seek to deal with the case as a \"matter of urgency\"."

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Windsor",
      "text": "Funeral preparations are under way for Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II's husband, who died on Friday 9 April aged 99. \nThis is what we know about the event.\nThe ceremonial royal funeral will be held at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, at 15:00 BST on Saturday 17 April. \nPrince Philip's body is now resting in the inner hall at Windsor Castle after being moved from its private chapel.\nThe duke is reported to have requested a funeral of minimal fuss and has not lain in state - where members of the public would have been able to view his coffin. \nThe procession and service will be televised - details below.\nCoronavirus restrictions in England mean only 30 people, socially distanced, are allowed to attend funerals. \nThe guest list includes members of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh's families, including three of his German relatives.\nPrince Harry will attend but his wife Meghan, who is pregnant, will not make the trip from the US, on medical advice. It is the first time the Duke of Sussex has returned to the UK since stepping down as a senior royal last year.\nAttendees are expected to wear masks in line with government advice. The pallbearers and clergy are not included in the number of attendees.\nThe duke will have a ceremonial funeral, rather than a state funeral. There is a subtle difference - state funerals are usually reserved for monarchs, although wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill was given a state funeral. The Queen Mother had a ceremonial funeral in 2002, as did Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. \nOn the day of the funeral, the coffin will be moved from the private chapel to the State Entrance of Windsor Castle. It will be placed on a modified Land Rover, that the duke himself helped design, to be carried the short distance to St George's Chapel.\nCoronavirus restrictions on crowds and numbers attending funerals mean the duke's ceremonial funeral will be much lower key than if it had happened in other times - although the Palace says this very much \"reflects the duke's wishes\" and it will still \"celebrate and reflect\" a life of service.\nLive online coverage of the procession and funeral begins on the BBC News website and app at 07:00 BST and the service will be streamed in the UK and internationally. \nTelevision coverage in the UK starts at 12:30 BST on Saturday on BBC One, the BBC News Channel and on BBC iPlayer.\nOn the radio, you can follow the day's events between 14:00 BST and 16:10 BST on Radio 4 and Radio 5 Live, and simulcast on BBC World Service English, BBC Radio Scotland, and BBC Radio Ulster. \nBBC Radio Wales and BBC local radio will also cover the event, with start times to be confirmed.\nBy 14:15 BST, the Quadrangle in Windsor Castle will be lined by the Household Cavalry and the Foot Guards, along with military detachments from units that had special connections with Prince Philip on the grass.\nFrom 14:20 BST, those members of the Royal Family and The Duke of Edinburgh's family not taking part in the procession leave Windsor Castle by car for St George's Chapel.\nAt 14:40 BST, the bands in the Quadrangle stop playing and the coffin will be carried out and placed onto the Land Rover.\nMembers of the Royal Family walking in the procession will leave the State Entrance after the coffin and take up their positions.\nBehind the Land Rover will be Princes Charles, Andrew, Edward and Princess Anne, as well as grandsons Princes William and Harry. They are joined by Princess Anne's son Peter Phillips, her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence and the Earl of Snowdon. Members of the duke's staff will follow behind them, including his private secretary Brigadier Archie Miller Bakewell, a personal protection officer, two pages and two valets.\nAt 14:45 BST, the procession begins. Led by the band of the Grenadier Guards, the procession will move from the Quadrangle to Horseshoe Cloister. The band is followed by the Major General's party and military chiefs of staff. The Land Rover follows, flanked by pallbearers from the Royal Marines and other regiments and corps associated with the duke. The Royal Family members and staff follow behind.\nThe Queen will travel at the rear of the procession in the State Bentley and will enter St George's chapel through the Galilee porch.\nThe procession route will be lined by personnel from the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, The Highlanders, 4th Battalion Royal Regiment of Scotland and the Royal Air Force.\nGuns will be fired by The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery from the East Lawn throughout, as a bell tolls in the Curfew Tower, at the west end of the castle. \nAt 14:53 BST, the Land Rover will arrive at West Steps of St George's Chapel, and be met by a guard of honour and band from the Rifles Regiment, who will play the national anthem.\nMembers of the Household Cavalry will line the West Steps and a Royal Navy \"piping party\" will pipe a nautical call known as \"the Still\" as the coffin is carried up the steps to the chapel.\nThe coffin, draped with the duke's standard, with a wreath and the duke's naval cap and sword on top, will be met by the dean of Windsor, together with the Archbishop of Canterbury, for the service.\nOnly the members of the Royal Family will enter the chapel - the rest of the procession will remain outside. \nAt 15:00 BST, a minute's silence will be held nationwide, in memory of the duke. \nThe start and end of the Silence will be signalled by a gun fired by The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery.\nInside the chapel, the funeral service will begin as the coffin is carried to the Quire, and placed on a platform called a catafalque. \nA small choir of four singers, who will be in the nave of the chapel, will sing pieces of music chosen by the duke.\nAfter the service, the duke will be interred in the royal vault.\nThe duke's coffin is draped in his personal flag, his standard. The flag represents elements of his life, from his Greek heritage to his British titles. \nWhen the duke got engaged to the then Princess Elizabeth in 1946, he renounced his Greek title and became a British citizen, taking his mother's anglicised name, Mountbatten.\nThe Mountbatten family is therefore also represented on the standard, alongside the castle from the arms of the City of Edinburgh - he became Duke of Edinburgh when he married.\nA number of objects personally selected by the duke will be displayed on cushions on the altar in St George's Chapel.\nThese include the duke's insignia - medals and decorations awarded to him by the UK and Commonwealth countries - his field marshal's baton, Royal Air Force wings and insignia from Denmark and Greece \nMembers of the public have been asked not to attend any of the funeral events, in line with public health advice.\nOn the Royal Family website, members of the public are asked to consider making a donation to a charity instead of leaving floral tributes in memory of the duke. An online book of condolence is also available for the public to post their personal tributes.\nThe period of national mourning ends on the day of the funeral.\nThe Royal Family will continue to observe mourning for another week - but members will attend engagements wearing black mourning bands where appropriate."

      "tags": "Scottish Parliament election 2021,Nicola Sturgeon,SNP (Scottish National Party),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has promised to provide a \"transformational\" increase in NHS funding if the SNP wins the election. \nSpeaking as she launched the party's manifesto, Ms Sturgeon said frontline NHS spending would increase by at least 20% over the next five years - which she said would total \u00a32.5bn. \nThe SNP leader repeated her call for an independence referendum to be held within the next parliamentary term.\nBut added it would be a \"dereliction of duty\" to do so during the pandemic.\nThe manifesto also promises a \u00a310bn investment programme in NHS facilities, and a minimum 25% rise in mental health spending.\nAnd it pledges to abolish NHS dental charges, which Ms Sturgeon said would \"ensure that cost is not a barrier to accessing health care\".\nIn a video speech to coincide with its publication, Ms Sturgeon said the coronavirus pandemic had \"turned life as we know it upside down\".\nBut she said her party was putting forward \"unashamedly optimistic\" proposals that would \"build a better nation\" rather than return things to how they were before. \nAnd she described the manifesto as a \"serious programme for serious times\".\nSCOTLAND ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nMs Sturgeon said: \"If the SNP is re-elected, we will use our experience to undertake a full-scale post-pandemic remobilisation of the NHS.\n\"Investment in the NHS is already at record levels. But the pandemic has placed exceptional pressures on our NHS - and that requires an exceptional response.\n\"Over the next parliament, we will increase frontline NHS spending by at least 20%. This will deliver an additional \u00a32.5bn for frontline health services - and is almost double what an inflation-only increase would amount to.\"\nSCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the government. Find out more here.\nWhat powers do they have? MSPs pass laws on aspects of life in Scotland such as health, education and transport - and have some powers over tax and welfare benefits.\nWho can vote? Anyone who lives in Scotland, is registered to vote and aged 16 or over on 6 May is eligible. You can register to vote online. \nThe first minister admitted that her government had made mistakes in response to Covid-19, but insisted that it had learned from those errors.\nShe added: \"A year ago, we had to act fast without the knowledge we have now about this virus - and without the benefit of the hindsight we have today.\n\"I know we didn't get every decision right, but we have done our level best and we have learned from experience.\n\"It is that combination of commitment and experience that I believe is so vital for these times.\" \nThe party's other key manifesto pledges include: \nMs Sturgeon also said her government would \"move towards what is known as a minimum income guarantee\".\nShe said the first step would to establish independently assessed minimum income standards. \nMs Sturgeon added: \"We will then identify the extent to which we can use our existing powers over social security, as well as our investments in fair work, childcare and public services to ensure that people meet these income standards.\n\"We will lay the foundation for the introduction of a Citizens' Basic Income should Scotland choose to become independent and gain the tax and social security powers that are necessary to make that a reality.\"\nThe SNP plan to increase NHS spending by at least \u00a32.5bn over the next five years goes beyond the \u00a32bn minimum promised by the Conservatives. \nThere is no doubt that this would be a significant uplift - almost twice the rate of inflation. But it is not money for nothing. \nThe SNP wants the NHS to work harder, to increase treatment activity by 10% compared to pre-pandemic levels to help clear the big backlog of cases caused by covid. \nTo achieve that and meet the rising costs of healthcare plus a 4% pay rise for many health workers, increased spending on mental health and the abolition of charges for dentistry - the NHS will have no trouble spending more money. \nBy prioritising the NHS in its plans for recovery from the pandemic, the SNP is aligning itself with the public service that is most popular with and highly valued by Scottish voters. \nOn a second referendum, Ms Sturgeon said it was \"vital\" that people who live in Scotland were able to decide the future that they want. \nBut she stressed that she was not proposing holding a referendum while the country was still grappling with the Covid crisis.\nMs Sturgeon said: \"That would be a dereliction of my duty as first minister to dedicate all of my energies to leading us through the crisis.\n\"But it would also be a dereliction of my duty as first minister - my duty  to this and future generations - to let Westminster take Scotland so far in the wrong direction that we no longer have the option to change course.\n\"So, it is my judgment that the people of Scotland should decide Scotland's future through an independence referendum in the next term of parliament.\"\nThe UK government has repeatedly refused to give its backing to a referendum, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisting that the vote held in 2014 settled the matter for a generation.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the SNP wanted to \"put a referendum roadblock in front of Scotland's recovery\". \nHe added: \"This is a manifesto to create a new crisis at the earliest opportunity, when we're going to be tackling the health and economic crisis for years to come.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that stopping the SNP winning an overall majority in the election was \"crucial\".\nHe said this was because it would force the government to focus entirely on the coronavirus recovery rather than on an independence referendum. \nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the country was still waiting for the SNP to deliver promises they had made in 2007.\nMr Rennie said: \"They have a one-track mind for independence that prevents them getting anything else done.\"\nThe Scottish Greens, who are the only other major party to have launched their manifesto so far, want to see a referendum held during the next Holyrood term if there is a \"simple majority\" of MSPs in favour of one.\nThe party said independence \"is now our route back to EU membership\" and would give Scotland \"the powers and potential to be a leader in the transition to a zero-carbon economy\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The risk of developing a serious brain clot - known as a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) - is 8 to 10 times higher in people with Covid than those who get a vaccine, a study suggests.\nBased on US data, the Oxford research team says people being vaccinated should be reassured by the findings.\nIt follows investigations into links between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots.\nThe study only looked at those who had had a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.\nThe research, which involved electronic health records of 81 million people in the US, looked at the number of CVST cases seen in the two weeks following a diagnosis of coronavirus and the number of cases occurring in the two weeks after people had their first coronavirus vaccine.\nIt estimates that while these blood clots are uncommon after Covid - with 39 in every million people developing one within two weeks of being ill - they are much rarer still after a vaccine.\nBut researchers say their study - which has not been through a formal review and is separate from the Oxford vaccine group - is still a work in progress and must be interpreted cautiously because it is difficult to calculate with certainty how common CVSTs are in the general population, partly because of just how rare they are. \nThe study also found:\nThe European Medicines Agency says a particular type of CVST occurs in around five in a million people after the first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - but the populations vaccinated were not the same as in the US and the rates cannot be compared.\nPaul Harrison, professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford, said their study had important conclusions for people deciding on vaccines.\nHe said: \"Firstly, Covid-19 markedly increases the risk of CVST, adding to the list of blood clotting problems this infection causes. \n\"Secondly, the Covid-19 risk is higher than seen with the current vaccines, even for those under 30; something that should be taken into account when considering the balances between risks and benefits for vaccination.\"\nFrom their database they were unable to investigate whether the CVST clots they were seeing had similar features to those seen in rare cases after vaccines - which all had a peculiar pattern of blood cells associated with them, where certain cells called platelets were diminished.\nProf Beverley Hunt, of Thrombosis UK, said the mechanisms behind people getting clots after Covid and those experiencing clots after vaccines were likely to be different. \nShe said: \"Patients who are hospitalised with Covid-19 have very pro-thrombotic (sticky) changes in their blood, which persist after they have been discharged.  This will lead to an increased rate of blood clots.  \n\"The mechanism for the very rare blood clots and low platelet counts seen after the AstraZeneca vaccine is different. It is associated with an immune response.\""

      "text": "Psychedelic drug psilocybin, found in magic mushrooms, is as good at reducing symptoms of depression as conventional treatment, a small, early-stage study has suggested.\nBut when it comes to actively improving people's well-being and ability to feel pleasure, the psychedelic drug may have had a more powerful effect. \nPsychedelics are being studied for a range of mental-health conditions.\nBut experts caution that this is a small trial with more research needed.\nFor the past three decades, since Prozac hit the market, new drugs for depression and anxiety have generally been variations on the same theme.\nYet for a considerable chunk of people they cause undesirable side-effects, stop working over time or don't work in the first place. \nThe psilocybin trial's leaders said there was appetite for \"novel\" treatments that took a different approach. \nThe trial's 59 participants were given either psilocybin or a common antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).\nThe scientists from Imperial College London's Centre for Psychedelic Research measured participants' mood and functioning using a number of different scales.\nTheir primary measure scores people's symptoms of depression based on their answers to questions about sleep, energy, appetite, mood and suicidal thoughts.\nThese questions are largely negatively focused: they ask whether someone is feeling sad, but not whether they are feeling happy. \nBy this measure, psilocybin performed as well as a conventional antidepressant - an SSRI called escitalopram. \nAll 59 participants saw comparable reductions in their depressive symptoms.\nBut on several other measures - though they weren't the scientists' primary focus - the psychedelic drug performed considerably better.\nThat includes measures of work and social functioning, mental well-being and the ability to feel happy.\nThe study is among the first to pit the psychedelic head-to-head with a traditional depression treatment - and to open the trial to anyone with moderate-to-severe depression, not just those for whom all other treatments had failed.\nAs well as being a small trial, though, this represents a relatively early phase in the research, so more studies will be needed to prove this effect. \nThe study is \"not a quantum leap\", according to Guy Goodwin, professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford. \n\"It is under-powered and does not prove that psilocybin is a better treatment than standard treatment with escitalopram for major depression. \n\"However, it offers tantalising clues that it may be\".\nIt adds to the growing body of research suggesting psychedelics could be a viable alternative treatment for depression, anxiety, substance misuse and other common conditions. \nAnd, Prof Goodwin added, the work \"underlines the broader point that research in depression has been too driven by ratings of particular symptoms rather than the return of positive mood and patient well-being\". \nSSRIs like fluoxetine (the generic name for Prozac), citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline are the drugs doctors will reach for first when treating depression and anxiety.\nThey are thought to work on the brain's stress system, muting responses, which can \"take the edge off\", study author Dr Robin Carhart-Harris explained, making painful emotions easier to bear.\nBut they don't necessarily help people \"feel great,\" he said - and for some the drugs blunt all emotions, both positive and negative.\nThis emotional blunting can be an unwelcome side-effect.\nOn the other hand, psilocybin seems to work on receptors in the brain associated with \"re-ordering\" the way we think about things. \nDr Carhart-Harris said that after psychedelic therapy, participants reported feeling \"recalibrated, reset like they haven't for years\" and \"enjoying life\". \n\"They get more at the root cause of suffering [rather than] plastering over or muting their symptoms.\" \nPeople in the psilocybin treatment group also experienced fewer of the side-effects that often bother people taking SSRIs: drowsiness, sexual dysfunction and dry mouth.\nThey did have more of the transient symptoms, such as headaches on the day after receiving the drug, though.\nAnd the experience of the \"trip\" itself was not easy, the study's co-author Prof David Nutt explained. \"This is hard, hard work. It's often very challenging.\"  \nThose being given psilocybin received two relatively high doses of the drug, three weeks apart, while people on the escitalopram arm of the study took that pill every day for six weeks.\nBoth groups were given therapy. \nProf Nutt said the therapy was \"as important as the drug action\" - the scientists are anxious to warn against people trying to self-medicate. \n\"It's not the drug alone. We're not sure the drug alone would have an intrinsic antidepressant effect,\" he said.\nIn order to try to \"blind\" people as to which group they were in - to prevent their expectations altering how they responded to the medication - those on the psychedelic arm were given a daily placebo pill and those on the SSRI arm had two guided sessions during which they were given 1mg of psilocybin (not enough to have a real effect). \nFor obvious reasons, though, it is quite challenging to \"blind\" people to whether or not they've received a large dose of psychedelics.  \nBut Dr Carhart-Harris said other studies suggested people continued to feel better for months after psilocybin treatment, making it unlikely to be just the effect of positive expectations.\nThe participants in the Imperial study are being followed up for six months after their initial six-week treatment. \nFollow Rachel on Twitter "

      "title": "Covid: How ready is Scotland to unlock?",
      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid travel restrictions around Scotland are due to be eased on Friday, earlier than expected, but there will be a much more significant relaxation in the rules from 26 April. As Scotland prepares to unlock, here are five things about the state of the epidemic. \nThe emergence of the Kent Covid variant in the weeks before Christmas drove a massive spike in cases in Scotland.\nAt the beginning of the year, the number of weekly cases per 100,000 people in Scotland almost reached 300, triggering a full lockdown which has now lasted almost four months.\nBut there has been a sustained decline in weekly cases since January, with the rate falling to below 35 on 13 April.\nUsing a World Health Organization (WHO) system for measuring infection levels, this indicates Scotland has a \"moderate\" level of community transmission of the virus.\nThe rate is now the lowest it has been since September and still appears to be falling.\nScotland's death rate also spiked in January after the Kent variant spread rapidly among the population.\nIt is believed that the variant can lead to a higher chance of hospitalisation and death, as well as being much more infectious.\nTowards the end of January the number of weekly Covid deaths per 100,000 people within 28 days of a positive test went higher than eight.\nThis figure went below 1.0 on 14 March and by 12 April it had fallen to 0.1.\nThe Scottish government says this sustained decline in the death rate has been achieved through a combination of people sticking to lockdown rules, and the vaccination of those most vulnerable to becoming severely ill or dying from Covid-19.\nAccording to the WHO's thresholds, the death rate in Scotland indicates \"low\" levels of community transmission.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nBy this measure the 14-day average on 12 April was 1.9% - just below the WHO's 2% threshold indicating a \"low\" level of community transmission.\nIt's worth pointing out that the WHO's preferred way of measuring the positivity rate is through \"sentinel surveillance\", or random community testing, which is not how the Scottish government reports it in its daily figures.\nHowever, the organisation lists \"overall test positivity\" as an additional measure if a comprehensive testing system is in place.\nIt's expected that all of Scotland will harmonise at level three from 26 April.\nRates in all local authorities have fallen in the last couple of months, but there are still significant differences between areas.\nThere have been very few cases recently in Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles or in Dumfries and Galloway, contrasting with much higher rates in Clackmannanshire, North Lanarkshire and West Lothian.\nThis variation in rates is one the Scottish government will continue to watch carefully, as public health officials try to avoid importing cases from areas of high levels of the virus to communities with low levels. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that there may still be a need in future for some \"limited travel restrictions\" within Scotland to prevent this happening.\nOn 9 April, there were 10 local authorities with a higher level of cases than the Scotland-wide rate - and six are still categorised as having \"high\" levels of community transmission according to the WHO.\nThe WHO outlines five \"situational levels\" ranging from level zero, when there should be \"no restrictions\" on daily activities, up to level four which requires a full lockdown to tackle an \"uncontrolled epidemic\".\nUsing measures like the death rate and the percentage of positive cases, the WHO system indicates that Scotland is currently sitting in level one or two, which is when more stringent rules like travel restrictions can be lifted.\nIn other words, Scotland does appear ready to come out of a full lockdown.\nThe WHO says that in level two some additional measures may be required to control transmission, however, \"disruptions to social and economic activities can still be limited\".\nIn level one, \"basic measures\" should remain in place to prevent Covid infections spreading, but any disruptions to social and economic life should be \"limited and transient\".\nBut there is an important caveat to the WHO document, which possibly casts an even more optimistic light on Scotland's situation - it was written in November and so does not take into account a country's vaccination programme.\nAbout 60% of people aged 16 or over in Scotland have now received at least a first dose of a Covid vaccine, with hopes that the programme will be complete by the end of July.\nIn recent weeks there has been a focus on administering second doses of the vaccine, with more than 600,000 people in Scotland now fully vaccinated.\nThe Scottish government also says that everyone in the nine priority groups, as set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, has now been offered a vaccine, with almost all the over-50s having received a first dose."

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The US will continue to support Afghanistan after withdrawing all US troops, but not \"militarily,\" President Joe Biden has pledged.\n\"It is time to end America's longest war,\" he said in a speech from the White House room where US airstrikes there were first declared in 2001.\nThe pull-out is to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 terror attacks, officials say.\nAt least 2,500 US troops are part of the 9,600-strong Nato Afghan mission.\nThe number of US troops on the ground in Afghanistan fluctuates, and US media report the current total is closer to 3,500.\nUS and Nato officials have said the Taliban, a hardline Islamist movement, have so far failed to live up to commitments to reduce violence in Afghanistan.\nIn Kabul, Afghan officials say they will continue peace talks in preparation for the withdrawal.\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani tweeted that he had spoken on the phone with Mr Biden on Wednesday, and that the country \"respects the US decision and we will work with our US partners to ensure a smooth transition\".\nHe added that Afghanistan's defence forces \"are fully capable of defending its people and country\".\n\"We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create the ideal conditions for our withdrawal, expecting a different result,\" said Mr Biden, the fourth president to oversee the war.\n\"While we will not stay involved in Afghanistan militarily, our diplomatic and humanitarian work will continue,\" he continued, adding: \"We will continue to support the government of Afghanistan.\"\nMr Biden also pledged to continue providing assistance to Afghan defence and security forces - including 300,000 personnel, who he says \"continue to fight valiantly on behalf of their country and defend the Afghan people, at great cost\".\nHe also paid his respects to the victims of the 11 September 2001 attack which triggered the US invasion of Afghanistan.\n\"We went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago,\" he said. \"That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021.\"\n\"We have to focus on the challenges that are in front of us,\" said Mr Biden, citing the threat of cyber attacks and rising tensions with China.\n\"We already have service members doing their duty in Afghanistan today whose parents served in the same war,\" he added.\n\"We have service members who were not yet born when our nation was attacked on 9/11. War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multigenerational undertaking.\"\nLater on Wednesday, Mr Biden will visit Arlington National Cemetery, where some of the 2,488 US troops who died fighting in Afghanistan are buried.\nMr Biden's plan pushes back the 1 May deadline agreed to by the Trump White House.\nThe deal signed in February 2020 said the US and its Nato allies would withdraw all troops by May 2021 if the Taliban upheld its promises, including not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks.\nAlthough the group stopped attacks on international forces as part of the historic agreement, it has continued to fight the Afghan government. Last month, the Taliban threatened to resume hostilities against foreign troops still in the country on 1 May.\nLast year Donald Trump set in motion a full US withdrawal from Afghanistan. This week, Joe Biden - who as Barack Obama's vice-president opposed an ongoing large US presence in the nation - pledged to see the process to its final resolution.\nThat his administration will miss the Trump-set deadline of 1 May has been overshadowed by the symbolism of Biden's new deadline, 11 September, the 20th anniversary of the attack that instigated US entry into Afghanistan.\nTrump's actions have insulated Biden from significant criticism so far, even from conservative hawks. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell called Biden's decision a \"grave mistake,\" but others - like Texas Senator Ted Cruz - have voiced support.\nWhile the short-term political downside of withdrawing the 3,500 remaining US soldiers appears minimal, Biden's move is not without risk. If the Taliban takes power and cracks down on women's rights, or if the nation once again becomes a haven for extremist militants, the American public could hold Biden responsible - and today's critics will have new ammunition.\nIn the meantime, however, Biden will claim credit for ending \"America's longest war\" and focusing the nation's efforts on domestic challenges. He will do so on solid political ground - for now.\nOn Wednesday, US CIA Director William Burns said in a senate hearing that military capabilities in the region would be diminished once the US leaves.\n\"There is a significant risk once the US military and the coalition militaries withdraw,\" he said, adding that the US will still \"retain a suite of capabilities\" to counter extremist threats.\nOn Tuesday, a senior US official warned that the Taliban \"will be met with a forceful response\" if they attack US troops during the pull-out phase.\nAbdullah Abdullah, head of the nation's High Council for National Reconciliation, said on Wednesday that the news of foreign troops withdrawing means \"we need to find a way to co-exist\", Reuters news agency reported.\n\"We believe that there is no winner in Afghan conflicts and we hope the Taliban realise that too,\" he said.\nAfghans across the country have told the BBC's Afghan service that they are alarmed by the news.\n\"I do not think conditions are suitable for withdrawal,\" says Roeena Usmani, who lives in the western Herat province bordering Iran.\n\"The international community has not yet fulfilled their commitments, there is talk of the Taliban returning to power-sharing.\"\n\"We are concerned that we could lose all the achievements of the last 20 years, particularly for women,\" she continues. \"There should be guarantees that we should not return to the dark days of 20 years ago.\"\nMohammad Askar, a resident of Mazar-e Sharif in northern Afghanistan, said: \"If American troops want to leave Afghanistan they should do so with a plan. \n\"If not, I fear Afghanistan will return to civil war.\"\nWeyar, a resident of the northern Baghlan province, said the US \"should go after reaching agreement with all stakeholders, including the Taliban\".\n\"Otherwise Afghanistan may plunge into war, which will be disastrous not only for Afghanistan but the whole world.\"\nOctober 2001: US-led bombing of Afghanistan begins following the 11 September attacks on the United States \nFebruary 2009: Nato countries pledge to increase military and other commitments in Afghanistan after US announces dispatch of 17,000 extra troops\nDecember 2009: US President Barack Obama decides to boost US troop numbers in Afghanistan by 30,000, bringing total to 100,000.
