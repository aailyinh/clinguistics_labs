      "tags": "Companies,Centrica,British Gas,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Chris O'Shea, the boss of British Gas owner Centrica, has said his family was posted excrement amid a pay row at the firm.\nBritish Gas engineers held a five-day strike last month, followed by seven extra strike days, in what unions say is a response to an attempt by the firm to push through pay cuts by threatening to fire workers.\nMr O'Shea said that he understood what he was asking was \"difficult\".\nBut he told MPs he was \"not immune\" to the situation.\nIn June, Centrica said it planned to to cut about 5,000 jobs to \"arrest the decline\" of the company.\nIt has been losing customers to rivals and in February last year, it blamed a big loss in 2019 on a price cap for customers and falling gas prices. \nIt has asked some staff to sign new contracts. Centrica said 83% of workers had already accepted its new terms and conditions, which it said protected base pay and pensions.\nLabour MP Judith Cummins told Mr O'Shea that the threat of being sacked if they refused to sign up to new terms was having an effect on the health of his workers. One wrote to her complaining of chest pains, body aches and shortness of breath.\n\"This person even took a Covid test because he though that was a reason,\" she said. \"But it wasn't, it was anxiety because of this fire and rehire action you are taking.\" \nMr O'Shea told Parliament's Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee the situation was affecting him too, and said he needed to save jobs.\n\"Undoubtedly what I'm asking people to do is difficult, I won't shy away from that,\" he said.\n\"However, my view is that I would rather do everything in my power to save the 20,000 jobs that we've got.\n\"I know this puts a lot of pressure on people. Only yesterday my wife and teenage son had a package of excrement delivered to them with a note about fire and rehire. This is something that affects absolutely everybody. I'm not immune to this.\"\nHe told Parliament that the police were involved with the situation.\nJustin Bowden, national officer at the GMB union, said Centrica's workforce had a \"history of change\" and that relations between workers and the company's management would be friendlier if staff had not been confronted with job losses when asked to help with costs.\n\"The cart was put very much before the horse,\" he said. He said that it would be similar to the union voting for strike action before making its own pay proposals.\nMr O'Shea insisted that the company's \u00a31bn net loss for 2019 showed that the company needed to make changes.\nMr Bowden countered that the company was fundamentally profitable and that it posted adjusted operating profit of \u00a3901m for 2019. This figure does not include some costs, but it is the measure of profit used by the company, according to its annual report. \nMr O'Shea said he was \"committed\" to working with unions to find a resolution.\nMr Bowden said that the level of pressure on employees was \"unprecedented\", but that he would engage with more talks. \nCorrection 6 April 2021: This article was amended to include mention of seven extra strike days called after the initial five-day action.

      "tags": "Martin Scorsese,Stock markets,GameStop",
      "text": "Amateur investors swept up in the trading frenzy surrounding US retailer GameStop \"could lose everything\", the former stock broker who inspired the Wolf of Wall Street film has warned.\nJordan Belfort, who was jailed for market manipulation in 1999, said such investments could be \"great on the way up, but painful on the way down\". \nGameStop shares surged 700% last week as amateurs, inspired by tips shared on social media, piled into the stock.\nBut they have dropped sharply since.\nShares fell 63% on Tuesday to $81 - a far cry from last week's record of almost $350. \nMr Belfort said he sympathised with the small-time traders drawn to GameStop, many of whom wanted to turn the tables on big Wall Street firms. \nBut he told the BBC: \"You must be so careful because eventually these stocks are going to come crashing back down to earth.\n\"If you are looking at this as a way to make your living, you'll have to catch a falling knife on the way down. I would urge people to take their chips off the table.\"\nThe trading frenzy began in late January, when small-time investors began buying up shares in GameStop, a loss-making video games retailer. \nMany Wall Street hedge funds - known as \"short sellers\" - had bet against the firm, meaning they stood to make money if its stock fell, but lose heavily if it rose.\nBut amateurs, inspired by posts on Reddit and Youtube, realised they could drive up the price if they bought en masse, inflicting losses on the big players and making gains for themselves. \nThe excitement also encompassed other stocks such as AMC and Nokia, while the price of silver has seen intense speculation. \nMr Belfort said the trading had taken on a political tone, with investors seeking \"justice\" against Wall Street firms they perceived had behaved unethically.\nHe added: \"All of a sudden there is a way for people to communicate on message boards like Reddit, there's a way for them to trade instantly on platforms like Robinhood.\n\"You put those two things together with the power of social media and bam - just like that the little guy got the best of the big institutions.\"\nHowever, he said there was a risk of people getting swept away in the excitement, noting that those with little understanding of stocks were now buying GameStop shares. \n\"Be aware of being the last person on the bandwagon, that is really the danger here.\"\nMr Belfort, who is now an author and motivational speaker, defrauded investors of $200m in the 1980s and 90s and is still paying restitution to his victims. \nHis memoir was the inspiration for Martin Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street film in 2013, but he sued the film's producers for fraud and breach of contract last year claiming $300m in compensation.\nMr Belfort alleged Red Granite Productions - whose co-founder Riza Aziz was arrested on suspicion of money laundering last year - lied about being \"legitimately funded\" when he sold the rights to his story.\nThe company's lawyer described the lawsuit as \"desperate and supremely ironic\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Welsh government,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic,Vaughan Gething",
      "text": "More lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlier at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the health minister has said, looking back with hindsight.\nVaughan Gething made the admission while talking about the pressure faced by policy makers dealing with Covid-19.\nBut he also said he believes decisions were correct based on the information available at the time.\nThere have been 4,775 deaths with Covid-19 in Wales since March 2020.\nThere have also been 192,912 positive cases recorded. \nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said objections were raised to decisions taken at the start of the pandemic.\nWales went into its first lockdown on 23 March and the Welsh Government came under fire early on for the speed of care home testing, as well as contact tracing.\n\"Looking back, if we had the opportunity to do this all again, we would have made different choices on borders definitely,\" Mr Gething said. \n\"We would almost certainly have entered lockdown a week or two earlier, and we would have probably saved more lives if we had done that.\n\"I think that actually on the really big and serious choices we have learned lots. \n\"So if we have the knowledge we have now I would definitely have made different choices at various points in the pandemic. \n\"We'd have been able to get a jump-start on our testing capacity. \n\"We'd have been able to make different choices about testing around care homes earlier. \n\"We did manage to get ourselves into a good position on PPE so we never ran out, but it was really tight at various points in time.\"\nHe said the Welsh Government's scientific advisors all agreed the advice given at the time was the correct advice based on the information they had.\nHowever, if they had the information they now possess, the advice would have been different. \nMr Gething admitted being at the sharp end of decision-making at such a critical time had taken its toll.\n\"If you're having conversation with needing to plan for the potential for mass burial as we were at the start of the pandemic, then you know that really sobers you up very quickly about the scale and the enormity of the challenge we're facing,\" he said. \n\"I never really thought that I would have to make decisions that have this sort of consequence. \n\"We often talk about making life and death decisions but actually the choices we make have an impact on the whole population.\"\n\"During the pandemic making the right choice can mean that you're saving lots of lives, and making a different choice means that you can end up thinking that, that choice I made may not have been the right one. \n\"So there's an awful lot more pressure. \n\"We've lost well over 4,000 Welsh citizens to the pandemic. But it could have been much, much worse. \n\"Without the action we have taken I'm confident that we'd have lost more people.\"\nThe Welsh Government had received praise over its slower approach to easing lockdown restrictions than England but drew criticism in other areas such as easing restrictions too quickly after November's firebreak.\nIt was also criticised early into the vaccine rollout because of its pace, but the vaccination rate is now higher than other parts of the UK, and 416,306 first doses have been given. \n\"To make decisions in government has been an extraordinary period of time as well and you learn not just by getting things right,\" said Mr Gething.\n\"You also learn by making mistakes as well.\"\nAs well as mistakes on decisions during the pandemic, Mr Gething has also faced a couple of difficult personal moments including being accused by a newspaper of breaking lockdown rules when he ate chips on a park bench with his family.\nHe also came under fire while grappling with new online meetings when he left his microphone on and was caught swearing about a Labour colleague.\n\"We shouldn't try to pretend that everything has been perfect,\" Mr Gething said about the Welsh Government's overall response to the pandemic. \n\"But no one's had to do this before. I just think that sort of honesty is really important for people.\"\nIn response to the interview, Mr Price tweeted: \"Being too slow into lockdown and coming out of the firebreak without a gradual approach has undoubtedly cost lives.\n\"Early abandonment of test and trace and the failure to test properly in care homes were avoidable and costly mistakes.\n\"It's not enough to argue, as the PM does, that government acted on the best evidence at the time, as many of us raised objections to these policies at the time.\"\nYour story\nTravel is currently limited to essential purposes in Wales, such as for work and caring responsibilities, and international travel is barred.\nBut, after a tough year with the pandemic, many people will be dreaming about a holiday in 2021. \nWhile bookings for UK staycations are \"coming in thick and fast\", some people are gambling on a foreign trip in the hope restrictions will ease later this year. \nUse this form to tell us about your plans. \nIn some cases your comments will be published, displaying your name and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Aung San Suu Kyi,Myanmar coup ,Myanmar",
      "text": "Min Aung Hlaing rose steadily through the ranks of the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's powerful military, but as commander-in-chief for the past decade he also wielded significant political influence before the 1 February coup.\nHe successfully maintained the Tatmadaw's power even as Myanmar transitioned to democracy, but received international condemnation and sanctions for his alleged role in the military's attacks of ethnic minorities.\nAs Myanmar returns to military rule under his leadership, Min Aung Hlaing now looks set to extend his power and shape the country's immediate future.\nThe 64-year-old general has spent his entire career in the influential military, which he joined as a cadet.\nA former law student at Yangon University, he entered the Defence Services Academy on his third attempt in 1974.\nThe relatively unassuming infantryman kept getting regular promotions and moved up the ladder, eventually becoming commander of the Bureau of Special Operations-2 in 2009.\nIn this role, he oversaw operations in north-eastern Myanmar, which led to tens of thousands of ethnic minority refugees fleeing the eastern Shan province and the Kokang region, along the Chinese border.\nDespite allegations of murder, rape and arson against his troops, Min Aung Hlaing continued to rise and in August 2010 he became joint chief of staff.\nLess than a year later, he was tapped for the military's top post ahead of more senior generals, succeeding long-time leader Than Shwe as commander-in-chief in March 2011.\nWhen Min Aung Hlaing became military chief, blogger and writer Hla Oo - who said they had known each other in childhood - described him as \"a battle-hardened warrior of brutal Burmese Army\", but also called him a \"serious scholar and gentleman\".\nMin Aung Hlaing began his tenure as military chief as Myanmar transitioned to democracy in 2011 after decades of military rule, but remained keen on maintaining the Tatmadaw's power.\nHis political influence and social media presence increased as the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) led the government.\nIn 2016, when Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) came to power, he seemingly adapted to the change by working and appearing at public events with her.\nDespite the change, he ensured the Tatmadaw continued to hold 25% of parliamentary seats and crucial security-related cabinet portfolios, while resisting the NLD's attempts to amend the constitution and limit military power.\nIn 2016 and 2017, the military intensified a crackdown on the Rohingya ethnic minority in the northern Rakhine state, leading to many Rohingya Muslims fleeing Myanmar.\nThe military chief was condemned internationally for the alleged \"genocide\", and in August 2018 the UN Human Rights Council said: \"Myanmar's top military generals, including Commander-in-Chief Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, must be investigated and prosecuted for genocide in the north of Rakhine State, as well as for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States.\"\nFollowing the council's statement, Facebook deleted his account, along with those of other individuals and organisations who it said had \"committed or enabled serious human rights abuses in the country\".\nThe US sanctioned him twice - in 2019 for his alleged role in \"ethnic cleansing\" and human rights violations, and in July 2020 the UK also imposed sanctions on him.\nThe November 2020 general election saw a landslide win for the NLD, according to official figures, but in subsequent months the Tatmadaw and military-backed USDP repeatedly disputed the results.\nThe USDP made allegations of widespread electoral fraud. Those claims were dismissed by the election commission ahead of a planned parliament session on 1 February to confirm the new government.\nSpeculation of a coup grew amid the stand-off between the government and the armed forces. On 27 January Min Aung Hlaing warned that \"the constitution shall be abolished, if not followed\", citing example of previous military coups in 1962 and 1988.\nHis office seemingly reversed this stance by 30 January, saying that the media had misinterpreted military officials' words about abolishing the constitution.\nHowever, on the morning of 1 February, the Tatmadaw detained State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other senior leaders, and declared a year-long state of emergency.\nMin Aung Hlaing assumed all state power for this period in his capacity as commander-in-chief, and immediately prioritised the alleged electoral irregularities.\nA meeting of the National Defence and Security Council led by him said it would investigate the fraud claims and hold new elections, effectively invalidating the NLD's win.\nMin Aung Hlaing was originally due to step down as commander-in-chief after reaching the retirement age of 65 in July this year, but has now given himself at least another year in power - and potentially longer - with Myanmar's apparent return to military rule.\nAs Myanmar faces an uncertain future with the state of emergency, he has cemented his power and taken charge of the country.\nThis report was compiled by BBC Monitoring"

      "tags": "Anxiety,A&E,Bradford,Self harm,Child health,Mental health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The pandemic has had a deep impact on children, who are arriving in A&E in greater numbers and at younger ages after self-harming or taking overdoses, writes Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary.\nChildren are a lost tribe in the pandemic. While they remain (for the most part) perplexingly immune to the health consequences of Covid-19, their lives and daily routines have been turned upside down. \nFrom surveys and interviews carried out for the Born in Bradford study, we know that they are anxious, isolated and bored, and we see the tip of this iceberg of mental ill health in the hospital.\nChildren in mental health crisis used to be brought to A&E about twice a week. Since the summer it's been more like once or twice a day. Some as young as 10 have cut themselves, taken overdoses, or tried to asphyxiate themselves.\nThere was even one child aged eight.\nLockdown \"massively exacerbates any pre-existing mental health issues - fears, anxieties, feelings of disconnection and isolation,\" says A&E consultant Dave Greenhorn. \nWhile Bradford has been in lockdown longer than some other parts of the country, there is no reason to believe this is a local problem. Dave says fellow A&E consultants he's spoken to in Scotland, Portsmouth and Northern Ireland all report a significant increase in mental health attendances - among all age groups, children as well as adults. \nSelf-harming \"used to be the mind-set of older teenagers but we are seeing much younger children doing this now\" says Ruth Tolley, a matron on the paediatric ward where children are taken if it is not safe for them to return home.\nIt may then take the combined efforts of several nurses to prevent further self-harm on the ward.\nEating disorders are also on the rise, says paediatrician Helen Jepp. So are overdoses - where children take their parents' medication, or their own - and cases where children rush out of the house and behave recklessly or dangerously on the street.\nA child psychiatrist who works with Bradford's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) says the caseload fell at the start of the pandemic then returned to normal levels. For him what's new is not the quantity but the severity of the work. \"We have been seeing more intense distress,\" he says. \"Young people are in a worse state than usual.\"\nConsultant Dave Greenhorn describes a recent evening in A&E. It's a busy one - there are 94 people in the department, including a pale-looking teenage boy, lying quietly in a cubicle.\nDave asks if he's OK, but there is no answer and no eye contact.\nThe notes show that the boy has attended the Emergency Department every other day for two weeks. Before now he has taken small overdoses and told staff he wants to die. He has a child and adolescent psychiatrist and support worker but there is no firm diagnosis of mental illness.\nOne of the problems is that lockdown has prevented everyone from accessing their own safety valves. The boy has previously mentioned that he misses going out with his friends. Now he's stuck at home, and so are other members of his family. Unable to get away for a few hours peace, the mum says she's at the end of her tether and can't deal with her son at home on this particular night.\nDave's attempts to coax the boy to talk to him are unsuccessful, so he makes sure the youngster has some juice and a sandwich and asks the nurses to keep trying to get him to engage when they have a minute - though they rarely do.\nOn previous admissions to the paediatric ward the boy has been hard to look after, so it's been agreed he shouldn't be sent there, but he doesn't want to go to an adult ward. In the end he spends the night in A&E.\nThe pandemic has underlined for all to see just how important school is for children. Education is only part of it. There is also the social life, and children benefit from routine, boundaries and adult authority figures outside the home.\nTeachers are also experts at spotting problems such as anxiety and self-harm that has taken place at home. A lot of referrals would normally arise in this way. \nFor older children, school is the framework that will enable them to reach university or employment, and some struggle when it appears to give way.\nSeema [not her real name] attempted suicide and started self-harming when exams were cancelled last summer. \n\"We tried very hard for our exams - you're taught that your entire future revolves around these exams, but that crumbles right in front of you and it's really shocking. It has a huge impact,\" she says.\n\"I felt like stabbing myself\u2026 I was in a constant state of anxiety.\"\nNow 17, she is doing a lot better, though she still misses contact with teachers and friends, and would like schools to organise online groups for students to socialise, not just meet for lessons.\nHer family hasn't been able to understand her problem, but she has now been getting help.\nProf John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio.\nOne crucial beneficial change that has come out of this epidemic of mental ill-health is that professionals from all the different agencies in Bradford have come together to support the children in their time of crisis. \nGone are the delays in referrals between different teams - the health service and social services are acting as one.\n\"Covid has brought services closer together,\" says paediatric ward matron Ruth Tolley. \"We needed an urgent meeting with the safeguarding team and various other agencies and we were able to pull that meeting together in two hours - getting people together and getting a plan, that is really positive.\"\nPaediatrician Helen Jepps agrees. She got a call about a teenager one morning, logged on and saw that a number of teams were already discussing the case - social workers, Camhs and voluntary organisations. \"It feels a real privilege at the moment to have that close contact,\" she says. \nBut this is little consolation for the damage that is being done to children's lives. \nThe past 10 months of lockdown and school closures may have seemed unending for parents, but for a 10-year-old it will have felt like a lifetime. Their youth is being stolen from them.\nInformation and support: If you or someone you know is affected by issues discussed in this article, the BBC's Action Line has organisations which may be able to help for emotional distress/suicide and mental health issues.\nFollow @docjohnwright and radio producer @SueM1tchell on Twitter"

      "text": "A number of female Welsh sprinters have been verbally abused by strangers as they train in public.\nThey would normally be able to train at athletics tracks but those venues have been closed because of coronavirus restrictions.\nFormer Wales 400m champion Rhiannon Linington-Payne said the behaviour was \"potential harassment\" and not banter. \nWelsh Athletics said it had started working with South Wales Police to tackle intimidating behaviour.\nLinington-Payne, 29, from Cardiff, said the language shouted was often offensive or derogatory towards women.\n\"I've had inappropriate comments about my figure, wolf-whistling, cars slowing down to stare... I've even had a beer can thrown at me,\" she said. \n\"The more it happens, the more it wears away at you\". \nCurrently only individuals classified as elite athletes by Sport Wales and part of the Commonwealth Games programme can travel to and train at designated facilities. \nIt means many athletes who represent Wales at a high level have been left training at home, alongside roads or in parks. \n\"It's actually quite ironic... I'm not allowed on the track for safety reasons, but I don't feel safe where I'm training now,\" added Great Britain and Wales sprinter Hannah Brier. \nThe 22-year-old, from Neath, who competes in the 100m and 200m sprints trains six days a week, doing weights in her parents' kitchen or running reps alongside flat stretches of road.  \nThe masters student said one incident in the summer left her feeling \"intimidated\" as a man repeatedly drove past her, shouting and staring. \nMiss Brier was so concerned about her safety that she eventually called her dad to pick her up. \nThe incident has left her choosing plainer and looser items of clothing to avoid attention. \n\"I find myself now going through my wardrobe and picking outfits that I think are not as flashy, not as revealing... I'm not going to get noticed if I wear all black,\" she added \nLast week the Welsh Government eased lockdown restrictions to allow an individual to meet one other person from another household to exercise in their local area.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the decision was \"partly\" because they had heard from women that \"in the dark, cold and wet of January they don't feel safe going out to exercise alone\".\nA survey by England Athletics in 2017 found a third of female runners said they had been harassed while out running. \nMore than 60% of the 2,000 women questioned said they felt anxious running alone, with personal safety their main concern.\nLauren Williams, a 400m hurdler from Llanidloes, Powys, has had similar \"unnerving\" experiences while training in public spaces.  \n\"Never before have I felt unsafe training but recently, I really have,\" she said. \nThe 21-year-old said she had received comments on her clothes being \"too tight\", or her outfits being too revealing. \n\"I'm not going out to run to look good, I'm going to perform so it shouldn't matter,\" she added. \nThe management student at Bath University added she does not have a choice other than to train to make next year's Commonwealth Games in Birmingham but she is worried this behaviour might put other women off exercising outdoors. \n\"It manifests itself everywhere even in a local park, the message has got to be it is not ok, the behaviour shouldn't be condoned,\" she said. \nFellow athlete Linington-Payne agrees and has called for wider cultural change to stop this sort of behaviour. \n\"It goes deeper than sport,\" she said.\n\"It's just respect for other human beings and I'm shocked that there are people out there who still think it's appropriate to speak to someone like that.\"\nIn a statement, Welsh Athletics chief executive James Williams said the body's values promotes \"respect, togetherness and fun\" and everyone should be able \"to enjoy the sport in a safe and inclusive way\". \nThe organisation has recently started working with South Wales Police to tackle intimidating behaviour and derogatory comments."

      "tags": "Domestic abuse,Television,Music",
      "text": "US actress Evan Rachel Wood has claimed singer Marilyn Manson \"horrifically abused\" her during their three-year relationship in the late noughties.\nManson and Wood began dating in 2007 and got engaged in 2010, but broke up later that year.\nManson has denied the allegations, saying they were \"horrible distortions of reality\".\nWood has previously said that she is a survivor of rape and domestic abuse, without naming the person accused.\nIn the wake of Wood's allegations, Loma Vista Recordings - which released Manson's most recent albums - said in a statement on Twitter that it would no longer be working with the artist and would cease promoting his latest album \"effective immediately\".\nUS TV network Starz said Manson's guest appearance in fantasy drama American Gods will be removed from an upcoming episode.\nOn Monday, Wood alleged that Manson was her abuser for the first time via a statement posted on her Instagram account.\n\"The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson,\" the Westworld actress claimed.\n\"He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.\"\nShe added: \"I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.\"\nManson responded to the allegations in his own Instagram post on Monday evening, saying: \"Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.\"\n\"My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how - and why - others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth, \" he added.\nSeveral other women came forward via social media platforms on Monday to make similar statements accusing Manson of abuse.\nA guitar technician who toured with Manson, Dan Cleary, has previously said on Twitter that Manson turned Wood \"into a different person\" while on tour, adding: \"He broke her.\"\n\"I then started working for him as his personal assistant in 2014-2015,\" Cleary alleged. \"I saw first-hand, over and over, him being an abusive violent boyfriend to his [girlfriend] Lindsay. Over the almost two-year stretch I saw her in tears and him screaming and belittling her more often than I didn't.\n\"He would threaten to kill her, cut her up, bury her, embarrass her to the world. Making her cry and fear him made him feel good. He would remind her that she'd be homeless without him and make fun of her learning disabled family member.\"\nCleary claimed several people in Manson's inner circle knew of the alleged abuse but would not say anything because of \"the code\" and a fear of losing work.\nWood has previously referred to being raped and abused in interviews and on social media and in 2019 she created the Phoenix Act, which extends the statute of limitations on domestic violence from three years to five. \nThe bill was signed into law by California governor Gavin Newsom in October 2019, and took effect in January 2020. \nAt the time, Wood testified to Congress that her abuser had hidden an addiction to drugs and alcohol from her, and \"had bouts of extreme jealousy, which would often result in him wrecking our home, cornering me in a room, and threatening me\".\nA representative for Manson has previously said it would be \"inappropriate to comment\" on personal testimony.\nLast year, Manson ended an interview with Metal Hammer early after he was questioned about his relationship with Wood, and other women, in light of the actress's testimony.\nManson's team previously defended a quote from a 2009 interview he did with Spin, in which he said of Wood: \"I have fantasies every day about smashing her skull in with a sledgehammer.\" \nHis representatives said his words were \"obviously a theatrical rock star interview promoting a new record, and not a factual account\".\nWood, 33, is known for roles in films such as  The Wrestler and The Ides of March. She has voiced characters in films such as Frozen II and Asterix and the Vikings.\nShe is best known for portraying sentient android Dolores Abernathy in the HBO series Westworld, a role she has played since 2016.\nManson, 52, has released 11 studio albums since 1994, three of which have reached the top 10 in the UK.\nHis biggest hit single was a cover of Soft Cell's Tainted Love, which reached number five in 2001.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, you can access support via BBC Action Line.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is \"optimistic\" people will be able to have summer holidays this year - but it depends on certain things going well.\nAsked about tourism in the UK, he said he did not want to give \"concrete\" dates for such trips but would set out more details on 22 February.\nThe success of the vaccine rollout and level of Covid cases would be factors taken into consideration, he added.\nNearly 9.3 million people in the UK have had their first dose of a vaccine.\nA vaccine has been offered to all older residents at eligible care homes in England, the NHS announced earlier - an achievement Mr Johnson described as a \"crucial milestone\".\nThe government is aiming to offer all care home residents and carers, people over 70 and frontline care workers a vaccination by mid-February. \nFigures released on Monday show a further 18,607 Covid cases have been recorded. There have also been a further 406 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMr Johnson, speaking during a visit to Batley, West Yorkshire, said: \"I don't want to give too much concrete by way of dates for our summer holidays. I am optimistic - I understand the reasons for being optimistic - but some things have got to go right.\n\"The vaccine programme has got to continue to be successful. \n\"We have got to make sure we don't get thrown off course by new variants, we have got to make sure that we continue to keep the disease under control and the level of infections come down.\"\nHe added that once he gives more details in the last week of February \"people should certainly be able to plan on that basis\".\nHis comments come after Health Secretary Matt Hancock predicted \"a happy and free Great British summer\".\nMeanwhile, the government has announced it is to carry out urgent door-to-door testing in parts of England for a new variant of coronavirus originally identified in South Africa, after cases were found with no known links to travel or previous cases.\nAll of the UK is currently under a lockdown, with people only allowed to travel abroad for essential purposes; such as work that cannot be done from home, medical appointments or educational reasons. These are the same \"reasonable excuses\" that apply to domestic travel.\nMr Johnson said there were signs the lockdown measures were working but it was too early to \"take your foot off the throat of the beast\" by easing restrictions.\n\"We are starting to see some signs of a flattening and maybe even a falling off of infection rates and hospitalisations,\" he said.\n\"But don't forget that they are still at a very high level by comparison with most points in the last 12 months, a really very high level.\"\nRules around international travel were tightened last month, meaning all travellers must self-isolate for 10 days when they return to the UK, while people returning to England from high-risk countries will have to quarantine in government-provided hotels.\nPeople leaving England will soon have to make a declaration on why they need to travel, which will be checked by carriers prior to departure, Home Secretary Priti Patel has announced.\nSome UK holiday providers have since reported a boom in domestic bookings for this summer.\nThe boss of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, said he is expecting \"a strong return\" for European beach holidays this summer thanks to the vaccination programme.\nDr Mike Tildesley, an infectious disease expert who advises the government, suggested that if the UK continued the current pace of vaccinations - and jabs were shown to prevent transmission, not just severe infection - measures could begin to be eased from March.\n\"We need to be very careful,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme . \"Hopefully by the summer we can get back to something pretty close to what we have seen before the pandemic as normal.\"\nVaccines would need to be \"pretty good\" at blocking transmission \"to avoid a resurgence\" of the virus when measures are eased, Dr Tildesley added, with research due on this over the next month.\nThe UK government announced on Monday that it had ordered an extra 40 million doses of a vaccine from the French pharmaceutical company Valneva, that should become available later in the year and into 2022.\nThat takes the total number of different vaccines the UK has secured to 407 million doses - more than enough for the entire population.\nHowever, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was too soon to say when \"surplus\" vaccine doses could be donated to other counties, such as European Union member states.\nHe said the priority remained getting the vaccine to the most vulnerable in society by the spring.\nIn other developments:"

      "tags": "Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs,European Union,Fishing industry",
      "text": "The EU has told British fishermen they are indefinitely banned from selling live mussels, oysters, clams, cockles and scallops to its member states.\nAs the UK is now a separate country, it is not allowed to transport the animals to the EU unless they have already been treated in purification plants.\nBut the industry says it does not have enough tanks ready and the process can slow exports, making them less viable. \nThe government promised to continue to \"raise the issue\" with the EU.\nSince 1 January, UK firms have been able to send only pre-purified, ready-to-eat shellfish - accompanied by an export health certificate - to buyers in the EU's 27 member states.\nUntil this year, they could be purified - with contaminants removed in clean seawater tanks - after they reached their destination.\nUK shellfish catches were valued at \u00a3393m in 2019.\nOnly those landed in \"class A\" waters - the very cleanest - can currently be transported from the UK to the EU without the need for purification beforehand. But most UK waters are not in that category.\nThe UK government previously said it thought the restrictions on exports of bivalve molluscs - such as mussels, clams, cockles, scallops and oysters - would end on 21 April.\nThis was because Brussels was \"expected\" to change its rules on that date to allow unpurified shellfish in from non-member states.\nBut it has emerged - as first reported by Politics Home - that the European Commission wrote to leading UK companies on 13 and 19 January to tell them the current arrangement would be in place indefinitely.\nThis has increased fears for the future of businesses and staff, amid concerns that purified shellfish go off quicker than unpurified ones, making them harder to transport.\n\"The issue with shellfish is that they are highly perishable, so there are many risks associated with delays,\" Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, told the BBC. \n\"We are really in a high-risk category compared with other kinds of exports.\"\nHe added that \"nothing\" had changed, in terms of the EU's rules, but firms who had thought they were going to were feeling \"very frustrated\".\nA Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: \"We will continue to raise the issue of live bivalve molluscs not ready for human consumption with the EU, to ensure the trade can continue securely.\"\nMinisters would work to reach an \"appropriate solution\", they added."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Universities in the UK,Universities,Students",
      "text": "The interest on student loans in England should be scrapped for 15 months, a group of universities says.\nThe vice-chancellors of seven universities say this would cover the period from the first national lockdown until summer 2021. \nThey say waiving the charge would ease the pressure on graduates.\nBut the government said such a move would not help students in need amid the coronavirus pandemic as it announced a boost to hardship funding.\nUniversities minister Michelle Donelan said the vice-chancellors' proposal wouldn't put cash into students' pockets to support them during the pandemic.\nShe told BBC Breakfast that \"at least half of students don't actually pay back their student loan\", adding that the government's priority was helping \"those students most in need\".\nThe government has announced an extra \u00a350m for student hardship funds in England, on top of \u00a320m agreed in December.\nIn a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, the vice-chancellors say students are paying a heavy price in the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"The opportunity and wealth gap between the young and old is already unacceptably large - and existing challenges are being amplified by the impact of the pandemic on students and their life chances,\" the letter says.\nIt says the pandemic has placed \"unprecedented pressures on our students\", with demands for hardship funds increasing by over 100% in some universities.\nThe letter is signed by seven vice-chancellors:\nThey call for a reduction equivalent to waiving the interest rate on student loans for the 15 months from the first national lockdown in March 2020 to the end of this academic year.\nIn England students are currently charged 5.6% on their student loans while they are studying,  based on the retail price index, plus 3% - this applies until the 5 April after they graduate and then varies depending on earnings.\nThe letter comes as the government says students facing financial pressures due to the pandemic will have access to an additional \u00a350m support fund.\nMs Donelan said: \"We know that the pandemic, and the implications of the pandemic, has put extra pressure on students' finances.\"\nUniversities will be able to use the extra funding to help students facing loss of employment, additional costs for alternative accommodation or to support access to remote teaching amid Covid-19.\nThe majority of university students in England have been told not to return to campus under the latest lockdown, sparking calls for rent rebates for term-time accommodation, and for tuition fee refunds.\nIn December, the government announced a one-off fund of up to \u00a320m to help students most in need of support in exceptional circumstances - this further \u00a350m takes the total to \u00a370m for this financial year.\nThe funding will be distributed by the Office for Students (OfS) directly to universities, which will prioritise the students most in need.\nLast week, a survey from the Office for National Statistics suggested that a growing proportion of university students were not happy with their academic experience - and nearly two in three had seen their mental health worsen.\nThe University and College Union general secretary, Jo Grady, described the funding as a \"sticking plaster\".\n\"The government needs to go further and provide proper funding to avoid irreparable long-term damage to the sector's reputation,\" she said.\nAlistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said the additional funding was a \"positive step\", but added: \"As the serious mental health impact of the pandemic continues to be felt, universities need further funding to alleviate the substantial increases in demand that university wellbeing and support services are experiencing.\"\nNicola Dandridge, chief executive of the OfS, said the funding was welcome.\n\"We intend to distribute it as swiftly as possible to benefit those who are most in need,\" she said.\nThe independent consultancy London Economics (LE)  looked just at first year undergraduates, from England,  studying across the UK.\nThe cost of writing off their interest, for that one cohort, for this academic year is estimated at roughly \u00a333m, or a 0.3% increase in the cost to the government of funding this cohort.\nMaike Halterbeck, associate director at LE and a specialist in higher education fees and funding, said not much would be gained for students. \n\"In spite of its apparent attractiveness, this proposal wouldn't provide any benefit to the average graduate. \n\"Only the highest earning - predominantly male - graduates would derive a small benefit of a few hundred pounds. It would not affect female graduates, or lower earning male graduates\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nCaptain Sir Tom Moore, the 100-year-old Army veteran who won the nation's hearts by walking 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday last year during the first lockdown, died with coronavirus. Tributes led by the Queen and Boris Johnson flooded in for the \"great British hero\", who raised almost \u00a333m for the NHS. His daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore said he had been treated for pneumonia over the past few weeks and last week tested positive for Covid-19. Here is how Capt Sir Tom became a nation's hero, his obituary, a picture gallery and a look back at his life in the video below.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said it is \"critical\" people in areas of England singled out for enhanced testing for the South African variant stay at home. He told MPs there were other \"mutations of concern\" in Bristol and Liverpool, and people there should also only go out when \"absolutely essential\". The government is expected to announce surge testing in certain postcodes of the two cities. Home testing kits are already being deployed in a number of other areas. Meanwhile, a total of 10,143,511 coronavirus jabs have now been given in the UK, of which 9,646,715 were first doses, government figures show.\nScotland's youngest pupils are likely to return to the classroom full time from 22 February as schools begin a phased reopening. The move will include all pupils in P1-P3 as well as pre-school children. There will also be a part-time return, but on a very limited basis, for senior secondary pupils to allow them to complete work for national qualifications. All of the country's other lockdown restrictions will remain in place until at least the end of the month, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.\nThe Kent variant of coronavirus that has been spreading in the UK appears to be undergoing some \"worrying\" new genetic changes, say scientists. Tests on some samples show a mutation, called E484K, already seen in the South Africa and Brazil variants that are of concern. Although this change may reduce vaccine effectiveness, the current ones in use should still work, say experts. Meanwhile, as we learn more about how the virus spreads, the advice about which face covering is best to wear is changing in some countries. The BBC's science editor David Shukman looks at the options in the video below.\nThere are many ways companies and employees have adapted to the Covid pandemic, including those who have taken to working from their shed and fashion brands innovating to try to survive. Online-only Scottish company Oh Polly specialises in outfits you'd buy for a glamorous night out - clothes that essentially became irrelevant the moment clubs and restaurants were shut. But they were able to turn around a loungewear and tracksuit collection in a matter of months. Elsewhere, shed sellers have seen a surge in demand for insulated, luxury outhouses that can be used as home offices as the garden path became the new commute for wealthy home workers.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nTo read about what home-schooling technology help you may be able to get.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Aung San Suu Kyi,Myanmar coup ,Myanmar,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Calls are growing for the release of Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi a day after the army seized power in the south-east Asian nation. \nMs Suu Kyi, who led the country's elected government, has not been seen since she was detained by the military.\nMPs who were confined in their accommodation in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, have now been told they can leave.\nBut there are signs of defiance, including a medical staff strike and pot-banging in the main city Yangon.\nThe military took power in the early hours of Monday and declared a year-long state of emergency after accusing Ms Suu Kyi's party of fraud over its recent election win.\nHer National League for Democracy (NLD) demanded her immediate release on Tuesday. It has also called upon the military to accept the results of the November election, which saw the NLD win more than 80% of the votes. \nMyanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces until 2011, when a nominally civilian government was sworn in.\nThe morning after the coup, the country remained calm. Streets were quiet, with troops patrolling all major cities and a night-time curfew in force.\nThe communications systems which had been disrupted on Monday had returned by Tuesday morning, with phone and internet connections running again. \nBut as night fell on Tuesday, car horns and the banging of cooking pots could be heard in the streets of Yangon in a sign of protest. \nA campaign of civil disobedience appeared to be gathering steam with doctors working in government hospitals saying they would stop work from Wednesday to push for Ms Suu Kyi's release. \nSome medics are resorting to wearing symbols in silent protest. \nAt least one doctor has quit in protest, saying \"such coups cannot be tolerated at all\". \nDr Naing Htoo Aung, a 47-year-old anaesthesiologist at Mongywa Hospital in Sagaing Region, told BBC Burmese: \"I resigned because I couldn't work under a military dictator who did not care about the country and the people. This is the best response I can give to them.\"  \nOne 25-year-old resident, who asked not to be named, told the BBC: \"Waking up to learn your world has been completely turned upside down overnight was not a new feeling, but a feeling that I thought that we had moved on from, and one that I never thought we'd be forced to feel again.\"\nMore than 100 MPs, who were blockaded in their accommodation by troops in the capital Nay Pyi Taw, have now been told they are free to leave, BBC Burmese has learned. \nPower has been handed over to commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. Eleven ministers and deputies, including those in finance, health, the interior and foreign affairs, have been replaced. \nIn the first meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing repeated that the takeover had been \"inevitable\" after the military made allegations of electoral fraud.  \nBy Nyein Chan Aye, BBC Burmese, Yangon\nThis city of more than five million people is trying to get back to normal but has yet to digest the previous day's events. \nThe streets are quieter than usual this morning and security forces are deployed at major points. Panic buying has stopped and telecommunications services are back.\nPrivate banks are resuming their services after temporarily closing down on Monday. Many people are withdrawing cash to brave the uncertain times ahead. \nIn Nay Pyi Taw, troops with tanks and trucks still surround the country's parliament. \nIt has been a bloodless coup so far, but the impact could be severe at a time of economic downturn amid the Covid pandemic. \nThe political turmoil, with possible international sanctions and foreign investment now uncertain, has left people frustrated and angry. \nThere have been no official statements on Ms Suu Kyi's exact whereabouts since she was detained in pre-dawn raids on Monday.\nBut unnamed sources from within the NLD have said both she and President Win Myint were being held under house arrest.\n\"We were informed not to worry. However we are worrying. It would be a relief if we could see photos of them at home,\" the MP told news agency AFP, on condition of anonymity.\nMany of the other detained lawmakers are also still held in their government housing in the capital, with one member of the NLD describing it as \"an open-air detention centre\".\nMs Suu Kyi - who spent nearly 15 years in detention between 1989 and 2010 - has urged her supporters to \"protest against the coup\" in a letter written before she was detained. It warned the military's actions would put the country back under a dictatorship.\nShe was barred from becoming president because she has children born to a foreign national. But since the NLD's decisive election victory in 2015 she has been widely seen as de facto leader. \nMyanmar is a country of 54 million people in south-east Asia which shares borders with India, China and Thailand, among others. \nIt was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011.\nNearly all expressions of dissent were banned and accusations of severe human rights abuses led to international condemnation and sanctions.\nAung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence.\nA government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. Her party won again by a landslide in the 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more.\nUS President Joe Biden has threatened to reinstate sanctions on Myanmar. He said the military should not \"overrule the will of the people\".\nAlong with the US, the United Nations, the UK and the EU have also condemned the military takeover. \nThe US had removed sanctions over the past decade as Myanmar progressed towards democracy. \nSanctions could theoretically be imposed on large companies linked to the military that deal in gems, clothing and have banking interests. They may also target individual generals. Other options include cutting aid, but there are concerns this could unfairly affect the wider population. \nIt is unclear though how much effect the US warnings will have. The coup leaders will have expected sanctions and factored those into their plans. \nToe Zaw Latt, Myanmar bureau chief of the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), a non-profit news organisation based outside of Myanmar, told the BBC that the military will know sanctions are an unavoidable consequence of their actions, adding that \"they don't care about Western sanctions\" and are more concerned \"about how China, Japan, South Korea respond\". \n\"The country enjoys Chinese protection and South East Asian markets,\" Myanmar expert Elliott Prasse-Freeman of the National University of Singapore explains. \n\"Hence I expect them to react to sanctions with a shrug, the price paid for reasserting power and assuaging the humiliation of losing to their democratic enemies in two consecutive elections.\"\nChina, which has previously opposed international intervention in Myanmar, urged all sides in the country to \"resolve differences\". China's Xinhua news agency described the changes as a \"cabinet reshuffle\". \nOther countries in the region, including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines, have said it is an \"internal matter\"."

      "text": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is to step down as chief executive of the e-commerce giant that he started in his garage nearly 30 years ago.\nHe will become executive chairman, a move he said would give him \"time and energy\" to focus on his other ventures.\nMr Bezos, who has a fortune of almost $200bn, will be replaced by Andy Jassy, who currently leads Amazon's cloud computing business.\nThe change will take place in the second half of 2021, the company said.\n\"Being the CEO of Amazon is a deep responsibility, and it's consuming. When you have a responsibility like that, it's hard to put attention on anything else,\" Mr Bezos said in a letter to Amazon staff on Tuesday.\n\"As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions.\" \n\"I've never had more energy, and this isn't about retiring. I'm super passionate about the impact I think these organisations can have,\" he added.\nMr Bezos, 57, has led Amazon since its start as an online bookshop in 1994. The firm now employs 1.3 million people globally and has its hand in everything from package delivery and streaming video to cloud services and advertising. \nHe's amassed a fortune of $196.2bn, according to Forbes' list of billionaires., making him the world's richest man. However, Bloomberg's billionaire index puts Tesla boss Elon Musk just ahead of him.\nAmazon saw its already explosive growth skyrocket last year, as the pandemic prompted a surge in online shopping.\nThe firm reported $386bn (\u00a3283bn) in sales in 2020, up 38% from 2019. Profits almost doubled, rising to $21.3bn.\nIn announcing the plans, Mr Bezos said he would continue to focus on new products and initiatives.\n\"When you look at our financial results, what you're actually seeing are the long-run cumulative results of invention,\" he said. \"Right now I see Amazon at its most inventive ever, making it an optimal time for this transition.\"\nThe shake-up comes as Mr Bezos has developed an increasingly public profile. \nHe has endured a public divorce, become a target for labour and inequality activists, and poured his wealth into other businesses, such as space exploration firm Blue Origin and the Washington Post newspaper. \nAmazon also faces increasing scrutiny from regulators, who have questioned its monopoly power. And its dominance in cloud computing is being increasingly challenged by other tech firms, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube.\nMr Bezos's decision to hand over the day-to-day operation of the company came as a surprise. But investors appeared unfazed, with little change in the firm's share price in after-hours trade.\nIn a call with analysts to discuss the firm's financial results, Amazon chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said: \"Jeff is not leaving, he is getting a new job... The board is super active and important in Amazon's success story.\"\u00a0\nMr Jassy, a Harvard graduate, has been with Amazon since 1997 and helped develop Amazon Web Services, which has long been seen as the profit engine of the company.\nThe division provides cloud computing and storage for governments and companies including McDonald's and Netflix. \n\"Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have. He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence,\" Mr Bezos said.\nSophie Lund-Yates, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was \"no accident\" that Amazon is tapping the head of the cloud business to lead the company. \nThis is a real surprise. But you have to remember that Jeff Bezos himself is worth nearly $200bn. \nAnd when you're that rich imagine what you can do. Jeff Bezos has some pretty lofty ambitions outside of Amazon. \nHis Blue Origin company wants to \"build a road to space\". He's also sunk $10bn into Earth Fund, designed to help combat the effects of climate change. \nOh, and he also owns the Washington Post. \nHow will Amazon cope? Well, importantly, he's not leaving. As executive chair and founder he'll still exercise huge power over the company. \nHowever, stepping back will inevitably mean less influence.\nHis replacement - Andy Jassy - has been running Amazon Web Services, Amazon's booming cloud business division. \nHis rise to the top underscores how important this business has become to Amazon.\nAnother top executive, Jeff Wilke, who led the firm's consumer business, announced his retirement last year.\nAmazon Web Services \"continued to shine in [its most recent] quarter, and now accounts for a more meaningful chunk of sales. The potential here is huge, and the scalable benefits that come with it should have ears pricking up,\" she said.\nOverall sales at the company rose 44% in the last three months of the year to $125.6bn, boosted in part by renewed lockdowns in some parts of the world as well as a later date for the firm's \"Prime Day\", when the firm drives sales with a slew of discounts.\nAmazon Web Services saw sales rise 28% to $12.7bn.\nCarolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, wrote on Twitter that the \"huge\" announcement showed how central cloud services are to Amazon's business.\nBut she added that she did not think Bezos was \"done making an impact on the future of the company\". \nCritics of the firm reacted to the announcement similarly. \n\"Do not be fooled by Amazon. Jeff Bezos is still in a position of immense power as executive chair,\" said Public Citizen, a US-based consumer rights activist group. \"This abusive, predatory monopoly still needs a complete overhaul.\""

      "text": "A man who was treated with imported blood products in the 1980s became the first haemophiliac in the UK to test HIV positive and die of Aids, an inquiry has heard. \nKevin Slater, from Cwmbran, was 20 when he developed Aids in 1983 the Infected Blood Inquiry has been told. \nHe was not informed that he had been diagnosed with the condition for at least 18 months and died in 1985. \nRecords show it was recommended that the diagnosis be kept from him. \nThe UK-wide inquiry is looking into what has been described as the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS.\nHaemophilia is a blood condition which affects the clotting of blood in those affected. \nIn the 1980s some of the blood products used to treat the condition were infected with HIV.\nThe inquiry heard there were about 100 haemophiliac patients in Wales at the time. \nMr Slater's sister-in-law Lynda Maule said she does not believe he was ever told he had Aids. \n\"He was treated disgustingly,\" she told the inquiry. \"There was no care, nothing. \n\"The way he was treated - put in a separate room, meals being passed through the door. \n\"This guy towards the end was being fed by his parents because he couldn't get out of bed, he couldn't physically get out of bed. \n\"I don't think he was ever told, that's my honest opinion. I don't remember ever hearing Kevin say 'Oh you know this is the score then mum' or his Mum actually looking up and saying 'we've found out what's up'.\"\nMr Slater's brother Paul was also a haemophiliac who died of Aids in 1991 after being given infected blood. \nMs Maule said hearing the evidence at the inquiry has been difficult but added it is important to establish justice for those who were infected with HIV as a result of contaminated blood. \n\"Hearing it all again today brought it all back,\" she said. \"I can see this guy there, crying out for help and not getting it.\"\nThe inquiry also was told consultant Prof Arthur Bloom did not immediately inform the haemophiliac community that he was treating a patient with a confirmed case of Aids. \nThis was despite Aids being marked as probable on Mr Slater's medical records. \nFor several months Prof Bloom continued to describe the case to haemophiliac groups and officials in terms such as \"possible\" and \"suspected\" and that links had not been established with infected blood products. \nInquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff described the descriptions as \"difficult to reconcile\".\nThe hearing is continuing."

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is set to confirm whether Scotland's Covid lockdown will be extended beyond mid-February.\nThe first minister is also expected to give details about the reopening of schools and nurseries.\nOther steps to combat the spread of the virus, including tougher supervised quarantine measures, will be outlined in a statement at Holyrood.\nThe level four restrictions have closed non-essential shops and have seen a \"stay at home\" message put down in law.\nThey have been in place across mainland Scotland since Boxing Day and were last week extended to the Western Isles.\nIt comes amid growing concern that Scotland's vaccination programme is lagging behind the rest of the UK.\nScotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said Scotland would not see \"all of lockdown lifted\", but added that progress had been made in recent weeks.\nHe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that public health advisors had been weighing what restrictions should be eased first as infection rates slowed and the positivity rate went down.\n\"The most important thing is children and that's what we've trailed in the last few weeks - that we will get some kids back to school if we can possibly make it safe,\" he said.\n\"That's the recommendation, based on the public health threat of keeping schools closed.\"\nBut Prof Leitch said it was not time for schools to \"go back to normal\", adding that while it might be possible to allow the youngest primary-age children to return to school, it was \"more difficult\" to see older children back in the classroom.\n\"It gets more difficult at that end for a couple of reasons,\" he said.\n\"The principal reason is that older kids behave like adults in relation to the virus, so they can spread the virus and the new variant spreads proportionately more easily even in that group. So we've got to be cautious.\"\nScottish government ministers are meeting on Tuesday morning to review the latest data and decide what happens next, with the first minister due to give her update at 14:20.\nThe government says Scotland's NHS is on course to have vaccinated all over-80s by Friday and the over-70s by the end of next week.\nBut opposition parties have accused Ms Sturgeon of being \"in denial\" about the pace of the vaccine rollout in Scotland - with Prof Leitch admitting that \"we do need to be doing it faster\".\nScotland, which has about a twelfth of the UK population, has vaccinated just over 575,000 people while the UK tally stands at about 9.3 million. \nAnd the country had vaccinated the lowest percentage of its adult population - 12.7% - of all of the four UK nations by Monday.\nThe figure for England stood at 17.8% while it was 16% in Wales and 14.8% in Northern Ireland.\nDuring her daily media briefing on Monday the first minister said the current lockdown \"is working\" but warned that case numbers are still too high.\nPupils across the country are currently home schooling but Ms Sturgeon is expected to give more clarity as to how they may return to the classroom.\nThe most likely option is a phased approach that would see the youngest pupils and those with additional support needs among the first wave.\nSenior pupils preparing coursework for assessment are also likely to be among the first to go back as this year's Highers and Advanced Higher exams have been cancelled.\nThe first minister will also update Holyrood on plans to keep the virus under control when the easing of lockdown begins. \nLast week it was announced that people travelling to England from certain \"high risk\" countries will soon have to quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels so the measure can be more strictly enforced.\nScotland has its own quarantine rules, which differ slightly, as do Wales and Northern Ireland.\nBut tougher restrictions for supervised quarantine of travellers are expected to be announced after the Scottish government last week said UK Government measures \"did not go far enough\"\nThe move is a response to the emergence of new variants of coronavirus, from countries such as South Africa and Brazil, which are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic."

      "text": "Tougher quarantine restrictions will be extended to all travellers arriving directly into Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced.\nThe four UK nations have already agreed that people arriving from high risk countries on a \"red list\" will have to quarantine in hotels.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said the measure \"does not go far enough\".\nThe Scottish government now plans to introduce a \"much more comprehensive\" approach to \"managed quarantine\".\n\"I can therefore confirm today that we intend to introduce a managed quarantine requirement for anyone who arrives directly into Scotland, regardless of which country they have come from,\" she said.\nMore details on how and when the changes to quarantine would come into effect would be set out and put into operation as soon as possible.\nThe first minister said the stricter rules were to \"guard against\" the importation of new variants. \nShe said that the approach agreed across the UK only included countries where new variants had already been identified. \nMs Sturgeon said this was \"too reactive\" because a new variant will often have spread across borders by the time it has been identified through genomic sequencing.\nWhile the Scottish government cannot \"unilaterally\" implement managed quarantine for people arriving in other parts of the UK before travelling to Scotland, it will urge the UK government to adopt the stricter approach. \n\"If they do not wish to do so... we will ask them to work with us to reduce the risk amongst people travelling to Scotland via ports elsewhere in the UK,\" she said.\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs that Covid had almost been eliminated in Scotland last summer - before it was \"re-seeded from overseas travel\".\nAsked about strengthening checks on those travelling between Scotland and England, Ms Sturgeon said she would continue to speak to Police Scotland about enforcement. \nAll overseas travellers - including British nationals - are already expected self-isolate for 10 days upon arrival in the UK, even with a recent negative test result.\nThe UK has now placed 33 high-risk countries where new Covid variants have been identified on a so-called \"red list\".\nPlans have been announced to make anyone travelling to England from a red-list country quarantine in a hotel.\nArrivals will be met at the airport or point of entry and taken to the hotel so that self-isolation can be enforced \"without exception\".\nInternational flights into Scotland have fallen sharply during the pandemic. For example, the only overseas flights landing in Scotland on Wednesday are from Norway to Aberdeen.\nToday's new rules make it almost impossible to fly from Scotland for a foreign holiday or for any other reason, without facing quarantine on your return. \nAnd very tight restrictions now apply to anyone coming here from abroad.\nThis clampdown makes life even tougher for Scotland's airports and travel industry, which are reeling after almost a year of disruption. Nicola Sturgeon said she'd work with the UK government to give them the support they need.\nHow long will this last? Will foreign holidays be impossible this summer? \nThat's unclear. But the first minister said efforts to eliminate Covid here last summer had been thwarted after the virus was \"re-seeded [in Scotland] from overseas travel\".\nSo what's crystal clear is she wants to avoid a wave of foreign holidays this summer causing another wave of Covid and lockdown in the autumn.\nA spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said there was an urgent need to reach agreement on how the aviation industry would recover from the pandemic.\n\"We still don't know how this is expected to work, when it is being enacted and what it means for airports and our industry, so yet again we ask the Scottish government to talk to us,\" he said. \n\"We understand restrictions are required but we're now coming up for a year of little to no passengers without direct industry support.\"\nDerek Provan, chief executive of AGS Airports, which includes Glasgow Airport, said it was the third significant announcement which had been made on travel restrictions in as many weeks without any consultation. \n\"We understand the need for short-term emergency measures, and we all want to see this virus brought under control as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\"However, it's imperative government engages with industry on developing a recovery plan.\" \nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

At that stage there were eight confirmed cases, and two that were suspected.\nSpeaking to BBC Wales, Chief Scientific Adviser Rob Orford said the situation was being monitored \"very carefully in Wales\".\n\"We're very fortunate in Wales to have a very good system in place where we sequence many of the positive Covid test that we that we have back,\" he said.\nHe said numbers of the UK Kent variant - identified before Christmas - had reduced during lockdown.\nWhat is the new variant?\nAll viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into new versions or variants.\nThese tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive.\nMost are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some variants can make the virus more infectious or threatening to the host - humans.\nThere are now many thousands of variants of the pandemic virus circulating. But experts are concerned about the South African variant, or 501.V2, as they fear it can spread more readily and vaccines may not work quite as well against it.\nIn a statement the Welsh Government said: \"We are considering whether enhanced arrangements, which might include testing, are needed.\n\"We continue to look for cases through the quarantine and testing arrangements currently in place, as well as through our programme of genomic surveillance.\n\"We work closely with Public Health Wales and with the wider UK response to monitor, detect and investigate new variants of the virus.\"\nIt is not clear where the cases had been found.\nPublic Health Wales earlier announced there had been 614 new Covid infections, of all variants, and seven further deaths on Tuesday as Wales' average case rate fell to 131 cases per 100,000 people.\nIn a virtual session of the Senedd on Tuesday, Mr Gething said there are concerns that both the South African variant and a recent mutated form of the Kent variant, will have a \"less effective response\" for vaccines.\n\"That does not mean that vaccines won't be effective at all; they will still offer a good level of protection and it reinforces the need to continue going with real pace in our vaccination programme,\" he said.\nMr Gething said he was confident the Welsh Government had the ability to identify such cases through testing.\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"In other parts of the UK a door-to-door testing blitz is getting under way in a bid to find every single case of the South African variant, and those in affected postcodes are being instructed to only go out when 'absolutely essential'. \n\"Labour's health minister must urgently update the Senedd on the latest presence of both variants in Wales and unique measures the Welsh Government intends to take to tackle and reduce transmission.\"\nPlaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"This is a reminder of the importance of an effective test, trace and isolate system alongside the protection that the vaccine can give us. \n\"If infection can quickly be identified and traced, and people are supported to self-isolate - including an increase to isolation payments to \u00a3800 as Plaid Cymru has been asking for - then it will help us to keep ahead of the new variant.\"\nMeanwhile, a senior researcher has said people in Wales have played a significant part in the development treatments and vaccines to combat Covid-19.\nDr Nicola Williams from Health and Care Research Wales said 1,200 people helped test the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines, while people in north Wales had taken part in Novavax trials. \nThe Novavax jab - which last week was shown to be 89% effective - is the first to be tested and have some success against new variants.\nDr Williams said they had an \"overwhelming response\" from the public and not everyone was able to be put into a trial.\n\"What we have achieved in Wales is tremendous,\" she said.\n\"We've been able to come together as a community [with] NHS and academia and we've been able to put Wales on the map in terms of its ability to be responsive, to set up studies really quickly and then really deliver, in terms of recruiting successfully to those studies.\""

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is set to confirm whether Scotland's Covid lockdown will be extended beyond mid-February.\nThe first minister is also expected to give details about the reopening of schools and nurseries.\nOther steps to combat the spread of the virus, including tougher supervised quarantine measures, will be outlined in a statement at Holyrood.\nThe level four restrictions have closed non-essential shops and have seen a \"stay at home\" message put down in law.\nThey have been in place across mainland Scotland since Boxing Day and were last week extended to the Western Isles.\nIt comes amid growing concern that Scotland's vaccination programme is lagging behind the rest of the UK.\nScotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said Scotland would not see \"all of lockdown lifted\", but added that progress had been made in recent weeks.\nHe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that public health advisors had been weighing what restrictions should be eased first as infection rates slowed and the positivity rate went down.\n\"The most important thing is children and that's what we've trailed in the last few weeks - that we will get some kids back to school if we can possibly make it safe,\" he said.\n\"That's the recommendation, based on the public health threat of keeping schools closed.\"\nBut Prof Leitch said it was not time for schools to \"go back to normal\", adding that while it might be possible to allow the youngest primary-age children to return to school, it was \"more difficult\" to see older children back in the classroom.\n\"It gets more difficult at that end for a couple of reasons,\" he said.\n\"The principal reason is that older kids behave like adults in relation to the virus, so they can spread the virus and the new variant spreads proportionately more easily even in that group. So we've got to be cautious.\"\nScottish government ministers are meeting on Tuesday morning to review the latest data and decide what happens next, with the first minister due to give her update at 14:20.\nThe government says Scotland's NHS is on course to have vaccinated all over-80s by Friday and the over-70s by the end of next week.\nBut opposition parties have accused Ms Sturgeon of being \"in denial\" about the pace of the vaccine rollout in Scotland - with Prof Leitch admitting that \"we do need to be doing it faster\".\nScotland, which has about a twelfth of the UK population, has vaccinated just over 575,000 people while the UK tally stands at about 9.3 million. \nAnd the country had vaccinated the lowest percentage of its adult population - 12.7% - of all of the four UK nations by Monday.\nThe figure for England stood at 17.8% while it was 16% in Wales and 14.8% in Northern Ireland.\nDuring her daily media briefing on Monday the first minister said the current lockdown \"is working\" but warned that case numbers are still too high.\nPupils across the country are currently home schooling but Ms Sturgeon is expected to give more clarity as to how they may return to the classroom.\nThe most likely option is a phased approach that would see the youngest pupils and those with additional support needs among the first wave.\nSenior pupils preparing coursework for assessment are also likely to be among the first to go back as this year's Highers and Advanced Higher exams have been cancelled.\nThe first minister will also update Holyrood on plans to keep the virus under control when the easing of lockdown begins. \nLast week it was announced that people travelling to England from certain \"high risk\" countries will soon have to quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels so the measure can be more strictly enforced.\nScotland has its own quarantine rules, which differ slightly, as do Wales and Northern Ireland.\nBut tougher restrictions for supervised quarantine of travellers are expected to be announced after the Scottish government last week said UK Government measures \"did not go far enough\"\nThe move is a response to the emergence of new variants of coronavirus, from countries such as South Africa and Brazil, which are more infectious than the original one that started the pandemic."

      "text": "Deaths caused by alcohol hit a new high during the first nine months of 2020, provisional figures for England and Wales show.  \nBetween January and September, 5,460 deaths were registered with this cause - up 16% on the same months in 2019. \nIt is the biggest toll recorded since records began in 2001.\nThe high rates spanned the period during and after the first Covid lockdown, the Office for National Statistics figures show.\nIt reached a peak of 12.8 deaths per 100,000 people in the first three months of 2020 and remained at this level through to September - higher than in any other time on record. \nAs in past years, rates of male alcohol-specific deaths were twice those seen for women. \nExperts say the coronavirus pandemic will have had little effect on how the data was gathered and recorded. \nBut it is not clear how much it may have contributed to the deaths.\nONS spokesman Ben Humberstone said: \"Today's data shows that in the first three quarters of 2020, alcohol-specific deaths in England and Wales reached the highest level since the beginning of our data series, with April to September, during and after the first lockdown, seeing higher rates compared to the same period in previous years.\"\n\"The reasons for this are complex and it will take time before the impact the pandemic has had on alcohol-specific deaths is fully understood.\" \nJohn Slater, 63, sought help for his drinking a few years ago, saying dependency \"crept up on me gradually\" after taking an ill health pension and becoming a carer for relatives. \n\"I needed some way to be able to cope, to escape, and alcohol was it,\" he says. \"I wasn't all over the place, it started as a means to cope. I always used to spend time cooking a nice meal and would have a glass of wine, but one glass became two glasses which became three and then a bottle, two bottles, hidden bottles. Then you realise, oh hell, I have got a real problem here.\n\"Whenever I thought I had to cut my drinking down, I couldn't manage it and panicked and I went to the supermarket.\" \nJohn, from Devon, says he was scared of being labelled an alcoholic. \"There's still an enormous amount of stigma around it,\" he says. \"It makes it really difficult for people to come forward.\"\nHe eventually found help via the programme Drink Wise Age Well which is run by charity We Are With You, which he says offered a \"holistic\" approach and addressed his childhood trauma. He no longer drinks.\n\"It's not all about people having to go to rehab,\" says John. \"It's also about how our drinking increases when we are maybe isolated, or lonely, or become unemployed, or don't feel wanted or the burden of life increases.\"\nLooking at today's figures about alcohol-related deaths, John says that without help, there was a chance he could have \"carried on sinking and drinking, and gradually unravelled\".\nThe UK's Addiction Treatment Group said it knew first hand how many people have struggled with alcohol since the pandemic began. \n\"We must remember that what we're talking about here aren't just figures; they're people,\" said Nuno Albuquerque, head of treatment at the group.\n\"They're mums, dads, brothers, sisters, friends, colleagues and neighbours who have lost their lives to alcohol; a substance so widely accepted and almost encouraged in this country, but one so controlling, addictive and, ultimately, life-threatening.\"\nIf you are concerned about addiction, BBC Action Line has help and support. \nHave you been affected by this story?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Public Health England is investigating cases of coronavirus with 'worrying' new genetic changes that have been found in some regions of the UK. \nTests show they have a mutation, called E484K, that is already seen in the South Africa variant. \nAlthough this change may reduce vaccine effectiveness, the current ones in use should still work, say experts.\nThere have been 11 cases in Bristol and a cluster of 32 cases in Liverpool. \nUrgent testing for the South Africa variant is already starting in parts of England and could be rolled out to other areas seeing different variants with the same E484K mutation. \nScientists working with Public Health England found a small number of cases of the UK 'Kent' variant with the E484K mutation - it was seen in 11 out of 214,159 samples that they tested, and predominantly from the South West of England.\nIt is likely there may be more cases that haven't yet been found. The Liverpool area has seen 32 cases of original coronavirus that have the E484K mutation too.\nIt's not unexpected that variants are appearing or that they will continue to change - all viruses mutate as they make new copies of themselves to spread and thrive.\nDr Julian Tang, a virus expert at the University of Leicester, described the finding as \"a worrying development, though not entirely unexpected\".\nHe said it was important people follow the lockdown rules and get cases of coronavirus down to prevent opportunities for the virus to mutate further. \n\"Otherwise not only can the virus continue to spread, it can also evolve.\"\nHe said that allowing spread could allow a \"melting pot\" for different emerging variants. \nScientists have already been checking what these new mutations might mean for existing coronavirus vaccines that were designed around earlier versions of the virus that started the pandemic. \nSome research appears to show E484K may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies.\nBut early results from Moderna suggest its vaccine is still effective against variants with this mutation - although the body's immune response may not be as strong or prolonged.\nTwo new coronavirus vaccines that could be approved soon - one from Novavax and another from Janssen - also appear to offer good cover against variants, protecting against serious illness. \nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts.\nA silver lining may be that the variants are mutating in a similar way rather than diverging from each other. \nProf Ravi Gupta from the University of Cambridge said: \"This gives us a sign that it has certain favoured routes - and we can work to block those off with a vaccine.\"\nFormer UK health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the race was on to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible in order to keep a step ahead of the virus.\nMeasures such as washing your hands, keeping your distance from other people and wearing a face covering will still help prevent infections."

      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

It includes testing people who do not have Covid symptoms.\nThe testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants.\nSurge testing is currently taking place in areas of England where the new Delta variant - first identified in India - is spreading fastest.\nEast\nNorth West\nWest Midlands\nSouth East\nSurge testing is also currently being carried out in specific and targeted locations within the following local authority areas:\nLondon\nSouth East\nNorth West\nYorkshire and the Humber\nTargeted community testing is also taking place in various health board areas across Scotland. \nScientists have identified a number of \"variants of concern\" - these are  newly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. \nAlso, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines.\nThe Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). \nThe variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming system which uses Greek letters instead. \nThe PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test \nPeople tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. \nThis involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis.\nIt is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result.\nThe lateral flow test \nThis also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes.\nWherever you are in the UK, if you have symptoms you should book a free test online. You will be sent to a testing site or have a testing kit sent to your home. \nIf you have problems booking, call 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland. \nAnyone in England can now get free lateral flow tests each week - even if they do not have symptoms. These can be ordered online, by calling 119, or can be collected from test centres and pharmacies. \nAnyone in Scotland can also order free lateral flow tests online, or collect them from test centres.\nAnyone who gets a positive result test must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. NHS Test and Trace will tell their contacts to isolate if necessary.\nSelf-isolating means not leaving home for exercise or even to buy food, medicines or other essentials.\nPeople in England who fail to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to \u00a310,000.\nAnyone on a low income who has been told to self-isolate can claim a \u00a3500 payment."

The tests will be PCR ones, which involve swabbing the nose or throat and are regarded as the most reliable.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, the health secretary said: \"We have also seen 11 cases of mutations of concern in Bristol and 32 in Liverpool, and are taking the same approach. \n\"In all these areas it is imperative that people must stay at home and only leave home where it is absolutely essential.\"\nHe also urged people to take a test if offered one by their local authority. \nPublic Health England (PHE) later confirmed that the 11 cases in Bristol were the new Kent variant with the E484K mutation, which has already been seen in the South African and Brazilian variants. \nThe 32 cases in Liverpool are the original version of Covid-19 but also have the new E484K mutation.\nThere is some concern this mutation might make vaccines less effective.\nA PHE spokesman said it was \"monitoring the situation closely and all necessary public health interventions are being undertaken, including enhanced contact tracing and control measures\". \nA spokesman for Bristol City Council said local public health teams would begin to plan for extra testing in the area, with details released when approved. \nThe news on mutations has obviously caused alarm. \nWhat is more, there are likely to be more out there - the ones detected so far come from random sampling of between 5% and 10% of positive cases.\nBut that should not detract from the progress that is being made in terms of spread of the virus.\nThis is the second day in a row that cases have been below 20,000.\nAt the start of the year around 60,000 new cases a day were being diagnosed.\nThis drop has now started to translate to significantly fewer admissions to hospital - the numbers have dropped by nearly a quarter in the past week.\nThis will mean deaths will soon start falling - in fact it already looks as if the peak may have been passed last week.\nLater in the month it would be hoped the impact of vaccinations would be felt, which could result in a quite marked drop in deaths.\nThe mutations require vigilance, but the bigger picture shows real progress is being made.\nMeanwhile, tougher quarantine restrictions will be extended to all travellers arriving directly into Scotland, to minimise the risk of new variants entering the country, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. \nThe four UK nations have already agreed that people arriving from high risk countries under travel bans will have to isolate in hotels rather than at home, with the measure due to be introduced in the coming weeks.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said this did \"not go far enough\" and her government intended to implement \"managed quarantine\" for anyone who arrives directly in Scotland. \nShe added that five cases of the South African variant had been identified in Scotland but they were all linked to travel. \nLabour has also called for hotel quarantine to apply to all UK arrivals. \nIn December, the discovery of the new variant prompted a ban on foreign nationals travelling into the UK from South Africa and later from southern African countries.\nIt comes as the latest figures show the UK has given out more than 10 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, including more than 9.6 million first doses. \nThe number of daily coronavirus cases recorded in the UK continues to fall, with 16,840 cases recorded on Tuesday - the lowest daily figure since 9 December. \nThere have also been a further 1,449 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government figures. \nIt compares to 1,631 deaths recorded last Tuesday and means the number of deaths has fallen for seven days in a row, compared to the same day the previous week. \nIn other developments: \nDo you live in an area where the South Africa variant is suspected?

      "text": "A landmark review has called for transformational change in our economic approach to nature.\nThe long-awaited review by Prof Sir Partha Dasgupta, of the University of Cambridge, says prosperity has come at a \"devastating\" cost to the natural world.\nThe report proposes recognising nature as an asset and reconsidering our measures of economic prosperity.\nIt is expected to set the agenda on government policy going forward.\nAt its heart is the idea that sustainable economic growth requires a different measure than Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\"Truly sustainable economic growth and development means recognising that our long-term prosperity relies on rebalancing our demand of nature's goods and services with its capacity to supply them,\" Prof Dasgupta said in a statement.\n\"It also means accounting fully for the impact of our interactions with nature across all levels of society.\"\nCovid-19 has shown us what can happen when we don't do this, he added. \"Nature is our home. Good economics demands we manage it better.\" \nThe Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity was commissioned by the UK Treasury in 2019, the first time a national finance ministry has authorised a full assessment of the economic importance of nature.\nThe report, which has been compared with the influential 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, sets out the ways in which we should account for nature in economics and decision-making. \nRecommendations include:\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed the review. The UK is co-hosting COP26 - this year's UN climate meeting - and also holds the presidency of this year's G7. Mr Johnson said: \"We are going to make sure the natural world stays right at the top of the global agenda.\"\nSir David Attenborough, who wrote the foreword to the review, said: \"This comprehensive and immensely important report shows us how, by bringing economics and ecology face-to-face, we can help to save the natural world and, in doing so, save ourselves.\" \nThe 600-page review argues that losses in biodiversity are undermining the productivity, resilience and adaptability of nature. This is in turn putting economies, livelihoods and well-being at risk. \nCommenting on the review, Jennifer Morris, of conservation non-profit The Nature Conservancy, described it as a \"clarion call\" to world leaders.\n\"We must tackle the nature crisis in conjunction with the climate emergency for the sake of our economies, livelihoods, and wellbeing - and those of future generations,\" she said.\n The review has been published at the beginning of a critical year for tackling the climate change and extinction crises. \nPolicymakers are looking ahead to the UN Biodiversity Conference COP15 in Kunming, China, closely followed by the UN Climate Change Summit (COP26) in Glasgow in late 2021.\nBiodiversity is declining faster than at any time in human history. Since 1970, there has been on average almost a 70% decline in the populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. \nIt is thought that one million animal and plant species  - almost a quarter of the global total - are threatened with extinction. \nThe idea of being able to put a price on nature divides opinion, but accounting for the economic value of nature is increasingly guiding policy.\nWhile some argue that the assumption the natural world has no value is baked into current business models, others have doubts over whether an ecosystem can be accurately represented by financial models.\nKatie Kedward, economist at University College London's (UCL) Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose, argues that there are conceptual problems in trying to capture the complexities of nature in financial terms. \nShe told BBC News: \"There are significant uncertainties in estimating nature loss in monetary terms and given the uncertainties involved price-based tools can't be used as a replacement to more important steps to restore nature.\"\nThe review is the result of an 18-month independent global assessment on the economics of biodiversity, led by Prof Dasgupta.\nHM Treasury has said it will examine the review's findings and respond formally in due course.\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's youngest pupils are likely to return to the classroom full time from 22 February as schools start a phased reopening.\nThe move will include all pupils in P1-P3 as well as pre-school children.\nThere will also be a part-time return, but on a very limited basis, for senior secondary pupils to allow them to complete work for national qualifications. \nA final decision will be taken on the partial reopening in a fortnight. \nFurther details of the next phase of the gradual return to schools will also be set out at that point, alongside a timescale for the return of in-person learning for colleges and universities.\nScotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, questioned why the first minister had not mentioned any need for P1-P3 pupils to socially distance, and said it wanted to see the scientific evidence to justify the approach. \nThe union added: \"Clearly, any school return remains contingent upon continued progress on community suppression of the virus and that is not a given so we need to see infection levels coming down substantially before the return date can be confirmed.\"\nAll of the country's other lockdown restrictions will remain in place until at least the end of the month, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. \nBut she said she was \"cautiously optimistic\" that some gradual easing of the rules could be possible from early March. \nThe first minister also announced that travellers coming to Scotland from any country may be asked to quarantine in a hotel - which goes further than systems announced in the rest of the UK.\nBusiness groups have called on the Scottish government to provide firms with a route map out of lockdown. \nMs Sturgeon said the government intended to allow \"small increases\" in existing provision for children and young people with significant additional support needs from 22 February.\nAnd she said there would be a \"significant expansion\" of testing in schools and nurseries in the coming weeks, with tests available for both staff and senior secondary pupils.\nThe first minister said older pupils will only be able to return after 22 February to ensure practical work important to achieving qualifications is completed.\nOnly between 5% and 8% of a secondary school's pupil roll will be able to be present at any one time.\nMs Sturgeon also stressed that the schools announcement was dependent on the virus continuing to be suppressed.\nSchools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since the Christmas holidays, with learning being done at home and online. \nHealth experts have warned that the country risks facing a \"lost generation\" unless a way can be found to get young people back to some sort of normality. \nInterim Scottish Labour leader Jackie Baillie said that most children will have missed more than half a year of normal, in-person schooling as she called for greater investment to be put in place \"for some time to come\" to help them catch up.\nAnd the Scottish Conservatives accused the government of failing to get the proper digital support in place for home learning, which it said would further widen the attainment gap between wealthier and less well off pupils.\nThe current stay-at-home lockdown, like the last one, is a long slog. It will last what's left of the winter. But as we move into spring, change is coming.\nPlans to re-open nurseries and schools from 22 February for the youngest children will not only restore their full time education but will allow some parents to resume work.\nHowever, the phased return of schools could add to the burden some families have to carry.\nIf, for instance, you have a young child to get to school and an older pupil to organise for online learning at home, that could be harder to manage than either having both at home or both in school.\nIt is not clear how quickly full time schooling will resume for all age groups.\nIt will be another fortnight before the first minister sets out how wider restrictions might be eased from the beginning of March.\nIt is already clear that process will be gradual and that some measures like social distancing, wearing face coverings and avoiding international travel will not be lifted anytime soon.\nMs Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that she wanted to see children back in full-time, face to face education as quickly as possible.\nAnd she said she was acutely aware of the wider health, developmental and social harms being experienced by young people while they were not in school, and of the pressure school closures was putting on working parents and family life. \nBut she said the current state of the pandemic and the need to protect the country as much as possible from the virus meant that her options for reopening schools were limited.\nShe added: \"The judgment the Cabinet arrived at this morning, based on the advice of our expert advisers, is that if we all agree to abide with the lockdown restrictions for a bit longer - so that our progress in suppressing the virus continues - we can begin a phased, albeit gradual, return to school from 22 February.\"\nAll of mainland Scotland and some islands are currently under the country's toughest level four restrictions, with non-essential shops closed and strict travel rules in force. \nAnd there has been growing concern in recent days that Scotland's vaccination programme is lagging behind the rest of the UK.\nThe country had vaccinated the lowest percentage of its adult population - 13.4% - of all of the four UK nations by Tuesday.\nThe figure for England stood at 18.4% while it was 17% in Wales and 15.6% in Northern Ireland.\nThe UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has written to Ms Sturgeon offering the help of the English health department and the Ministry of Defence to accelerate the rollout in Scotland.\nMr Jack said: \"I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as  closely as possible.\"\nA further 34,881 people were given their first does of the vaccine in Scotland since Monday, the highest daily total so far.\nThe country will need to average about 40,000 a day if it is to hit its target of vaccinating everyone over the age of 70 and the extremely clinically vulnerable by the end of next week.\nIt brings the total number of people to have received the vaccine in Scotland, which has about a twelfth of the UK population, to 610,778.\nThe UK as a whole had vaccinated just over 9.6 million people by Tuesday. \nCovid-19 prevalence in Scotland has fallen under the lockdown regulations from 302 per 100,000 in the week ending 8 January to 136 per 100,000 last week.\nTest positivity has also reduced to an average of 6.6% in the seven days up to 29 January - still higher than the 5% that the World Health Organisation considers to be indicative of an outbreak being under control.\nMs Sturgeon said: \"Pressure on our NHS continues to be severe. The number of Covid patients being treated in hospital remains around 30% above the high point of the first wave last April.\n\"However, hospital admissions in this wave appear to have peaked on January 12. They have now stabilised and are starting to reduce, albeit slowly.\"\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "text": "US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has revealed that she is a survivor of sexual assault.\nHer statement came as she described the trauma of hiding from a violent mob that stormed the Capitol last month.\nShe also claims Republicans are using \"the tactics of abusers\" by telling lawmakers to \"move on\" from the trauma.\nThe New York Democrat, known by her initials AOC, has been a lightning rod for conservatives and has frequently been condemned by Donald Trump.\n\"I'm a survivor of sexual assault,\" she said in an Instagram Live video on Monday night, fighting back tears. \"And I haven't told many people that in my life.\"\nThe 31-year-old self-described democratic socialist disclosed little about her sexual assault ordeal, but said: \"When we go through trauma, trauma compounds on each other.\"\nShe also blasted Republicans like Texas Senator Ted Cruz for denying what she described as their responsibility for the storming of the Capitol complex, which left five people dead.\nAfter Mr Cruz last week agreed with Ms Ocasio-Cortez on a policy matter, she lashed out: \"You almost had me murdered three weeks ago so you can sit this one out.\" \nMr Cruz, and other Republicans who objected to the congressional certification of President Joe Biden's victory - which was taking place as the mob breached the Capitol - have previously denied any role in stoking the violence.\nShe said she was particularly appalled by Texas Congressman Chip Roy, a former aide to Ted Cruz, who has called for the congresswoman to apologise to his former boss.\n\"These are the tactics of abusers,\" Ms Ocasio-Cortez said during the broadcast to about 150,000 viewers. \"Or rather, these are the tactics that abusers use. \n\"And so when I see this happen, how I feel, how I felt was: 'Not again.' I'm not going to let this happen again. I'm not going to let it happen to me again. I'm not going to let it happen to the other people who've been victimised by this situation again.\"\nMs Ocasio-Cortez described the 6 January riot, which sent lawmakers scrambling for cover and barricading their congressional offices, as like a \"zombie movie\". \n\"I thought I was going to die,\" she said.\n\"We cannot move on without accountability,\" she said on Instagram. \"We cannot heal without accountability.  All these people telling us to move on are doing so at their own convenience.\"\nShe added: \"The folks who are saying, 'We should move on,' 'We shouldn't have accountability,' et cetera, are saying: 'Can you just forget about this so we can, you know, do it again?'\"\nShe recounted how she concealed herself behind her office's bathroom door, and glimpsed a white man storming into her office, shouting: \"Where is she? Where is she?\"\nThe congresswoman said it was a Capitol Police officer, but he looked at her with \"anger and hostility\" and did not identify himself as a member of law enforcement.\nMs Ocasio-Cortez said she and her staff did not know whether the officer was there to \"help us, or hurt us\".\nMs Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the so-called Squad of young women lawmakers elected to office in 2018 amid a wave of Democratic victories. \nTheir national profile rose in 2019 after Mr Trump told the four women, who are all ethnic minorities, to \"go back\" to where they were from in a comment largely condemned as racist.\nShe has become a high-profile target of conservative media and Republicans in Congress. \nLast July, she accused a Republican senator of using sexist language against her during a heated exchange in the halls of the Capitol.\nOne of the rioters apologised last week for tweeting \"Assassinate AOC\" as the violence was still unfolding.\n\"While I never intended to harm Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez nor harm any members of the Capitol police force, I recognise that my social media posts were completely inappropriate,\" said Texas man Garret Miller, who is facing four federal charges.\nHer comments come as former-President Trump faces an impeachment trial in the Senate for having allegedly incited an insurrection by giving a speech to the mob approximately an hour before the violence began. \nRepublicans say Democrats are preventing the country from healing by seeking to cast blame on Mr Trump.\nIn her Instagram video, Ms Ocasio-Cortez denounced people who are \"constantly trying to tell you that you didn't experience what you experienced or that you're lying.\"\n\"There's the trauma of going through what you went through,\" she said, \"and then there's the trauma afterwards of people not believing you, or trying to publicly humiliate you, or trying to embarrass you. \n\"And that also gets internalised, too, because a lot of times you don't want to believe it either.\"\nMs Ocasio-Cortez said she was prepared for criticism after sharing her sexual assault ordeal because it was not directly related to the Capitol riot.\n\"People are going to say that, 'Oh, she's just trying to make it about her,'\" she said. But all of your traumas can intersect and interact, she added.\nShe said Congress had made counsellors available for lawmakers, especially those who had encountered rioters, in order to help them process the ordeal.\n\"Those folks who are just trying to tell us to move on are just like pulling the page, they're using the same tactics of every other abuser who just tells you to move on,\" she said."

      "tags": "Captain Tom Moore,Obituaries",
      "text": "At times of crisis, a nation needs hope and heroes. \nSometimes, they're found in unlikely places - and when Britain first locked down against the coronavirus pandemic, it discovered Captain Sir Tom Moore.\nIn April 2020 the then 99-year-old war veteran accepted a little family challenge: to raise \u00a31,000 for health service charities by walking 100 lengths of his garden before his 100th birthday at the end of that month.\n\"One small soul like me won't make much difference,\" he declared in his first TV interview. \nHe could not have been more wrong.\nBy the time he closed his fundraising page at midnight on his 100th birthday, Captain Sir Tom had raised more than \u00a332m from more than one-and-a-half-million global donors.\nBut that was just the beginning - a knighthood, RAF flypast to mark him turning 100 and personal greetings from the Queen and prime minister soon followed.\nAnd he even became the oldest person ever to score a number one single in the UK, when he and Michael Ball sang a cover of You'll Never Walk Alone.\nCaptain Sir Tom was born in Keighley on 30 April 1920. His father, Wilson, came from a family of builders; his mother, Isabella, taught children at a local school. \nIt was a comfortable, middle-class background, but a decade later came the Wall Street Crash. It triggered a world-wide economic depression which hit Yorkshire mill towns hard. \nA quarter of the British population struggled to feed themselves. Young Tom was surrounded by long lines at soup kitchens, and classmates suffering from rickets and tuberculosis. \nBright enough to win a place at grammar school, he found he enjoyed working with his hands more than reading books.\n\"I was always a very practical boy,\" he recalled. \"The sort of toys I liked would be a piece of wood, some nails and a hammer.\"\nBut his real passion was motorbikes. At the age of 12, Captain Sir Tom discovered one lying in a barn and bought it for half a crown. He proudly took it home, and lovingly did it up.\nHe left school to start an apprenticeship in civil engineering, but there was barely time to finish it before World War Two broke out. \nConscripted into the British army in June 1940, Captain Sir Tom joined the Duke of Wellington's regiment - an infantry battalion with historic links to the West Riding.\nBy his own admission, he was \"too young to feel frightened\". Indeed, for a practically-minded motorsport enthusiast barely out of his teens, the British army was a thrilling place.\nCaptain Sir Tom spent time in Cornwall, preparing to defend the coast from a German invasion, and learned how to drive tanks. \nSelected for officer training, he became a second lieutenant on his 21st birthday, and - now part of the 146th Royal Armoured Corps - found himself posted to India.\nWith the Suez Canal closed, the sea journey took six perilous weeks. The convoy inched around the southern tip of Africa, at constant risk from German submarines. \nThe train ride across India took nearly as long, the burning heat made only slightly less unbearable by huge blocks of ice scattered among the troops.\nTheir final destination was Burma, where the British army and its Indian allies had been forced into a fighting retreat by a seemingly unstoppable Japanese advance. \nCaptain Sir Tom was joining the bruised and bloodied \"forgotten army\", which was suffering from disease and low morale. It was fighting in the world's least hospitable terrain, with impenetrable jungle, poisonous snakes, and hot lashing rain for six months of every year. \nMuch of the fighting was done hand-to-hand, with no quarter given on either side. Years later, Captain Sir Tom clearly recalled staring into the \"whites of the eyes\" of the opposing troops.\nWith his knowledge of motorbikes, Captain Sir Tom was asked to train dispatch riders. Radio transmissions could be intercepted, so this was the best means of getting information to and from the front line.\nIt was dangerous work. Dispatch riders worked alone and at night. The roads that did exist were deeply rutted and thick with mud, and the risk of ambush was ever-present.\nCaptain Sir Tom loved the motorbikes, but described the job as a \"poisoned chalice\". Once the engine started, there was no stopping or going back. \n\"If it didn't go well,\" he said bluntly, \"I was dead\".\nSlowly, the 14th army turned the tide in Britain's favour. Over the next two years, Captain Sir Tom's team helped cut Japanese supply lines along the Burmese coast.\nOne notable occasion was the battle for Ramree Island in 1945. More than 1,000 Japanese infantrymen were forced into a mangrove swamp infested by salt-water crocodiles. Only a handful emerged.\nBy this time, Captain Sir Tom had survived a nasty bout of dengue fever and been promoted to Captain. With the Japanese finally on the back foot, he returned to England to train recruits in the art of driving tanks.\nOn VE Day, there were \"certain activities in the bar\", but Captain Sir Tom's thoughts were with his mates still fighting in the Far East. \"They didn't get a day off,\" he said.\nHe became an instructor at the Armoured Fighting Vehicle School in Dorset. He loved the work, but was desperately unhappy at home\nIn 1949, he married his first wife Billie and took a job as a sales manager for a roofing company in his native Yorkshire. The troubled marriage lasted 18 years and did not produce children.\nNow in his late 40s, Captain Sir Tom resigned himself to never finding love. Until, a few years later, he met Pamela.\nShe was 15 years younger and an office manager at the firm's headquarters in Gravesend. Romance blossomed, and Captain Sir Tom began to think of excuses to travel down to Kent.\n\"She looked terrific to me, like a model,\" he later told the Daily Mail. \"The attraction became stronger and I eventually married her.\"\nCaptain Sir Tom raced his beloved Scott motorbikes around Yorkshire, winning various cups and medals. He and Pamela had two children - Lucy and Hannah.\nIn 1992, Captain Sir Tom retired at the age of 72. He was looking forward to retirement but life proved less than kind.\nPamela fell ill with dementia. Captain Sir Tom cared for his wife for two years, and then visited her care home every day until her death in 2006.\nNot wanting to be alone, Captain Sir Tom moved into his daughter Hannah's home in the Bedfordshire village of Marston Moretaine. \nThere, his routine seldom wavered: waking early each morning to let the dogs out, followed by a daily jog on a running machine. He allowed himself a few luxuries, including a daily glass of wine in front of the television. Judge Judy was a favourite programme.\nCaptain Sir Tom was treated for skin cancer and a broken hip, and received \"marvellous service\" from the NHS. When the world locked down for the coronavirus pandemic, he saw a chance to give something back.\nBut a piece in Bedford Today about his sponsored walk mushroomed into a global media event. For millions trapped at home, Captain Sir Tom was a much-needed symbol of defiance, national unity and hope. \n\"Please remember,\" he said repeatedly, \"tomorrow will be a good day.\" The money flooded in. \nAs Captain Sir Tom turned to complete his final lap, the total stood at more than \u00a312m. It would eventually surpass \u00a330m. An honour guard from his old regiment saluted an extraordinary achievement.\nHis cover of You'll Never Walk Alone, a duet with Michael Ball, raised even more - hitting the top of the charts in time for Captain Sir Tom's hundredth birthday and making him the oldest person ever to score a number one single in the UK.\nOn the day itself, a Spitfire wheeled in tribute over Marston Moretaine; a local school volunteered to display 160,000 birthday cards sent to a national treasure.\nCaptain Sir Tom - promoted to Colonel - did not set out to inspire millions. Like the young lieutenant in 1941, he was just trying to do his bit. The Queen knighted him at a special ceremony at Windsor Castle on 17 July 2020.\nWith stubbornness, courage and optimism, he was the right man at the right time.\nHe was Britain as it needed to see itself: selfless, patriotic and undefeated - and never taking a backward step.

      "text": "More than 400 figures from the UK fashion industry have signed an open letter to the prime minister warning that post-Brexit red tape and travel restrictions threaten their survival.\nSignatories, including Twiggy and Katharine Hamnett, say some firms are already relocating to the EU.\nThey say the sector is worth \u00a335bn to the UK and employs one million people. \n\"Yet we have been disregarded in this deal and our concerns overlooked,\" the letter to Boris Johnson says.\nThe letter, to be presented on Tuesday morning, calls for a meeting with ministers because \"without urgent attention these issues will jeopardise the immediate and long term future of the sector\". \nThey said the trade agreement, finalised on Christmas Eve just a week before the UK left the bloc's single market and customs union, had failed to deliver on promises of frictionless future trade.\nThe sector's concerns echo those of other sectors, from music to fisheries, who argue the new bureaucratic regime is endangering the future of their industries.\nBut the letter says the fashion industry contributes \"more to UK GDP than fishing, music, film and motor industries combined\".\nIt highlights the compensation package offered to the fishing industry, saying: \"Fishing contributes as much to the UK economy as East London does from the fashion and textile industry, employing the same workforce as just one of the many high street retailers currently facing liquidation\".\nModel Yasmin Le Bon said the nature of the industry meant people had to be able to travel freely within the EU, often at short notice.\n\"I have been working continually in this industry for the past 37 years. It works in a very particular way, with jobs being confirmed literally at the last minute. I may get a call, make a decision and be at the airport within two hours.\n\"For once we need to be listened to and for the Government to work with us before it is too late,\" she said.\nDesigner Katharine Hamnett said many firms could be weeks away from going under. \"We need a radical overhaul of customs arrangements including VAT on all goods shipped into the EU by the end of February, or British brands will die,\" she said.\nIsabel Ettedgui, the chief executive of Connolly, the fashion brand that sells Scottish cashmere and manufactures leather goods in Spain, said the trade rules were turning the industry into a Brexit trading post.\n\"The result could be the possible closure of a 185-year-old company that holds the Royal Warrant,\" she said.\nLast week Samantha Cameron, wife of former prime minister David - who called the 2016 Brexit referendum - said her fashion business was finding post-Brexit trading with the EU \"challenging and difficult\".\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are working closely with businesses in the fashion industry to ensure they get the support they need to trade effectively with Europe, and seize new opportunities as we strike trade deals with the world's fastest growing markets.\"\n\"We are aware that some businesses are facing challenges with specific aspects of our new trading relationship with the EU. To this end, we are operating export helplines, running webinars with policy experts and offering businesses support via our network of 300 international trade advisers. This is on top of the millions we have invested to expand the customs intermediaries sector.\""

      "tags": "Scottish government,Coronavirus vaccines,Jason Leitch,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Almost 35,000 people received their first dose of the Covid vaccine on Monday, the highest daily figure since the programme began.\nIt marked the first day in which mass vaccination centres were open in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow.\nThe jump in figures came after concerns that just 9,628 people had the jab in Scotland on Sunday.\nProf Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, told BBC Scotland \"we do need to be doing it faster\". \nHe said Sundays had been \"a bit tricky\" for the vaccine programme because many GP surgeries were closed.\nThe figure was the lowest since the Scottish government started publishing daily vaccine statistics.\nScottish Secretary Alister Jack later wrote to the first minister on behalf of the UK government to offer \"any support or assistance we can give you to accelerate your rollout programme\".\nMr Jack said this included further requests for military assistance and mutual aid between health services.\nHis letter concluded: \"I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as closely as possible.\"\nScotland, which has about a twelfth of the UK population, has now vaccinated just over 610,000 people while the UK tally stands at about 9.6 million. \nScotland has vaccinated the lowest percentage of its population aged 16 and over - 13.45% - of all of the four UK nations.\nThe equivalent figure for England was 18.39%, Wales was 16.98% and Northern Ireland was 15.59%.\nIn order to be equal to its population share, Scotland should have vaccinated another 200,000 people.\nIn her Covid statement at Holyrood, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland had initially concentrated on making sure there was a depth of uptake in the clinically most vulnerable groups such as elderly care home residents.\nShe said the challenge now was to increase the breadth of the overall numbers.\nIn response, Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives at Holyrood, said the Scottish government's vaccination programme was \"slow, stuttering and lagging way behind the rest of the UK\".\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Scotland needed to be \"ambitious\" with its vaccination programme and said there was no need to ditch the rest of the rollout while care homes and other vulnerable groups were prioritised.\nMs Sturgeon said \"legitimate questions\" were being asked about the slow rollout but she stood by the approach that was taken. \nThe Scottish government insists that it remains on track to meet its target of having vaccinated everyone over the age of 70 and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable by 15 February.\nBut many people aged over 70 have not yet received an appointment letter, with 21% of those aged between 75 and 79 having been vaccinated by Tuesday.\nScotland now needs to be vaccinating about 40,000 people per day to meet the target - with Tuesday's total of 34,881 being the highest it has managed in a single day so far. \nOpposition parties have accused First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of being \"in denial\" about the pace of the vaccine rollout in Scotland.\nProf Leitch said the plan had been for most over-80s to be vaccinated in their local GP surgery so they would not have to travel greater distances and where they would know the staff.\nHe acknowledged that many GP surgeries did not open on Sundays, and that \"some people think this was not the right thing to do\".\nHe said the vaccination teams had been \"asked to have another look at that\".\nProf Leitch told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"We agree we do need to be doing it faster.\n\"That is why now, as we have gone down a level to people who are a little bit more mobile - the 70 years olds, the over-75s - they are now being done in big vaccination centres or semi-big vaccination centres.\"\nHe also predicted that the opening of the new mass vaccination centres in Edinburgh and Aberdeen earlier this week, alongside the existing facility in Glasgow, meant that \"many, many more\" people would be vaccinated this weekend.\nThe latest figures show 83% of people over the age of 80 have now had their first jab, although the first minister said the figure was likely to be closer to 90% as there were fewer people in the age group than they had thought and the figures are being \"refined\".\nThe daily figures show 98% of older care home residents and 88% of care home staff have been given their first dose. \nProf Leitch said: \"We'll finish the over-80s this week, apart from a few stragglers who are maybe a bit doubtful or don't want done or were Covid positive. \n\"So not 100% but we'll get to just as many as we can by this Friday, and we've started the 70 to 79 year olds and we're beginning to send letters out to those who are over 65 and those who are vulnerable.\"\nHe admitted that it was \"hard\" for people in Scotland to hear that vaccination numbers were higher in England, but insisted that it was \"not a race\" - and pointed out that the death rate and prevalence of the virus in Scotland was still lower than in England. \nProf Leitch added: \"It is a race against the virus, not a race against my colleagues and I want England to be vaccinated as fast as they can possibly do it and I also want Wales and Northern Ireland to be vaccinated. \n\"So I don't really like the competitive nature of the vaccination story.\""

      "title": "Into the wild: Could lynx be reintroduced to Scotland?",
      "tags": "Animals",
      "text": "Hundreds of years after the last lynx died out in Britain, people in Scotland are being asked about whether the cats should be reintroduced.\nEurasian lynx are the third largest predator in continental Europe after the brown bear and wolf. Their main prey are roe deer - a small deer that favours woodland.\nLynx were once native to Britain but were driven to extinction 500 to 1,000 years ago due to hunting and habitat loss. \nThree charities - Scotland: The Big Picture, Trees for Life and Vincent Wildlife Trust - have come together to look into the potential of releasing lynx into the wild in Scotland.\nLast month the charities began a year-long \"extensive and impartial\" study to explore public attitudes to the idea, and to investigate the barriers to returning the animals to parts of the Cairngorms and Argyll.\nThe study, Lynx to Scotland, will include consultation with rural communities and is separate from other lynx reintroduction projects.\nThere are strong critics of the idea, with the National Farmers Union Scotland (NFUS) saying a return of the predator would be \"wholly unacceptable\" to its members.\nThe three charities believe there are sound ecological reasons for bringing back lynx, an animal they describe as a \"shy and solitary\" woodland hunter, rarely glimpsed and not known to attack humans.\nThey said previous research suggested the Scottish Highlands had sufficient habitat - and more than enough roe deer - to support about 400 wild lynx.\nSteve Micklewright, chief executive of Findhorn-based Trees for Life, said Scotland had more roe deer than any other European country. He said lynx could help control deer numbers in areas where their feeding harmed natural woodland regeneration.\nHe said: \"By preying on roe deer, lynx would restore ecological processes that have been missing for centuries, and provide a free and efficient deer management service.\"\nHerefordshire-based Vincent Wildlife Trust is leading the study.\nJenny MacPherson, science and research programme manager at the trust, said: \"Reintroducing lynx would inevitably bring challenges.\"\nShe said the study would seek a range of perspectives to obtain \"meaningful conclusions\" about the level of support or tolerance for lynx, and the likely success of any future reintroduction.\nPeter Cairns, of Scotland: The Big Picture, said predators like lynx played a key part in healthy natural environments.\nHe said: \"With a global biodiversity crisis, we have a responsibility to have open and constructive conversations around restoring key native species to the Scottish landscape - and science shows that apex predators like lynx play a vital ecological role in maintaining healthy living systems.\"\nLynx have been reintroduced to other parts of Europe, including Germany's Harz National Park in 2000.\nOle Anders, who works on a project managing the park's small lynx population, said there had been discussions and debates about releasing the cats in the Harz mountains since the 1970s.\nHe told BBC Scotland's The Nine initial fears about their reintroduction had included lynx attacks on people and livestock.\nMr Anders said no-one had been put risk by the animals, and farmers were compensated for the few livestock losses seen.\nHe said: \"Forestry is the most important business (in the park) and there is not much farming, which is something of an advantage to introducing a large carnivore like the Eurasian lynx.\"\nMr Anders said some tourism businesses in the park had embraced the lynx and used images on their promotional material.\nBut NFUS is strongly opposed to the reintroduction.\nIt said an NFUS study trip to Norway in 2017 heard that Norwegian authorities paid out compensation on 20,000 sheep lost to predators, with lynx accounting for 21% of the losses.\nNFUS vice president, Martin Kennedy, said predation of livestock in Norway had been declining, but only because of the numbers of farmers who had given up stocking sheep.\nMr Kennedy, a hill farmer from Highland Perthshire, added: \"The Norwegians told us that to reintroduce predators into our country would be an absolute catastrophe.  \n\"Their experience has simply strengthened our resolve.\"  \nAngus MacFadyen, NFUS environment and land use committee chairman, said: \"NFU Scotland remains crystal clear that any proposals to re-introduce predators such as lynx are wholly unacceptable to Scottish farmers and crofters. \n\"The past three to four years have seen a long line of brazen and presumptuous claims from organisations about the imminent reintroduction of lynx to the UK.\"\nThe Scottish government has no plans to reintroduce lynx.\nThe Lynx to Scotland study will run until February next year."

      "tags": "Gateshead,Statues and sculptures,History,Slavery,British Empire,BAME communities,Race and ethnicity",
      "text": "TV historian David Olusoga claims it is \"palpable nonsense\" to say that removing controversial statues \"somehow impoverishes history\".\nProf Olusoga says statues, such as those of slave traders, are not useful ways of teaching history or explaining the values of previous eras.\nInstead the historian argues they are a continuing public \"validation\" of people who did \"terrible things\".\nProf Olusoga is to be an online school teacher himself this week.\nPupils in the lockdown will be able to watch Prof Olusoga explaining the importance of the census to historians - ahead of the national census in March - and looking at how it can reveal changes of populations and hidden stories.\nThe University of Manchester professor recently revealed one of his own hidden histories - that he had been at primary school in Gateshead with Paul Gascoigne and the former footballer had rescued Prof Olusoga and his sister from racist bullying.\nThe TV presenter, who had been born in Nigeria but moved to a council estate in north- east England, says the prejudice he faced in school was part of the \"Darwinian world of the 1970s playground\".\nBut the historian still sees its continuation in the abuse aimed at black footballers such as Marcus Rashford.\n\"Racism in football just found a new outlet in the world of social media. If you look under that rock, it's there all the time.\n\"Marcus, because he so high profile and because we love to attack people who are doing good in this country, for reasons I've never quite understood, is the focus at the moment. But it's constant, it's always there,\" says the historian and author.\nHis lesson about the census, made with the Office for National Statistics, is about the \"lascars\", sailors recruited from Asia to work on British ships, who often faced tough conditions for lower pay than their white counterparts.\nThey were at the centre of a trading empire that was \"incredibly complicated, diverse and also unfair\".\nHe says studying the British empire, in its strengths and weaknesses, is \"absolutely critical\" to understanding present-day Britain - in terms of the \"economy, culture, cuisine, as well the people who are living here\".\nBut when it comes to issues such as examining links with the slave trade, he says there is a reluctance and a push towards \"distraction and deflection\" and \"various ways of saying 'We don't want to talk about that'.\"\nHe argues that debates about statues - such as the statue to slave trader Edward Colston that was pushed into the harbour in Bristol - should face up to the historical evidence of who is being commemorated.\nCommunities Secretary Robert Jenrick recently promised more safeguards to monuments, saying they are \"almost always best explained and contextualised, not taken and hidden away\".\n\"What has stood for generations should be considered thoughtfully, not removed on a whim or at the behest of a baying mob,\" said Mr Jenrick.\nProf Olusoga says there has been particular hostility to suggestions there were enslaved black people in 18th Century Britain, as well as in the colonies.\nThis seems to make people deeply \"uncomfortable\", says the presenter of the A House Through Time TV series.\n\"I think that's because we've created a moral firewall between what happened in Britain and what happened in the empire - with the idea that what happened in the empire doesn't really count.\"\nProf Olusoga also has concerns for future historians - and digital gaps in the historical record.\nHe says the way politicians and decision-makers use messaging services like WhatsApp to share their private thoughts could leave future historians with much less understanding about how policies are being made.\nHistorians should be \"enormously worried\" about \"politicians finding ways of not leaving records of their decisions in their debates\", says Prof Olusoga. \n\"That's fundamental to the workings of democracy.\"\nHe says written memos, notes, letters and emails have been ways into the thinking of politicians behind the scenes, that will not be available for an era of private, unrecorded messages.\n\"One of the most interesting things, if you study Churchill, is his notes in the margin,\" he says.\n\"I think politicians need to leave a record of their deliberations and their debates that lead them to the decisions they made - so they can be held accountable by historians.\"\nProf Olusoga's video lesson, Equality, representation and the census, part of the Census 2021 Let's Count primary school programme, will be on the Census 2021 YouTube channel, 11:00, 4 February."

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine could lead to a \"substantial\" fall in the spread of the virus, say scientists. \nThe impact of Covid vaccines on transmission has been a crucial unknown that will dramatically shape the future of the pandemic.\nThe study, which has not been formally published, also showed the vaccine remained effective while people waited for a second dose. \nIt was 76% effective during the three months after the first shot.\nThe impact on transmission is critical. \nIf a vaccine only stops you getting severely ill, but you can still catch and pass on the virus, then everyone will need to be immunised to be protected.\nBut if it also stops you spreading the virus then it would have a far greater impact on the pandemic as each person who is vaccinated indirectly protects other people too. \nThe study by the University of Oxford swabbed participants every week to test them for the presence of the virus. \nIf there is no virus then they cannot spread it. In the study, the numbers testing positive halved in people once they had been given two doses of the vaccine. \n\"The data indicate that [the vaccine] may have a substantial impact on transmission by reducing the number of infected individuals in the population,\" the report said. \nThe UK, amid global debate and in sharp contrast to other countries, is prioritising giving the first dose to as many people as possible. \nThe idea is to save more lives by giving more people some protection, but it means people will have to wait around three months for the booster instead of three weeks. \nThis study - on 17,000 people in the UK, South Africa and Brazil - showed protection remained at 76% during the three months after the first dose.\nThis rose to 82% after people were given the second dose. \nProf Andrew Pollard, from the Oxford Vaccine Trial, said: \"These new data provide an important verification of the interim data that was used by more than 25 regulators including the MHRA and EMA to grant the vaccine emergency use authorisation.\n\"It also supports the policy recommendation made by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation for a 12-week prime-boost interval, as they look for the optimal approach to rollout.\"\nThe report does not tackle the impact of the new variants on how well the vaccines work. \nProf Stephen Evans, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: \"The data definitely provide some evidence to suggest that the eventual protection from two doses of this vaccine are not worsened by having a longer than 28 or 42 day period between doses, and tend to confirm what had been shown before, that if anything the eventual efficacy was better.\" \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the study was \"hugely encouraging\", adding that it \"further reinforces our confidence that vaccines are capable of reducing transmission and protecting people from this awful disease\".\nHe said: \"This report shows the Oxford vaccine works and works well.\n\"More than 9.6 million people have already received the first dose of their Covid-19 vaccine and the NHS is working tirelessly to vaccinate as many people as possible in every part of the UK.\""

But most UK waters are not in that category.\nThe UK government previously said it thought the restrictions on exports of bivalve molluscs - such as mussels, clams, cockles, scallops and oysters - would end on 21 April.\nThis was because Brussels was \"expected\" to change its rules on that date to allow unpurified shellfish in from non-member states.\nBut it has emerged - as first reported by Politics Home - that the European Commission wrote to leading UK companies on 13 and 19 January to tell them the current arrangement would be in place indefinitely.\nThis has increased fears for the future of businesses and staff, amid concerns that purified shellfish go off quicker than unpurified ones, making them harder to transport.\n\"The issue with shellfish is that they are highly perishable, so there are many risks associated with delays,\" Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, told the BBC. \n\"We are really in a high-risk category compared with other kinds of exports.\"\nHe added that \"nothing\" had changed, in terms of the EU's rules, but firms who had thought they were going to were feeling \"very frustrated\".\nA Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: \"We will continue to raise the issue of live bivalve molluscs not ready for human consumption with the EU, to ensure the trade can continue securely.\"\nMinisters would work to reach an \"appropriate solution\", they added."

      "tags": "Television,Emmy Awards,Tony Awards,Acting,Film",
      "text": "Hal Holbrook, the Oscar-nominated actor known for playing Deep Throat in All the President's Men, has died at 95.\nHolbrook, who also appeared in Wall Street, Into The Wild and Lincoln, died on 23 January, his assistant told the New York Times.  \nAs Deep Throat, Holbrook leaks vital evidence to the journalists investigating the Watergate scandal.\nHolbrook also had a distinguished theatre career, mostly notably in his one-man show portraying Mark Twain. \nHe had numerous TV credits to his name, including two appearances in US political drama The West Wing as Republican Albie Duncan.\nBradley Whitford, who played Josh Lyman in the series, tweeted: \"My God, what an incredible actor. Rest In Peace, Hal Holbrook.\"\nDirector Edgar Wright said: \"What work Hal Holbrook leaves behind. Loved his performances in The Fog, All The President's Men, Magnum Force, Creepshow, Capricorn One, The Star Chamber, Wild In The Streets & Into The Wild, among many many others.\"\nHolbrook's stage and TV recreation of the revered American novelist, humorist and social critic in Mark Twain Tonight arguably brought him his greatest fame. \nIt earned him a Tony award for his Broadway performance in 1966 and the first of his 10 Emmy nominations in 1967.  In the course of his long career Holbrook won five of the Emmys for which he had been nominated. \nHolbrook first crafted and then performed Twain while he was a 19-year-old college student. His first big appearance in the part was on the famed Ed Sullivan TV Show. \nLater, he performed the show on television and in theatres internationally, and also for former President Eisenhower and in an international tour sponsored by the US State Department.\nHe continued with his Twain act until his early 90s, playing on Broadway and notching up more than 2,200 performances in venues across the country. \n\"Mark Twain gets me out of the bed in the morning,\" Holbrook said in 2014. \n\"He literally fires me up. I don't have to fire myself up, all I have to do is lay there and think about what's going on in my country and the world and run over some of the Twain I am going to do.\"\nHolbrook was born in Cleveland on 17 February 1925, and his mother was a vaudeville dancer. \nHe first starting acting at the age 17 when he performed in the popular farce The Man Who Came to Dinner at Cleveland's Cain Park Theatre. \nAfter serving in the Army in Newfoundland during World War Two, Holbrook attended Denison University in Granville, Ohio.\nHe later ventured to New York and studied with the actress Uta Hagen and in the 1950s, Holbrook acted on the CBS soap opera The Brighter Day. \nHe won his first Emmy in 1971 for his work on the NBC drama series The Bold Ones: The Senator and took two more trophies for playing Commander Lloyd Bucher in the 1973 TV film Pueblo, about the capture of a US spy ship by North Korea in 1968.\nHolbrook's craggy voice and appearance lent itself to historical portrayals and other parts that required gravitas, such as his portrayal of US President Abraham Lincoln in the TV mini-series Lincoln, for which he also won an Emmy.\nHe reprised the role in the ABC miniseries North and South in 1985 and its sequel the following year.\nAmong many other shows, he also appeared in the West Wing, The Sopranos, Bones, Grey's Anatomy and Hawaii Five-0.\nOn the big screen, as well as making an impression as Deep Throat and in Into the Wild, he played a power-hungry police lieutenant in the Dirty Harry movie Magnum Force.\nIn Steven Spielberg's 2012 Lincoln biopic, Holbrook played presidential adviser Preston Blair. He also featured in the films The Firm, Capricorn One, The Fog, and Water for Elephants. \nIn 2008, aged 82, Holbrook became the oldest actor to have been nominated for an Academy Award for his supporting role in Into the Wild, starring Emile Hirsch. \nHowever, he has since been overtaken by Christopher Plummer, who won in the same category in 2018 aged 88.\nIn recent years he became a regular presence on US television, with roles in series including Sons of Anarchy, Rectify and the sitcom Designing Women.\nHolbrook's memoir Harold: The Boy Who Became Mark Twain was published in September 2011.\nHe was married three times. He and third wife Dixie Carter - who also appeared in Designing Women - were married in 1984 and remained together until her death in 2010.\nHe is survived by his three children and two stepdaughters, as well as two grandchildren and two step-grandchildren.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "New restrictions designed to make online casino games less intensive and safer have been announced by the Gambling Commission.\nThey include the introduction of limits on spin speeds, as well as a permanent ban on features that speed up play or celebrate losses as wins.\nOperators must clearly display to the player their total losses or wins.\nThe Gambling Commission said online operators would need to implement the new rules by 31 October.\nThe moves come in response to concern over what are known as online slot games - that is, games designed to mimic slot machines in real-life betting shops and casinos.\nThese account for an estimated 70% of online casino games.\nAccording to the Gambling Commission, these slot games have by far the highest average losses per player of online gambling products.\nOnline slots and similar casino-style games have come to dominate Britons' spending on gambling. The British public spent \u00a32.2bn on online slot games in 2019, according to the Gambling Commission, and some estimates say the UK now accounts for 15% of these types of games. \nThe Commission has already cracked down on one of the bookmakers' cash cows, the fixed-odds betting terminal. on which customers can play casino games in shops. Now they have gone after the online equivalent. The new measures are aimed at reining in the power and addictive nature of the games and giving the customer more of a chance to rein in spending. \nGambling regulation in the UK appears headed for a shake-up. The commission has been criticised by some MPs for being toothless and ill-equipped to cope with the shift online. At the end of last month, the government quietly announced a consultation on how the regulator should be funded, with an acknowledgment that it was a small organisation, given the size of the industry it had to police. \nA big test may come later this year, with indications that there may be a ban on gambling companies sponsoring the shirts of football and darts players. That would be unpopular not just with the companies, but also the sports authorities and clubs, who have become reliant on the sponsorship income.\nAnother change being introduced is a ban on reverse withdrawals - a function which allows consumers to re-gamble money they had previously requested to withdraw.\n\"Evidence shows that reverse withdrawal functions present a risk to players because of the temptation to continue gambling,\" said the Commission.\n\"In addition, the slot features being removed or more closely controlled have been associated with increased intensity of play, loss of player control or binge play.\"\nSports, Tourism and Heritage Minister Nigel Huddleston welcomed the measures, saying they would \"help curb the intensity of online gambling, introducing greater protections that will reduce the risk of gambling-related harm\".\nIn the past year or so, the Gambling Commission has introduced a series of curbs on gambling, including raising the age limit for playing the National Lottery and banning the use of credit cards."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Public Health England is investigating cases of coronavirus with 'worrying' new genetic changes that have been found in some regions of the UK. \nTests show they have a mutation, called E484K, that is already seen in the South Africa variant. \nAlthough this change may reduce vaccine effectiveness, the current ones in use should still work, say experts.\nThere have been 11 cases in Bristol and a cluster of 32 cases in Liverpool. \nUrgent testing for the South Africa variant is already starting in parts of England and could be rolled out to other areas seeing different variants with the same E484K mutation. \nScientists working with Public Health England found a small number of cases of the UK 'Kent' variant with the E484K mutation - it was seen in 11 out of 214,159 samples that they tested, and predominantly from the South West of England.\nIt is likely there may be more cases that haven't yet been found. The Liverpool area has seen 32 cases of original coronavirus that have the E484K mutation too.\nIt's not unexpected that variants are appearing or that they will continue to change - all viruses mutate as they make new copies of themselves to spread and thrive.\nDr Julian Tang, a virus expert at the University of Leicester, described the finding as \"a worrying development, though not entirely unexpected\".\nHe said it was important people follow the lockdown rules and get cases of coronavirus down to prevent opportunities for the virus to mutate further. \n\"Otherwise not only can the virus continue to spread, it can also evolve.\"\nHe said that allowing spread could allow a \"melting pot\" for different emerging variants. \nScientists have already been checking what these new mutations might mean for existing coronavirus vaccines that were designed around earlier versions of the virus that started the pandemic. \nSome research appears to show E484K may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies.\nBut early results from Moderna suggest its vaccine is still effective against variants with this mutation - although the body's immune response may not be as strong or prolonged.\nTwo new coronavirus vaccines that could be approved soon - one from Novavax and another from Janssen - also appear to offer good cover against variants, protecting against serious illness. \nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts.\nA silver lining may be that the variants are mutating in a similar way rather than diverging from each other. \nProf Ravi Gupta from the University of Cambridge said: \"This gives us a sign that it has certain favoured routes - and we can work to block those off with a vaccine.\"\nFormer UK health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the race was on to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible in order to keep a step ahead of the virus.\nMeasures such as washing your hands, keeping your distance from other people and wearing a face covering will still help prevent infections."

      "tags": "Illegal and unregulated fishing,Fishing,Sustainable fishing,Fishing industry",
      "text": "Two of the UK\u2019s most sensitive fishing sites are set to receive better protection.\nThe Marine Management Organisation says it plans to safeguard fishing areas in Dogger Bank and South Dorset by completely banning bottom trawling.\nThe sites are already designated as protected areas, but in reality they are not patrolled - and they\u2019re both over-fished.\nGreenpeace recently dropped concrete blocks on to Dogger Bank.\nThe intention was to deter bottom trawling. Another group, Blue Marine, took legal action to try to safeguard the sea bed.\nBottom trawling is a destructive type of fishing which involves dragging weighted nets across the sea floor. \nThe MMO is consulting on proposed by-laws prohibiting bottom-towed gear on the sites. The consultation runs to 28 March 2021.\nThe Environment Secretary George Eustice said: \u201cNow that we have left the Common Fisheries Policy, we are able to deliver on our commitment to achieve a healthy, thriving and sustainable marine environment.\u201d\nThe decision couldn\u2019t have been made if the UK was still in the EU, and it was condemned by the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations (NFFO). \nA spokesperson for the NFFO said: \u201cThe decision has been taken with zero discussion with those affected. There will be knock on environmental as well as social and economic impacts.\u201d\nDogger Bank is the largest sandbank in UK waters, and underpins the North Sea\u2019s ecosystem.\nIt provides a vital habitat for a wide range of species which live on and within the seabed, including flatfish, starfish, sandeels, crabs, clams, worms, scallops and more. \nThese species in turn provide a vital food source for predators such as porpoises, dolphins and seabirds. \nBottom trawlers typically seek scallops, sandeels, sole, plaice, cod, and crab. \nThe UK government has also proposed to partially stop bottom trawling at two other theoretically protected sites \u2013 one off the coast of Land\u2019s End and the other off Lincolnshire. \nCharles Clover from Blue Marine said: \u201cWe applaud this first step towards protecting our offshore marine protected areas, starting with the Dogger Bank, a huge and ecologically important area which has been hammered by trawls and dredges for too long. \n\u201cThe government in England has conceded that damaging fishing has been going on illegally in protected areas.\u201d \nMr Clover believes today\u2019s announcement sets a precedent for all the UK's 73 offshore Marine Protected Areas for the devolved administrations and for the EU, which have the same law. \nThe NFFO described the proposals as having delivered \u201ca sledgehammer to fishing\u201d. It continued: \u201cThis punishing reversal comes on the back of the government\u2019s failure to deliver on fishing in the Brexit negotiations, and damaging delays in the export of fish and shellfish.\nBut academics say fisheries have been taking too much. Prof Callum Roberts of Exeter University said: \u201cWhat is left on the Dogger Bank today is a ghost of what was once there. \n\u201cNew protection could lead to the beginnings of a recovery of a megafauna that used to thrive on the bank in astonishing densities: halibut, flapper skate, blue skate, longnose skate, angel sharks, turbot, brill, wolffish, conger eels, cod. \n\u201cMany of these species have declined so far that they are on the endangered species list. But, so far, marine conservation efforts in the UK have completely neglected doing anything to bring about their recovery.\n\u201cIn the 1830s, small sailing vessels con the Dogger could catch a tonne of halibut per day. Today, the entire fishing fleet catches less than two tonnes a year.\u201d\nChris Thorne, from Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cAll of our sensitive marine areas must be properly protected, not just four. Ministers have finally woken up to their responsibilities, yet there are still hundreds of other equally important marine areas still open to all forms of destructive industrial fishing. \n\"Action in these four sites is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the scale needed to solve the crisis facing our oceans.\n\u201cThis process shows that the government is prepared to use its new Brexit powers to properly protect our seas.\u201d\nFollow Roger on Twitter."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Fully jabbed travellers arriving in the UK from France have to quarantine, because of the Beta variant. \nThe government is concerned jabs may not work as well against the variant. \nFrench authorities say most cases are from the overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte, rather than mainland France.\nBeta, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, has some significant genetic changes that experts are studying. It was first identified in South Africa.\nAll viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into new versions or variants.\nThese tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive. \nMost are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some variants can make the virus more infectious or threatening to the host - humans. \nSome of the changes Beta has undergone involve the virus's spike protein - the part that gains the virus entry into human cells. It is also the bit that vaccines are designed around, which is why experts are concerned about these particular mutations.\nBeta, along with a few other variants of coronavirus, such as Delta and Alpha, have been labelled \"variants of concern\". These have some worrying changes experts want to keep a very close eye on.\nBeta carries a mutation, called N501Y, which appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. \nAnother mutation, called E484K, could help the virus dodge a person's immune system, and may affect how well vaccines work. \nThere is no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people.\nAs with the original version, the risk is still highest for elderly people and those with significant underlying health conditions.\nVaccines are designed around original Covid, rather than new variants. \nThere is some evidence they are less effective at stopping Beta infections.\nBut experts say they should still work to stop severe illness. \nEven in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to provide a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary.\nA trial of a new version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, designed against Beta, has begun in the UK.\nSome of the other Covid vaccines are also being updated. \nThe Beta variant has been identified in more than 50 countries around the world. \nSo far, the UK has recorded just over 1,000 cases of Beta. That's a tiny fraction of all Covid cases. Another variant, called Delta, currently makes up more than 99% of Covid seen in the UK. \nSouth Africa has reported higher cases of Beta.\nWhen it was first identified in the UK, the government recommended surge testing in the community in some regions to help stop the spread. \nA system of foreign travel restrictions has also been introduced to minimise the chance of UK travellers spreading Beta as well as other variants of concern. \nAlthough adults who were fully jabbed in the UK now no longer need to quarantine on return from amber list countries, double vaccinated travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to self-isolate for ten days. \nThey will also have to take two PCR tests to ensure they are not infectious. \nUK scientists are tracking variants, including Beta, to learn more and are providing genomic sequencing help to other countries so that they can do the same.

It also called upon the military to accept the results of the November election, which saw the NLD win more than 80% of the votes. \nHowever, the military has appointed a new election commission and chief of police. The previous commission found no evidence of election fraud.\nMyanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces until 2011, when a nominally civilian government was sworn in.\nThe country was calm in the aftermath of the coup, with troops patrolling all major cities and a night-time curfew in force. Communications systems disrupted by the coup returned by Tuesday morning. \nBut as night fell on Tuesday, car horns and the banging of cooking pots could be heard in the streets of Yangon in a sign of protest. \nYouth and student groups also called for civil disobedience campaigns, and a Facebook page for the campaign gained over 100,000 likes.\nDoctors working in government hospitals said they would stop work from Wednesday to push for Ms Suu Kyi's release. \nSome medics are resorting to wearing symbols in silent protest. \nAt least one doctor has quit in protest, saying \"such coups cannot be tolerated at all\". \nDr Naing Htoo Aung, a 47-year-old anaesthesiologist at Mongywa Hospital in Sagaing Region, told BBC Burmese: \"I resigned because I couldn't work under a military dictator who did not care about the country and the people. This is the best response I can give to them.\"  \nAnother doctor involved in the campaign, Myo Thet Oo, told Reuters news agency: \"We cannot accept dictators and an unelected government.\n\"They can arrest us anytime. We have decided to face it... All of us have decided not to go to the hospital.\"\nPower has been handed over to commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. Eleven ministers and deputies, including those in finance, health, the interior and foreign affairs, were replaced. \nIn the first meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing repeated that the takeover had been \"inevitable\" after the military made allegations of electoral fraud.  \nThere have been no official statements on Ms Suu Kyi's exact whereabouts since she was detained in pre-dawn raids on Monday.\nBut unnamed sources from within the NLD have said both she and President Win Myint were being held under house arrest.\nMs Suu Kyi - who spent nearly 15 years in detention between 1989 and 2010 - has urged her supporters to \"protest against the coup\" in a letter written before she was detained. It warned the military's actions would put the country back under a dictatorship.\nShe was barred from becoming president because she has children born to a foreign national. But since the NLD's decisive election victory in 2015 she has been widely seen as de facto leader. \nMyanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China. Thailand and Laos.\nIt was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011.\nNearly all expressions of dissent were banned and accusations of severe human rights abuses led to international condemnation and sanctions.\nAung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence.\nA government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh and triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community.\nShe has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more.\nUS President Joe Biden has threatened to reinstate sanctions on Myanmar. He said the military should not \"overrule the will of the people\". Later the State Department declared events in Myanmar to be a coup and said it would review foreign aid to the country.\nAlong with the US, the United Nations, the UK and the EU have also condemned the military takeover. \nUK Foreign Office minister Nigel Adams said he hoped a phone call planned with Ms Suu Kyi later this week would go ahead to confirm her safety.\nIt is unclear though how much effect the warnings from Western countries will have. The coup leaders will have expected sanctions and factored those into their plans. \nChina, which has previously opposed international intervention in Myanmar, urged all sides in the country to \"resolve differences\". China's Xinhua news agency described the changes as a \"cabinet reshuffle\". \nOther countries in the region, including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines, have said it is an \"internal matter\"."

      "text": "She was once seen as a beacon for human rights - a principled activist who gave up her freedom to challenge the ruthless army generals who ruled Myanmar for decades.\nIn 1991, Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, while still under house arrest, and hailed as \"an outstanding example of the power of the powerless\". \nIn 2015, she led her National League for Democracy (NLD) to victory in Myanmar's first openly contested election in 25 years. But she was deposed by a coup in 2021 when the military took control and arrested her and the political leadership around her. \nWhile her image had suffered internationally due to her response to the crisis that befell Myanmar's mostly Muslim Rohingya minority, she remains hugely popular with the country's Buddhist majority.\nMs Suu Kyi spent nearly 15 years in detention between 1989 and 2010. Her personal struggle to bring democracy to then military-ruled Myanmar (also known as Burma) - made her an international symbol of peaceful resistance in the face of oppression.\nDespite her landslide victory in 2015, the Myanmar constitution forbade her from becoming president because she has children who are foreign nationals. But Ms Suu Kyi, now 75, was widely seen as de facto leader.\nHer official title was state counsellor. The President until the 2021 coup, Win Myint, was a close aide.\nIn 2020, her NLD once again won a landslide majority, getting even more votes than in the 2015 vote.\nThe still powerful military disputed the results, claiming election fraud. On the day parliament was to a sit for the first time, the military arrested Ms Suu Kyi along with many other political leaders. \nIt then declared a state of emergency, handing power to the military for a full year.\nMs Suu Kyi was later charged with illegally importing communications equipment. Police said they found seven walkie-talkie radios in her home which she was not authorised to possess.\nMs Suu Kyi is the daughter of Myanmar's independence hero, General Aung San.\nHe was assassinated when she was only two years old, just before Myanmar gained independence from British colonial rule in 1948.\nIn 1960 she went to India with her mother Daw Khin Kyi, who had been appointed Myanmar's ambassador in Delhi.\nFour years later she went to Oxford University in the UK, where she studied philosophy, politics and economics. There she met her future husband, academic Michael Aris.\nAfter stints of living and working in Japan and Bhutan, she settled in the UK to raise their two children, Alexander and Kim, but Myanmar was never far from her thoughts.\nWhen she arrived back in Yangon in 1988 - to look after her critically ill mother - Myanmar was in the midst of major political upheaval.\nThousands of students, office workers and monks took to the streets demanding democratic reform.\n\"I could not as my father's daughter remain indifferent to all that was going on,\" she said in a speech in Yangon on 26 August 1988. She went on to lead the revolt against the then-dictator, General Ne Win.\nInspired by the non-violent campaigns of US civil rights leader Martin Luther King and India's Mahatma Gandhi, she organised rallies and travelled around the country, calling for peaceful democratic reform and free elections.\nBut the demonstrations were brutally suppressed by the army, which seized power in a coup on 18 September 1988. Ms Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest the following year.\nThe military government called national elections in May 1990, which Ms Suu Kyi's NLD convincingly won - but the junta refused to hand over control.\nMs Suu Kyi remained under house arrest in Yangon for six years, until she was released in July 1995.\nShe was again put under house arrest in September 2000, when she tried to travel to the city of Mandalay in defiance of travel restrictions.\nShe was released unconditionally in May 2002, but just over a year later was imprisoned after a government-backed mob set upon her entourage in the north of the country. She escaped because of the swift action taken by her driver, but many of her supporters were savagely beaten and a number died. \nShe was later allowed to return home - but again under effective house arrest. \nAt times she was able to meet other NLD officials and selected diplomats, but during the early years she was often in solitary confinement. She was not allowed to see her two sons or her husband, who died of cancer in March 1999.\nThe military authorities had offered to allow her to travel to the UK to see him when he was gravely ill, but she felt compelled to refuse for fear she would not be allowed back into the country.\nMs Suu Kyi was side-lined from Myanmar's first elections in two decades on 7 November 2010 but released from house arrest six days later. Her son Kim was allowed to visit her for the first time in a decade.\nAs the new government embarked on a process of reform, Ms Suu Kyi and her party re-joined the political process. \nThey won 43 of the 45 seats contested in April 2012 by-elections, in an emphatic statement of support. Ms Suu Kyi was sworn in as an MP and leader of the opposition. \nThe following May, she left Myanmar for the first time in 24 years, in a sign of apparent confidence that its new leaders would allow her to return. \nSince becoming Myanmar's state counsellor, her leadership has been partly defined by the treatment of the country's mostly Muslim Rohingya minority. \nIn 2017 hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh due to an army crackdown sparked by deadly attacks on police stations in Rakhine state.\nMyanmar now faces a lawsuit accusing it of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), while the International Criminal Court is investigating the country for crimes against humanity.\nMs Suu Kyi's former international supporters accused her of doing nothing to stop rape, murder and possible genocide by refusing to condemn the still powerful military or acknowledge accounts of atrocities.\nA few initially argued that she was a pragmatic politician, trying to govern a multi-ethnic country with a complex history.\nBut her personal defence of the army's actions at the ICJ hearing in the Hague was seen as a new turning point for her international reputation.\nAt home, however, \"the Lady\", as Ms Suu Kyi is known, remains wildly popular among the Buddhist majority who hold little sympathy for the Rohingya. \nDuring her time in power Ms Suu Kyi and the NLD government also faced criticism for prosecuting journalists and activists using colonial-era laws.\nWhile there was progress in some areas, the military continued to hold a quarter of parliamentary seats and controlled key ministries including defence, home affairs and border affairs.\nIn August 2018, Ms Suu Kyi described the generals in her cabinet as \"rather sweet\" and Myanmar's democratic transition, analysts said, appeared to have stalled.\nThe 2021 military coup came as the country was facing one of South East Asia's worst Covid-19 outbreaks, putting new strains on an already impoverished healthcare system as lockdown measures devastate livelihoods. \nThe coup triggered widespread demonstrations and Myanmar's military has cracked down on pro-democracy protesters, activists and journalists.\nIn December 2021, Ms Suu Kyi was found guilty of inciting dissent and breaking Covid rules in the first of a series of verdicts that could see her jailed for life. UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet called it a \"sham trial\" that would only \"deepen rejection of the coup\".\nMs Suu Kyi faces 11 charges in total and denies them all.\nYet Ms Suu Kyi remains popular. A 2020 survey by the People's Alliance for Credible Elections, a watchdog, found that 79% of people had trust in her - up from 70% the previous year.\nDerek Mitchell, former US Ambassador to Myanmar told the BBC: \"The story of Aung San Suu Kyi is as much about us as it is about her. She may not have changed. She may have been consistent and we just didn't know the full complexity of who she is.\n\"We have to be mindful that we shouldn't endow people with some iconic image beyond which is human.\""

      "text": "The military takeover in Myanmar on Monday resulted in internet disruption in large parts of the country.\nThe authorities have now blocked access to Facebook, which they said was for the sake of \"stability\". \nThe restrictions to the internet were reported on Monday at 03:00 local time (20:30 GMT on Sunday).\nInternet connectivity had dropped to 50% of normal levels by 08:00 local time that day, as people were waking up to the news of the military takeover.\n\"Army cut off the state media TV and radios, local phone line and internet getting disabled across the country,\" tweeted Burmese Reuters journalist Wa Lone. \nData from the internet monitoring service Netblocks shows disruptions on network operators, including state-owned Myanma Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) and an international operator, Telenor.\nNetblocks says its findings indicate a \"centrally ordered mechanism of disruption... progressing over time as operators comply\".\nBy midday on Monday, internet connectivity had returned to 75% of normal activity.\nHowever, on Wednesday the military blocked access to Facebook, which has been used by activists to co-ordinate opposition to the coup.\nFor the overwhelming majority in Myanmar, Facebook is the primary means of access to the internet. \nSome users are managing to circumvent the ban by using VPNs, which encrypt an internet connection so its location is not identifiable. \nUsers in the country are rushing to download VPN apps to allow them to do this. \nThere has been a 4,300% increase in the demand for VPN, according to Top10VPN.com, which conducts research on these services. \nThe authorities have said blocks on Facebook will remain in place until 7 February.\nSome parts of Myanmar, also known as Burma, were more restricted than others.\nBased at Monash University in Australia, the IP Observatory, which tracks internet connectivity around the world, found that some regions were severely disrupted. \nMagway region was reporting zero internet connectivity at one point. \nYangon region, which includes the country's largest city, dropped in connectivity to about 50% compared to normal times. Restricting internet in the major cities is likely to be more difficult, as users will have access to a wider variety of providers that may implement restrictions at different intensities and at different times. \nMost regions are now reporting an increase in internet connectivity. \nThe Myanmar government has restricted the internet before, especially in areas in Rakhine and Chin states, where the army is fighting local groups. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced by the conflicts. \nArticle 77 of Myanmar's Telecommunications Law, passed in 2013, is used by the government to cut off telecommunications during a national emergency. \nHowever, human rights groups have called for the law to be amended to protect freedom of expression and have criticised the broad scope of the law. \nThere were also concerns that health information about Covid-19 was being restricted to some parts of the country, because of an internet shutdown in 2020. \nA government can disrupt the internet by ordering internet service providers (ISPs) to limit access. \nThis can include blocking particular sites, such as popular social media platforms. A message such as \"server not found\" or \"this site has been blocked by the network administrator\" will show up. \nAnother method is known as \"throttling\" - when the bandwidth to a website is limited, making the internet slow and frustrating to use. \nFinally, telecoms providers can shut down all access to the internet. \nIn theory, a telecoms company could challenge a government order. But in countries where the government has a tight grip on the media and can threaten to revoke licences, the willingness to push back on such demands is limited.  \nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions"

\"but politics is the way\". \nHe said staff safety was paramount. \"All threats must be condemned and cross party support for withdrawal is welcome. \n\"Those parties who talked up the threat of violence during the negotiations need to reflect. \nBorder Control Posts (BCPs) were built at Larne harbour, and two other facilities in NI as a consequence of Brexit. \nThey are facilities for inspecting food and live animals when they arrive from other parts of the UK.\nAt the end of the Brexit transition on 1 January 2021, Northern Ireland remained in the single market for goods.\nThe rest of the UK did not, so some products entering Northern Ireland from GB must be checked on entry.\nThe EU has particularly strict rules on food and animals, requiring all those products to enter through a BCP.\nVictor Chestnutt, the President of the Ulster Farmers' Union, said he was concerned that the supply of food may be affected by the suspension of checks.\nHe told BBC News NI: \"Some of our food companies bring in ingredients from the UK mainland. If they needed checks and those checks are not done, is that going to be held at the port or is that going to be released?\n\"Trade needs to flow and flow freely. If we see more delays, it will add more cost and more problems.\""

      "text": "Losses to Scotch whisky exports have reached \u00a3500m as a result of tariffs imposed by the US, according to an industry body.\nNew figures suggest single malt exports have fallen by more than a third since a 25% tariff was imposed in 2019.\nIt was among measures introduced by the US in retaliation against EU subsidies given to aircraft maker Airbus.\nThe Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) described the current situation as \"unsustainable\".\nIt also said distillers were \"continuing to pay the price for an aerospace dispute that has nothing to do\" with them.\nSWA chief executive Karen Betts said: \"Since tariffs were put in place, our exports to the US have fallen by 35%, amounting to over half a billion pounds in lost exports.\n\"This is being borne by large and small producers alike, who are losing sales and market share in what has been for decades the industry's largest and most valuable market, which they may never now recover.\"\nAmerican drinkers have shifted to spirits in a big way while told to \"shelter in place\" - their equivalent of lockdown. With beer consumption hit, most spirits have seen a big boost, led by tequila.\nDiageo, the spirits giant, deployed its marketing jargon last week to observe the US market has seen \"strong activations in the at-home occasion\".\nWhiskies have shared in the activation, except for Scotch, and that's in its biggest export market, where single malts have grown strongly. Those 25% tariffs targeted at Scotch malt have made Irish, Canadian and US alternatives relatively cheaper and helped their sales.\nIt might be that single malt drinkers shift to premium blends, which don't carry the tariff. That would help explain Diageo results, published last week and covering July to December last year, showing malts down 33% on the previous year, while its Johnnie Walker blended range was up 11%. \nBut an industry source says it's not like that for smaller distillers, finding that distributors in the USA have a reduced thirst for Scotch, if any of it - malt or blended - arrives with a price hike.\nScotch distillers fear the shift will be very hard to claw back. Removing tariffs will not see Scotch bounce back overnight. This proves a point they've made for years, that Scotch whisky has competitors, who can quickly grab market share.\nMs Betts added that it is hard for Scotch whisky producers to understand why the UK government is \"unwilling\" to comply with World Trade Organisation rules on aerospace subsidies.\nShe said: \"Distillers are suffering terrible losses and still the government, after 16 years of unsuccessful litigation, is unprepared to take the necessary steps to ensure subsidies comply with the UK's international obligations.\"\nLast month, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer used a newspaper column to call on the UK Government to negotiate with the new US administration of President Joe Biden.\nAs well as calling for the immediate suspension of tariffs, the SWA wants more support for the industry given the difficult trading conditions as a result of Brexit and the Covid pandemic.\nA Department for International Trade spokesman said: \"The Secretary of State for International Trade has led intensive talks with the US to get these unfair tariffs on UK exports removed.\n\"We will continue to push hard for a resolution that works for the whole of the UK - including our brilliant Scotch whisky producers.\n\"We have a clear strategy in place to de-escalate the dispute and we will work with the new US administration at the earliest opportunity to find a solution.\"\nScotland's trade minister Ivan McKee MSP said: \"The damaging impact of these tariffs on businesses and communities is being felt across Scotland and is increasing, as the SWA's figures make clear.\n\"Scottish producers have suffered enough for something that has nothing to do with them and cannot wait any longer.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK must \"come down hard\" on the South African coronavirus variant, the health secretary has said, after cases with no links to travel were detected.\nAbout 80,000 people in England will be offered urgent tests for the variant.\nResidents aged 16 and over in eight areas across Surrey, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Southport and Walsall are being asked to take tests, regardless of symptoms. \nPrevious cases in the UK were connected to South Africa.\nBut random checks found 11 cases that could not be linked to international travel.\nMatt Hancock told a Downing Street news conference on Monday that there was \"currently no evidence\" to suggest the South African variant was \"any more severe, but we need to come down on it hard, and we will\".\nMobile testing units and home kits are being sent to the following neighbourhoods:\nAppealing to residents of these postcodes, Mr Hancock said: \"It is imperative that you stay at home, and that you get a test, even if you don't have symptoms. \n\"This is so important so that we can break the chains of the transmission of this new variant, and we've got to bring this virus to heel.\"\nDr Susan Hopkins, of Public Health England, told the same briefing that three of the vaccines that had been used in trials had proven effective against the South African variant.\nShe said officials expected other vaccines to have \"a similar level of effectiveness, particularly in reducing hospitalisation and death\".\nDr Hopkins added that further testing was taking place involving the South African variant so that predictions could be made with \"greater robustness\".\nProf Jim McManus, the director of public health for Hertfordshire, told the BBC that if every single case was detected, it might be \"possible\" to eradicate the variant within two weeks. \nAsked how confident the government was that the new variant could be contained, Mr Hancock warned it was \"not straightforward... there may be further cases we don't know about yet\".\nHe added it was \"absolutely vital\" that people in the affected areas \"minimise all social contact and get a test when the opportunity arises\".\nWhy have 11 cases caused such alarm? It is because of the precarious position we are in currently.\nVaccination is being rolled out quickly and many vulnerable people are building up immunity.\nAnything that interferes with that at this point will have significant consequences. But once vaccination is complete and there are significant levels of immunity across the population, the impact of mutations becomes much more diluted.\nThis is why there needs to be maximum vigilance now, but in the long-term we can still be confident we can get on top of this pandemic.\nViruses mutate, so what is happening is not surprising.\nBut coronaviruses - certainly compared to the flu which sees different strains circulating every year - tend to be relatively stable.\nSo that means, even with the mutations we are seeing, the vaccines that have been developed still offer a very good degree of protection, even if that protection is not quite as high as it was against the original form of the virus.\nWhat is more, it is relatively straightforward with this generation of vaccines to re-engineer them to work better against the mutations that have been seen.\nAlmost 9.3 million people in the UK have now received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest government figures.\nMeanwhile, a further 18,607 new infections were recorded in the UK as of Monday, as well as another 406 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nIn total, 105 cases of the South African variant have been identified - with all but 11 linked to travel in South Africa. \nMr Hancock said testers would be going door-to-door in the areas being targeted for surge testing.\nKent County Council said police would be among those going door-to-door to offer residents in the ME15 area tests \"there and then\". \nIn Hertfordshire, residents in the EN10 area will receive a letter offering tests at mobile screening units, to collect at a local library, or through the post, the county council said.\nPositive cases will be analysed to see if they are caused by the South African variant.\nPublic Health England has already been analysing around 5% to 10% of all positive cases in more detail, allowing it to identify new variants in the community.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said vaccines could be adapted to deal with new variants if necessary.\n\"The fact is we are going to be living with Covid for a while to come in one way or another,\" Mr Johnson said. \nStudies are under way into how the vaccines work against the new variants, with some early results suggesting the Pfizer jab protects against them.\nData on two new vaccines that could be approved soon - one from Novavax and another from Janssen - show that they appear to offer some protection against the variant. Meanwhile, early results from Moderna suggest its vaccine is still effective against the South Africa variant.\nIn other developments:"

      "text": "People in areas that have been singled out for enhanced testing for the South African variant should further limit the time they spend away from home, a minister has said.\nUniversities minister Michelle Donelan said those affected should be \"thinking twice about their actions\".\nOn-the-spot doorstep tests, home testing kits and mobile testing units will be deployed in eight areas.\nThe health secretary said he wanted to \"come down hard\" on the variant.\nIt follows fears that the more infectious version may be spreading in communities in England.\nMs Donelan told BBC Breakfast that people in the targeted areas should be having a \"conversation with their employer about making sure that they can work from home\" and \"limiting even more the time that they are outside of their house\".\nThe enhanced testing programme aims to reach 80,000 people.\nMatt Hancock, the health secretary, urged everyone over 16 in the targeted areas to take up the offer of a test whether they have symptoms or not - and even if they have been vaccinated.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, he said anyone who had not been contacted and was unsure whether they should have a test should find out via their local authority's website.\nGene sequencing has so far uncovered 105 cases of the variant, which - like the variant previously discovered in Kent - is thought to be more contagious although not more deadly.  \nEleven of the cases of the South African variant had no link to foreign travel, prompting concerns it is spreading in the community.\nDr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said the existing vaccines may offer less protection against the South African variant, although they still offer a good level of immunity.\nThe \"surge testing\" will affect people living and working in these areas linked to cases of the variant:\nIn most of the areas, home testing kits are being delivered and collected, while some are also providing mobile testing sites. The tests will be PCR ones, which involve swabbing the nose or throat and are regarded as the most reliable.\nMr Hancock also said it was \"imperative\" that people in these areas \"only leave home where it is absolutely essential\".\nTom Casson, who lives in Hackbridge in south London, said he was concerned about the \"handling\" of the new testing programme in his area.\n\"There has been no direct contact with us,\" he told the BBC. \"People want to help. But tell them what to do and how they can help. How can they go to the shops? How can they get tested? How will the home testing work?\" \nBy Suzanne Leigh, BBC News\nHanwell, W7, is, arguably, one of London's best kept secrets. There's a village-like feel in parts and a carnival, free music festival, a zoo - all either cancelled or closed at the moment, of course. \nBut still open are the wide spaces of parkland. The River Brent and Grand Union canal thread through and the area is a haven for wildlife. Red kites can regularly be seen hovering over the golf course; herons and an egret are a frequent sight and if you're really lucky you'll spot a water rail or kingfisher. Bats nestle under the viaduct, anecdotally a favourite spot of Queen Victoria's - she would request that her train would pause there so she could admire the view.\nIt's a bit quieter than usual this morning. People are noticeably giving each other more space and the only hubbub is around the newly opened vaccination centre at the church hall. \nBut there's also confusion. Why not test all the postcode? Why aren't there more test appointments? \nThere are roads split between those deemed to be in the danger zone and those outside it. How does that work? \nIn December, the discovery of the new strain prompted a ban on foreign nationals travelling into the UK from South Africa and later from southern African countries.\nUnder current restrictions, people arriving into England from anywhere outside the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man need to isolate at home for 10 days and provide a negative Covid test result before travel.\nA new system of quarantine requiring those arriving from countries under travel bans to isolate in hotels is due to be introduced in the coming weeks.\nLabour, however, wants the government to go further and introduce a hotel quarantine system for all UK arrivals.\nOn Monday, the House of Commons voted 262-0 in favour of a non-binding motion to introduce such a system. All Conservative MPs abstained.\nLabour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds accused the government of being \"irresponsible\" not to back the motion.\n\"We have to do everything we can\" to protect against \"mutations emerging elsewhere\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nCompletely stopping the spread of the South African variant is probably not realistic.\nFor one thing, these 11 cases have only been spotted by random checks on 5-10% of all positive cases. There are bound to be more.\nSo why the testing blitz? It's because of the delicate position we're in.\nVaccination is being rolled out quickly and many vulnerable people are building up immunity.\nAnything that interferes with that will have significant consequences - so even just slowing the spread will be really beneficial. \nBut once vaccination is complete and there is significant immunity across the population, the impact of mutations becomes much more diluted.\nThis is why maximum vigilance is needed now, but in the long-term we can still be confident we can get on top of this pandemic.\nViruses mutate, but coronaviruses - certainly compared to the flu, which sees different strains circulating every year - tend to be relatively stable.\nSo, even with the mutations we are seeing, the vaccines still offer a very good degree of protection - even if that protection is not quite as high as it was against the original form of the virus.\nWhat's more, it is relatively straightforward with this generation of vaccines to re-engineer them to work better against the mutations that have been seen.\nIt is expected that Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will outline tougher supervised quarantine measures later.\nIt comes amid growing concern in Scotland that it is lagging behind England in its vaccination programme.\nUK minister Ms Donelan said Ms Sturgeon's proposal of a \"blanket policy\" on quarantining all arrivals would be \"unfeasible\" and \"not necessarily effective\". She said the UK government's strategy had to be \"targeted and deliverable\".\nMr Hancock would update the House of Commons about hotel quarantine for arrivals from some countries \"within the week\", she said, adding that 30 countries have been identified.\nAccording to the Times, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned Downing Street that only closing the borders or introducing mandatory quarantine for all would stop new variants entering the UK.\nA government source told the BBC the report was \"not accurate\" and that the prime minister \"was not advised to stop all travel\".\nProf Calum Semple, a member of Sage, told the Today programme a \"significant reduction in the movement of people\" was \"incredibly important\" in order to \"snuff out\" the South African variant, but it was not practical to close the UK's borders completely.\n\"You can't do it altogether when you have got a country that is dependent on imports for food and other essential processes. It is just not possible,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, scientists have said that the variant discovered in Kent appears to be undergoing some genetic changes already seen in the South African and Brazilian variants.\nThe latest analysis of death certificates by the UK's national statistical agencies shows more than 9,000 deaths in the week ending 22 January were linked to Covid.\nIt is a rise of nearly 1,300 on the week before and the second highest weekly figure since the pandemic began. \nIt means 44% of all the deaths recorded in the week were linked to Covid and brings the total number of deaths during the pandemic by this measure - based on mentions on the death certificate - to nearly 113,000. \nHowever, these figures lag behind the government's daily deaths data, which counts people who have died within 28 days of testing positive. \nOn Monday, the government's coronavirus dashboard recorded a further 406 deaths and 18,607 new confirmed cases. Overall, that data has started to suggest the rise in deaths is levelling off.\nGovernment data also shows 9,296,367 first doses of the vaccine have now been given, with almost half of people in their 70s given a jab and almost 90% of over-80s.\nMr Hancock told MPs: \"That we find ourselves in this position is no accident. \n\"Our strategy has been to invest early and invest at risk. We backed many horses, no matter where they're from, and we've also built up our vaccine manufacturing capability here at home.\"\nDr Hopkins said laboratory studies were being carried out to provide further evidence of the vaccines' effectiveness against new variants.\nThe three vaccines approved so far - Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna - all showed effectiveness against the South Africa variant that was higher than the minimum standard set by the World Health Organization and the US Food and Drug Administration, she said.\nShe said she expected other vaccines to have similar levels of effectiveness against the variant, particularly in reducing serious illness and deaths from the virus."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Russia,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine gives around 92% protection against Covid-19, late stage trial results published in The Lancet reveal. \nIt has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death. \nThe vaccine was initially met with some controversy after being rolled out before the final trial data had been released.\nBut scientists said its benefit has now been demonstrated.\nIt joins the ranks of proven vaccines alongside Pfizer, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen. \nThe Sputnik vaccine works in a similar way to the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab developed in the UK, and the Janssen vaccine developed in Belgium.\nIt uses a cold-type virus, engineered to be harmless, as a carrier to deliver a small fragment of the coronavirus to the body.\nSafely exposing the body to part of the virus's genetic code in this way allows it to recognise the threat and learn to fight it off, without risking becoming ill. \nAfter being vaccinated, the body starts to produce antibodies specially tailored to the coronavirus. \nThis means the immune system is primed to fight coronavirus when if it encounters it for real. \nIt can be stored at temperatures of between 2 and 8C degrees (a standard fridge is roughly 3-5C degrees) making it easier to transport and store. \nBut unlike other similar vaccines, the Sputnik jab uses two slightly different versions of the vaccine for the first and second dose - given 21 days apart.\nThey both target the coronavirus's distinctive \"spike\", but use different vectors - the neutralised virus that carries the spike to the body. \nThe idea is that using two different formulas boosts the immune system even more than using the same version twice - and may give longer-lasting protection.\nAs well as proving effective, it was also safe with no serious reactions linked to the vaccine during the trial.\nSome side effects to a vaccine are expected but these are usually mild, including a sore arm, tiredness and a bit of a temperature.  \nAnd there were no deaths or serious illness in the vaccinated group linked to the jab. \nAs well as Russia, the vaccine is being used in a number of other places including:\nIn a comment published alongside the Lancet paper, Profs Ian Jones and Polly Roy said: \"The development of the Sputnik V vaccine has been criticised for unseemly haste, corner cutting, and an absence of transparency.\n\"But the outcome reported here is clear and the scientific principle of vaccination is demonstrated, which means another vaccine can now join the fight to reduce the incidence of Covid-19\".\nThey pointed out the vaccine had good effect in all age groups, and reduced the seriousness of the disease after one dose. \nThis was \"particularly encouraging\" while supply of the vaccine is limited, they added. \nThe authors of the Lancet paper pointed out the analysis only included symptomatic cases of Covid, and more work would need to be done to understand whether it stops even asymptomatic cases, and prevents the virus from being passed on by vaccinated people. \nDr Julian Tang, a clinical virologist at the University of Leicester, said: \"Despite the earlier misgivings about the way this Russian Sputnik V vaccine was rolled out more widely - ahead of sufficient Phase 3 trial data - this approach has been justified to some extent now. \n\"Such pandemic-related vaccine rollout compromises have, to be fair, been adopted in the UK vaccination programme also - with the extended intervals between the first and second doses.\n\"So we should be more careful about being overly critical about other countries' vaccine designs.\""

      "text": "The government has been defeated in the House of Lords on its post-Brexit Trade Bill, with peers backing a move to stop the UK doing deals with countries that abuse human rights. \nThey supported an amendment giving the High Court the right to determine if genocide has been committed. \nIf it decided it had, the government would then have to hold a debate to set out what it proposed to do. \nMinisters say they are are committed to working with Parliament on a solution. \nThe House of Lords has been considering the Trade Bill for a second time after MPs overturned a series of changes peers made in January. \nThe legislation enables the UK to strike new trade deals with countries after leaving the EU.\nBut there is concern over the human rights records of current and potential trading partners, including China and its treatment of the Uighur people.\nThe government says it has spoken out strongly against human rights abuses in China and around the world.\nCrossbench peer Lord Alton, who brought forward the amendment, said it was time \"to speak and to act\". \nUnder his plans, the High Court would be given the right to make a preliminary judgement on genocide and ministers would then be obliged to have a debate in Parliament if such human rights abuses were found to have occurred.\nMinisters would have to set out what they planned to do \"within a reasonable time\". \nSpeaking in the debate, Lord Alton said it was an attempt to \"impose a limitation\" on ministers where genocide was shown to have taken place. \nPeers backed his amendment by 359 votes to 188.\nThe government also lost votes on two other amendments.\nOne by Conservative Lord Lansley would give Parliament the opportunity to set negotiating terms for trade deals. \nThe other, by Labour's Lord Collins, would compel ministers to report on human rights before trade deals are considered.\nInvestment minister Lord Grimstone insisted that \"trade does not have to come at the expense of human rights\". \nHe said genocide was \"notoriously hard to prove\", but the government had \"some sympathy\" with calls to give Parliament a greater role to scrutinise where there were \"credible concerns\".\nLord Grimstone indicated that, if a parliamentary select committee published a report on genocide and sought a debate, the government would facilitate one, adding that human rights abuses could not be \"swept under the carpet\". \nBut many Conservative backbench MPs are uneasy at the government's approach.\nIn January, the government narrowly avoided defeat in the Commons when 33 of them voted to outlaw trade deals with countries judged to have committed genocide. \nThe Trade Bill will now return to the Commons for MPs to vote on the amendments, in the latest series of parliamentary back-and-forth between the two Houses, known as ping-pong."

      "text": "A landmark review has called for transformational change in our economic approach to nature.\nThe long-awaited review by Prof Sir Partha Dasgupta, of the University of Cambridge, says prosperity has come at a \"devastating\" cost to the natural world.\nThe report proposes recognising nature as an asset and reconsidering our measures of economic prosperity.\nIt is expected to set the agenda on government policy going forward.\nAt its heart is the idea that sustainable economic growth requires a different measure than Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\"Truly sustainable economic growth and development means recognising that our long-term prosperity relies on rebalancing our demand of nature's goods and services with its capacity to supply them,\" Prof Dasgupta said in a statement.\n\"It also means accounting fully for the impact of our interactions with nature across all levels of society.\"\nCovid-19 has shown us what can happen when we don't do this, he added. \"Nature is our home. Good economics demands we manage it better.\" \nThe Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity was commissioned by the UK Treasury in 2019, the first time a national finance ministry has authorised a full assessment of the economic importance of nature.\nThe report, which has been compared with the influential 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, sets out the ways in which we should account for nature in economics and decision-making. \nRecommendations include:\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed the review. The UK is co-hosting COP26 - this year's UN climate meeting - and also holds the presidency of this year's G7. Mr Johnson said: \"We are going to make sure the natural world stays right at the top of the global agenda.\"\nSir David Attenborough, who wrote the foreword to the review, said: \"This comprehensive and immensely important report shows us how, by bringing economics and ecology face-to-face, we can help to save the natural world and, in doing so, save ourselves.\" \nThe 600-page review argues that losses in biodiversity are undermining the productivity, resilience and adaptability of nature. This is in turn putting economies, livelihoods and well-being at risk. \nCommenting on the review, Jennifer Morris, of conservation non-profit The Nature Conservancy, described it as a \"clarion call\" to world leaders.\n\"We must tackle the nature crisis in conjunction with the climate emergency for the sake of our economies, livelihoods, and wellbeing - and those of future generations,\" she said.\n The review has been published at the beginning of a critical year for tackling the climate change and extinction crises. \nPolicymakers are looking ahead to the UN Biodiversity Conference COP15 in Kunming, China, closely followed by the UN Climate Change Summit (COP26) in Glasgow in late 2021.\nBiodiversity is declining faster than at any time in human history. Since 1970, there has been on average almost a 70% decline in the populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. \nIt is thought that one million animal and plant species  - almost a quarter of the global total - are threatened with extinction. \nThe idea of being able to put a price on nature divides opinion, but accounting for the economic value of nature is increasingly guiding policy.\nWhile some argue that the assumption the natural world has no value is baked into current business models, others have doubts over whether an ecosystem can be accurately represented by financial models.\nKatie Kedward, economist at University College London's (UCL) Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose, argues that there are conceptual problems in trying to capture the complexities of nature in financial terms. \nShe told BBC News: \"There are significant uncertainties in estimating nature loss in monetary terms and given the uncertainties involved price-based tools can't be used as a replacement to more important steps to restore nature.\"\nThe review is the result of an 18-month independent global assessment on the economics of biodiversity, led by Prof Dasgupta.\nHM Treasury has said it will examine the review's findings and respond formally in due course.\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

      "text": "Losses to Scotch whisky exports have reached \u00a3500m as a result of tariffs imposed by the US, according to an industry body.\nNew figures suggest single malt exports have fallen by more than a third since a 25% tariff was imposed in 2019.\nIt was among measures introduced by the US in retaliation against EU subsidies given to aircraft maker Airbus.\nThe Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) described the current situation as \"unsustainable\".\nIt also said distillers were \"continuing to pay the price for an aerospace dispute that has nothing to do\" with them.\nSWA chief executive Karen Betts said: \"Since tariffs were put in place, our exports to the US have fallen by 35%, amounting to over half a billion pounds in lost exports.\n\"This is being borne by large and small producers alike, who are losing sales and market share in what has been for decades the industry's largest and most valuable market, which they may never now recover.\"\nAmerican drinkers have shifted to spirits in a big way while told to \"shelter in place\" - their equivalent of lockdown. With beer consumption hit, most spirits have seen a big boost, led by tequila.\nDiageo, the spirits giant, deployed its marketing jargon last week to observe the US market has seen \"strong activations in the at-home occasion\".\nWhiskies have shared in the activation, except for Scotch, and that's in its biggest export market, where single malts have grown strongly. Those 25% tariffs targeted at Scotch malt have made Irish, Canadian and US alternatives relatively cheaper and helped their sales.\nIt might be that single malt drinkers shift to premium blends, which don't carry the tariff. That would help explain Diageo results, published last week and covering July to December last year, showing malts down 33% on the previous year, while its Johnnie Walker blended range was up 11%. \nBut an industry source says it's not like that for smaller distillers, finding that distributors in the USA have a reduced thirst for Scotch, if any of it - malt or blended - arrives with a price hike.\nScotch distillers fear the shift will be very hard to claw back. Removing tariffs will not see Scotch bounce back overnight. This proves a point they've made for years, that Scotch whisky has competitors, who can quickly grab market share.\nMs Betts added that it is hard for Scotch whisky producers to understand why the UK government is \"unwilling\" to comply with World Trade Organisation rules on aerospace subsidies.\nShe said: \"Distillers are suffering terrible losses and still the government, after 16 years of unsuccessful litigation, is unprepared to take the necessary steps to ensure subsidies comply with the UK's international obligations.\"\nLast month, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer used a newspaper column to call on the UK Government to negotiate with the new US administration of President Joe Biden.\nAs well as calling for the immediate suspension of tariffs, the SWA wants more support for the industry given the difficult trading conditions as a result of Brexit and the Covid pandemic.\nA Department for International Trade spokesman said: \"The Secretary of State for International Trade has led intensive talks with the US to get these unfair tariffs on UK exports removed.\n\"We will continue to push hard for a resolution that works for the whole of the UK - including our brilliant Scotch whisky producers.\n\"We have a clear strategy in place to de-escalate the dispute and we will work with the new US administration at the earliest opportunity to find a solution.\"\nScotland's trade minister Ivan McKee MSP said: \"The damaging impact of these tariffs on businesses and communities is being felt across Scotland and is increasing, as the SWA's figures make clear.\n\"Scottish producers have suffered enough for something that has nothing to do with them and cannot wait any longer.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nOn Monday evening, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said 105 cases of the South African Covid-19 variant had been found in the UK. Of those, 11 had no links to international travel. In response, the government is beginning mass, door-to-door testing in eight parts of England where the variant was found - they are in Surrey, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Southport and Walsall. Around 80,000 people over 16 will be tested, regardless of symptoms. Mr Hancock said he wanted to \"find every case\" of the variant to \"break the chains of transmission\". He said there was \"no evidence\" to suggest the South African variant was more severe - but it's thought it may be more contagious. Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said vaccines \"perhaps\" could have \"diminished effectiveness\" on the variant, but would still be \"very good\". Learn more about the South African variant here - and watch Mr Hancock's announcement below.\nThe interest on student loans in England should be suspended for 15 months, a group of universities says. The vice-chancellors of seven universities say this would cover the period from the first national lockdown until summer 2021. In England, students are currently charged 5.6% on their student loans while they are studying - which is the retail price index plus 3%. But loan interest isn't the only cost that students are facing - here's a report from last month on a university \"rent strike\".\nA doctor in Bradford says the pandemic is leading to an increase in children self-harming or taking overdoses. \"Children in mental health crisis used to be brought to A&E about twice a week,\" writes Dr John Wright. \"Since the summer it's been more like once or twice a day.

And if that brings me into conflict with government then so be it. And if it doesn't, it doesn't,\" said Lord Wharton.\nLord Wharton also suggested that if he became chair of the OfS it would consider whether the process for students seeking tuition fee refunds was \"fit for purpose\".\n\"I think the truth is that the process currently is bureaucratic and cumbersome and slow,\" he said."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,Brexit",
      "text": "The EU has condemned \"threats\" against staff making Brexit-related checks at Northern Ireland's ports, and told EU officials working in Northern Ireland not to attend their duties.\nOn Monday, Mid and East Antrim Council withdrew staff from Brexit inspection duties over security fears.\nAll parties have condemned the threats.\nA senior police officer said there was no evidence any of the main loyalist paramilitary groups were involved in the incidents. \nNI police have increased patrols and offered advice on shift patterns.\nThey held talks with council staff after Brexit-related checks at NI ports were suspended amid security concerns.\nAn industry source told BBC News NI lorries arriving on the boats into Belfast and Larne received a waiver on Tuesday and were directed straight out of the ports.\nAfter the local authority decided to withdraw its staff, Stormont announced it was suspending physical inspections of food consignments - particularly meat, fish and dairy products - at Larne and Belfast.\nChecks are being carried out on some goods arriving from the rest of the UK, as part of what unionists view as an economic border with Britain. \nUnionist politicians strongly oppose the part of the Brexit deal known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, which has led to the new controls. \nGraffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in recent days, referring to employees as \"targets\".\nStaff reported suspicious activity - including apparent attempts to gather personal information, such as vehicle number plates. \nPolice Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan told the BBC there was no evidence to corroborate an anonymous claim that any of the main loyalist paramilitary groups were behind this.\nMr Ewan said that \"individuals or small groups of people\" were involved in incidents of graffiti or intimidation.\nHe said there was no evidence that car registrations of staff were being gathered, adding that there was nothing to suggest an attack on anyone was imminent.\nThe posts are run by Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera), led by official vets.\nDaera stopping the physical checks is a significant move as it means the posts are not operating as they are supposed to.\nMid and East Antrim Borough Council has 12 environmental health officers, and several senior officials, working at Larne harbour.\nA number of lorries were redirected away from a border control post near Belfast's Docks according  BBC News NI's Michael Fitzpatrick at the scene earlier on Tuesday.\nThe vehicles were stopped on the main road outside the Daera site on Duncrue Street by Border Force officers on Tuesday morning and redirected elsewhere.\nNo activity was taking place within the facility and the main gate into the site remained closed. \nBorder Control Posts (BCPs) were built at Larne harbour, and two other facilities in Northern Ireland, as a consequence of Brexit. \nThey are facilities for inspecting food and live animals when they arrive from other parts of the UK.\nAt the end of the Brexit transition on 1 January, Northern Ireland remained in the single market for goods.\nThe rest of the UK did not, so some products entering Northern Ireland from GB must be checked on entry.\nThe EU has particularly strict rules on food and animals, requiring all those products to enter through a BCP.\nOn Friday, unionist parties accused the EU of hypocrisy after it sought to trigger a Brexit safeguard to control the export of coronavirus vaccines into NI.\nThe protocol, which is part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, is designed to allow the free movement of goods from the EU into NI, and prevent the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland.\nUnionist parties are opposed to it because they argue it poses a risk to the stability of the union by placing a border down the Irish Sea.\nThey have also cited difficulties for trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, arguing the protocol will damage the local economy.\nArticle 16 is essentially a safeguard that would allow the UK or EU to act unilaterally if measures imposed as a result of the protocol are deemed to be causing \"serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nFood products such as meat, milk and fish now need to be certified by vets when moving from GB to NI.\nThis certification is being phased in for retailers but already applies in full for food service and catering firms.\nWhen the certificates are issued the lorry trailer is supposed to be sealed.\nThe developments at Larne are being seen within the context of what the PSNI stated publicly last week - there are signs of growing tensions created by the Brexit protocol within some sections of the community.\nThe PSNI had discussions about the safety of port staff.\nThere is nothing at this stage which points to a loyalist paramilitary grouping being behind what is going on.\nThe mood within loyalism is said to be one of discontent, but sources are not suggesting the direction of travel is protests, civil disobedience or violent acts.\nOne source said the focus must be on a concerted unionist push politically against the Irish Sea border.\nThere has been political unity in condemnation of the threats.\nStormont's new Agriculture Minister Gordon Lyons of the DUP said there was \"no justification\" for the threats.\nSpeaking in the assembly, Mr Lyons said his department was planning to receive a further risk assessment from the PSNI.\nHe said he could not provide assembly members with a timeline as to when he expected to receive the report.\nHe said: \"This is a time for calm heads, there's a huge degree of anger and we should all be aware of that.\n\"But that's no excuse for the threats and intimidation we have seen. What we have now are the real consequences of the protocol being felt.\"\nThe DUP has said it intends to send a \"strong signal\" to the Irish government by stopping north-south activities related to the NI Protocol.\nIt has drafted a five-point plan it says is needed to address the \"growing crisis\" over the Irish Sea border.\nTaoiseach (Irish PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin condemned the \"intimidatory tactics\".\n\"It's a very sinister and ugly development and, obviously, we will be doing everything we possibly can to assist and defuse the situation,\" he said.\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Gerry Kelly called on police to make arrests, if the evidence was there.\nUUP leader Steve Aiken said the threats \"are completely unacceptable\" and added that the \"growing anger over the Irish Sea Border and the impact on our economy, businesses and society must be recognised\" by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the EU Commission.\nJustice Minister Naomi Long tweeted that \"those responsible for this need to be taken off the streets\". \n\"Those whipping up tension need to dial down the rhetoric,\" the Alliance Party leader added.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said there needs to be more political leadership shown by unionists to \"tone down\" tensions. \nHe said that the first priority is to establish if workers are safe to return to their jobs through discussions with the PSNI and trade unions.\n\"If we can establish that they are safe then I think there will be no choice but to get back to work.\"\nMayor of Larne Peter Johnston, of the DUP, said tensions had been building for some time.\n\"Sadly, these threats and this behaviour is not just an overnight thing,\" he told Radio Foyle. \n\"We won't be putting our staff back into that position until the risk assessment comes back to say that it's safe to do so.\"\nThe European Commission's spokesperson said the EU \"condemned very strongly any threat of violence\".\n\"We understand decisions taken by the NI authorities to temporarily suspend a certain number of checks for the transfer of goods, it is obvious for us the first and utmost priority is the safety of people,\" said Eric Mamer.\nEU and UK government officials will hold a virtual meeting with Stormont's first and deputy first ministers on Wednesday.\nPSNI officials held talks with Mid and East Antrim council and Daera officials to discuss the threats, which ACC McEwan described as \"constructive\".\nThe council has said it will carry out a full risk assessment with the PSNI, Food Standards Agency and Daera.\nVictor Chestnutt, the President of the Ulster Farmers' Union, said he was concerned that the supply of food may be affected by the suspension of checks.\nHe told BBC News NI: \"Some of our food companies bring in ingredients from the UK mainland. If they needed checks and those checks are not done, is that going to be held at the port or is that going to be released?\n\"Trade needs to flow and flow freely. If we see more delays, it will add more cost and more problems.\""

      "text": "Myanmar woke to the news on Monday that the military was seizing control of the country.\n\"I guess I'll be live tweeting a coup now,\" former Reuters journalist Aye Min Thant wrote on Twitter shortly before 07:00 local time (00:30 GMT).\n\"Things are still pretty quiet for now, though people are awake and scared. I've been fielding calls since 6am from friends and relatives. The internet is in and out and my sim card no longer works.\" \nThe takeover was announced in a statement aired on a military-owned television station.\nIt said the top army commander was in charge and a one-year state of emergency had been declared. The country's civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, had been detained, along with other members of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party.\nThe move followed a landslide win by Ms Suu Kyi's party in an election in November that the army claims was marred by fraud. Ms Suu Kyi has urged her supporters to \"protest against the coup\".\nMyanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by the armed forces from 1962 until 2011,  when a new government began ushering in a return to civilian rule.\nOne resident of Myanmar's main city, Yangon, told the BBC she was ready to head out for an early morning walk when she received a message from a friend telling her of Ms Suu Kyi's detention.\nThe 25-year-old, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, immediately logged on to social media.\n\"Waking up to learn your world has been completely turned upside down overnight was not a new feeling, but a feeling that I thought that we had moved on from, and one that I never thought we'd be forced to feel again,\" she said, reflecting on her childhood under military rule.\n\"What really hit me was seeing how our regional ministers were all detained. Because this meant that they really took everyone, not just Aung San Suu Kyi,\" she added.\nThe arrest of regional lawmaker Pa Pa Han was livestreamed on Facebook by her husband.\nPolitical activists, including filmmaker Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi, were also reported to have been detained.\nThe Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) in Myanmar told the BBC it had documented the arrests of at least 42 officials, and 16 civil society activists.\nIt said the process of verifying names was ongoing, while noting that some detainees had been released later in the day.\n\"We woke up with the news of the military coup in the early morning and some of our friends were detained,\" a local activist, who we are keeping anonymous, told the BBC's Newsday programme.\n\"The internet connectivity is not there anymore... I can't go out and use my phone, there is no data at all. This is what's happening right now. There are military cars roaming around the city,\" she said.\nLocal journalist Cape Diamond tweeted that in the capital, Nay Pyi Daw, there had been no signal from 04:00 to 11:15 local time. \"No call, No Wifi,\" he later wrote on Twitter.\nBy BBC Reality Check\nAs the military took hold of power, internet disruption affected large areas.\nThe restrictions began at 03:00 on Monday local time. Internet connectivity dropped to 50% of normal levels of internet connectivity by 08:00.\nThe data shows disruptions impacting networks operators including state-owned Myanma Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) and an international operator Telenor, according to internet monitoring service Netblocks.\nNetblocks say its findings indicate a \"centrally ordered mechanism of disruption\u2026 progressing over time as operators comply\".\nBy midday, internet connectivity appeared to be back up to 75%. \nThe Myanmar government has restricted the internet before, especially in areas in Rakhine and Chin states, where the army is fighting local groups. \nArticle 77 of Myanmar's Telecommunications Law passed in 2013 permits the government to cut off telecommunications during a national emergency. \nHowever, human rights groups have called for the law to be amended to protect freedom of expression. \nInternational and domestic TV channels, including the state broadcaster, went off air.\nThe bright red flags of the NLD were taken off of homes and businesses in Yangon.\n\"My neighbour just took down his NLD flag... The fear of violence is real,\" journalist and researcher Annie Zaman wrote on Twitter.\nShe later shared a video of a flag being removed at a local market.\nPeople stocked up on essential supplies and queued at ATMs. Banks suspended services because of poor internet connections but said they would resume from Tuesday.\nBBC Burmese Service journalist Nyein Chan Aye said the mood in Yangon was of \"fear, anger and frustration\".\nHe said that after rushing out to buy staple supplies, like rice, many people were staying indoors waiting to see what happens next.\nIt has been a tough time economically for many in Myanmar, and the arrival of a coup has had many fearing for basics.\nMa Nan, a trader in Yangon, told the BBC: \"I'm worried if the price [of goods] will go up. I am worried because my daughter hasn't finished her school [education]. It's only halfway. Also this is the time of a pandemic.\"\nHousewife Than Than Nyunt was also worried that the price of goods would rise and \"people will revolt\", adding: \"I hope that Aung San Suu Kyi and her colleagues will be freed sooner rather than later.\"\nThe fears are real if this coup means a return to the kind of life under the military rule of the 1990s and 2000s.\nThe military had staged a bloody coup in 1988, with thousands dying as a student-led uprising against a Soviet-style one-party rule was put down.\nMs Suu Kyi rose to prominence at the time and battled military rule and human rights abuses for two decades, after the military had refused to accept her election win of 1990.\nLife was punctuated by corruption, fluctuating prices, repression of daily life, chronic malnourishment in some areas and ethnic strife in others. Many are now concerned about what will come next.\n\"We are currently trying to tell ourselves that we will move on because we've moved on from worse before,\" the 25-year-old in Yangon told the BBC. \"But I wish we didn't have to do that, I wish we didn't have to tell ourselves to be strong.\"\nSome military supporters, however, celebrated the coup, parading through the city blasting patriotic music. \nGriffin Hotchkiss, an American expat who has lived in Myanmar for about six years, said he saw a \"caravan of pro-military civilians blasting loud music and 'celebrating' - while people (whom I know to be NLD supporters) on my street were visibly angry\".\nSome were surprised that the immediate fallout was not more extreme.\nOn a trip into Yangon, Mr Hotchkiss said that \"besides some army vehicles in the City Hall compound nothing looked out of the ordinary\".\nLater in the day, Mr Hotchkiss noticed that while there were \"far fewer people\", many shops appeared to be open and doing business.\nMichael Ghilezan, who lives in Yangon with his Burmese wife, said he had \"expected to see people marching down the streets in protests, and military vehicles stationed around the city. But none of that happened\"."

      "text": "More lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlier at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the health minister has said, looking back with hindsight.\nVaughan Gething made the admission while talking about the pressure faced by policy makers dealing with Covid-19.\nBut he also said he believes decisions were correct based on the information available at the time.\nThere have been 4,775 deaths with Covid-19 in Wales since March 2020.\nThere have also been 192,912 positive cases recorded. \nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said objections were raised to decisions taken at the start of the pandemic.\nWales went into its first lockdown on 23 March and the Welsh Government came under fire early on for the speed of care home testing, as well as contact tracing.\n\"Looking back, if we had the opportunity to do this all again, we would have made different choices on borders definitely,\" Mr Gething said. \n\"We would almost certainly have entered lockdown a week or two earlier, and we would have probably saved more lives if we had done that.\n\"I think that actually on the really big and serious choices we have learned lots. \n\"So if we have the knowledge we have now I would definitely have made different choices at various points in the pandemic. \n\"We'd have been able to get a jump-start on our testing capacity. \n\"We'd have been able to make different choices about testing around care homes earlier. \n\"We did manage to get ourselves into a good position on PPE so we never ran out, but it was really tight at various points in time.\"\nHe said the Welsh Government's scientific advisors all agreed the advice given at the time was the correct advice based on the information they had.\nHowever, if they had the information they now possess, the advice would have been different. \nMr Gething admitted being at the sharp end of decision-making at such a critical time had taken its toll.\n\"If you're having conversation with needing to plan for the potential for mass burial as we were at the start of the pandemic, then you know that really sobers you up very quickly about the scale and the enormity of the challenge we're facing,\" he said. \n\"I never really thought that I would have to make decisions that have this sort of consequence. \n\"We often talk about making life and death decisions but actually the choices we make have an impact on the whole population.\"\n\"During the pandemic making the right choice can mean that you're saving lots of lives, and making a different choice means that you can end up thinking that, that choice I made may not have been the right one. \n\"So there's an awful lot more pressure. \n\"We've lost well over 4,000 Welsh citizens to the pandemic. But it could have been much, much worse. \n\"Without the action we have taken I'm confident that we'd have lost more people.\"\nThe Welsh Government had received praise over its slower approach to easing lockdown restrictions than England but drew criticism in other areas such as easing restrictions too quickly after November's firebreak.\nIt was also criticised early into the vaccine rollout because of its pace, but the vaccination rate is now higher than other parts of the UK, and 416,306 first doses have been given. \n\"To make decisions in government has been an extraordinary period of time as well and you learn not just by getting things right,\" said Mr Gething.\n\"You also learn by making mistakes as well.\"\nAs well as mistakes on decisions during the pandemic, Mr Gething has also faced a couple of difficult personal moments including being accused by a newspaper of breaking lockdown rules when he ate chips on a park bench with his family.\nHe also came under fire while grappling with new online meetings when he left his microphone on and was caught swearing about a Labour colleague.\n\"We shouldn't try to pretend that everything has been perfect,\" Mr Gething said about the Welsh Government's overall response to the pandemic. \n\"But no one's had to do this before. I just think that sort of honesty is really important for people.\"\nIn response to the interview, Mr Price tweeted: \"Being too slow into lockdown and coming out of the firebreak without a gradual approach has undoubtedly cost lives.\n\"Early abandonment of test and trace and the failure to test properly in care homes were avoidable and costly mistakes.\n\"It's not enough to argue, as the PM does, that government acted on the best evidence at the time, as many of us raised objections to these policies at the time.\"\nYour story\nTravel is currently limited to essential purposes in Wales, such as for work and caring responsibilities, and international travel is barred.\nBut, after a tough year with the pandemic, many people will be dreaming about a holiday in 2021. \nWhile bookings for UK staycations are \"coming in thick and fast\", some people are gambling on a foreign trip in the hope restrictions will ease later this year. \nUse this form to tell us about your plans. \nIn some cases your comments will be published, displaying your name and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

on 16 April 2020 - Captain Tom, as he had become affectionately known, had raised more than \u00a312m for NHS Charities Together.\nIn 2007, he had moved from Kent to Bedfordshire to be with his youngest daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, and her family.\nIt was here, in Marston Moretaine, that the idea of raising relatively modest funds for a charity supporting the NHS was hatched.\nCapt Sir Tom began walking - planning on 10 laps at a time of the 25-metre (82ft) loop in his back garden - and the donations began mounting up.\nEvery million was another milestone, but the veteran, who became a well-known face on national television, took it all in his stride.\nEver modest about the challenge he had set himself, Capt Sir Tom was nevertheless astounded by the generosity of donors, describing it as \"completely out of this world\".\n\"It's all for the sake of the nurses and the NHS we have, because they are doing such a magnificent job,\" he said at the time.\n\"Every penny that we get, they deserve every one of it.\"\nHe was described as a \"one-man fundraising machine\" by the Duke of Cambridge, while both the prime minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Capt Sir Tom was \"an inspiration\" to everyone.\nNot only did his efforts encourage thousands to donate to the fundraising appeal, but he inspired many to join his campaign to raise both awareness and money for those working in, and supporting, the NHS.\nFrom a teenage girl learning to walk again on a treadmill as part of her recovery from a stroke, to a non-verbal boy with autism - who wrote \"He is a hero to us,\" as he embarked on his own challenge to walk for the NHS - people set themselves their own challenges, buoyed by the former soldier.\nAge, it seemed, was no barrier - as Capt Sir Tom was proving.\nDozens dusted off their own walking frames and took to the streets to prove they could play their own part in the drive to raise funds.\nOne woman completed a marathon by walking laps near her Berkshire home, at the age of 104.\n\"Tom, I've done it,\" she laughed, as she finished her challenge.\nA week before his 100th birthday, Capt Sir Tom became the oldest person ever to get to number one in the UK singles charts when his duet of You'll Never Walk Alone - with singer Michael Ball - took the top spot.\nHis 100th birthday on 30 April 2020 was marked with an RAF flypast, personal birthday greetings from the Queen and prime minister, and he was made an honorary colonel of the British Army.\n\"I'm still Captain Tom, that's who I really am but if people choose to call me colonel, well, thank you very much,\" he replied.\nThe following month it was announced he would be awarded a knighthood for his fundraising efforts and would be known as Captain Sir Thomas Moore \"under Ministry of Defence protocol\".\nOn 17 July 2020, he was knighted in the grounds of Windsor Castle, in the Queen's first official engagement in person since the lockdown period began in March.\nHis youngest daughter said at the time of his fundraising efforts that her father had become a \"beacon of hope\" during challenging times.\nAnd indeed, Capt Sir Tom always seemed to know just the right thing to say to buoy the nation's spirits as the public tried to abide by government regulations to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"To all those people who are finding it difficult at the moment, the sun will shine on you again, and the clouds will go away,\" he said.\n\"Tomorrow will be a good day\" - another example of his positivity - became a hashtag on social media posts.\nThe proud Yorkshireman completed his 100 laps of his garden live on television in April 2020, with a Guard of Honour from 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment and a rousing round of applause from his family.\nBy the time he closed his fundraising page at midnight on his 100th birthday, Capt Sir Tom had raised \u00a332,794,701 for charities supporting the NHS, from more than one-and-a-half-million global donors.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

Asked how many bullets were fired, a police official replied: \"Too many to count.\"\nThe gunfight took place at an upscale gated community north of Miami.\nThe FBI said two of the agents had been transported to hospital and were in a stable condition. The third injured agent did not require hospital.\nAccording to the Miami Herald, the suspect was barricaded inside a home for several hours before shooting and killing himself.\nThe shooting took place at the Water Terrace apartment complex, about 10 miles (16km) north-west of Fort Lauderdale. The luxury community features a gym, pool, spa and tennis courts, according to their website.\n\"In accordance with FBI policy, the shooting incident is under investigation by the FBI's Inspection Division,\" the FBI said in a statement. \"The review process is thorough and objective and is conducted as expeditiously as possible under the circumstances.\"\nFBI Director Christopher Wray identified the two agents as Dan Alfin and Laura Schwartzenberger, who both worked for years to combat child pornography in Florida.\n\"Special Agent Alfin and Special Agent Schwartzenberger exemplified heroism today in defence of their country,\" he said. \"The FBI will always honour their ultimate sacrifice and will be forever grateful for their bravery.\"\nThe Sunrise Police Department closed down multiple roads in the area, urging local residents to stay indoors due to the \"ongoing investigation\".\nSunrise Police spokeswoman Otishia Browning-Smith said \"there were too many [shots] to count.\"\nJulius McLymont, a resident of the complex, told the Associated Press that he heard the gunfight begin with an initial volley of four shots. He first thought it may have been a car backfiring until about two minutes later about five more shots rang out.\nMr McLymont said he saw officers in Swat gear loading an injured person onto an ambulance as more emergency crews arrived."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Universities in the UK,Universities,Students",
      "text": "The interest on student loans in England should be scrapped for 15 months, a group of universities says.\nThe vice-chancellors of seven universities say this would cover the period from the first national lockdown until summer 2021. \nThey say waiving the charge would ease the pressure on graduates.\nBut the government said such a move would not help students in need amid the coronavirus pandemic as it announced a boost to hardship funding.\nUniversities minister Michelle Donelan said the vice-chancellors' proposal wouldn't put cash into students' pockets to support them during the pandemic.\nShe told BBC Breakfast that \"at least half of students don't actually pay back their student loan\", adding that the government's priority was helping \"those students most in need\".\nThe government has announced an extra \u00a350m for student hardship funds in England, on top of \u00a320m agreed in December.\nIn a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, the vice-chancellors say students are paying a heavy price in the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"The opportunity and wealth gap between the young and old is already unacceptably large - and existing challenges are being amplified by the impact of the pandemic on students and their life chances,\" the letter says.\nIt says the pandemic has placed \"unprecedented pressures on our students\", with demands for hardship funds increasing by over 100% in some universities.\nThe letter is signed by seven vice-chancellors:\nThey call for a reduction equivalent to waiving the interest rate on student loans for the 15 months from the first national lockdown in March 2020 to the end of this academic year.\nIn England students are currently charged 5.6% on their student loans while they are studying,  based on the retail price index, plus 3% - this applies until the 5 April after they graduate and then varies depending on earnings.\nThe letter comes as the government says students facing financial pressures due to the pandemic will have access to an additional \u00a350m support fund.\nMs Donelan said: \"We know that the pandemic, and the implications of the pandemic, has put extra pressure on students' finances.\"\nUniversities will be able to use the extra funding to help students facing loss of employment, additional costs for alternative accommodation or to support access to remote teaching amid Covid-19.\nThe majority of university students in England have been told not to return to campus under the latest lockdown, sparking calls for rent rebates for term-time accommodation, and for tuition fee refunds.\nIn December, the government announced a one-off fund of up to \u00a320m to help students most in need of support in exceptional circumstances - this further \u00a350m takes the total to \u00a370m for this financial year.\nThe funding will be distributed by the Office for Students (OfS) directly to universities, which will prioritise the students most in need.\nLast week, a survey from the Office for National Statistics suggested that a growing proportion of university students were not happy with their academic experience - and nearly two in three had seen their mental health worsen.\nThe University and College Union general secretary, Jo Grady, described the funding as a \"sticking plaster\".\n\"The government needs to go further and provide proper funding to avoid irreparable long-term damage to the sector's reputation,\" she said.\nAlistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said the additional funding was a \"positive step\", but added: \"As the serious mental health impact of the pandemic continues to be felt, universities need further funding to alleviate the substantial increases in demand that university wellbeing and support services are experiencing.\"\nNicola Dandridge, chief executive of the OfS, said the funding was welcome.\n\"We intend to distribute it as swiftly as possible to benefit those who are most in need,\" she said.\nThe independent consultancy London Economics (LE)  looked just at first year undergraduates, from England,  studying across the UK.\nThe cost of writing off their interest, for that one cohort, for this academic year is estimated at roughly \u00a333m, or a 0.3% increase in the cost to the government of funding this cohort.\nMaike Halterbeck, associate director at LE and a specialist in higher education fees and funding, said not much would be gained for students. \n\"In spite of its apparent attractiveness, this proposal wouldn't provide any benefit to the average graduate. \n\"Only the highest earning - predominantly male - graduates would derive a small benefit of a few hundred pounds. It would not affect female graduates, or lower earning male graduates\""

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio issued an order restricting non-essential travel from 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Monday, and closing public schools on Tuesday.\nNew York state Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York City as well as 44 other counties.\n\"This is a dangerous situation,\" he said in a press conference on Monday. \"A life-threatening-situation. Expect closures. It's going to get very bad very quickly.\"\nIn New Jersey, Governor Philip Murphy suspended the state's bus and rail operations on Monday. His emergency order allows authorities to shut roads and evacuate homes.\nMore than 1,600 flights have been cancelled at major airports in the storm's path, including Newark Liberty International Airport, John F Kennedy Airport, and Philadelphia International Airport. At New York's La Guardia Airport, all flights were suspended as of Monday morning. \nThe storm has also halted vaccine distribution in Connecticut, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Philadelphia, parts of Washington, DC and the New York area. \nIn New York City vaccinations will be cancelled through to Tuesday, as Mayor de Blasio has said it is \"not safe\" for older residents to go outside in the blizzard conditions. \n\"We're in a local state of emergency,\" Mr de Blasio said at a news conference. \"I'm fearful that this tough situation we have now could get worse.\"\nSnow hit the west coast last week, with some parts of California experiencing more than 6ft (2m) of snowfall.\nIn Washington DC, many have enjoyed the snow in front of the capital's iconic landmarks.

      "text": "Gyms and leisure centres will be reopened as soon as possible when lockdown is eased amid concerns about mental health, a minister has said.\nGyms and leisure centres were among the last businesses to open their doors following the first lockdown last year.\nMental Health Minister Eluned Morgan said she was concerned about the impact of the closures on people's well-being.\nHowever, a Welsh Government advisory group has warned the risk of \"superspreading\" in gyms was high.\nWales is set to remain under level four \"stay home\" restrictions - the highest level of measures - for at least another three weeks.\nThe Welsh Government has not hinted when measures could be eased but has said reopening schools remained its priority.\nPreviously a number of gym owners had called for fitness facilities to be classed as \"essential services\" saying they were important for people's physical and mental health.\nAt the Welsh Government Covid briefing on Tuesday Ms Morgan said: \"We recognise the amazing difference that keeping fit can have on someone's mental health and that's why we were really reluctant to close down gyms.\n\"That's why, when we reopen, it will be one of the first things which we will try and consider... gyms are very much in the early opening areas we would like to focus on.\"\nBefore the pandemic, going to the gym was a big part of Dan McTiffen's life.\nOver the last few months he has been trying to train in the kitchen while his daughter has been eating her breakfast.\n\"Last year me and my partner would get up, it was light and warmer and we would train outside, but now it is raining, and pitch black - it's a different kettle of fish,\" he said.\nMr McTiffen said he would book a class immediately when his gym - Ion in Cardiff - reopened, as he felt safe due to the measures in place.\n\"I'm a better father, I'm better professionally, I feel like I've achieved something that day when I train,\" he said.\nWales rugby player and yoga teacher Alecs Donovan set up her own yoga studio in Cardiff just weeks before the first lockdown, and then had to close its doors.\n\"I am always so busy, but on the first day of lockdown I realised I didn't have anything to get up for,\" she said.\nMs Donovan, who runs the Yoga Hub, started online classes and although their popularity has grown, she said some people missed being able to go classes in a quiet space and see friends.\n\"It has been really hard, our lifestyles have changed dramatically, so many people are struggling mentally and physically at the moment,\" said Ms Donovan.\n\"It is worrying, some of the most positive people have hit a low - exercise makes such a difference, even if it's just being able to go once a week.\"\nFitness coach and GB athlete Emma Howells Davies said with events cancelled and months of home schooling, trying to train was difficult.\nShe said reopening spaces for people to exercise with others, even outside, could be significant in helping people with their mental health.\n\"When you are feeling really low to get off the sofa is really hard, but if you have a class to go to and see people it really helps,\" said the coach.\nMs Howell Davies said she was looking forward to the day she could see clients face-to-face again, and hoped measures would be eased for outdoor activities soon.\n\"We need to make it easy for people to exercise, but the longer we are stuck like this, the harder it will be to get back into good habits,\" she said.\nFitness facilities were among the last businesses allowed to reopen in Wales after closing at the end of March, with strict measures in place.\nAfter being open for two months, they closed again, as a 17-day national \"firebreak\" lockdown began. Days before Christmas they shut once more as current restrictions came into force.\nIn January, the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Group said while all fitness facilities were different, the risk was high due to people being in enclosed spaces while exercising and sharing equipment.\nThe group said while case rates were high, the risk posed by superspreading events was \"beyond acceptable levels\".\nIt added when rates had lowered, \"reduced occupancy combined with maximised ventilation\" would be important in gyms.\nUnder level four restrictions people can only exercise with one other person outside their household or bubble.\nUnder the alert level framework, level three should see non-essential stores, beauty salons, gyms and swimming pools reopen.\nExercise rules could also be eased to allow up to 30 people to exercise together outdoors in organised activities, and up to 15 people indoors.\nTravel is currently limited to essential purposes in Wales, such as for work and caring responsibilities, and international travel is barred.\nBut, after a tough year with the pandemic, many people will be dreaming about a holiday in 2021. \nWhile bookings for UK staycations are \"coming in thick and fast\", some people are gambling on a foreign trip in the hope restrictions will ease later this year. \nUse this form to tell us about your plans. \nIn some cases your comments will be published, displaying your name and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "France,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The French health authority has said AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine should only be given to people aged under 65. \nIt is the latest recommendation from an EU member state approving the jab with such restrictions, citing insufficient data on its efficacy for older people.\nThe EU drugs regulator has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults, but it is up to each member to set its own rollout policy.\nGermany and Austria have already recommended it be limited to under-65s.\nThere has been criticism of the slow pace of vaccinations in the EU and the campaign has been hit by delays to deliveries of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines, among others.\nThe European Commission - the EU executive - was caught up in a row with AstraZeneca last week, after the company said it could not supply the expected doses on time.\nThe president of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in particular, has been under fire for her own handling of the rollout, but she defended her stance on Tuesday. \"I am convinced that the European strategy on vaccination is the right one,\" she told France's Le Monde. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel also backed the EU's approach in a TV interview.\nThe health regulator said there was still not enough data about the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine for patients over 65 years of age.\n\"These data will arrive in the coming weeks. In the meantime we recommend its use for people under 65 years old,\" it said.  It recommended the vaccine for health workers and vulnerable people between the ages of 50 and 65.\nMore than 1.5 million people have received a Covid vaccine so far in France. In the UK, which has a similar population, more than 10 million doses have been given.\nEuropean Affairs Minister Cl\u00e9ment Beaune told French radio on Monday that the British were \"taking a lot of risks in this vaccination campaign\" by spacing delays between two injections.\n\"Here scientists say we shouldn't do this,\" he added. UK health officials have defended the plan, despite criticism.\nLast week Germany's vaccine commission said it could not recommend the use of the jab in people aged over 65.\nOn Tuesday health authorities in Sweden and Poland made similar announcements and Belgium's health minister said the vaccine, for the moment, would only be given to people below the age of 55. Italy's medicines agency on Saturday also approved the jab for all adults under 55.\nScientists at Oxford University, meanwhile, have said the vaccine could lead to a \"substantial\" fall in the spread of the virus, in a study yet to be formally published. \nIndividual EU countries are free to decide who vaccines should be given to once they have been approved at EU level. \nIn her TV interview on Tuesday, the German chancellor said \"every vaccine is welcome in the European Union\", adding that good data had emerged for the Russian Sputnik V vaccine.\nIn her interview with Le Monde, Ursula von der Leyen admitted that the EU had made missteps.\n\"When you make urgent decisions - and in this year of crisis we've taken around 900 - there's always the chance of missing something,\" she said.\nBut she said 18 million vaccine doses had been delivered across the EU so far and many more would follow over the next two months. \"We are on the right track,\" she said.\nMs van der Leyen also implied that the UK's early success in its vaccination programme came as the result of readiness to compromise on safety standards.\nCountries which started vaccinating people ahead of the EU \"resorted to emergency authorisation procedures\", she said. \n\"The commission and member states agreed not to compromise on safety and efficacy requirements.\"\nBritain has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme for weeks.\nUK health officials say it is safe and provides \"high levels of protection\" for all ages. Research has shown it is highly effective.\nNo-one who received the Oxford vaccine in trials was hospitalised or became seriously ill due to Covid.\nThe vaccine is given via two injections to the arm, the second between 4 and 12 weeks after the first.\nWhen it approved it last week, the EU's European Medicines Agency (EMA) noted that most participants in test studies were under 55 years of age.\nIt said that while there were not yet enough results to show how well the vaccine will work in older people, \"protection is expected, given that an immune response is seen in this age group and based on experience with other vaccines\".\nAstraZeneca has said a US study will shortly provide additional data on the vaccine's efficacy in older adults.

      "text": "Checks on animal and food products at Larne and Belfast ports have been suspended amid concerns for staff safety.\nThe Department of Agriculture said this was pending talks with the PSNI. \nThis comes after Mid and East Antrim Council withdrew staff from Brexit inspection duties at Larne Port over security concerns.\nGraffiti opposing the Irish Sea border has been painted in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in recent days.\nThe mayor of Larne, the DUP's Peter Johnston, said the council decision had been taken due to \"menacing behaviour\" referencing growing tensions over the NI Protocol.\nThe BBC understands the PSNI is due to meet Mid and East Antrim council and officials from  Stormont's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) on Tuesday morning to  discuss the threats to workers at Larne and Belfast ports. \nThe Northern Ireland Executive will also discuss the latest developments.\nPolice said they have increased patrols at Larne port and other \"points of entry\".\n\"The safety of staff working at points of entry is of the utmost importance to us,\" the PSNI tweeted.\n\"Where we have credible information we will share that with our partners and take appropriate action.\"\nThe BBC has asked the EU for comment on the withdrawal of staff and security fears.\nIn its statement the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said: \"On the basis of information received today and, pending further discussions with the PSNI, Daera has decided in the interests of the wellbeing of staff to temporarily suspend physical inspections of products of animal origin at Larne and Belfast. \n\"The situation will be kept under review and in the meantime full documentary checks will continue to be carried out as usual.\"\nChecks on animals and food products containing meat, fish, dairy or eggs are among those affected.\nAgriculture Minister Edwin Poots said he had taken the decision to withdraw staff from the ports following consultation with staff.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said she \"utterly condemned\" the threats.\nSpeaking on UTV, she said: \"I think it is utterly reprehensible that anyone who is going to their place of work should be threatened in this way.\"\nMrs Foster said she was on the phone with UK minister Michael Gove when she was told of the council's decision.\n\"I was able to inform him of the development this evening,\" she said, adding that the way to deal with the NI Protocol was through \"constitutional politics\". \nEarlier on Monday evening, Larne mayor Peter Johnston told a council meeting that staff assisting with checks had raised concerns about \"suspicious activity\".\n\"We have no option but to withdraw them [staff] in order to fulfil our duty of care,\" said Mr Johnston.\nHe added that he would write to Mr Poots, who holds responsibility over the issue, to make him aware of the decision.\nIn a statement, the council said there had been an \"upsurge in sinister behaviour\" in recent weeks, including graffiti describing port staff as \"targets\", and what appeared to be attempts to gather workers' personal information, including vehicle registration plates. \nThe council said it will carry out a full risk assessment with the PSNI, Food Standards Agency and Daera.\nBefore council's decision on Monday, there were 12 environmental health officers working at Larne Port, as well as several senior council officers.\nSinn F\u00e9in's group party leader, councillor James McKeown, said staff would only return when it was safe. \n\"There are simmering tensions within the local community at present and we will not stand by and let our staff be targeted when they are just doing their jobs.\"\nSDLP councillor Eugene Reid said leaders had fallen short: \"The language used and tone of the discussion relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol has raised tensions and whipped up fear. \n\"It should be the role of all leaders to extract the poison from public dialogue, and I'm challenging everyone to do that.\"\nEast Antrim Sammy Wilson said the NI Protocol has to go - \"but politics is the way\". \nHe said staff safety was paramount. \"All threats must be condemned and cross party support for withdrawal is welcome. \n\"Those parties who talked up the threat of violence during the negotiations need to reflect. \nBorder Control Posts (BCPs) were built at Larne harbour, and two other facilities in NI as a consequence of Brexit. \nThey are facilities for inspecting food and live animals when they arrive from other parts of the UK.\nAt the end of the Brexit transition on 1 January 2021, Northern Ireland remained in the single market for goods.\nThe rest of the UK did not, so some products entering Northern Ireland from GB must be checked on entry.\nThe EU has particularly strict rules on food and animals, requiring all those products to enter through a BCP.\nVictor Chestnutt, the President of the Ulster Farmers' Union, said he was concerned that the supply of food may be affected by the suspension of checks.\nHe told BBC News NI: \"Some of our food companies bring in ingredients from the UK mainland. If they needed checks and those checks are not done, is that going to be held at the port or is that going to be released?\n\"Trade needs to flow and flow freely. If we see more delays, it will add more cost and more problems.\""

      "text": "Marilyn Manson has been dropped by his record label following claims by actress Evan Rachel Wood that she was \"horrifically abused\" by the musician.\nLoma Vista Recordings said it would no longer be working with Manson and would cease promoting his latest album \"effective immediately\".\nManson has denied the allegations, saying they are \"horrible distortions of reality\".\nHis guest appearance in Starz drama American Gods will also be removed.\nManson was due to be seen in an upcoming episode but the US TV network Starz said in a statement: \"Due to the allegations made against Marilyn Manson, we have decided to remove his performance from the remaining episode he is in, scheduled to air later this season. Starz stands unequivocally with all victims and survivors of abuse.\"\nThe singer's most recent album released through Loma Vista was last year's We Are Chaos, which reached number seven in the UK charts and eight in the US.\nManson began working with Loma Vista in 2015 for his record The Pale Emperor.\nOn Monday, Wood claimed Manson had \"horrifically abused\" her during their three-year relationship in the late noughties.\nManson and Wood began dating in 2007 and got engaged in 2010, but broke up later that year.\nWood has previously said that she is a survivor of rape and domestic abuse, without naming the person accused.\nIn an Instagram post, she alleged: \"The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson.\n\"He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.\"\nShe added: \"I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.\"\nManson responded to the allegations in his own Instagram post on Monday evening, saying: \"Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.\n\"My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how - and why - others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth,\" he added.\nSeveral other women came forward via social media platforms on Monday to make similar statements accusing Manson of abuse.\nOn Tuesday, Wood posted an image of a letter written by Californian senator Susan Rubio to Monty Wilkinson, the acting US Attorney General, requesting that \"the US Department of Justice meet with the alleged victims immediately and investigate these accusations\".\nWood has previously referred to being raped and abused in interviews and on social media and in 2019 she created the Phoenix Act, which extends the statute of limitations on domestic violence from three years to five. \nThe bill was signed into law by California governor Gavin Newsom in October 2019, and took effect in January 2020. \nAt the time, Wood testified to Congress that her abuser had hidden an addiction to drugs and alcohol from her, and \"had bouts of extreme jealousy, which would often result in him wrecking our home, cornering me in a room, and threatening me\".\nA representative for Manson has previously said it would be \"inappropriate to comment\" on personal testimony.\nWood, 33, is known for roles in films such as The Wrestler and The Ides of March. She has voiced characters in films such as Frozen II and Asterix and the Vikings.\nShe is best known for portraying sentient android Dolores Abernathy in the HBO series Westworld, a role she has played since 2016.\nManson, 52, has released 11 studio albums since 1994, three of which have reached the top 10 in the UK.\nHis biggest hit single was a cover of Tainted Love, which reached number five in 2001.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, you can access support via BBC Action Line.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is \"optimistic\" people will be able to have summer holidays this year - but it depends on certain things going well.\nAsked about tourism in the UK, he said he did not want to give \"concrete\" dates for such trips but would set out more details on 22 February.\nThe success of the vaccine rollout and level of Covid cases would be factors taken into consideration, he added.\nNearly 9.3 million people in the UK have had their first dose of a vaccine.\nA vaccine has been offered to all older residents at eligible care homes in England, the NHS announced earlier - an achievement Mr Johnson described as a \"crucial milestone\".\nThe government is aiming to offer all care home residents and carers, people over 70 and frontline care workers a vaccination by mid-February. \nFigures released on Monday show a further 18,607 Covid cases have been recorded. There have also been a further 406 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMr Johnson, speaking during a visit to Batley, West Yorkshire, said: \"I don't want to give too much concrete by way of dates for our summer holidays. I am optimistic - I understand the reasons for being optimistic - but some things have got to go right.\n\"The vaccine programme has got to continue to be successful. \n\"We have got to make sure we don't get thrown off course by new variants, we have got to make sure that we continue to keep the disease under control and the level of infections come down.\"\nHe added that once he gives more details in the last week of February \"people should certainly be able to plan on that basis\".\nHis comments come after Health Secretary Matt Hancock predicted \"a happy and free Great British summer\".\nMeanwhile, the government has announced it is to carry out urgent door-to-door testing in parts of England for a new variant of coronavirus originally identified in South Africa, after cases were found with no known links to travel or previous cases.\nAll of the UK is currently under a lockdown, with people only allowed to travel abroad for essential purposes; such as work that cannot be done from home, medical appointments or educational reasons. These are the same \"reasonable excuses\" that apply to domestic travel.\nMr Johnson said there were signs the lockdown measures were working but it was too early to \"take your foot off the throat of the beast\" by easing restrictions.\n\"We are starting to see some signs of a flattening and maybe even a falling off of infection rates and hospitalisations,\" he said.\n\"But don't forget that they are still at a very high level by comparison with most points in the last 12 months, a really very high level.\"\nRules around international travel were tightened last month, meaning all travellers must self-isolate for 10 days when they return to the UK, while people returning to England from high-risk countries will have to quarantine in government-provided hotels.\nPeople leaving England will soon have to make a declaration on why they need to travel, which will be checked by carriers prior to departure, Home Secretary Priti Patel has announced.\nSome UK holiday providers have since reported a boom in domestic bookings for this summer.\nThe boss of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, said he is expecting \"a strong return\" for European beach holidays this summer thanks to the vaccination programme.\nDr Mike Tildesley, an infectious disease expert who advises the government, suggested that if the UK continued the current pace of vaccinations - and jabs were shown to prevent transmission, not just severe infection - measures could begin to be eased from March.\n\"We need to be very careful,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme . \"Hopefully by the summer we can get back to something pretty close to what we have seen before the pandemic as normal.\"\nVaccines would need to be \"pretty good\" at blocking transmission \"to avoid a resurgence\" of the virus when measures are eased, Dr Tildesley added, with research due on this over the next month.\nThe UK government announced on Monday that it had ordered an extra 40 million doses of a vaccine from the French pharmaceutical company Valneva, that should become available later in the year and into 2022.\nThat takes the total number of different vaccines the UK has secured to 407 million doses - more than enough for the entire population.\nHowever, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was too soon to say when \"surplus\" vaccine doses could be donated to other counties, such as European Union member states.\nHe said the priority remained getting the vaccine to the most vulnerable in society by the spring.\nIn other developments:"

      "tags": "Russia,Alexei Navalny,Vladimir Putin",
      "text": "A Moscow court has jailed Putin critic Alexei Navalny for three-and-a-half years for violating the conditions of a suspended sentence.\nHe has been in detention since returning to Russia last month. He was treated in Germany for a near-fatal nerve agent attack on him in August. \nThere have been violent scenes in Moscow - video on social media show police beating and arresting protesters who came out to support Mr Navalny.\nThousands have rallied across Russia.\nMr Navalny's suspended sentence for embezzlement has been converted into a jail term. He has already served a year under house arrest which will be deducted from the total.\nMr Navalny greeted the news with a resigned shrug, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow reports. In court he called President Vladimir Putin a \"poisoner\", blaming him for the attack.\nHis supporters called for an immediate protest, and hundreds gathered in central Moscow and St Petersburg despite a heavy police presence. More than 850 have been detained in Moscow alone, according to monitors.\nMr Navalny's lawyer said they would appeal against Tuesday's ruling.\nOn Tuesday night, security forces \"took\" the centre of Moscow, arrest-squads deployed in vast numbers to all the main roads and squares. \nIn body armours and helmets, they formed long lines beneath the multicoloured street lights still hanging up from New Year. Protesters were massively outnumbered. \nThe official show of force was like a postscript to the message sent by imprisoning Alexei Navalny: the Kremlin is fully ready to crush those who challenge its authority. \nBut Mr Navalny's supporters refuse to be silent. \nHundreds were detained tonight, and judging by the honking car horns in central Moscow - a new phenomenon - many more people are angered by what happened on Tuesday, than those ready to risk taking to the streets in open protest.\nStrong international reaction to the sentence came quickly, with the Council of Europe - the continent's leading human rights body - saying the judgement \"defied all credibility\".\n\"With this decision, the Russian authorities not only further exacerbate human rights violations as already established by the European Court of Human Rights, they also send a signal undermining the protection of the rights of all Russian citizens,\" said the council's human rights commissioner, Dunja Mijatovic, in a statement.\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described the ruling as \"perverse\", and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the verdict was a \"bitter blow to firmly established civil liberties and the rule of law\".\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for Mr Navalny's immediate and unconditional release, and said he would work closely with allies to hold Russia accountable for \"failing to uphold the rights of its citizens\".\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova responded by telling Western countries to focus on their own problems.\n\"You should not interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state,\" she said on Russian TV.\nMr Navalny has been accused of breaking the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence for embezzlement that required him to report regularly to Russian police. His lawyers say the accusation is absurd as the authorities knew he was recovering in Berlin from the nerve agent attack that nearly killed him in Russia.\nAddressing the court before the sentencing, Mr Navalny said the case was being used to frighten the opposition: \"This is how it works: they send one to jail to intimidate millions.\" \nOn the Novichok chemical attack, he said: \"Using the FSB [Federal Security Service of Russia], Putin attempted to commit murder. I'm not the only one - many know this already and many others will. And this is driving the thieving little man in the bunker crazy.\n\"No matter how much he tries to look like a geopolitician, he took offence at me because he will go down in history as a poisoner.\"\nMr Navalny's return to Russia on 17 January triggered mass protests in support of him, many of them young Russians who have only ever experienced President Putin's rule. \nThe Kremlin has denied any involvement in the attack on him, and rejects the conclusion by Western experts that Novichok - a Russian chemical weapon - was used.\nMr Navalny accuses Mr Putin of running an administration riddled with corruption, and recently released a YouTube video featuring an opulent Black Sea palace which, he alleged, was a Russian billionaires' gift to the president. More than 100 million people have watched the video.\nOn Saturday Arkady Rotenberg, a billionaire businessman close to Mr Putin, said he owned the palace and had bought it two years ago.\nBut on Sunday some protesters brandished gold-coloured toilet brushes, a symbol of their anger about the palace. For a second weekend, crowds defied bitter cold and a massive deployment of riot police, and more than 5,000 were arrested, according to OVD-Info group.\nOVD-Info says it is an independent Russian media project, which gets crowdfunding in Russia and its donors include the Memorial human rights group and the European Commission.\nMr Navalny is already serving a 30-day sentence in connection with the embezzlement case, which he denounces as politically motivated.\nIn recent days police have arrested many of Mr Navalny's top aides, who assist him in his Anti-Corruption Network (FBK).

      "text": "Covid-19 was involved in 41.5% of all deaths in Wales in the latest week - the highest proportion in the pandemic.\nIt was also by far the worst week for deaths in north Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures.\nThree quarters of the region's 102 deaths were in Wrexham and Flintshire, Covid-19 hotspots in recent weeks.\nMeanwhile, Covid deaths in care homes were also at their highest weekly number.\nThe ONS figures show there were 447 deaths involving Covid-19 across Wales for the week ending 22 January.\nThis is 20 fewer than last week, which was the highest recorded during any week of the pandemic.\nIt was still the third highest total registered during the pandemic but the first time the weekly total has fallen since 4 December.\nThe total number of deaths occurring involving Covid-19 in Wales has now risen to 6,473 people.\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board area in north Wales - with 102 deaths - had by far its worst week for deaths in the pandemic, with 75% in north east Wales.\nThey included 47 deaths in hospitals and 40 in care homes in the health board area.\nThere were 25 deaths involving Wrexham care home residents and 17 in hospital in the area.\nThere were also 20 hospital deaths involving Flintshire residents.\nThe Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area saw 78 deaths. These included 20 deaths in hospital and 19 of care home residents in Bridgend. There were 18 more hospitals deaths in Rhondda Cynon Taf and five in Merthyr Tydfil.\nThere were also 29 hospital deaths in Cardiff, 25 involving Caerphilly residents and 24 in Swansea.\nAll counties recorded at least one death involving Covid-19.\nThe total number of deaths involving Covid in Wales, up to and registered by 22 January, was 6,330 people. When deaths registered over the following few days are counted, there is a total of 6,473.\nRCT, with 802 deaths, has the largest number of Covid-19 deaths occurring in Wales, followed by Cardiff with 708 up to the latest week. \nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, continue to be above the five-year average.\nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing.\nIn Wales, the number of deaths from all causes fell again from 1,170 to 1,077, but it was still 265 deaths (32.6%) above the five-year average for the week.\nWhen this is added up, the number of deaths from all causes from 3 January 2020 and up to 22 January 2021 was 41,238, which is 4,962 more than the five-year average. \nOf these, 6,330 deaths (15.3%) mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. When deaths occurring up to 22 January but counting registrations in the week or so after, the total is 6,473.\nThere has also been the highest number of weekly deaths in care homes involving Covid-19 in Wales - 129. \nThis brings a total of 1,396 Covid-19 deaths in care homes up to 22 January, making up 22% of all coronavirus deaths in Wales.\nOlder People's Commissioner for Wales Hel\u00e9na Herklots said she was \"deeply concerned\" and that the deaths represented \"heartbreak and loss\" for families and friends. \n\"It is crucial that care homes continue to work with local public health teams to identify any additional measures that could help protect older people and the staff who care for them, and ensure these are put in place immediately,\" she said. \n\"Today's sad news also underlines why all possible action must be taken to ensure that older people living in care homes - the group at the very top of the priority list - receive their vaccines as soon as possible to protect them from becoming seriously ill with coronavirus.\" \nMeanwhile, Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW) compiles its own figures, which showed they have been notified of 7,445 deaths among adult care home residents, from all causes, since 1 March. \nThis is 37% more care home deaths than notified in the same time period last year, and 40% higher than for the same period in 2018.\nCIW has been notified of 1,709 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, with 490 of these being residents transferred to hospital.\nSeparate figures also show 112 care homes (10.7%) notified at least one confirmed Covid case in the last week. This is a fall from the 163 homes who did the same in the week before.\nWhen looking at crude death rates - based on local populations - Wales has four of the highest 10 across England and Wales.\nRCT has 332.4 deaths per 100,000 people in total so far in the pandemic. Merthyr is third with 305. Bridgend and Blaenau Gwent are also high.\nCeredigion, once second lowest behind the Isles of Scilly, now has the 26th-lowest death rate in the UK with 100.4 per 100,000, with Anglesey the lowest in Wales on 65.7 deaths per 100,000.\nONS reports registrations of deaths, where doctors either confirm or suspect Covid-19 and include it on the death certificate. As well as hospitals and care homes, it also includes deaths in hospices and people's own homes. In around 90% of cases, it is estimated that Covid is the underlying cause of death, not just a contributory factor."

      "tags": "Israel,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Israel's vaccination programme is showing signs of working to drive down infections and illness in the over-60s.\nThe fall appears to be most pronounced in older people and areas furthest ahead in their immunisation efforts.\nThis suggests it is the vaccine, and not just the country's current lockdown, taking effect. \nIsraeli Ministry of Health (MoH) figures show 531 over-60s, out of almost 750,000 fully vaccinated, tested positive for coronavirus (0.07%).\nAnd far fewer fell ill, with 38 becoming hospitalised with moderate, severe or critical disease - a tiny proportion. \nThe MoH assessed the medical records of almost a million people in total -  743,845 of whom were over the age of 60 - until at least seven days after they received a second dose of the vaccine. \nThere were three deaths in vaccinated over-60s - although it is possible they contracted the infection earlier, before their immunity had time to build.\nBefore the vaccine had time to take effect, more than 7,000 infections were recorded, just under 700 cases of moderate to critical illness and 307 deaths. \nThe MoH data suggests infections and illnesses fell consistently from 14 days after receiving the first jab onwards.\nWhile the biggest fall observed was in people seven days after their second dose of the vaccine, this cannot be used as evidence for or against the wisdom of the UK's strategy of delaying second doses. \nIsrael has consistently given people their first and second doses no more than three weeks apart, but the first dose isn't expected to provide protection for at least two weeks.\nSo it is not possible by looking at this data to untangle the impact of the second dose from the first dose starting to kick in. \nThe first dose takes longer to show any effect as it primes the immune system to start recognising and fighting off the virus. \nIsrael has delivered five million doses of the vaccine to a population of about nine million - and about one million people have received two doses. \nThe jury's still out on whether the vaccine completely stops people from carrying, and passing on, the virus.\nSo for now, while many people remain unvaccinated, those who have had the jab are still being told to socially distance and wear masks.  \nThe MoH's data only looked at infections and illness in vaccinated people - it did not involve a control group of unvaccinated people as a clinical trial would.\nBut a team of researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Tel-Aviv University, and Technion - Israel Institute of Technology - have attempted to pin down whether the observed fall in cases is down to the vaccine rather than just the effect of lockdown restrictions. \nProf Malka Gorfine, Hagai Rossman, Prof Eran Segal, and Dr Uri Shalit analysed national data by age and city.\nThey identified bigger falls in infections and hospitalisations both in the over-60s, who were vaccinated first, and in the cities which vaccinated the largest proportion of their populations earliest.\nThese relative changes were not seen in earlier lockdowns.\nThis gives early but encouraging signs the falls can be linked to the vaccine, and not just to current restrictions. \nSeparately, Israel's second-largest healthcare provider Maccabi published figures showing 66 people out of a group of 248,000 vaccinated (0.03%) caught the Covid-19 virus, more than a week after receiving the second dose of the vaccine.\nOf those 66, all had mild symptoms and none were hospitalised. \nUnlike the MoH, Maccabi compared the infection rate with 900,000 unvaccinated people with a similar demographic profile. In this group during the same time period, 8,250 caught Covid - more than 30 times as many. \nThey estimated the vaccine was 92% effective when used in a population - very similar to the 95% Pfizer found in a controlled clinical trial. \nFollow Rachel on Twitter"
