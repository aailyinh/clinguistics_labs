      "text": "Delaying lockdown easing could have a \"critical impact\" on already struggling businesses and cost UK hospitality \u00a33bn in lost sales, industry groups say. \nThe government is expected to say that current coronavirus rules will remain in place for another four weeks after the planned 21 June unlocking.\nCapacity limits will remain in pubs and cinemas and nightclubs will stay shut. \nJunior Health Minister Ed Argar said he expected there to be more aid to help businesses cope.\nKate Harl said her restaurant, the Bean Inn in St Ives, Cornwall, would be operating at a \"greatly reduced capacity\" due to the delay and her ability to earn would be \"severely restricted\".\n\"For us the number of covers that we will be doing each night will be down by about 40%,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.\n\"It feels like we're treading water at the moment. We're not able to progress and make a decent profit. We're not at risk of going under, but it's very very difficult and challenging to go forward.\"\nMinisters are concerned about the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus, now the most prevalent in the UK, which is around 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant first identified in Kent. \nUK Hospitality, which represents pubs, bars and restaurants, said it recognised the government had a balance to strike, but it said many businesses were already deeply in debt and called for greater levels of government support.\n\"Even now, with partial reopening, sector sales remain down 42% and 300,000 jobs remain protected by furlough,\" said boss Kate Nicholls. \n\"A one-month delay to restrictions lifting would cost the sector around \u00a33bn in sales - but would also have a knock-on impact on bookings throughout the summer and into the autumn.\"  \nThe Night Time Industries Association, which represents nightclubs among other venues, said businesses had been waiting to open for more than 15 months and many had made financial commitments ahead of 21 June. \nIt said 54% of businesses it surveyed had ordered stock, 73% had called in staff and 60% had sold tickets. The trade group says it will legally challenge any delay, arguing that levels of mortality, hospitalisation and infection are still relatively low.\n\"To delay would have a huge impact on the sector, losing many businesses [and] livelihoods culminating in further loss of confidence in the sector,\" said chief executive Michael Kill. \n\"We will see many more illegal unregulated events take the place of businesses that are licensed and regulated across the country as people express their frustration,\" he added. \nAnton Stevens, director of the Hidden Nightclub in Manchester, said further delays to lifting the lockdown restrictions was \"the last thing we need really\". \nMr Stevens said he and colleagues were hopeful that the 21 June opening day was \"on track\".\n\"Any question of the variants being a deciding factor in delaying the 21 June plans were quashed by the PM only last month and the rise of new cases seemed a formality as the vaccination plan seemed to be working as expected,\" he said.\nMr Stevens said his team added more air conditioning units, toilets and washrooms to \"reopen safely\".\n\"We've hired and trained new staff, a new security company and agreed plans for stock,\" he added.\n\"There's obviously a cost for all of this work which was needed to reopen safely and we're not going to see any return on the thousands of pounds invested for an extended period, with no mention of a another support package.\"\nThe Treasury has said eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief, VAT reduction and the Recovery Loan Scheme. The furlough scheme and support for the self-employed is in place until September.\nBut business groups want the chancellor to go further. \nThe British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said business support measures should reflect the level of restrictions announced and remain in place until the economy is able to reopen fully. \n\"We would be calling for the government to provide further cash grants, at least equivalent to levels provided during the first lockdown, and to delay the tapering of government payments into the furlough scheme, planned for the start of July,\" said BCC co-executive director Claire Walker.\n\"The government should also look at extending the trade credit reinsurance scheme beyond the end of June to minimise possible disruptions in insurance coverage.\"\nJunior Health Minister Ed Argar told Sky News: \"I know that when [the prime minister] addresses his decision, sets out what he intends to do around the easing on the 21st, he will address those points as well.\n\"He is very mindful of the need for businesses and others to get the support they need if they continue to be locked down or unable to open.\"\nA Treasury spokesperson said it was \"committed to helping businesses and individuals through the pandemic and deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty over the summer\". \n \"The furlough scheme and support for the self employed is in place until September and eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief, VAT reduction and the Recovery Loan Scheme,\" they added."

      "text": "A heatwave has hit large parts of the US Pacific Northwest and Canada, sending records tumbling. \nThe US National Weather Service has issued heat warnings for much of Washington and Oregon states. Parts of California and Idaho are also affected. \nOn Saturday temperatures in Seattle, Washington State, reached 101F (38C), a record in the city for June.\nSome cities have opened cooling centres, where residents can escape the heat in air-conditioned buildings. \nThe soaring temperatures are due to a dome of high pressure hovering over north-western United States and Canada.\nExperts say climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, however linking any single event to global warming is complicated. \nAs the climate changes, there could be an increase in the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves, experts say. \nThe National Weather Service (NWS) said that even hotter temperatures were forecast for the coming days throughout the Pacific Northwest as well as parts of western Nevada and California. \nDespite the warnings many people have been enjoying the sunshine, with lakes busy and pools running at full capacity. \nTemperatures are expected to soar 20 - 30F above average in Washington and Oregon states. \n\"Residents are urged to avoid extended periods of time outdoors, stay hydrated and check on vulnerable family members/neighbours,\" the NWS said. \nShops have sold out of portable air conditioners and fans and a number of Covid vaccination drives have been cancelled. \nThe area normally sees mild weather and many people do not have air conditioning. \nOregon's health authority has removed Covid capacity limits at large venues with air conditioning such as cinemas and shopping malls in order for people to take shelter from the heat. \nIn Canada, British Columbia recorded the hottest temperature in the country on Saturday - 43.2C. Parts of Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Northwest Territories are under a heat warning.\nThe heat there is also expected to continue through the week with records expected to fall. "

      "text": "The EU's chief Brexit negotiator says he is \"confident\" a solution can be found in the next 48 hours over a possible ban on chilled meat products from GB being sold in NI.\nEuropean Commission Vice President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d  has appeared before a Stormont committee.\nProducts such as chilled sausages were due to be prohibited from Thursday as a result of the NI Protocol.\nThe protocol is part of the Brexit deal that creates a border in the Irish Sea.\nIt keeps NI in the European Union single market for goods.\nThe EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states.\nBut the UK has asked the EU to delay the ban through extending a so-called grace period.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said he had been in \"intensive contact\" with the European Parliament and EU member states in recent days about the UK's request.\n\"While I cannot today announce the EU's formal agreement to the request, but after all the internal contacts I have had, I remain confident we can find a solution in the next 48 hours that will address both sides' needs and concerns,\" he said.\n\"I hope to be bringing such optimism to Northern Ireland more in the future.\"\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d also told MLAs that the EU was \"prepared to take bold steps\" on flexibilities, if the UK is committed to implementing protocol in full, including changing EU laws if necessary.\nHe repeated the EU's preference for a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement as a solution for Northern Ireland, where the UK continues to follow all EU agri-food rules. \nThe UK has previously rejected this proposal, with its negotiator Lord Frost saying it would be \"an abrogation of sovereignty\" if it involved the rules being enforced through the EU institutions.\nSpeaking later in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she welcomed the \"indication\" from Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d that the extension would be granted.\n\"We should bank that but what we need here are longer-term solutions and I hope we can find those in the period ahead,\" she added.\n\"I do think the appearance of Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d really was a positive development, I think it is really important that he does hear first-hand that the DUP doesn't speak for the north on Brexit or the Protocol.\"\nAnalysis\nThere are clearly some within the EU who think that the UK government is not serious about maintaining the protocol.\nSo Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d was saying 'yes we want to be flexible, but we also need to see the goodwill and the implementation from your side'.\nI think the two sides are still quite far apart on what sort of flexibilities are required or are necessary to make the protocol work.\nI think it's inevitable that we will see another big row blowing up at least by the autumn.\nEconomy Minister Paul Frew described the protocol as \"damaging and brutal\".\nHe told the assembly it was being used as \"punishment and leverage\" by the EU for future negotiations with the UK.\n\"There are some people here [in the assembly] who are complicit in that and that has really frustrated businesses I've spoken to over the last couple of weeks,\" he added.\nBefore the Executive Office committee meeting, the SDLP's Colin McGrath, speaking as chairman, said the committee would make sure Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d was \"fully appraised\" of what Stormont's backbench members think about the protocol.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps NI in the European Union single market for goods.\nThe EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states.\nSince January, producers in Great Britain have not been able to sell these products in the EU.\nHowever, in December 2020, the EU agreed to a six-month grace period to allow supermarkets in Northern Ireland to re-orientate supply chains away from Great Britain.\nThe UK has asked the EU to extend a grace period for chilled meats to the end of September.\nMeanwhile judgement is expected this week in a judicial review which challenged the lawfulness of the protocol.\nThe challenge was brought by a group of unionist politicians and was heard in the High Court in Belfast last month.\nOne of the applicants, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, tweeted that judgement is expected on Wednesday morning."

      "tags": "Companies,Facebook,Competition law,United States",
      "text": "The stock market value of Facebook has topped $1 trillion for the first time after the tech giant won a court victory against US regulators. \nA federal court dismissed two lawsuits, from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a coalition of states, sending Facebook shares up 4.2%.\nIt took the value of Facebook above $1tn, making it the last of the \"big five\" tech firms to hit the milestone.\nThe legal actions had accused Facebook of stifling competition.\nBut Judge James Boasberg ruled that the FTC's anti-trust complaint against the social networking giant was too vague.\nAnother separate anti-competition lawsuit filed by a group of 46 states was thrown out because the alleged violations occurred too long ago.\nIn the US District Court for the District of Columbia ruling, Judge Boasberg wrote that the FTC's complaint was \"legally insufficient\" and had to be dismissed, because the FTC had \"failed to plead enough facts\" to back up its claim that Facebook was stifling competition. \nThe FTC's lawsuit had requested that the technology giant, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, be broken up.\n\"The FTC's complaint says almost nothing concrete on the key question of how much power Facebook actually had, and still has, in a properly defined anti-trust product market,\" wrote Judge Boasberg.\n\"It is almost as if the agency expects the court to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that Facebook is a monopolist.\"\nWhile this is a setback for the FTC that some analysts say could have repercussions for the future of anti-competition law in the US, the watchdog can re-file the charges and has until 28 July to do so. \nHowever, investors saw it as an important victory for Facebook, sending the share price higher. The values of the other tech giants - Apple, Google-owner Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon - have already topped $1tn.\nSeparately, Judge Boasberg also dismissed an anti-competition lawsuit brought by a coalition of 45 US states together with the FTC.\nThis lawsuit had also sought to force Facebook to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. It related to Facebook's acquisition of the two apps in 2012 and 2014.\nIn March, Facebook petitioned the federal court in the US to dismiss them, describing the FTC complaint as \"nonsensical\".\nThe firm said the FTC's case \"ignores the reality of the dynamic, intensely competitive high-tech industry in which Facebook operates\".\nIn his ruling on this case, Judge Boasberg said that the states did not provide \"a reasonable justification\" for why they had waited between six to eight years to decide to sue Facebook - an argument the social networking giant previously made.\nHe added that the states had failed to provide \"a factual dispute\" and only gave a \"half-hearted contention that Facebook was not prejudiced but rather 'benefitted from the states not filing sooner', since it has been and remains a very profitable company\".\n\"Ultimately, this anti-trust action is premised on public, high-profile conduct, nearly all of which occurred over six years ago - before the launch of the Apple Watch or Alexa or Periscope, when Kevin Durant still played for the Oklahoma City Thunder and when Ebola was the virus dominating headlines,\" wrote Judge Boasberg.\nHe added that the states' allegations made it clear that the lawsuit could easily have been filed between 2012 and 2014: \"The system of anti-trust enforcement that Congress has established does not exempt plaintiffs here from 'the consequences of [their] choice' to do nothing over the last half decade. \""

      "tags": "CCTV,Department of Health & Social Care,Whistleblowers,Peter Bone,Matthew Hancock",
      "text": "A security review is under way at the Department of Health after footage of Matt Hancock kissing his aide was leaked to a national newspaper.\nMinisters said the material was captured by departmental CCTV rather than a covert camera.\nThe Sun said it was passed the recordings by a whistleblower, amid concerns about security in government. \nBut Labour said the \"biggest scandal\" was ministers using private email accounts for official business.\nOn Friday, material of Mr Hancock and Gina Coladangelo emerged, triggering alarm that sensitive meetings and conversations by ministers may be being monitored.\nSeveral ministers have expressed surprise at the presence of CCTV in a government office.\nQuestioned on a visit to Batley and Spen in West Yorkshire, the prime minister said he was \"sure all that kind of thing is going to be looked into\".\nThe security review will be accompanied by a separate investigation into whether there are any implications for arrangements in Parliament. \nAsking an urgent question in the Commons, Conservative MP Peter Bone said the issues raised were of \"national concern\".\nHe said there was a long-standing rule that secret recordings of MPs by the police, security services or state are outlawed under a principle known as the \"Wilson doctrine\", named after the former prime minister, Harold Wilson. \nResponding, Cabinet Office minister Julia Lopez said the government took concerns about security \"very seriously\". \nShe said the footage was recorded by departmental CCTV - which has since been disabled - rather than a covert camera. \nBut Labour's Chris Bryant said it \"blows my mind\" that Ms Lopez was suggesting that Mr Hancock knew there was a camera in his office. \nAnd former minister Angela Eagle said Mr Hancock \"would not have behaved in the way he behaved right in front of it\" if he knew the recording device had been there, adding: \"I think she's stretching credibility.\"\nThe Cabinet Office's confirmation that the images appear to have come from departmental CCTV rather than any covert camera reduces the sense that this might be a major national security risk.\nIf someone had infiltrated a camera then it would have raised issues about whether offices needed to be more regularly swept for devices (a time-consuming task, insiders say, especially when lots of people have access). \nAnd given it looks to have been leaked by an insider, there does not appear to have been any role for cyber-espionage or a hostile state which require MI5 to become involved. \nBut it still leaves some serious security questions unresolved. \nCameras are not normally in private offices so why was this one present? \nWas it left over after an office was reconfigured? And why was Matt Hancock unaware of it? \nThere is also the question of access to CCTV footage. \nParliamentarians want to know which contractors or staff are able to view such images and whether there are sufficient controls and vetting of those individuals. \nDeputy Labour leader Angela Rayner told MPs that the issue of private email being used to to conduct government business raised serious questions. \nShe waved minutes of a departmental meeting, in which she said \"senior civil servants report government contracts being approved from the minister's private email address\", and said the matter needed to be referred to the information commissioner.\n\"Our country faces daily threats from hostile foreign states,\" she added. \n\"What does it say about this government when they will launch an inquiry into leaks of CCTV but not into their own ministers?\" \nMs Lopez said: \"Government guidance is that official devices, email accounts and communications applications should be used for communicating classified information.\"\nBut she said \"other forms of electronic communication may used in the course of conducting government business\" and \"each minister is responsible for ensuring that government information is handled in a secure way\".\nShe added at the height of the pandemic, ministers were receiving a \"huge volume of correspondence\" from various sources on their work and their private accounts. \nShe said: \"There were 15,000 offers of help in securing PPE that came in following the prime minister's call for assistance.\n\"The important thing to note is that when PPE offers did come in, they went through the same eight-stage process, so no matter which way those things were communicated, they went through the same process and that should provide assurance.\"\nThe Metropolitan Police said it was \"aware of the distribution of images alleged to have been obtained within an official government premises\".\nBut it added: \"No criminal investigation has been launched. At this time this remains a matter for the relevant government department.\""

      "text": "Canada has recorded its highest ever temperature as the country's west and the US Pacific north-west frazzle in an unprecedented heatwave.\nLytton in British Columbia soared to 46.6C (116F) on Sunday, breaking an 84-year-old record, officials said.\nA \"heat dome\" - static high pressure acting like a lid on a cooking pot - has set records in many other areas.\nThe US and Canada have both warned citizens of \"dangerous\" heat levels that could persist this week.\nExperts say that climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated. \nBBC forecaster Nick Miller says that \"heat dome\" isn't a strictly defined meteorological term but has become associated with describing large areas of high pressure, leading to clear skies and hot sunny days. The longer the high pressure pattern lasts, the longer the heatwave is and temperatures can build day by day.\nThis high pressure zone is huge, from California right up to Canada's Arctic territories and stretching inland through Idaho.\nSales of air-conditioners and fans have surged, and cooling shelters have sprung up. Some bars and restaurants - and even a swimming pool - were deemed too hot to function.\nLytton, which is about 150 miles (250km) north-east of Vancouver, surged past the previous Canadian record.\nThat was set in two towns in Saskatchewan - Yellow Grass and Midale - back in July 1937 at a balmy 45C (113F).\nLytton was not alone. More than 40 other spots in British Columbia set new records.\nEnvironment Canada senior climatologist David Phillips told CTV: \"I like to break a record, but this is like shattering and pulverising them. It's warmer in parts of western Canada than in Dubai.\"\nHe said there was a chance of topping 47C somewhere, with Monday the likeliest day.\nBritish Columbia's power providers said there had been a surge in demand for electricity to keep air-conditioners running.\nEnvironment Canada said Alberta, and parts of Saskatchewan, Yukon and the Northwest Territories, should also be on alert.\nIn its warning, it forecast a \"prolonged, dangerous, and historic heatwave will persist through this week\", with temperatures 10C-15C above normal, at near 40C in many places.\nThe Pacific north-west has also been breaking records, particularly in parts of Washington and Oregon states.\nThe US National Weather Service called the heatwave conditions \"historic\" and said they would persist through the week, \"with numerous daily, monthly and even all-time records likely to be set\".\nSeattle and Portland, cities with famously rainy climates, both recorded their hottest temperatures ever on Sunday.\nPortland shattered its prior record when temperatures reached 44C, according to the US National Weather Service. Seattle also passed a historic high as the mercury hit 40C.\nOregon eased Covid attendance restrictions to open up swimming pools and air-conditioned areas like shopping centres. But Seattle in Washington had to close one pool because of \"unsafe, dangerous pool deck temperatures\".\nFruit growers have been rushing to pick crops, fearing the heat could shrivel cherries and other fruit. Pickers have been starting at dawn and stopping at lunchtime in the unbearable temperatures.\nBJ Thurlby, president of the Northwest Cherry Growers, told the Seattle Times: \"We are travelling in absolutely uncharted waters.\"\nThe US track and field Olympic qualifying trials had to be halted in Eugene, Oregon, on Sunday, as the crowd was told to leave the stadium for safety reasons.\nSome Covid vaccination centres also closed because of the heat.\nSome areas along the coast could cool a little later in the week, but Boise, Idaho, could see a week of 40C+ temperatures. The National Weather Service said parts of the state could suffer \"one of the most extreme and prolonged heatwaves in the recorded history of the Inland Northwest\".\nThe warnings for all were to stay hydrated, avoid strenuous activities, and check on vulnerable neighbours.\nWe can't say for certain this brutal heat storm has been caused by emissions from industrial society, but scientists studying extremes say every heatwave occurring today is made more likely and more intense by human-induced climate change.\nIn fact scientists have got much better at linking some extreme events to climate change, such as the heatwave that scorched Europe in 2019, which researchers say was made 100 times more likely due to CO2. \nWhat's extra-concerning is that these temperatures have been reached with global temperatures just 1.1 C above preindustrial times. \nScience body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, judges that we're likely to exceed 1.5C above that level before long. And at current rates we will overshoot a 2C rise - possibly higher.\nYet China and India continue to build new coal-fired power stations. And the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the US - won't give a date to phase them out. \nThe UK and others are still drilling for more oil and gas to burn, saying it'll be needed to 2050.\nIt's certainly looking like a climate emergency."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Weddings,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Most coronavirus rules will remain in place in England for another four weeks after the planned 21 June unlocking, government sources have told the BBC.\nSenior ministers have signed off on the decision to delay the lifting of all legal restrictions on social contact.\nThat could mean capacity limits for sports, pubs and cinemas will remain, and nightclubs would stay closed.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is due to confirm the delay at a news conference later - at 18:00 BST.\nThe extension will be put to a Commons vote this month and could trigger a sizeable Conservative backbench rebellion.  \nEngland was due to move to stage four of the government's roadmap out of lockdown on 21 June, when venues and events would be allowed to operate without capacity limits and the cap on guests at weddings would be lifted.\nIt would also have meant an end to current rules which limit gatherings at home to six people or two households.\nBut many scientists have called for the reopening to be delayed to enable more people to be vaccinated and receive second doses, amid rising cases of the Delta variant, which was first identified in India.\nA delay would also allow more work to be done on whether vaccines are breaking, or simply weakening, the link between infections and hospitalisations.\nHealth Minister Edward Argar told BBC Breakfast that he could not confirm the delay before the PM's announcement, but that there was a \"concerning increase\" in cases of the Delta variant and numbers in hospital were \"beginning to creep up\".\nMost severe cases were among unvaccinated people or those who had only one dose, he said, adding that at current rates nearly 10 million second doses could be administered over four weeks to increase protection.\nMr Argar said the prime minister would address issues of economic support in any announcement and that the PM was \"very sensitive\" to the situation of couples who had already had to postpone their weddings.\nAll areas of Scotland are due to move to Level Zero Covid restrictions on 28 June - meaning bigger groups can gather in caf\u00e9s, pubs and restaurants, although they will still have to observe social distancing. \nLimits on indoor gatherings in Northern Ireland are scheduled to be relaxed on 21 June and the current rules in Wales will be reviewed on 25 June.\nIf the lifting of restrictions is pushed back, the UK Weddings Taskforce - an industry group - estimates that 50,000 weddings planned in the four weeks from 21 June could be cancelled, with the industry losing \u00a3325m for every week of delay.\nCurrently the number of guests allowed at weddings is limited to 30. \nThe Night Time Industries Association said businesses such as nightclubs had already spent millions preparing to reopen, and the association would legally challenge any delay to reopening.\nWill Power, owner of the Lab 11 nightclub in Birmingham, said a delay would be \"catastrophic\". \n\"This will possibly hurt us more than the initial lockdown back in March last year,\" he said.\nKate Nicholls from UKHospitality, which represents pubs, bars and restaurants, said businesses faced losing \u00a33bn in sales if the relaxation of restrictions was delayed by a month.\nSinger Frank Turner, who has raised money for struggling small music venues, said the delay would \"tip some businesses into final collapse\", while theatre producer Sonia Friedman warned \"many livelihoods are under existential threat\".\nRising infections in the UK are being driven by the Delta variant which is believed to be around 60% more infectious than the previous dominant variant and twice as likely to result in hospital admissions.\nOn Monday, the UK recorded 7,742 new cases of Covid-19 and three deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nThe seven-day average for cases in the UK is up 46% compared with the seven days before. \nHowever, NHS England data shows over-55s are continuing to account for a smaller percentage of people admitted to hospital with Covid-19. \nOn 6 June around a third of admissions were aged 55 or over, compared to a little over 70% on 6 March, and more than 80% on 6 December. \nMeanwhile, the government has announced extra support for six more areas of England, to help suppress the spread of the Delta variant. \nAdditional testing, tracing, isolation support and measures to maximise vaccine uptake will be deployed in Birmingham, Blackpool, Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Liverpool City Region and Warrington.\nGuidance will also be set out for the six areas on steps people can take to keep their communities safe, including minimising travel in and out of the area. \nIf it wasn't for the Delta variant, the government would in all likelihood be announcing the go-ahead for a full unlock. \nBut a more infectious variant against which one shot of the vaccine works less well has created a problem. \nThat much can be seen from how quickly infection levels are rising. The trajectory we are on means we could see January levels of infection by the end of July. \nExactly what that means for hospital admissions is less clear. It is already obvious that while the vaccines have weakened the link between cases and serious illness they have not broken it completely - admissions are rising after all. \nEarly data suggests less than 5% of cases are ending up in hospital - half the rate seen previously. \nBut that still has the potential to cause 2,000 admissions a day if we did reach January levels of infection - twice what the NHS would see for all respiratory illnesses in a bad winter. \nNone of that is guaranteed, of course, and so a delay, government scientists are arguing, gives them more time to work out with confidence where we are heading - and it is even possible the immunity built up by the vaccines will have started to halt the growth by then. \nThe government has set out four tests that must be met for the next stage of easing restrictions to go ahead: \nMore than 41 million people in the UK have had a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while nearly 30 million have had two doses. \nSome Conservative MPs said they were concerned that vulnerable businesses would close permanently and that the prospect of ending all coronavirus restrictions was receding.\nBackbencher Peter Bone said he would vote against continuing restrictions unless the prime minister was able to show there was \"a very clear danger to our society\".\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that currently he \"can't see the evidence why we should be postponing our freedom\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer told LBC Radio if the lockdown decision was confirmed, it would be because of the government's \"pathetic borders policy\", which he said allowed the Delta variant to become established in the UK."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "A mix-and-match approach to Covid vaccines - using different brands for first and second doses - appears to give good protection against the pandemic virus, a UK study has found.\nThe Com-Cov trial looked at the efficacy of either two doses of Pfizer, two of AstraZeneca, or one of them followed by the other. \nAll combinations worked well, priming the immune system.\nThis knowledge could offer flexibility for vaccine rollout, say experts. \nThe trial results also hint that people who have already received two doses of AstraZeneca vaccine could have a stronger immune response if they were given a different jab as a booster if recommended in the autumn. \nThe UK's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there was no reason to change the current successful same dose vaccine schedules in the UK, however, given vaccines were in good supply and saving lives.\nBut he says it might be something to look at in the future: \"Mixing doses could provide us with even greater flexibility for a booster programme, while also supporting countries who have further to go with their vaccine rollouts, and who may be experiencing supply difficulties.\"\nSome countries are already using mixed doses. Spain and Germany are offering the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines as a second dose to younger people who have already received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following concerns about rare but serious blood clots, rather than about efficacy.\nTwo doses are important to give the fullest protection and teach the body to make antibodies and T cells to block and kill Covid. \nThe Com-Cov study, which looked at giving the doses four weeks apart in 850 volunteers aged 50 and above, found:\nLead investigator Prof Matthew Snape, from the University of Oxford, said the findings did not undermine the UK policy of giving people the same jab twice: \"We already know that both standard schedules are very effective against severe disease and hospitalisations, including against the Delta variant when given at eight to 12 weeks apart.\"\nHe said the new results showed mixed dose schedules were also effective, even though the interval of four weeks studied was shorter than the eight to 12-week schedule most commonly used in the UK.\n\"This longer interval is known to result in a better immune response,\" he added. \nMixed dose trial results for a 12-week jab interval will be available next month.\nMeanwhile, another pre-print study, which also came out on Monday, suggests a third dose of AZ vaccine, given more than six months after the second, boosts the immune system.\nBut experts say it is too early to know if people will need a booster dose this year ahead of winter. It is unclear yet how much immunity might wane over time. \nProf Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia said: \"The big question at present is whether or not we will be being offered booster vaccines in the autumn. With the evidence available from this and other sources, I suspect that will be likely for those most at risk from the virus, either due to age or being clinically vulnerable.\"\nHe suggested people who have had a first course of AstraZeneca might be offered the Pfizer vaccine in as a booster rather than a repeat AstraZeneca, while people who had a Pfizer first course may not need an autumn booster, based on the evidence from the Com-Cov trial. \nThe initial results of this mix and match vaccine trial are highly encouraging and throw up some interesting options for booster doses.   \nMixing first and second doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines yielded strong immune responses.  Indeed, every combination of dosing - Pfizer/Pfizer, AZ/Pfizer or Pfizer/AZ produced higher antibody and cellular responses than AZ/AZ.  \nDoes this mean that two doses of AstraZeneca is somehow inferior? Not necessarily.  \nIt is worth remembering that two doses of AZ are already proven to reduce the chances of being hospitalised with Covid by more than 90%.  \nSo we know from real world evidence that the AZ vaccine is highly effective. The AZ vaccine is a 'slow burner', and immunity levels build over time, especially when the dosing period is stretched.  Currently the gap between first and second doses is between eight and 12 weeks which should give a better immune response.  \nWhat this trial suggests is that for the third, booster doses, it may be preferable to give a different brand of vaccine than the one used for the first two shots.  \nBut it's also worth noting that mixing vaccines does produce more short-term side effects such as chills, headaches and muscle pain.

Some may now cease trading and let staff go,\" he said. \n\"Business support should be extended such as full furlough and full business rates relief.\"\nA spokeswoman for the government said that the furlough scheme, introduced at the start of the first nationwide lockdown, was still in place until September and \"is amongst the most generous schemes in the world\", providing \u00a365bn of support and protecting 11.5 million jobs.\n\"The government will continue pay 70% of workers' wages over July, with businesses asked to cover just 10%,\" she added,\n\"They can also continue to access additional support, including restart grants worth up to \u00a318,000 per business, and business rates relief and a cut to VAT - both in place until March 2022.\""

      "text": "Mark Drakeford has accused Boris Johnson's government of \"aggressively\" ignoring Wales' government and parliament. \nThe first minister has published a report on reforming the \"fragile\" union between the four UK nations.\nIt calls for a partnership between governments, but says relations have recently deteriorated.\nUK ministers said focusing on constitutional issues was an \"irresponsible\" distraction from Covid.\nMr Drakeford said there was an urgent need for change because \"the union has never been this fragile\". \nThe report came as Welsh ministers were granted permission to appeal after their legal challenge to a post-Brexit UK trade law was blocked.\n\"If matters continue in their current vein the case for the break-up of the UK will only increase,\" the first minister said.\n\"Too often we see the UK government act in an aggressively unilateral way, claiming to act on behalf of the whole UK, but without regard for the status of the nations and the democratic mandates of their governments.\" \nThe Labour first minister, an opponent of independence, wants more powers for the Welsh Parliament, including over the justice system.\nHis report says Westminster should allow Wales and Scotland to hold referendums on independence if their devolved parliaments want to, but adds \"it would be unreasonable for such referendums to be held too frequently\".\nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland should continue to be represented in the House of Commons, the report says, but the membership of the House of Lords should also reflect the make-up of the UK.\nFunding for the devolved nations should be based on their needs, it says, and the UK government should get consent from Cardiff if it wants to pay for certain things in Wales.\nIt follows a row over replacing EU funding to Wales, with UK government ministers acquiring new powers to fund things that are normally controlled by the Welsh government.\nIn a statement, the UK government said people wanted both administrations to work together \"and our full focus must remain on recovering from the challenges the pandemic has created\".\n\"Choosing to prioritise constitutional issues in the middle of a pandemic is an irresponsible and unwanted distraction,\" it said.\nResponding to accusations that UK-wide schemes such as the levelling-up fund undermined devolution, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: \"What we're trying to do with more visibility and vigour - I'm very proud of the fact - is we are trying to get more money into Wales, more investment into Wales, more jobs into Wales.\"\nOn the subject of the union, Mr Hart added: \"For most people it's the comforting knowledge that we are part of a big, historic combination of strengths, and that on balance that it's a force for good,\" pointing to the Covid vaccination programme as an example.  \nPlaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said the UK was \"failing utterly to deliver economic and social justice for the people of Wales\".\n\"The only way of achieving this is by putting Wales's future in Wales's hands, free from Westminster's chaos and incompetence. It's why support for independence is at an all-time high, and growing,\" he said."

      "text": "As schools break up for half term after weeks of low Covid rates, measures such as face coverings and class bubbles are still in place.\nBut restrictions should not last \"a day longer than is necessary\", according to Children's Commissioner Sally Holland.\nDeputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Chris Jones said it could \"make sense\" to relax controls during the summer months.\nBut teaching unions said they remained concerned about easing measures.\nProf Holland said it had been a \"remarkable, extraordinary and hugely challenging\" year-and-a-half for schools, keeping children safe and responding to changing circumstances.\nShe said new guidance allowing school trips, as well as music teachers increasingly being able to visit schools, were examples of a \"semblance of normality\" returning.\nBut on the most significant measures, such as maintaining contact groups and face coverings, she urged the Welsh government to review guidance all the time.\n\"You can't just let guidance sit for weeks and weeks, we can't have restrictions on children for a day longer than is necessary,\" she said.\nWhile the government deemed the measures to be necessary due to its public health and scientific advice, Prof Holland said pupils and teachers accepted it on the whole, but she urged the government to listen to all the arguments.\n\"Not only to evidence about epidemiology, but also the social impact it's having on children and young people so that's physical discomfort, it's how it impacts on their relationships with their peers, but also how it impacts on teaching and learning,\" she added.\nThe latest Public Health Wales figures recorded 55 Covid cases in schools over the past week, a total of 162 over the most recent 21 days.\nThe cases were reported by 11 of Wales' 22 local authorities.\nTwo thirds of cases were in Bridgend and Monmouthshire, linked to school cases in Porthcawl and Abergavenny.\nAlthough almost 81% of schools have had a Covid case since September, 208 schools have had only one case.\nCurrent guidance says face coverings should be worn by pupils and staff in secondary schools and colleges, including in classrooms, and by primary school staff where social distancing is not possible.\nSchools have formed contact groups of pupils to limit mixing.\nTwice weekly lateral flow tests are available for children over 11 years old and school staff.\nDr Jones said there were \"very few cases being reported in schools\", providing \"very reassuring evidence\" that schools were not \"a higher risk environment\".\nIan Gerrard, head teacher at Ysgol Aberconwy, in Conwy, said pupils had been \"really resilient\".\nHe said he was keen that the restrictions were relaxed \"in a safe way\", as mask-wearing \"does have an impact on learning in classrooms... but I think we've got to be driven by the science\".\nPupil Hannah Partington, 18, said: \"I think I'd feel comfortable to still wear them. It makes you feel a bit safer.\"\nHer classmate Marnie Cockrill, 18, said she would like restrictions to be \"a bit more relaxed\", but agreed she would also like to keep wearing a face mask at school.\n\"It's worth it for the protection,\" she said.\nWales' Education Minister Jeremy Miles has said school restrictions will be kept under review.\nDr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales (PHW), said the country's technical advisory group was considering dropping the rules.\n\"Personally, I would favour stepping back from face coverings during the summer months,\" Dr Jones said.\n\"We may need to reintroduce them again when the winter comes but we can't really decide that without gaining people's confidence - everybody has to feel happy that that approach makes sense.\"\nHe added information on face coverings was due \"shortly\" from the Technical Advisory Cell, a group of experts providing advice to the government.\n\"We know that there are some harms associated with face coverings and maybe they will get worse during the hot weather over the summer - difficulty with skin and irritation and the heat,\" he said.\n\"So I think there is an argument to say the benefit related to the risk is less for face coverings now, but we need to see that evidence and we need to discuss that with teaching unions and also children's representatives because we need to make sure that if there is a change in a policy everyone still has confidence in the protective measures that we have.\"\nDavid Evans, NEU Cymru secretary, said it was \"too early\" to lift Covid restrictions because of the current concerns over the Indian variant.\nHe said the younger population had not been vaccinated and that they were \"more mobile and were meeting more people\".\n\"There are a few weeks left until the end of the term, we should use this time to investigate more fully the Indian variant,\" Mr Evans added.\nHe said they still wanted to see pupils wear face masks in classrooms until the end of term and then assess the situation before they start back in school in September.\nDr Chris Jones added that Wales was \"ready to go\" if the UK-wide Joint Council on Vaccination and Immunisation gave the go-ahead for 16 and 17-year-olds to be vaccinated.\n\"I think it's fair to say if the JCVI recommended its use in 16 and 17-year-olds we would welcome that in Wales and we would be ready to start that age group sooner rather than later,\" he said.\n\"I think from our point of view, because we're already getting through large numbers of the 18 to 29-year-olds we would welcome advice to that effect sooner rather than later from the JCVI.\n\"They are an independent body of experts, we have to await their deliberations but there's no doubt that we would soon be ready to go if that was advised.\"\nHe said the evidence for vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds was still being assessed by medicines regulators."

Left-wing candidates withdrew from the race in the region to help him defeat rival Mr Mariani. \nMs Le Pen accused her rivals of forming \"unnatural alliances\" to block her and her party from power.\n\"[They] did all they could to keep us out and prevent us from showing the French our capacity to lead a regional administration,\" she told supporters.\nThe Hauts-de-France region around Calais in the north had also been earmarked as a potential gain for Ms Le Pen's RN, but was won by conservative Xavier Bertrand.\n\"The far-right has been stopped in its tracks and we have pushed it back sharply,\" he told his supporters after the polls closed.\nMr Bertrand's win will boost his prospects at becoming the Republican candidate in next year's presidential election.\nAlmost all of the incumbent regional presidents who ran again, whether left or right, were winners in Sunday's vote.\nAs with the first round of regional elections last week, voter numbers were at record lows.\nWhen polls opened for voting last Sunday, almost 90% of the country's youngest voters failed to show up.\nAbstention rates were only slightly lower for voters under 35.\nPresident Macron's party was already sidelined in these elections after its poor showing in the first round.  \nMarine Le Pen's also scored badly last Sunday, but she at least had hopes of picking up one region - which would have been a first and a boost for her presidential bid.\nIt didn't happen - once again her voters stayed away from the polls - and overall these elections have been a big disappointment for the hard right.  \nThe winners are the mainstream right whose candidates held on easily to the regions they already controlled. One of them the former minister Xavier Bertrand, whose fief is the northern Hauts-de-France region, is now openly a candidate for the  presidency next year."

      "text": "The government has said it is carrying out a thorough investigation into how classified defence documents were found at a bus stop in Kent.\nDefence minister Jeremy Quin told MPs he was \"very sorry\" it had happened.\nHe said it appeared to be a mistake made by a senior official, and the person's access to sensitive material has been temporarily suspended.\nThe documents - which were handed to the BBC - contained details of HMS Defender and the military.\nThey were found in a soggy heap behind a bus stop in Kent early on Tuesday morning.\nIn a statement to the Commons on Monday, Mr Quin said the documents included a paper that was marked \"secret UK eyes only\".\nHe said the senior government official had contacted his department to report they were missing on Tuesday. \n\"This is a mistake, it appears,\" Mr Quin later added. \"I don't want to prejudge the investigation but it appears it was a mistake made by an individual.\"\n\"I'm very sorry this incident has happened and the investigation will be thorough.\"\nHe added: \"While the investigation is being conducted the individual's access to sensitive material has been suspended.\"\nThe papers have now been given back to the government and are being assessed to check that none are missing, said Mr Quin.\nHe said the investigation will look at the actions of the people involved - including the printing of the papers, how the incident was managed once reported and the underlying processes for printing and carrying papers.\nThe defence minister said he expected the investigation to be completed \"shortly\" - but that he hoped it could be as little as a week.\nAnd asked whether the UK has told its allies, Mr Quin said: \"We have certainly informed the United States.\"\nMr Quin was also asked whether the investigation will consider whether any official secrets laws were broken by the BBC in reporting on the documents.\n\"In an ideal and proper world these documents should not have been available where they were so that's where the original fault clearly lies,\" he replied.\nHe said he would encourage members of the public to hand in such documents to the police.\n\"Although I would have preferred naturally the BBC to have handed them over immediately and not made reference to them, they have a job to do. And I recognise that they have behaved responsibly and they have handed the documents back into the department.\"\nOne MP, Conservative Bob Stewart, had said he was saddened that the BBC published its report rather than pass the documents straight to the police.\nBy Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent\nMPs are understandably concerned, and in some cases angry, about the loss of such sensitive documents. One even suggested that the senior MoD official responsible for losing them should be made to \"walk the plank\" for putting the country's military personnel at risk.\nIt's clear that the breach was significant. Some of the papers were marked \"secret\" and many were printed on pink paper, indicating the sort of material that should not be removed from the Ministry of Defence except under exceptional circumstances and according to strict procedures. \nThe investigation, led by the Permanent Secretary at the MoD and involving MoD police, will want to establish whether those procedures were followed and, perhaps, whether they need to be changed. \nA former senior government security official told the BBC that taking pink documents out of the MoD was the most \"egregious\" aspect of this whole affair, but also said that with senior officials working under enormous pressure, provision for them to work securely from home ought to be made possible. \nLabour shadow defence secretary, John Healey, asked if there was any danger that espionage may have played a role in the loss of the documents. The minister for defence procurement Jeremy Quin replied that the official had \"self-reported\" as soon as he realise the documents were missing.\nThrough our own reporting, the BBC can say with a high degree of confidence that this is not a story of espionage. \nBut it's still highly concerning. The documents relating to the UK's presence in Afghanistan in the coming months, and how UK forces might work alongside the Americans, are particularly sensitive. The BBC understands the loss has been the subject of frequent conversations with officials in Washington. \nLabour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the incident of the missing documents was embarrassing for the government and also \"deeply worrying\".\n\"Ministers need to do more to reassure the public and our forces personnel that they have a grip of their department,\" he said.\nMr Healey said this was not the first time sensitive documents had gone missing, citing two other examples this year. The minister replied that earlier breaches had not involved such highly classified material.\nOne set of documents discusses the likely Russian reaction to the passage of British ship HMS Defender through Ukrainian waters off the Crimea coast.\nOn 23 June more than 20 Russian aircraft and two coastguard ships shadowed the warship as it sailed about 12 miles (19km) off Crimea.\nThe documents discovered in Kent confirm that passage through a short stretch of water close to the south-west tip of Crimea was a calculated decision by the British government to make a show of support for Ukraine, despite the possible risks involved. \nAnother of the documents details plans for a possible UK military presence in Afghanistan after the US-led Nato operation there ends."

      "tags": "Companies,Financial Conduct Authority (FCA),Bitcoin,Personal finance,Cryptocurrency",
      "text": "Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, has been issued a warning by the UK's financial regulator. \nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has ruled that the firm cannot conduct any \"regulated activity\" in the UK.\nIt also advised people to be wary of adverts promising high returns on cryptoasset investments. \nBinance said the FCA notice would have no \"direct impact\" on the services it provides from its website Binance.com.\nBinance's existing crypto exchange is not UK-based so despite the FCA ruling, there will be no impact on UK residents who use the website to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies.\nThe FCA does not regulate cryptocurrencies, but requires exchanges to register with them. Binance has not registered with the FCA and therefore is not allowed to operate an exchange in the UK. \nThe FCA move comes amid pushback from regulators around the world against cryptocurrency platforms. \nBinance.com is an online centralised exchange that offers users a range of financial products and services, including purchasing and trading a wide range of digital currencies, as well as digital wallets, futures, securities, savings accounts and even lending.\nBinance Group is currently based in the Cayman Islands, while Binance Markets Limited is an affiliate firm based in London. The firm has multiple entities dotted around the world and Binance Group was previously based in Malta. \nThe FCA said that Binance Markets Limited (BML), which is owned by Binance Group, is not currently permitted to undertake any regulated activities without the prior written consent of the FCA. It has until Wednesday to comply with the ruling. \nThe regulator also stressed that no entity in the Binance Group holds any form of authorisation, registration or licence to conduct regulated activity in the UK.\nAt first sight, the Financial Conduct Authority's move to bar Binance from operating in the UK will have little impact. After all, it won't stop the company's many UK customers from using its exchange based in the Cayman Islands to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nNevertheless, the FCA is sending a strong signal that it is worried about the dangers of investing in cyptocurrencies in general. \nThe reason it wants them all to register is because it's concerned about their potential use as a cover for illicit activity - and it wants consumers to be very careful indeed.\nAs well as forbidding Binance from setting up an exchange in the UK, the regulator is ordering its UK division to stop any form of advertising here by 30 June. More significantly, it has until the end of this week to show the FCA that it has stored records of all of its UK customers, ready to be handed over if necessary.\nAnd there's a message to UK consumers to check whether any crypto company is registered with the regulator and, if it isn't, to consider withdrawing their assets.\nThe FCA cannot stop people from trading in cryptocurrencies - but it has got out its biggest red flag and is waving it vigorously.\nThis is not the first time that Binance has come under scrutiny by regulators over its global operations.\nIn the US, one of the firm's entities - Binance Holdings - has been the subject of a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specifically by its officials dealing with money laundering and tax offences, according to Bloomberg. \nThe SEC issued a similar warning to US consumers in April about the platform.\nOn Saturday, Binance announced it was pulling out of Ontario, Canada, after the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) accused it and several other crypto trading platforms of failing to comply with province regulations.\nAnd on Friday, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) warned Binance for the second time in three years that it is operating in the country without permission. \nMark Walker is a technology entrepreneur who has invested in cryptocurrencies for three and a half years, alongside running a farm. He has used Binance for about six months.\n\"This ruling probably won't impact me in the short term, but long term it may push me to using one of the many other less secure exchanges,\" he explains. \n\"The FCA are taking a blunt approach - this is a space which is growing and employs millions so it's like them banning the internet in the 90s.\n\"I called the FCA this morning and they couldn't even answer whether existing users funds could be withdrawn,\" Mr Walker adds.\nOne service Binance offers is the ability to use local currency to purchase digital currencies - known as fiat on-ramp in the industry. In mid-June, Binance's US partner Silvergate Bank decided to stop processing US dollar deposits and withdrawals for the firm, according to CoinDesk. \nWhile the cryptocurrency exchange says its entities are not all connected to it,  Nick Saponaro, a long-time cryptocurrency investor and entrepreneur, told the BBC this was a handy tactic for avoiding regulatory problems. \n\"Binance has over the course of their operations, moved several times to new jurisdictions,\" he said. \n\"That's not uncommon for these fledgling crypto businesses... if the regulations don't suit their needs, they just move their operations.\"\nAnother of the firm's entities - Binance.US -  is currently one of the biggest digital currency exchanges in the US, and Binance is one of the biggest firms in the global fintech industry, he says.\n\"I do believe they are trying to comply with regulations, but often with these businesses it's an 'ask for forgiveness' model, [where] they hope they can make enough money so if they do incur a fine, it's negligible comparatively to what they've earned.\"\nMr Saponaro, who co-founded the crypto-currency Divi and the blockchain payments ecosystem Divi Project, says the real problem with cryptocurrency exchanges is that they are still centralised, in that there is still a central authority that takes custody of the users' money, almost like a bank.\nThis is counter to what the cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies were designed to do, and he feels that all exchanges should be totally decentralised, enabling users to have complete control over their digital coins.\nBut he stresses that digital currencies are not a scam and eventually the fintech industry will get there.\n\"We're 12 years into the crypto adoption cycle, these things just take time - the exact same things were said about the internet initially,\" he said.\n\"Governments of each jurisdiction, especially the G7, need to with full transparency and confidence give us the full regulations about what we can and cannot do, and it needs to fit what the technology actually does.\""

      "text": "A 13-year-old was \"lured\" to a park by a girl and \"ambushed\" by two teenage boys who stabbed him and left him to die, a court has heard. \nOliver Stephens, known as Olly, was pronounced dead at Bugs Bottom fields in Emmer Green, Reading, on 3 January.\nOlly believed he was meeting a girl on her own, but two boys were lying in wait, Reading Crown Court heard.  \nTwo boys, both 14, deny murder. A girl, also 14, and one of the boys, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\nOpening the case for the prosecution, Alison Morgan QC said the defendants were \"motivated by perceived grievances\" against Olly.\nThe barrister said he was \"lured\" to the fields by the girl as part of a plan devised in the days before the attack with the two boys. \n\"Olly was then ambushed by the defendants,\" said Ms Morgan, adding that he was stabbed in the chest and back.\n\"He was physically attacked by [the two boys], with [the girl] standing nearby lending assistance by her presence.\"\nMs Morgan said that this was \"not some kind of consensual fight\" but a planned attack in which Olly was \"vulnerable\". \nShe told the court the defendants then fled the scene, deleted incriminating messages from their phones, and disposed of the clothes they were wearing. \nJurors were told the defendants had shared several messages on Snapchat in the days leading up to Olly's death that demonstrated hostility towards him.\nThese included a series of voice notes, in which one of the boys said: \"I actually hate the kid with a passion, like if I was to see him right now I'll probably end up killing him or something.\"\nOther messages referenced the possession, handling and use of knives, the prosecutor said.\nThe court heard that another girl who was asked to be part of the \"set up\" expressed concerns, and said she did not want to be part of a \"murder team\". \n\"Nah, it's not a murder,\" one of the boys on trial allegedly responded. \nThe trial continues. \nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,NHS,Matthew Hancock,Sajid Javid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People in England are \"very likely\" to be able to return to \"pretty much life before Covid\" on 19 July, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nIt was \"sensible to stick to our plan\" of having a \"cautious but irreversible approach\" to lifting the remaining coronavirus restrictions, he added.\nThe final stage of easing lockdown measures was previously put back by four weeks from 21 June by the PM.\nNew Health Secretary Sajid Javid will update MPs later on the restrictions.\nThe planned easing on 21 June was delayed amid concern over the spread of the Delta variant.  \nWhen announcing the delay, the prime minister promised a review after two weeks.\nMeanwhile, Spain, Malta and Portugal are introducing new restrictions for travellers from the this week.\nThose travelling to Spain - including the Balearic Islands, which will be on the UK's green travel list from Wednesday - will need to be fully vaccinated or have a negative PCR test. Malta, which will also go on the green list, will require visitors to have had both doses of a Covid-19 jab.\nTravellers from the UK to mainland Portugal will be required to quarantine for 14 days on arrival, unless they have been fully vaccinated for at least two weeks - but these rules do not apply to the islands of Madeira, which is going on the green list, or the Azores.\nThe Hong Kong government has also announced new measures, banning all passenger flights from the UK from 1 July after adding the country to its \"extremely high risk\" group.\nSpeaking on Monday, Mr Johnson said: \"Although there are some encouraging signs and the number of deaths remains low and the number of hospitalisations remains low - though both are going up a bit - we are seeing an increase in cases.\n\"So we think it's sensible to stick to our plan to have a cautious but irreversible approach, use the next three weeks or so really to complete as much as we can of that vaccine rollout.\n\"And then with every day that goes by it's clearer to me and all our scientific advisers that we're very likely to be in a position on 19 July to say that really is the terminus, and we can go back to life as it was before Covid as far as possible.\" \nMr Javid's address, which will come less than 48 hours after taking the role following Matt Hancock's resignation, is expected in the House of Commons at about 17:30 BST.\nMr Javid said: \"I want to see the restrictions lifted and life going back to normal as quickly as possible. That is my absolute priority. I want to see those restrictions lifted as soon as we can.\n\"It's going to be irreversible, there's no going back. That's why we want to be careful during that process.\"\nHe was appointed on Saturday evening shortly after Mr Hancock resigned for breaching social distancing guidance.\nPressure had been building on Mr Hancock following the publication by the Sun of pictures and a video of him kissing his colleague Gina Coladangelo. The pair are both married with three children each.\nThere's lots of talk about encouraging data. But with infection levels climbing rapidly, how can that be? \nThe key is in the picture emerging with hospital cases and deaths. When the initial delay to step four was announced, infection rates had just started rising and government scientists were worried about what that could lead to with the vaccination programme not fully rolled out.\nThe past few weeks have provided clarity about what we can expect. The answer can be found by comparing the start of the second wave in the autumn with what is happening now. \nDuring September and October cases were rising much as they are now.\nWithin eight weeks that had translated to more than 1,000 hospital admissions a day. This time round there are just above 200.\nThere is even better news with deaths. Latest estimates show fewer than one in 1,000 infections is leading to a death. At the peak of the winter wave it was one in 60.\nThis has dramatically altered what can be considered a proportionate response to the virus - and is why a further loosening of restrictions remains on the cards.\nThe number of new coronavirus cases across the UK has continued to rise quickly in the week since what would have been \"freedom day\".\nThe UK has recorded 116,287 cases in the past seven days - a 70% increase on the previous week's total. \nA total of 22,868 cases were reported on Monday, up from 14,876 on Sunday. However, the government said Sunday's figure was lower than expected because of a delay to processing data, and that Monday's total would include outstanding cases.\nA further three deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported in the UK. There tend to be fewer deaths reported on Mondays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend.\nIn Scotland, there have been a record number of daily cases recorded with a further 3,285 cases reported on Monday - surpassing the previous high of 2,999 from Thursday.\nBut the government's decision on lifting measures will also take into account the progress of the UK's vaccination rollout.\nLatest figures show that 84.4% of adults in the UK have had their first jab and 61.9% have had their second.\nSome Conservative backbenchers have urged the government to ease controls quickly, saying the country must learn to live with Covid and that the early investment in providing a vaccine in huge numbers was always intended to achieve just that.\nMatthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health services in England, urged Mr Javid to be a \"voice of caution\" in the cabinet over the pressures the pandemic is heaping on the NHS.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The number of cases in hospital are rising... we have to keep a careful eye on it.\"\nSaffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of the NHS Providers organisation, said Mr Javid's priorities should be tackling the new surge of Covid cases, along with the \"huge spike\" in demand for emergency services and the backlog of people waiting for NHS treatment.\nProf Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told Today that if levels of protection from jabs continued then the UK should be in a \"very good position\", when asked about restrictions being lifted soon.\nHe said: \"We're looking at the data that's coming from Public Health England about the effectiveness of the vaccines and we're seeing more than 90% protection.\"\nIn Wales, the lifting of coronavirus restrictions has been paused, to be reviewed again on 15 July, while in Scotland it is hoped that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August.\nSome rules in Northern Ireland will be reviewed on 1 July."

The rules came into effect at midnight.\nThe new quarantine measures apply only to those travelling to mainland Portugal, not Madeira.\nThere were 19 flights listed as departing on Monday from UK airports to Portugal's mainland airports - Lisbon, Faro and Porto.\nBrazil, South Africa, India and Nepal were already on Portugal's quarantine list, but the exception for people who are vaccinated against Covid-19 to avoid isolating applies just to the UK.\nFrustrated would-be holidaymaker Sarah Cluskey is one of many people who have been caught out by the ever-changing travel rules.\n\"Portugal is one of our favourite holiday destinations and when it went on the green list, we decided to book,\" she told the BBC.\nSarah's husband runs a construction company and has had to work in very difficult circumstances throughout the year, she says. \nHe has been travelling into London the whole time, apart from the first three weeks of lockdown.\nAfter a stressful year, she, her husband and their two teenage daughters had been looking forward to a break in the sun.\n\"Myself and my husband have been double vaccinated, so we can still go. However, we have an 18-year-old daughter who has just received her first vaccination and a 13-year-old daughter who hasn't been vaccinated. \n\"This leaves us in a position where we can go away, but not as a family, and there will be many other people in the same situation, which is very unfair to families. \n\"This means that we have no choice now but to cancel our holiday.\"\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday the measures in Spain for UK travellers would come into effect in 72 hours and included the Balearic Islands as well.\nPortugal and mainland Spain are currently on the UK's amber list, meaning those arriving back in the UK must take two tests and quarantine for 10 days.\nThe Balearic Islands are on the UK's green list, so holidaymakers do not have to quarantine on their return.\nMalta has said only \"fully-vaccinated travellers\" will be allowed to enter the country from the UK, but children under 12 will be permitted if they are accompanied by parents or guardians who have had both doses.\nThe Maltese government has said those aged between five and 11 must also show evidence of a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours before arrival.\nThe UK government says travellers can use an NHS Covid Pass to prove their vaccination status.\nThe pass is available in digital or paper format and people can access their own pass two weeks after having a second dose of the vaccine.\nYou are eligible to get a pass if: \nThe tougher restrictions across Europe come after Germany urged the EU to restrict UK travellers.\nThe Times reported German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to designate the UK as a \"country of concern\" because the Delta variant of the coronavirus is so widespread.\nThe plans will be discussed by senior European and national officials on the EU's integrated political crisis response committee.\nThe destinations added to the green list from 04:00 BST on 30 June are:\nSix destinations will also be added to the government's red list on 30 June - the Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Haiti, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda.\nMrs Merkel previously told Germany's parliament: \"In our country, if you come from Great Britain, you have to go into quarantine - and that's not the case in every European country, and that's what I would like to see.\"\nShe is set to meet Prime Minister Boris Johnson at Chequers on Friday.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has also talked about his concern at the spread of the variant.\nCurrently, fully vaccinated UK visitors to France can enter without quarantining.\nTravelling abroad isn't just about what is on the UK's green list: other countries also have to let UK travellers in. \nIn the last few days, more countries have tightened up their restrictions on arrivals from the UK, but each has decided its own approach on a sliding scale of severity. \nSome, like Spain, have added the need for a Covid test, while others like Malta require 12-year-olds and over to quarantine if not fully vaccinated. Each country is likely to continue deciding its own individual travel policy, but if many follow Malta's example, this could majorly disrupt family holidays. \nMany countries that rely on UK tourists will be loath to increase restrictions that will stop them from travelling and policies could change during the summer as countries vaccinate more of their citizens. \nBut these changes do show that international travel is still on shaky ground. \nWith Covid still widespread in many countries, tourists will have to think carefully about their spending on holidays.\nThere is always a risk that a green-list country may move to the amber or red list. If this happens, you will need to quarantine after your holiday - something that could be difficult for many people.\nOperators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate on your return.\nIf the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there.\nIn this case, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash.\nRead more about your refund rights on holidays\nAre you planning a holiday this summer?

      "text": "The EU's chief Brexit negotiator says he is \"confident\" a solution can be found in the next 48 hours over a possible ban on chilled meat products from GB being sold in NI.\nEuropean Commission Vice President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d  has appeared before a Stormont committee.\nProducts such as chilled sausages were due to be prohibited from Thursday as a result of the NI Protocol.\nThe protocol is part of the Brexit deal that creates a border in the Irish Sea.\nIt keeps NI in the European Union single market for goods.\nThe EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states.\nBut the UK has asked the EU to delay the ban through extending a so-called grace period.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said he had been in \"intensive contact\" with the European Parliament and EU member states in recent days about the UK's request.\n\"While I cannot today announce the EU's formal agreement to the request, but after all the internal contacts I have had, I remain confident we can find a solution in the next 48 hours that will address both sides' needs and concerns,\" he said.\n\"I hope to be bringing such optimism to Northern Ireland more in the future.\"\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d also told MLAs that the EU was \"prepared to take bold steps\" on flexibilities, if the UK is committed to implementing protocol in full, including changing EU laws if necessary.\nHe repeated the EU's preference for a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement as a solution for Northern Ireland, where the UK continues to follow all EU agri-food rules. \nThe UK has previously rejected this proposal, with its negotiator Lord Frost saying it would be \"an abrogation of sovereignty\" if it involved the rules being enforced through the EU institutions.\nSpeaking later in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she welcomed the \"indication\" from Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d that the extension would be granted.\n\"We should bank that but what we need here are longer-term solutions and I hope we can find those in the period ahead,\" she added.\n\"I do think the appearance of Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d really was a positive development, I think it is really important that he does hear first-hand that the DUP doesn't speak for the north on Brexit or the Protocol.\"\nAnalysis\nThere are clearly some within the EU who think that the UK government is not serious about maintaining the protocol.\nSo Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d was saying 'yes we want to be flexible, but we also need to see the goodwill and the implementation from your side'.\nI think the two sides are still quite far apart on what sort of flexibilities are required or are necessary to make the protocol work.\nI think it's inevitable that we will see another big row blowing up at least by the autumn.\nEconomy Minister Paul Frew described the protocol as \"damaging and brutal\".\nHe told the assembly it was being used as \"punishment and leverage\" by the EU for future negotiations with the UK.\n\"There are some people here [in the assembly] who are complicit in that and that has really frustrated businesses I've spoken to over the last couple of weeks,\" he added.\nBefore the Executive Office committee meeting, the SDLP's Colin McGrath, speaking as chairman, said the committee would make sure Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d was \"fully appraised\" of what Stormont's backbench members think about the protocol.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps NI in the European Union single market for goods.\nThe EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states.\nSince January, producers in Great Britain have not been able to sell these products in the EU.\nHowever, in December 2020, the EU agreed to a six-month grace period to allow supermarkets in Northern Ireland to re-orientate supply chains away from Great Britain.\nThe UK has asked the EU to extend a grace period for chilled meats to the end of September.\nMeanwhile judgement is expected this week in a judicial review which challenged the lawfulness of the protocol.\nThe challenge was brought by a group of unionist politicians and was heard in the High Court in Belfast last month.\nOne of the applicants, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, tweeted that judgement is expected on Wednesday morning."

      "tags": "Royal Navy,Crimea,Ukraine",
      "text": "Classified Ministry of Defence documents containing details about HMS Defender and the British military have been found at a bus stop in Kent.\nOne set of documents discusses the likely Russian reaction to the ship's passage through Ukrainian waters off the Crimea coast on Wednesday.\nAnother details plans for a possible UK military presence in Afghanistan after the US-led Nato operation there ends.\nThe government said an investigation had been launched.\nThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it is investigating \"an incident in which sensitive defence papers were recovered by a member of the public\". The MoD employee concerned reported the loss at the time, it said.\nThe documents, almost 50 pages in all, were found in a soggy heap behind a bus stop in Kent early on Tuesday morning.\nA member of the public, who wishes to remain anonymous, contacted the BBC when he realised the sensitive nature of the contents.\nThe BBC believes the documents, which include emails and PowerPoint presentations, originated in the office of a senior official at the MoD. \nThe documents relating to the Royal Navy's Type 45 destroyer, HMS Defender, show that a mission described by the MoD as an \"innocent passage through Ukrainian territorial waters\", with guns covered and the ship's helicopter stowed in its hangar, was conducted in the expectation that Russia might respond aggressively.\nOn Wednesday more than 20 Russian aircraft and two coastguard ships shadowed the warship as it sailed about 12 miles (19km) off Crimea's coast.\nMoscow's defence ministry said a patrol ship fired warning shots and a jet dropped bombs in the destroyer's path but the UK government rejected this account, denying any warning shots had been fired.\nThe mission, dubbed \"Op Ditroite\", was the subject of high-level discussions as late as Monday, the documents show, with officials speculating about Russia's reaction if HMS Defender sailed close to Crimea.\n\"What do we understand about the possible 'welcome party'\u2026?\" asked an official at Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ), the UK's tri-service headquarters at Northwood.\nRecent interactions in the eastern Mediterranean between Russian forces and a Carrier Strike Group led by HMS Queen Elizabeth had been unremarkable and \"in line with expectations\", the document said.\nBut officials knew this was about to change.\n\"Following the transition from defence engagement activity to operational activity, it is highly likely that RFN (Russian navy) and VKS (Russian air force) interactions will become more frequent and assertive,\" one presentation warned.\nA series of slides prepared at PJHQ shows two routeing options, one described as \"a safe and professional direct transit from Odessa to Batumi\", including a short stretch through a \"Traffic Separation Scheme\" (TSS) close to the south-west tip of Crimea. \nThis route, one slide concluded, would \"provide an opportunity to engage with the Ukrainian government\u2026 in what the UK recognises as Ukrainian territorial waters.\"\nThree potential Russian responses were outlined, from \"safe and professional\" to \"neither safe nor professional\". \nIn the event, Russia chose to react aggressively, with radio warnings, coastguard vessels closing to within 100 metres and repeated buzzing by warplanes.\nAn alternative route was considered, which would have kept HMS Defender well away from contested waters. \nThis would have avoided confrontation, the presentation noted, but ran the risk of being portrayed by Russia as evidence of \"the UK being scared/running away\", allowing Russia to claim that the UK had belatedly accepted Moscow's claim to Crimean territorial waters.\n\"As the public would expect, the Ministry of Defence plans carefully,\" an MoD spokesperson said. \n\"As a matter of routine, that includes analysing all the potential factors affecting operational decisions.\"\nAlongside the military planning, officials anticipated competing versions of events.\n\"We have a strong, legitimate narrative\", they said, noting that the presence of the embedded journalists (from the BBC and Daily Mail) on board the destroyer \"provides an option for independent verification of HMS Defender's action\".\nFollowing the controversy generated by HMS Defender's mission, the documents discovered in Kent confirm that passage through the TSS was a calculated decision by the British government to make a show of support for Ukraine, despite the possible risks involved. \nWas this gunboat diplomacy?\nIt was certainly the use of a warship in pursuit of diplomatic goals. But its primary objective was not to \"poke the Russian bear\" (a phrase and sentiment conspicuously absent from the documents). This was all about freedom of navigation and a clear endorsement of Ukraine's sovereignty, following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.\nUnder the terms of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the passage of a foreign ship is regarded as \"innocent\" when \"it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order, or security of the coastal state.\"\nIn the eyes of much of the world, that state is Ukraine, not Russia.\nThe documents don't stop there. \nThe bundle includes updates on arms exports campaigns, including sensitive observations about areas where Britain might find itself competing with European allies.\nThere's a whiff of post-Brexit anxiety in comments attributed to \"SofS\" (Defence Secretary Ben Wallace), who insists that the six-member European Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), of which Britain is a member, \"must not be hijacked\" by \"entryism\" from the European Commission. \nAnd there are briefing notes for last Monday's session of the UK-US Defence Dialogue, including observations on President Joe Biden's first months in office. \nThe Biden administration's early focus on China and the Indo-Pacific, they say, show \"there is still much continuity from the previous administration.\"\nThere are also suggestions of what Britain should be asking for.\n\"We should use the meeting to see how much the administration is prepared to share, or whether its stated ambition of consulting more with allies is truer in principle than in practice.\"\nMost of the papers are marked \"official sensitive\", a relatively low level of classification used, according to the government, \"where there is a clear and justifiable requirement to reinforce the 'need to know'\".\nBut one document, addressed to Ben Wallace's private secretary, and marked \"Secret UK Eyes Only\", outlines highly sensitive recommendations for the UK's military footprint in Afghanistan, following the end of Operation Resolute Support, the Nato operation currently winding down in the wake of President Biden's decision earlier this year to withdraw American forces. \nThe document discusses an American request for British assistance in several specific areas, and addresses the question of whether any British special forces will remain in Afghanistan once the withdrawal is complete.\nMedia reports have already suggested Britain is considering leaving some forces behind. \nDue to the sensitivity of the document, the BBC has decided not to report details which could endanger the security of British and other personnel in Afghanistan.\nBut amid reports of a worsening security situation in the country, it sounds several warnings.\n\"Any UK footprint in Afghanistan that persists... is assessed to be vulnerable to targeting by a complex network of actors,\" it says, noting that \"the option to withdraw completely remains.\"\nAfghanistan, it says, is already becoming more dangerous. \nThe reduced presence of Nato forces \"is already impairing the situational awareness that we (and the US) used to enjoy across the country\". \nNo Britons have been killed in Afghanistan since the US-Taliban deal in February 2020, it says, but \"this would be unlikely to remain the status quo\".\nRarely has a collection of lost documents covered such a wide range of important areas. This is a major embarrassment for the Ministry of Defence, which is currently carrying out a detailed investigation into how the papers came to be lying on a street corner, in the rain, in the early hours of Tuesday morning.\nJohn Healey, Labour's shadow defence secretary, said he was surprised documents had got out of the Ministry of Defence at all. He said he wants Mr Wallace to complete the investigation quickly and report to the House of Commons this week to reassure the public that no military operations had been put at risk."

      "title": "Covid in Scotland: Can we stop worrying about high case numbers?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Vaccination is offering Scotland the \"route out\" of the pandemic, according to Nicola Sturgeon. The first minister told MSPs this week that the link between new cases and the serious health harms caused by the virus hasn't gone away - but it is weakening significantly.\nScotland recorded 2999 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday - a record high. What do recent figures show us about this link? And does this mean we no longer have to worry about case numbers?\nCases are rising fast - and there are no signs yet that the rate of new infections is slowing.\nScotland had been enjoying a sustained decline in the number of new Covid-19 cases, but that all changed on 5 May.\nSince then, the number of new Covid cases per day has mainly been rising, and at an increasing pace in recent days.\nOn 5 May, the number of cases detected over the previous seven days was 1,046. By 23 June, this figure had gone up to 11,067 - a 10-fold increase.\nScotland also has the highest case rate among all of the UK nations, reaching almost 203 cases per 100,000 people on Wednesday.\nThe sharp rise is being driven by the more infectious Delta variant, first identified in India, which accounts for more than 90% of new cases in the UK, according to the UK government.\nHowever, the Scottish government says fewer people are being treated in hospital for Covid illness now and fewer people are dying, despite this increase.\nIn short, yes.\nBut according to the government's analysis, only about 5% of people who are infected end up in hospital, rather than the 10% we were seeing before vaccination started to offer us protection.\nPeople are also staying hospital for shorter periods after being admitted.\nThe easiest way to see this is in a graph which shows the link between new cases and the number of people in hospital being treated for Covid.\nDuring the outbreaks in the autumn and over the winter, the daily figure on hospital occupancy has closely tracked the daily cases figure, but it's different this time.\nThe number of people in hospital is trending upwards, but the gap between the two lines is obvious.\nTo draw a comparison with the end of 2020, when the average number of new cases being recorded a day was similar to now, there were 1,174 Covid patients in hospital. On 23 June, there were 170.\nPublic Health Scotland publishes data on daily hospital admissions of people with a positive test for Covid, and again there appears to be a different pattern this time.\nOn 28 August, as the second wave took hold in Scotland, an average of seven people were being admitted a day. It was a similar figure on 5 May 2021, as the Delta variant began to drive a new wave of cases.\nThis next chart compares hospital admissions from those dates.\nFor the first three weeks there is not much difference at all between the two lines, but then the rate of new admissions in the autumn begins to rise at a much faster rate.\nThere is generally a lag of several weeks between new cases and Covid-related deaths, which means it is harder to draw firm conclusions on whether the link between the two figures is weakening.\nCertainly, the number of new death certificates mentioning Covid-19 in Scotland has been reasonably stable over the last few weeks.\nHowever, the rate of new deaths in the autumn did not begin to rise fast until the latter half of October - six to eight weeks after case numbers began going up.\nIn the seven days up to 6 September just two death certificates mentioned Covid-19, the lowest figure in any week since the pandemic began in Scotland.\nAfter that, weekly deaths began to rise, with 76 recorded in the seven days up to 18 October.\nLast week, there were 13 death certificates mentioning Covid-19, according to the National Records of Scotland - three weeks after this spring's low of four deaths in the middle of May.\nWhat happens to this rate in the next few weeks will give a clearer indication on how much the link with deaths has weakened.\nLinda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland she was expecting the number of deaths to go up.\n\"We will see more deaths if cases continue to increase and we're going to see those deaths in two groups - the unprotected by full vaccination and, in a small number of cases, people who have had both doses, because the vaccines are not 100% protective,\" she said. \n\"So I think it will go up, but I'm hoping that it won't go anywhere near where we were before.\"\nIn the first minister's statement to Holyrood on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon announced a \"revised strategic framework\" for tackling Covid, which took into account the protection being offered by vaccination against Covid sickness.\nShe said that previously the Scottish government was intent on suppressing the virus to the \"lowest possible level\", but this has been replaced with an aim of suppressing the virus \"to a level consistent with alleviating its harms\".\nThis essentially means that higher numbers of cases will be tolerated than in past waves of the pandemic.\nThe Scottish government's new strategy reflects the latest guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) on public health and social measures to tackle Covid.\nIn this document, the WHO says the focus can shift from case numbers to hospital admissions and intensive care rates in countries where the most vulnerable are fully vaccinated - a position Scotland will be in by next week, according to the first minister.\nBut there is a balance to be struck here.\nIf case rates are allowed to get completely out of control, then pressure will inevitably increase on the NHS and more will die, Prof Bauld said.\n\"If we really see these numbers continue to increase, it's still going to translate into some hospital admissions and people becoming very unwell.\n\"So we've just got to hold the course for a few more weeks and try and send the behavioural message that this is not a free-for-all - we all need to do our bit.\"\nA high case rate also increases the risk of new variants of concern emerging - ones that are more infectious, more deadly or which are resistant to current vaccines.\nThe WHO's document says that some form of Covid restrictions - for example isolating after a positive test - will need to be used \"for the foreseeable future\".\n\"Things are improving but it's not going away,\" Prof Bauld said.\n\"Into the winter months we're still going to have to have some mitigations... there may be [restrictions] that are put in place again, rather than everything just continuing open indefinitely.\"\nAnd Prof Bauld also cautioned against governments coming up with an acceptable death rate for Covid-19.\n\"I think there's pressure on politicians to come up with a number of tolerable deaths from this disease in the future and quite rightly they're resisting that,\" she said.\n\"There are also these constant comparisons with flu which is unfortunate, because its much more deadly than influenza - and more transmissible.\"\nThe vaccination programme has been operating for more than six months and has been made possible thanks to the hundreds of people who give the jabs. If you are one of those vaccinators, we'd like to hear from you. Why did you get involved and how many jabs have you administered? \nYou can now get in touch with BBC Scotland on the phone messaging service, WhatsApp. \nTo start using the app, simply download WhatsApp on to your smartphone free from the internet.\nThen add our WhatsApp number +44 7902 704679 to your phone's contact list.\nPlease make sure you read our terms of use and privacy policy."

      "text": "Nissan is to announce a major expansion of battery production in Sunderland creating thousands of new jobs both directly and in the supply chain. \nThe firm, which already makes the Leaf electric car in Sunderland, may also announce the launch of a brand new electric model. \nThe government is contributing to the overall cost of the project, which is expected to cost hundreds of millions.\nThe size of the government contribution has not been disclosed. \nAs a person familiar with the deal put it, the government announced a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, so it was prepared to support the transition.\nIt is hoped the new plant will be producing batteries in time for 2024 when the level of UK-made components in UK-made cars is required to start increasing in line with the terms of the UK's trade deal with the European Union - where most of Nissan's Sunderland-assembled cars are sold.\nIndustry sources expect the scale and size of the new facility may closely match that of a new facility in Douai, France recently announce by Renault - which is a major shareholder in Nissan and a partner in a global manufacturing alliance. \nThe government is also in talks with Vauxhall to secure production of electric vehicles at its Ellesmere Port plant. The BBC understands those talks are \"going positively\" and an announcement is expected in the next few weeks.\nThe market for electric cars is expanding rapidly.\nBut earlier this month, influential green group Transport and Environment (T&E) said the UK risked being left behind in the race to build electric cars.\nThe Brussels-based campaign group said that as recently as 2018, the UK produced roughly half of all electric cars built in Europe.\nBut it claimed a lack of investment by UK manufacturers meant that by the end of the decade that figure could fall to just 4%.\nT&E also said Nissan's expansion plans for Sunderland - which would reportedly see the plant having a capacity of 6.5 Gigawatt hours (GWh) - amounted to \"a tiny fraction of the 474GWh of production at 17 sites across Europe for which funding has already been secured\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nWith just a fortnight to go until the planned lifting of all coronavirus rules in England, new Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said he sees \"no reason to go beyond\" the target date of 19 July. In his first statement to MPs since starting the job, Mr Javid said \"no date we choose comes with zero risk for Covid\" but that the aim was for two-thirds of UK adults to have had both doses by 19 July. And he said vaccines are working against the Delta variant first identified in India. More about the lockdown easing plan here - including details for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where lockdown easing is happening at different paces.\nA new study in the UK has found that mixing doses of the coronavirus vaccines gives people a robust immune response against the virus. The trial compared people with two doses of Pfizer or two of AstraZeneca, with people who had been given one of each. All combinations worked well, the research found - although deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said while there was no reason to change the UK rollout, it could be considered in the future.\nWe've heard a lot about the UK's traffic light system for foreign travel, but that's only half the obstacle to going abroad. Many countries have their own strict rules on letting Britons in, and Portugal, Malta and Hong Kong have now tightened their restrictions. People travelling from the UK to mainland Portugal now have to quarantine for 14 days unless they can prove they were fully vaccinated at least a fortnight ago, while Malta has said only \"fully-vaccinated travellers\" will be allowed to enter the country from the UK. More on travel rules here, or there's a guide to holidays in Spain, Portugal, Malta and other popular spots here.\nAustralia - which has managed to keep coronavirus cases low throughout the pandemic - is now seeing a spike across the country. It is the first time in months that cases have emerged in multiple parts of the country at the same time, with outbreaks in the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia, as well as cases of the Delta variant in Sydney. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been holding emergency talks to discuss measures such as mandatory vaccinations for care home workers and new quarantine rules. \nIt has been the first day of Wimbledon - and among the VIPs invited to watch the action on Centre Court were some of the scientists who had worked on the Covid vaccine. When the announcer pointed them out, the crowd erupted into a rousing standing ovation. Prof Sarah Gilbert - the architect of the Oxford vaccine who you can read about here - could be seen looking around the court and smiling.

      "text": "Drivers face a 50mph speed limit on a stretch of one of Wales' key roads - despite \u00a3336m being spent on the new dual carriageway.\nA consultation will decide the limit for the five-mile (8km) part of the A465 Heads of the Valleys road.\nIt means that after seven years of work to widen the road, set to be finished by autumn, drivers could be asked to use the same speed as it had before.\nThe Welsh government said the limit was in the interest of road safety.\nThe upgrade of the stretch between Brynmawr and Gilwern is part of the Welsh government's more than \u00a3800m upgrade programme for the road to turn the whole route from Monmouthshire to Neath Port Talbot into dual carriageways, which usually have a 70mph speed limit.\nThe current phase through the Clydach Gorge is Wales' biggest road building project but has caused controversy as it is costing taxpayers about \u00a3100m more than planned - and has run three years over the original schedule.\nMotorists, like 21-year-old trainee pharmacy technician Liv Hoskins, have had to put up with traffic congestion and 40mph speed limits as the road between Brynmawr in Blaenau Gwent and Abergavenny in Monmouthshire is upgraded. \n\"Where I live in Ebbw Vale, you used to be able to get from Ebbw Vale down to Abergavenny in about 10 minutes,\" said Ms Hoskins, who uses the route on her way to work in the Somerset resort of Weston-super-Mare.\n\"Now, you've got to allow at least 25 minutes. It's frustrating. The speed limit and flow of traffic on a single carriageway road has been a complete nightmare from start to finish.\n\"When you think about all the years that we've had to put up with the slower speed limit.\n\"I read on the consultation paperwork that they've said due to the engineering design, a 50mph speed limit was more suitable.\n\"It makes me wonder why they built a road that's only suitable for 50mph in this day and age.\"\nThe Welsh government said the proposed speed limit, similar to the old stretch of road, was \"in the interest of road safety\" and aimed to \"reduce the scheme's environmental impact.\"\nThe project has been difficult with the government saying more than 400 Olympic pools of material being excavated.\nThe difficult terrain, plus a dispute with contractor Costain, meant the project has gone more than \u00a3100m over budget.\nKeith Jones, director of the Institute for Civil Engineers In Wales, said the limit was linked to the road's design.\n\"If you have quite a difficult terrain, then you can flatten it out so you can travel faster, so people can see any obstacles in the way, a long way away,\" he said.\n\"But to do that you would be eating into the existing ground which would raise the cost.\"\nGiven budgetary \"concerns and challenges\", Mr Jones said it was a balance between \"flattening out the road and allowing the cars to go faster, and keeping the cost down.\"\nBrynmawr councillor John Hill thinks for safety the limit should be 50mph, but understood concerns.\n\"People have had a real hard time for the last six or seven years, people have got really frustrated with this road,\" he said. \n\"So now, you say to people, 'Yes, after all that seven years, you still can't do more than 50mph,' that is going to really upset people.\"\nHe understood it seemed \"an awful lot of money\" for the same limit but said: \"Safety is paramount.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives feared the 50mph speed limit - rather than the 70mph limit normally adopted on dual carriageways - could increase congestion.\n\"Saying that they want to save the environment but making life difficult for those of us who live here on a day-to-day basis is not good for anybody,\" said Natasha Ashgar, the Tories' transport spokeswoman. \n\"Frankly, I don't think drivers should be punished.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"The speed limit on the A465 has always been 50mph.\"\nIt said traffic flow would be improved, journeys would be faster and safer, and there would be less environmental impact."

      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,LGBT,Chile,Canada",
      "text": "Catholic nun, gay and militant. Bridget Coll, Irish born but a proud Canadian, was a trailblazer. \nShe and her partner, Chris Morrissey, made history when they challenged Canadian immigration law which had only recognised heterosexual married partners.\nAs nuns in the 1980s, they stood with the oppressed in Chile against dictator Augusto Pinochet's regime.\nHers is an inspirational journey. She travelled thousands of miles in just one lifetime.\nNow, her story features in a new exhibition in Dublin telling the stories of Ireland's LGBTQ+ diaspora.\nBridget died in 2016. Her life partner, activist and former nun, Chris, survives her.\nHistorian Dr Maurice Casey, who curated the exhibition, came upon their story by chance. He had set out to celebrate an LGBTQ+ history of the Irish emigration story.\nHe was researching the Canadian LGBTQ+ community and was inspired by a series of tapes held by Simon Fraser University recorded in 2009, through which the women tell their story.\nThere is wit and wisdom, a generosity and a humility about Bridget Coll that shines through on the tape recordings from 12 years ago.\nShe talks about how she was born in Donegal in 1934, one of 12 children from a Catholic family who grew up near Fanad lighthouse. She never questioned her sexuality.\n\"I didn't even know that queer existed,\" she said.\nAt 14, she wanted to be a nun and at 16, joined an order in England.\nFrom there, she went to America to work for the Franciscan Missionaries of St Joseph.\nThat was where the first seeds of dissent were sown.\n\"There was an encyclical on birth control from the Pope. The priest gave a whole sermon from the pulpit about how it was a real bad thing to do,\" she said in the recording. \n\"I had a lot of contact with mothers of kids that I taught. They would come and tell me their stories about birth control. I listened to the women's stories and their hardships.\n\"For the first time in my life, I began to doubt the teachings of the Church.\"\nShe was drawn to read more about social justice and liberation theology - a radical movement that grew up in South America as a response to the poverty and ill-treatment of ordinary people. \nThe Liberationists said the Church should act to bring about social change and should ally itself with the working class. \nIt was at that time that Bridget became close to Chris, a Canadian nun in the same order.\nWhen Bridget's parents died within weeks of each other in 1977, Chris was the one person who truly helped. \n\"She said she was a lesbian and asked: 'Do you know what that is?' I said: 'No'. \n\"She said: 'I think you're a lesbian'. I didn't know the word - that was the first time I knew.\n\"It was 1977, I was 43, that's the first time I ever heard it and the first time I fell in love with a woman.\"\nBridget knew she wanted to work in Chile and asked her superior to go there.\n\"Remember you're going to preach the gospel, not to meddle in politics,\" she was told.\nChris went with her to Chile in 1981. They lived in a shack in a shanty town joining whatever struggles people were experiencing. \nThey encouraged women to stand up for themselves in a strongly patriarchal society, and got the name of \"home wreckers\" for it, Bridget joked.\nThey joined an anti-torture movement. They never knew the second names of the other members - if they were tortured then they could not reveal names.\nOne day, a letter came from their religious superior. The order was celebrating an anniversary with a garden party.\nHow would they celebrate in Chile? There was a big protest against Pinochet that day; Bridget and Chris joined it. \n\"I realised how distant I was from them [the Order],\" she said. \nAfter much soul searching, the women left their congregation in 1989 and headed for Vancouver to live openly as a couple.\nBut Chris could not sponsor Bridget as a Canadian immigrant because they were lesbians. In 1992, she initiated a constitutional challenge, and won.\n\"It was on the local news at six o'clock, then it was on the national news that evening... it was something about Gorbachev first and then these two lesbians in Vancouver,\" said Bridget.\nThe women campaigned for LGBTQ+ rights.\nChris Morrissey has loving memories of her partner, and says she must listen again to those tape recordings Bridget made in 2009.\nShe remembers their first protest in Chile. They had to be fast. It was dangerous.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI from her home in Vancouver, Chris recalls Bridget urging them to get there quickly.\n\"The protest lasted only three minutes.

      "text": "The mother of a baby killed when a van hit his pram said she had \"waited such a long time\" to have her \"perfect\" son. \nRachael Thorold was pushing five-month-old Louis in his pram by the A10 in Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, on 22 January, when they were hit.\nMrs Thorold spent 118 days in hospital with multiple broken bones and a brain injury.\nShe said she was determined to get back to the person her son \"was totally in love with\".\nHer husband Chris said it was \"quite miraculous\" his wife survived and medics did not expect her to \"survive the first 72 hours\".\nMrs Thorold suffered a brain injury, which clinicians were \"most worried about\", as well as a skull fracture, broken cheek bones, a broken jaw, a number of broken vertebrae, a broken arm, pelvis, hip, and bones just below the knee.\nAt the time of the incident Mrs Thorold was on maternity leave, which she \"totally adored... and enjoyed being a mum\".\n\"It's what I'd waited such a long time to happen. We had quite a long journey through IVF to have him, but he was perfect,\" she said.\nThe 36-year-old, who does not remember the crash, said her grief was an \"ongoing process\" that \"will probably take me many, many years, probably the rest of my life to get over\".\nShe said her motivation was to \"get back to who I was and that's the person who Louis was totally in love with and hopefully I can get back to being that\".\nMrs Thorold said she was physically \"better\" but her issues were mostly muscular and \"quite significant\".\nHaving suffered a brain injury, she said mentally she was \"reasonably all right, just a bit slower than what I used to be\".\nShe is undergoing rehab which will continue for the rest of the year, but in 2022 she would \"like to be in a good position to start thinking about hopefully having a family\".\n\"Obviously we are at our lowest point now but hopefully we can get back close to where we were,\" she added.\nMr Thorold has set up the Louis Thorold Foundation with the aim of preventing infant pedestrian deaths.\nThe charity has so far raised nearly \u00a350,000 and he said there were \"too many statistics of children dying on the roads\".\nLouis died after the van left the road, having collided with a car on the A10.\nCambridgeshire Police said an investigation was ongoing.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "Sajid Javid has said he wants to see a return to normal \"as quickly as possible\" after replacing Matt Hancock as health secretary. \nSpeaking on Sunday, Mr Javid said he would do all he could to \"deliver for the people of this great country\".\nHis appointment comes after Mr Hancock stood down on Saturday for breaching Covid rules by kissing a colleague.\nMr Javid, who has had several key government roles, said his predecessor had worked \"incredibly hard\".\nHis return to the cabinet comes 16 months after his shock resignation as chancellor.\nBut Labour criticised the appointment, saying he had been an \"architect of austerity\" that weakened the NHS.\nMr Hancock announced his resignation after pressure had been building for him to quit following the publication by the Sun of pictures and a video of him and Gina Coladangelo, who are both married with three children, kissing. \nThe newspaper said the images had been taken inside the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on 6 May. \nFollowing the revelations, a number of Conservative MPs, as well as Labour and the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, had called for Mr Hancock to go. \nMs Coladangelo is also leaving her role as a non-executive director at the DHSC.\nMr Hancock has ended his 15-year marriage to his wife, Martha, and the relationship with Ms Coladangelo is understood to be a serious one.\nMr Javid's return to a senior cabinet role comes after he abruptly left government in February last year, a month before he was due to deliver his first Budget.\nAt the time, the prime minister ordered him to fire his closest aides and replace them with advisers chosen by Number 10 if he wanted to remain in post - conditions he said he was \"unable to accept\".\nMr Javid, who had clashed with the prime minister's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, chose to quit instead and was replaced by his former deputy at the Treasury, Rishi Sunak.\nSpeaking on Sunday to reporters, Mr Javid said Mr Hancock had achieved \"a lot\" in the role, adding \"I'm sure he will have more to offer in public life\".\nHe said: \"I was honoured to take up this position. I also know that it comes with huge responsibility, and I will do everything I can to make sure that I deliver for the people of this great country. \n\"We are still in a pandemic and I want to see that come to an end as soon as possible, and that will be my most immediate priority to see that we can return to normal as soon and as quickly as possible.\"\nOn Sunday the UK reported a further 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and a further 14,876 cases of Covid-19. Due to a technical issue the data from England was incomplete with any outstanding cases to be reported on Monday.\nIt is, of course, stating the obvious to say Sajid Javid has a full in-tray as the new health secretary in England.\nWhile we may be over the worst of the pandemic, there is still some way to go before life returns to normal.\nFor one thing hospital admissions for Covid are rising - not enough to overwhelm the NHS but enough to disrupt the recovery of other services like cancer care and routine surgery.\nThe NHS in England is also in the process of recruiting a new chief executive, while the UK Health Security Agency is being set up and absorbing some of the work of key agencies involved in the pandemic response, such as NHS Test and Trace and Public Health England.\nThen there is the long-term reform of the NHS that was announced earlier this year, which is overhauling some of the management structures of the health service by creating integrated organisations bringing together hospital and community teams.\nIf that was not enough, there is growing pressure on the government to finally come up with plans for the funding of social care - something governments of all colours have been promising to do since the turn of the century.\nIn a video on Twitter explaining why he had resigned, Mr Hancock said he understood the \"enormous sacrifices that everybody in this country has made, that you have made, and those of us who make these rules have got to stick by them and that's why I have got to resign\".\nIn his resignation letter, he apologised to his family and loved ones for \"putting them through this\".\nIn response, the prime minister said Mr Hancock \"should leave office very proud of what you have achieved - not just in tackling the pandemic, but even before Covid-19 struck us\".\nBut Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said the prime minister should have sacked Mr Hancock on Friday, when the revelations first emerged. \n\"Boris Johnson should have had the guts, the spine, the awareness, the judgement to sack [Matt Hancock] on Friday,\" he told BBC Breakfast on Sunday. \nMr Ashworth added that Mr Hancock's record on care homes, PPE, test and trace and sick pay for those isolating during the pandemic was \"a damning legacy\".\nHe also criticised Mr Javid's appointment, saying \"given his record on austerity, it's a bit like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop\".\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association Union, said Mr Javid would face a \"baptism of fire\" in his new role without the normal phased handover other health secretaries enjoyed. \nThe healthcare workforce was \"absolutely exhausted\" after working through the pandemic and there was a \"backlog crisis\" of more than five million patients waiting for treatment, he said.\nBut the first priority for Mr Javid will be overseeing the vaccination programme, Mr Nagpaul said, adding: \"He needs to make sure that every day counts because until we've vaccinated the adult population we are not going to be able to see our way through this pandemic.\"   \nBefore serving as chancellor, Mr Javid was home secretary. \nHe has also led the housing, communities, business and culture departments.\nOne of his first jobs as health secretary will be to examine the data ahead of England's proposed end to Covid restrictions on 19 July.\nFormer health secretary Jeremy Hunt described his appointment as an \"excellent choice\", saying it was the best possible news for social care because his time at the Department for Communities and Local Government meant he \"gets it\"."

Some may now cease trading and let staff go,\" he said. \n\"Business support should be extended such as full furlough and full business rates relief.\"\nA spokeswoman for the government said that the furlough scheme, introduced at the start of the first nationwide lockdown, was still in place until September and \"is amongst the most generous schemes in the world\", providing \u00a365bn of support and protecting 11.5 million jobs.\n\"The government will continue pay 70% of workers' wages over July, with businesses asked to cover just 10%,\" she added,\n\"They can also continue to access additional support, including restart grants worth up to \u00a318,000 per business, and business rates relief and a cut to VAT - both in place until March 2022.\""

The BBC understands those talks are \"going positively\" and an announcement is expected in the next few weeks.\nThe market for electric cars is expanding rapidly.\nBut earlier this month, influential green group Transport and Environment (T&E) said the UK risked being left behind in the race to build electric cars.\nThe Brussels-based campaign group said that as recently as 2018, the UK produced roughly half of all electric cars built in Europe.\nBut it claimed a lack of investment by UK manufacturers meant that by the end of the decade that figure could fall to just 4%.\nT&E also said Nissan's expansion plans for Sunderland - which would reportedly see the plant having a capacity of 6.5 Gigawatt hours (GWh) - amounted to \"a tiny fraction of the 474GWh of production at 17 sites across Europe for which funding has already been secured\"."

The country was said to have had the highest virus rate in Europe last week.\nA new online portal has also launched to allow all adults in Scotland who have not received a Covid vaccine to self-register for their first dose."

      "text": "Hospitality, wedding and night-time entertainment businesses have reacted with horror to the delay in England's full reopening until 19 July.\nOne nightclub owner told the BBC he had been closed since March last year and had a full diary of events planned over the next few weeks, which he'll now have to cancel, losing thousands of pounds in revenue. \nDavid Whittall, who runs the nightclub and live music venue Suki10c in Digbeth, Birmingham, now has no way to pay the bills in June, he said.\nAnd wedding planners said the continuation of some restrictions meant couples were likely to defer their weddings again.\n\"The sold-out events that we had booked in - that's what was going to get us through because we would have made revenue, we would have had profit, we would have been able to pay our bills. Now we don't have anything,\" Mr Whittall says.\nHe stresses that the government needs to announce financial support, but it cannot be along the same lines as the Culture Recovery Fund, \"because it takes too long to get the money\".\n\"If we don't get financial support, I don't want to think about what the alternative is,\" he says. \nChris Jowsey is the chief executive of community pub firm Admiral Taverns, which has more than 1,000 pubs across the UK. \n\"For many licensees, the situation is desperate because Covid restrictions are massively hindering pubs from trading profitably - if the regulations have to continue then we need the government to step in and offer extra support to the hospitality industry,\" he says.\n\"Licensees are losing money because they are having to hire extra staff members to cope with restrictions like table service and social distancing.\"\nThe British Beer and Pub Association has warned that four additional weeks of restrictions will cost pubs \u00a3400m. It says pubs must be allowed to \"open properly\" on 19 July. \nMr Whittall says he is surprised the prime minister didn't announce any additional financial support: \"We've got bills that need paying now... I'm not sure what we're supposed to do now.\"\nA spokesman for the Treasury said: \"We are committed to helping businesses and individuals through the pandemic and deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty over the coming months.\n\"The furlough scheme and support for the self-employed is in place until September and eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief of 75% over the year, VAT cuts and the Recovery Loan Scheme.\"\nWedding venues and planners have told the BBC that the government's announcement about unlimited guest numbers being permitted has provided some relief, but they are still deeply worried about the future of their industry. \nMatthew Shaw, founder and creative director at Sauveur, a creative events and luxury wedding planning studio in London, has already been on the phone to his clients, who are confused about what they are allowed to do at their weddings.\nMany are upset about the fact they cannot have a dance floor indoors and they want to cancel the bands they have booked, Matthew says, which puts pressure on the suppliers Sauveur works with.\n\"Dance floors and drinks receptions are the things people want,\" he tells the BBC. \n\"It's great to have a meal, to be with people, but when you take away the key elements of what make a wedding special...people don't want to spend the money on it anymore.\"\nEarlier this year, his marquee supplier went under. That means he will have to try to forge relationships with new suppliers, while hoping the existing ones are still coping and are resilient when clients pull the plug or decide to postpone their events. \nMr Shaw says that the last year has taken a toll on his mental health and that of his staff, clients and suppliers: \"I've spent sleepless nights wondering whether events will still be able to run, and whether we will still be able to get new clients, after watching new and existing clients drop away.\"\nSarah Callander Beckett, owner of wedding venue Combermere Abbey in Cheshire, agrees with Mr Shaw.\nThey say some clients might prefer to defer their weddings again. But this creates an additional headache as the calendar for the rest of this year and into next year is already pretty packed for many businesses in the industry.\n\"These are some difficult decisions we'll have to facilitate as a business in the next few days managing expectations and emotions,\" Ms Beckett says. \"Ideally what we want to see is also the return of dancing and mingling amongst guests.\"\nKeith Marsden is the landlord of the Prince of Wales pub in Moseley, Birmingham. \nHe says that social distancing has proved a significant challenge and a continuation of restrictions will deeply impact his bottom line.\nMr Marsden recently had his worst day of trading since he started the business, with takings of just \u00a396.\n\"With social distancing whether you're inside or outside, you just cannot get the capacity,\" he says. \"We're operating at about one-third of our capacity, so we just cannot do the numbers to make a profit.\"\nHe says that people have fallen out of the habit of going to the pub: \"We're hanging in there but we're in serious trouble.\n\"It really will be the final nail in the coffin for many.\"\nHe's also worried about the financial challenges ahead, and the debt that he and others in the industry have built up.\n\"If you come in here on a busy weekend you think, oh yeah they're doing quite nicely, but beneath the surface there's lots of problems lurking,\" says Mr Marsden.\n\"People haven't aggressively chased debt, landlords have let people off with rent, business rates holidays, things like that. They're now coming to the surface.\"\nThe Nationwide Caterers Association (NCASS), which represents caterers in the festival and events sectors, including mobile and street food businesses, is also calling on the government to provide immediate financial support. \n\"Festival caterers will still not be able to work after already losing the 2020 season - it is devastating for the sector as a whole,\" the industry body's director Mark Laurie says.\n\"There are ten of thousands of businesses involved in the festival industry who are going to suffer huge losses.\"\nLatest research from Live, the trade body for the UK live events sector, suggests the industry faces losses of more than \u00a3500m as at least 5,000 shows will be cancelled.\n\"Any delay to the 21 June reopening date will have significant and immediate repercussions, including 248 grassroots music venues that would face an immediate threat of eviction without a comprehensive response from the government that fully addresses their financial losses from delayed reopening,\" the trade body has warned. \nMr Laurie says that caterers have had \"little to no help\" from the government or local authorities: \"The Additional Restrictions Grants (ARG) for those without fixed premises won't work to support theses businesses and so that must be addressed.\n\"NCASS is calling on the government to publish the results of the Events Research Programme, to provide immediate financial support to affected businesses and provide a clear way forward.\"\nIt is a terrible three-way balancing act - a race not just between the vaccine and the variant, but also viability of thousands of businesses. A cost-benefit analysis without many benefits.\nThe signalling of 21 June as \"freedom day\" was meant to give businesses long-term confidence to plan staffing, stocking and reversing the mothballing of their hospitality venues. Indoor venues will incur substantial losses over the next month.\nThe message from the government is that the support package they put in place at the Budget already accounted for this eventuality. \nThe furlough scheme has begun a slow phase-out, whereas in many other similar countries, employer contributions are already required, or the schemes have ended. \nMinisters also point at the strength of the economic bounce-back and record hiring and vacancy statistics. But that will come as little comfort to industries now shut for 15 months, such as nightclubs. \nLocal authorities have yet to allocate \u00a31bn, about half of the discretionary fund.\nThe ideal picture, as the prime minister put it, is that they will not be rolling back any of the currently implemented roadmap. \nAs we know, the impact on the economy comes not just from mandatory lockdowns, but from voluntary social distancing as consumers stay away from crowded places if they feel the virus is out of control. \nOn two crucial occasions last March and last Autumn, the government chose to prioritise economic reopening, with consequences for the scale of the outbreak that followed, which in turn definitively failed to be of any benefit to the economy. \nThis time it appears they are learning a lesson from recent history, and proceeding cautiously. \nThe calculation is that the immediate extra economic pain will be outweighed by fewer deaths and a confident irreversible reopening in a month's time."

The TPLF has so far ignored the ceasefire saying it's intent on driving out all so-called \"invading enemies\". \u00a0\nThat means not just the Ethiopian troops, but the Amhara militia and Eritrean forces who have been fighting alongside the Ethiopian army. \u00a0\nThe international community will be watching to see whether the ceasefire is a turning point, and in particular, whether humanitarian groups can now travel freely in the region to deliver supplies to the millions of people in desperate need of food. \nA federal official told AFP news agency that the interim administration in Mekelle had decided to leave on Monday after rebels closed in \"on every side\".\nLocals are celebrating. One eyewitness quoted by AFP said: \"Everybody is out of their house. Everybody is excited and they have music on the streets.\"\nEthiopia's government said it was calling a military ceasefire for humanitarian reasons. It pointed to the need for aid workers to gain access, for farmers to get help during the planting season and for the return of internally displaced people. \nThe UK, the US and Ireland have called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting.\nAll sides in the conflict have been accused of carrying out mass killings and human rights violations.\nThe status of Eritrean troops remains unclear, although one resident of the town of Shire told Reuters the Eritreans appeared to be moving north, towards the border.\nEarlier this month, the UN described a situation of famine in northern Ethiopia. The UN's World Food Programme (WFP), Food and Agriculture Organization and Unicef have all called for urgent action.\nHowever Ethiopia's government has denied that there is a famine in the country.\nEthiopia is still awaiting the results of its 21 June parliamentary elections. Boycotted by some opposition groups and not held in some regions, including Tigray, they are expected to favour Mr Abiy."

      "title": "Clouds of Venus 'simply too dry' to support life",
      "text": "It's not possible for life to exist in the clouds of Venus. \nIt's simply too dry, says an international research team led from Queen's University Belfast, UK.\nHopes had been raised last year that microbes might inhabit the Venusian atmosphere, given the presence there of the gas phosphine (PH3).\nIt was suggested the concentration could not be explained by geological activity alone. But the new Belfast study puts a dampener on this idea.\nThe team assessed what is known about conditions in the clouds, gathered by space probes, and then looked across the library of lifeforms on Earth to see if any known organisms could persist in that challenging environment. The clouds are mostly sulphuric acid with a tiny fraction of water.\nThe analysis concluded that the most extreme \"extremophile\" - the name for microbes that live in very challenging conditions - wouldn't be able to survive, let alone thrive.   \n\"We found not only is the effective concentration of water molecules slightly below what's needed for the most resilient microorganism on Earth, it's more than 100 times too low. It's almost at the bottom of the scale, and an unbridgeable distance from what life requires to be active,\" Dr John Hallsworth from Belfast's School of Biological Sciences said. \nDoes this \"kill\" the idea of detecting life on Venus? \nIt was certainly a thrilling and intriguing announcement when a separate team came forward last September with the tantalising observations of PH3 at the second planet from the Sun.\nOn Earth, phosphine is associated with life, with microbes living in the guts of animals like penguins, or in oxygen-poor environments such as swamps.\nIt's possible to make the gas industrially, but there are no factories on Venus; so its signal in the planet's clouds demanded an explanation.\nSeptember's team, led by Prof Jane Greaves from Cardiff University, raised the possibility of Venusian life and invited other groups to knock down the proposition.\nSome astronomers initially questioned the correctness of the PH3 observations, which were made with two different telescope systems. But this latest challenge comes from a very different quarter - from experts in biochemistry. Dr Hallsworth is a microbiologist whose focus is the reaction of living organisms to stress.\nProf Greaves praised his work on Monday, describing the new study as an excellent piece of work. But she still thinks there is the possibility of a liveable window in the Venusian clouds.\n\"We spoke about this at some length last year; we know Venus's atmosphere is extremely desiccated but what we don't know is how well mixed it is. \n\"A colleague, Paul Rimmer, has a paper just out showing that some cloud droplets could have a very high water content,\" she told BBC News. \nProf Greaves highlighted the dark streaks sometimes seen on short timescales in the atmosphere in ultraviolet light. It's been speculated that these could be microbial colonies that evolve, die out and then re-emerge. \nDr Chris McKay is a leading figure in astrobiology, a field that examines the possibilities for life beyond Earth. The US space agency (Nasa) researcher, a co-author on the new Hallsworth study, said he would love to think Venus was inhabited but that the direct measurements of the atmosphere made by past probes really suggested this was unlikely.\nMore promising - although still very difficult to prove - is the notion that life might exist in the cloud layers of Jupiter.\nThe new research indicates compatible temperatures and water availability should be found at a depth where the pressure is about five times that at sea-level on Earth. Of course, this says nothing about the other requirements for life, such as a supply of nutrients.\n\"It's much harder to say a place is habitable than to say a place is not habitable, Dr McKay explained. \n\"To say a place is not habitable, all one has to do is show that some condition is beyond the range that life can tolerate. We've done that for Venus, unfortunately. \n\"We also show that one parameter - water activity - is within the range in a certain layer at Jupiter. But to show that this layer is habitable, we would have to go through all the requirements for life and show that they're all met. So it's much harder to say, Jupiter's atmosphere is habitable than it is to say Venus's clouds are uninhabitable.\"\nVenus is the hot planetary topic of the moment.\nNasa and the European Space Agency have just approved three new missions to go visit the world, starting at the end of this decade. And a private launch company, Rocket Lab, intends to send an atmospheric entry craft as soon as 2023. This has contributions from members of Prof Greaves' team and will look to sample the phosphine gas as the probe descends through the clouds.\nAdditionally, the team is about to formally publish responses to other scientists who doubted the robustness of their telescopic observations. \n\"We've looked at the data again, major improvements have been made [by the staff at the Alma observatory in Chile], and I'm really happy with what we've seen at Venus,\" Prof Greaves said.\nThe new Hallsworth study is published in the journal Nature Astronomy."

      "title": "Covid-19 in the UK: How many coronavirus cases are there in my area?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,NHS,Matthew Hancock,Sajid Javid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People in England are \"very likely\" to be able to return to \"pretty much life before Covid\" on 19 July, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nIt was \"sensible to stick to our plan\" of having a \"cautious but irreversible approach\" to lifting the remaining coronavirus restrictions, he added.\nThe final stage of easing lockdown measures was previously put back by four weeks from 21 June by the PM.\nNew Health Secretary Sajid Javid will update MPs later on the restrictions.\nThe planned easing on 21 June was delayed amid concern over the spread of the Delta variant.  \nWhen announcing the delay, the prime minister promised a review after two weeks.\nMeanwhile, Spain, Malta and Portugal are introducing new restrictions for travellers from the this week.\nThose travelling to Spain - including the Balearic Islands, which will be on the UK's green travel list from Wednesday - will need to be fully vaccinated or have a negative PCR test. Malta, which will also go on the green list, will require visitors to have had both doses of a Covid-19 jab.\nTravellers from the UK to mainland Portugal will be required to quarantine for 14 days on arrival, unless they have been fully vaccinated for at least two weeks - but these rules do not apply to the islands of Madeira, which is going on the green list, or the Azores.\nThe Hong Kong government has also announced new measures, banning all passenger flights from the UK from 1 July after adding the country to its \"extremely high risk\" group.\nSpeaking on Monday, Mr Johnson said: \"Although there are some encouraging signs and the number of deaths remains low and the number of hospitalisations remains low - though both are going up a bit - we are seeing an increase in cases.\n\"So we think it's sensible to stick to our plan to have a cautious but irreversible approach, use the next three weeks or so really to complete as much as we can of that vaccine rollout.\n\"And then with every day that goes by it's clearer to me and all our scientific advisers that we're very likely to be in a position on 19 July to say that really is the terminus, and we can go back to life as it was before Covid as far as possible.\" \nMr Javid's address, which will come less than 48 hours after taking the role following Matt Hancock's resignation, is expected in the House of Commons at about 17:30 BST.\nMr Javid said: \"I want to see the restrictions lifted and life going back to normal as quickly as possible. That is my absolute priority. I want to see those restrictions lifted as soon as we can.\n\"It's going to be irreversible, there's no going back. That's why we want to be careful during that process.\"\nHe was appointed on Saturday evening shortly after Mr Hancock resigned for breaching social distancing guidance.\nPressure had been building on Mr Hancock following the publication by the Sun of pictures and a video of him kissing his colleague Gina Coladangelo. The pair are both married with three children each.\nThere's lots of talk about encouraging data. But with infection levels climbing rapidly, how can that be? \nThe key is in the picture emerging with hospital cases and deaths. When the initial delay to step four was announced, infection rates had just started rising and government scientists were worried about what that could lead to with the vaccination programme not fully rolled out.\nThe past few weeks have provided clarity about what we can expect. The answer can be found by comparing the start of the second wave in the autumn with what is happening now. \nDuring September and October cases were rising much as they are now.\nWithin eight weeks that had translated to more than 1,000 hospital admissions a day. This time round there are just above 200.\nThere is even better news with deaths. Latest estimates show fewer than one in 1,000 infections is leading to a death. At the peak of the winter wave it was one in 60.\nThis has dramatically altered what can be considered a proportionate response to the virus - and is why a further loosening of restrictions remains on the cards.\nThe number of new coronavirus cases across the UK has continued to rise quickly in the week since what would have been \"freedom day\".\nThe UK has recorded 116,287 cases in the past seven days - a 70% increase on the previous week's total. \nA total of 22,868 cases were reported on Monday, up from 14,876 on Sunday. However, the government said Sunday's figure was lower than expected because of a delay to processing data, and that Monday's total would include outstanding cases.\nA further three deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported in the UK. There tend to be fewer deaths reported on Mondays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend.\nIn Scotland, there have been a record number of daily cases recorded with a further 3,285 cases reported on Monday - surpassing the previous high of 2,999 from Thursday.\nBut the government's decision on lifting measures will also take into account the progress of the UK's vaccination rollout.\nLatest figures show that 84.4% of adults in the UK have had their first jab and 61.9% have had their second.\nSome Conservative backbenchers have urged the government to ease controls quickly, saying the country must learn to live with Covid and that the early investment in providing a vaccine in huge numbers was always intended to achieve just that.\nMatthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health services in England, urged Mr Javid to be a \"voice of caution\" in the cabinet over the pressures the pandemic is heaping on the NHS.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The number of cases in hospital are rising... we have to keep a careful eye on it.\"\nSaffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of the NHS Providers organisation, said Mr Javid's priorities should be tackling the new surge of Covid cases, along with the \"huge spike\" in demand for emergency services and the backlog of people waiting for NHS treatment.\nProf Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told Today that if levels of protection from jabs continued then the UK should be in a \"very good position\", when asked about restrictions being lifted soon.\nHe said: \"We're looking at the data that's coming from Public Health England about the effectiveness of the vaccines and we're seeing more than 90% protection.\"\nIn Wales, the lifting of coronavirus restrictions has been paused, to be reviewed again on 15 July, while in Scotland it is hoped that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August.\nSome rules in Northern Ireland will be reviewed on 1 July."

      "text": "Drivers face a 50mph speed limit on a stretch of one of Wales' key roads - despite \u00a3336m being spent on the new dual carriageway.\nA consultation will decide the limit for the five-mile (8km) part of the A465 Heads of the Valleys road.\nIt means that after seven years of work to widen the road, set to be finished by autumn, drivers could be asked to use the same speed as it had before.\nThe Welsh government said the limit was in the interest of road safety.\nThe upgrade of the stretch between Brynmawr and Gilwern is part of the Welsh government's more than \u00a3800m upgrade programme for the road to turn the whole route from Monmouthshire to Neath Port Talbot into dual carriageways, which usually have a 70mph speed limit.\nThe current phase through the Clydach Gorge is Wales' biggest road building project but has caused controversy as it is costing taxpayers about \u00a3100m more than planned - and has run three years over the original schedule.\nMotorists, like 21-year-old trainee pharmacy technician Liv Hoskins, have had to put up with traffic congestion and 40mph speed limits as the road between Brynmawr in Blaenau Gwent and Abergavenny in Monmouthshire is upgraded. \n\"Where I live in Ebbw Vale, you used to be able to get from Ebbw Vale down to Abergavenny in about 10 minutes,\" said Ms Hoskins, who uses the route on her way to work in the Somerset resort of Weston-super-Mare.\n\"Now, you've got to allow at least 25 minutes. It's frustrating. The speed limit and flow of traffic on a single carriageway road has been a complete nightmare from start to finish.\n\"When you think about all the years that we've had to put up with the slower speed limit.\n\"I read on the consultation paperwork that they've said due to the engineering design, a 50mph speed limit was more suitable.\n\"It makes me wonder why they built a road that's only suitable for 50mph in this day and age.\"\nThe Welsh government said the proposed speed limit, similar to the old stretch of road, was \"in the interest of road safety\" and aimed to \"reduce the scheme's environmental impact.\"\nThe project has been difficult with the government saying more than 400 Olympic pools of material being excavated.\nThe difficult terrain, plus a dispute with contractor Costain, meant the project has gone more than \u00a3100m over budget.\nKeith Jones, director of the Institute for Civil Engineers In Wales, said the limit was linked to the road's design.\n\"If you have quite a difficult terrain, then you can flatten it out so you can travel faster, so people can see any obstacles in the way, a long way away,\" he said.\n\"But to do that you would be eating into the existing ground which would raise the cost.\"\nGiven budgetary \"concerns and challenges\", Mr Jones said it was a balance between \"flattening out the road and allowing the cars to go faster, and keeping the cost down.\"\nBrynmawr councillor John Hill thinks for safety the limit should be 50mph, but understood concerns.\n\"People have had a real hard time for the last six or seven years, people have got really frustrated with this road,\" he said. \n\"So now, you say to people, 'Yes, after all that seven years, you still can't do more than 50mph,' that is going to really upset people.\"\nHe understood it seemed \"an awful lot of money\" for the same limit but said: \"Safety is paramount.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives feared the 50mph speed limit - rather than the 70mph limit normally adopted on dual carriageways - could increase congestion.\n\"Saying that they want to save the environment but making life difficult for those of us who live here on a day-to-day basis is not good for anybody,\" said Natasha Ashgar, the Tories' transport spokeswoman. \n\"Frankly, I don't think drivers should be punished.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"The speed limit on the A465 has always been 50mph.\"\nIt said traffic flow would be improved, journeys would be faster and safer, and there would be less environmental impact."

      "tags": "Matthew Hancock",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson is still facing questions about the circumstances around Matt Hancock's resignation as health secretary after he broke social distancing rules during an affair with an aide.\nHere are the main ones.\nMr Hancock's affair with former lobbyist Gina Coladangelo was revealed on Thursday night, when The Sun newspaper published pictures - taken from a CCTV camera - of them kissing in his office.\nOn Friday, the prime minister accepted his colleague's apology for ignoring social distancing guidelines and declared the matter \"closed\".\nBut many Conservative MPs did not agree and put pressure on the government to remove the health secretary.\nMr Hancock resigned on Saturday evening after meeting Mr Johnson at Chequers - the prime minister's official country residence.\nSpeaking on Monday, the prime minister denied that the time gap between the revelations and Mr Hancock's departure had been too long.\n\"I read the story on Friday and we've got a new health secretary in post on Saturday, and I think that's about the right pace to proceed in a pandemic,\" he said.\nAnd a spokesman reiterated that Mr Johnson had not urged Mr Hancock to go.\nCritics of the government say the prime minister should have sacked Mr Hancock and are querying whether ministers are being adequately held to account.\nLast year, Mr Johnson found Home Secretary Priti Patel had not breached the ministerial code - which sets out standards of behaviour - after a report detailed evidence of her \"bullying\" staff.\nHe also declined to sack Mr Hancock last month after he was judged to have committed a \"minor technical breach\" of the code for initially failing to declare his stake in an NHS supplier.\nDowning Street has said ministers are judged by the proper standards.\nThe ministerial code states that they should be \"professional in all their dealings\", have \"proper and appropriate\" relationships with colleagues and that harassment and bullying \"will not be tolerated\".\nAnd the seven principles of public life are listed as selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership.\nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland has said that \"if there was any connection or conflict\" when Ms Coladangelo became a non-executive director of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) last September, \"it should have been declared\".\nMr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo have been friends since they worked together on a student radio station while at Oxford University.\nMr Buckland told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I don't know when this particular relationship began, but I expect those looking at the process would indeed ask those questions to make sure that this appointment, like thousands made every year, would stand up to scrutiny.\"\nMr Hancock took on Ms Coladangelo as an aide in March last year. She moved on to the DHSC director role - paying \u00a315,000 a year for 15 to 20 days' work a year - six months later.\nA government spokesman has said the appointment was \"made in the usual way\" and \"followed correct procedure\".\nThe Sunday Times has reported that that Mr Hancock potentially breached guidelines by using his personal email account for government business.\nInformation Commissioner Elizabeth Denham has said she is \"looking carefully\" at the the issue and considering \"what further steps may be necessary\".\nThis follows Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner demanding a \"full-scale investigation\" into whether private emails had been used to discuss government contracts, and if their use might have potentially broken the law.\nA Downing Street spokesman said it was his understanding that the emails had related only \"to things like diary acceptances\" and not for making deals.\nLabour also queried why Ms Coladangelo - who has now quit her DHSC role - obtained a parliamentary security pass.\nIt asked the House of Lords' commissioner for standards to \"urgently\" investigate whether it was issued according to the rules.\nThe pass was sponsored last year by junior health minister Lord Bethell, the Times reported, adding that Ms Coladangelo was understood never to have worked for Lord Bethell.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said there are \"huge questions still to answer\".\nIt is not known how the Sun obtained footage of Mr Hancock kissing Ms Coladangelo, a married mother of three.\nMr Buckland told BBC Breakfast he believed \"all colleagues in government\" would now be asking officials to \"make sure their offices are as safe as possible\" from \"unauthorised surveillance\".\nIt was not the role of CCTV to \"snoop\" on ministers, he said, calling it a \"a worry\" because footage could end up in the \"wrong hands, with states that wish us ill or wish the United Kingdom ill\".\nOn a visit to a London hospital, Mr Javid said the DHSC had disabled the camera used. \n\"For security it's just common sense,\" he added. \"I don't think as a general rule there should be cameras in the secretary of state's office.\nThe DHSC is also carrying out an internal review into what happened.\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said there appeared to have been a \"serious security breach\" and that the government had to \"sort itself out\".\nThe leak certainly raises security concerns, but it's not clear if it is a national security concern requiring MI5's involvement.\nHow did the camera come to be in a private office? If it had been placed there covertly that would raise serious issues about access and why it had not been spotted.\nBut if, as it seems, it was a regular departmental security camera the issue becomes more one of internal process and why the minister did not know about it.\nThe next issue is how the material got out.\nParliamentarians have raised questions about the use of CCTV from Chinese companies for fear material could be siphoned off. But there is no sign of that so far in this case with reports pointing to an insider leaking the material. \nThat still raises questions about access. The person may claim they were a whistle-blower revealing a minister breaking Covid guidelines but there will be fears this type of material could theoretically have been sold to a hostile state for blackmail.\nThe initial inquiry should answer whether this was a legitimate (but oddly placed) camera. If there is no further sign of outside interference then the national security implications likely remain low.\nBut even that won't stop ministers wondering where other cameras might be and what else might have been captured."

      "text": "NHS prescriptions for gardening and dancing are \"vitally needed\" to help tackle rising levels of loneliness after lockdown, people suffering from isolation have said.\nSocial prescribing has been included in the Welsh government's list of priorities for the next five years.\nA Mind Cymru pilot project is looking into its impact on mental health.\nOne woman who felt isolated in lockdown said loneliness was now a bigger health risk than smoking or obesity. \nAlice Gray, a 29-year-old science communicator and producer from Cardiff who struggled with loneliness during lockdown, said social prescribing was \"vitally needed\".\nShe added that loneliness could often be stereotyped as affecting older people, but she spent long periods in isolation during the pandemic, even spending the last birthday of her 20s alone because of social distancing rules.\n\"Loneliness is a widespread problem, even prior to pandemic,\" she said. \n\"It's not only incredibly isolating, but it's very stigmatised and often associated with the older generation - despite more young people struggling with loneliness. Three times as many young people deal with loneliness compared to older people.\"\nAfter spending many months entirely on her own, Ms Gray said she would personally benefit from something that would \"enable me to get on a path out of loneliness\".\n\"But also, as a neuroscientist, I think people underestimate the impact loneliness has on our brain and health - with lonely people being more than twice as likely to have mental health issues and loneliness is considered a bigger health risk now than smoking or obesity. \n\"I think having access to a service like that [social prescribing] could have impacts on the mental and physical health of people on a personal level, as well as on a broader level.\"\nSocial prescribing creates a formal way for primary care services such as GPs to refer patients to a variety of non-clinical services.   \nIt is sometimes referred to as a community referral and often involves a link worker called a social prescriber, who helps design a package of services or activities.\nThese can include gardening clubs, dance sessions or even just group chats. \nPre-pandemic, the Royal College of General Practitioners Wales called for all practices to have their own social prescriber in a bid to tackle GPs' workload, and \"free up their time for those patients most in need of medical care\".\nIn its loneliness action plan it said: \"Loneliness and social isolation can be as bad for patients as chronic long-term conditions. \n\"Loneliness puts people at a 50% increased risk of an early death.\n\"It can be hard for people who are lonely to know where to turn for support. That's why we want to see a dedicated professional for every GP surgery, a 'social prescriber' so that people who are lonely or are at risk are supported to make the right connections.\"\nNick from Ystradgynlais, Powys, said social prescribing helped him after a mental health crisis.\n\"Social prescribing is a way of helping people deal with the things in their lives that can make them feel unhappy or anxious.\n\"Addressing these things takes a little extra time and support, so social prescribing helps you find lots of different activities and support in your local community that can help you turn things around. I was referred to a number of different activities that have helped me.\"\nHe added the experience helped him make new friends and \"allowed me to come out of my shell\".\nLoneliness spiralled during the pandemic, particularly as a result of lockdown, with people forced to stay away from family, friends and unable to meet new people.\nAccording to Mind Cymru, social prescribing has been adapted to help those with mental health problems over the phone or online, providing support and strategies to help.\nThe easing of restrictions to include outdoor meetings for organised groups has also allowed many activities to restart.\nIt seems social prescribing is being taken seriously at government level as well as in the third sector, with First Minister Mark Drakeford including it in his 17-page plan for what he wants to achieve in the next five years.\nHe plans to introduce an all-Wales framework to roll out social prescribing to tackle isolation.\n\"Social prescribing solutions to mental health are quickly becoming more and more viable, as well as being assigned by increasing numbers of GPs and charitable organisations gaining more funding the possibilities for recovery and healing through social prescribing are near endless,\" he said in the document."

      "title": "Covid-19: End of England's Covid rules still set for 19 July",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The final easing of lockdown measures in England is still set for 19 July, the new health secretary has said.\nSajid Javid told MPs that ministers \"see no reason to go beyond\" that \"target date\".\nHe said that while cases were rising, the number of deaths \"remains mercifully low\".\nIn a statement, he said no date for lifting restrictions would come with \"zero risk\" and that \"we have to learn to live with\" Covid-19.\n\"We also know that people and businesses need certainty, so we want every step to be irreversible,\" he said.\n\"The restrictions on our freedoms, they must come to an end.\"\nAddressing the House of Commons for the first time as health secretary, Mr Javid added that the government was aiming for \"around two thirds of all adults in this country\" to have had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine by 19 July.\nThe vaccine is now estimated to have prevented 7.2 million infections and 27,000 deaths in England, according to new analysis from Public Health England and Cambridge University.\nThe end of England's lockdown was originally scheduled for 21 June, but was pushed back by four weeks with the promise of a review after two. Mr Javid's update marks the end of that review.\nThe number of new cases across the UK has continued to rise quickly since the delay was announced.\nA further 116,287 cases have been recorded in the past seven days - a 70% increase on the previous week's total. \nBut the latest estimates show fewer than one in 1,000 infections is leading to a death. At the peak of the winter wave it was one in 60.\nThe talk of encouraging data is understandable. You only need to look at what was happening in the autumn when the second wave was starting. \nAs is the case now, infection rates were climbing rapidly from a low base.\nBack then, that saw hospital admissions top 1,000 a day little over a month later. Thanks to the vaccines, hospitalisations are nowhere near that level now.\nIt means that what can be considered a proportionate response to the virus is now very different.\nBut admissions are still rising. So that is why government scientists are hoping to see some signs of a flattening in infection levels before a decision is made about 19 July.\nThe new health secretary is clearly confident that all remaining restrictions can be lifted then. The next two weeks will prove whether that faith is misplaced or not.\nMr Javid was asked whether it was the government's plan to remove all restrictions on 19 July.\nHe replied that it was certainly the government's intention to \"remove restrictions\" - but whether that would be all or just some, he added: \"As we follow the data in the coming days, we will set out more in due course.\"\nHe was also asked what he would do to help parents who were having to stay home repeatedly because their children were being told to isolate.\nMr Javid said a pilot was under way to ascertain whether \"tests can be used in lieu of isolation\". \nLabour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, suggested the government should not be so confident about the date, warning that cases were on the up. \n\"We've seen around 84,000 cases in the last week, an increase of around 61%. Today we've seen the highest case rate since January,\" he said. \n\"So what is he going to do to push infections down? Vaccinations will do it eventually but not in the next four weeks.\"\nThe tone from the new health secretary sounded less cautious than his predecessor, but in substance not much has changed.\nSajid Javid did exactly what Matt Hancock would have done had his political career survived - he dashed any hope that sceptical Conservative backbenchers might have had that restrictions in England could end next week.\nBut he did try to reassure them that the economic pain would not be prolonged for much longer.\nWith infections rising, though, Labour is warning that the anti-restriction rhetoric could prove premature.\nAnd while legal restrictions might end and closed businesses might re-open on 19 July, Mr Javid was less forthcoming on exactly when the paraphernalia of the pandemic - the masks, the apps, the contact tracing - will finally be consigned to the past.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people in England were \"very likely\" to be able to return to \"pretty much life before Covid\" on 19 July.\nHe said it was \"sensible to stick to our plan\" of having a \"cautious but irreversible approach\" to lifting the remaining restrictions.\nA total of 22,868 cases were reported on Monday, up from 14,876 on Sunday. However, the government said Sunday's figure was lower than expected because of a delay to processing data, and that Monday's total would include outstanding cases.\nA further three deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported in the UK. There tend to be fewer deaths reported on Mondays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend.\nThe latest figures show that 84.4% of adults in the UK have had their first jab and 61.9% have had their second.\nUntil lockdown is further eased in England, limits will remain on gatherings. \nCurrently, groups of no more than 30 are allowed to meet outdoors, while up to six people or two households are allowed indoors. Capacity limits will continue at venues and nightclubs will stay closed.\nHowever, some coronavirus pilot events are continuing as planned, including some upcoming Euro 2020 games, Wimbledon, and arts and music performances. Attendees have to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test.\nIt is not yet known whether social distancing and face masks will continue to be advised after 19 July. Reviews are under way into social distancing as well as into masks and other measures, and these are due to be completed before the lifting of rules on 19 July.\nOn its website under the section about step four of lockdown easing (the next step), the government says: \"We are going to have to keep living our lives differently to keep ourselves and others safe. We must carry on with 'hands, face, space'. Comply with the Covid-secure measures that remain in place.\"\nFormer Health Secretary Matt Hancock also previously suggested there could be a new approach to self-isolation, for example taking daily tests while continuing on with daily life.\nIn Wales, meanwhile, the lifting of Covid restrictions has been paused and will be reviewed again on 15 July. \nIn Scotland, it is hoped that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August, while some rules in Northern Ireland will be reviewed on 1 July."

      "text": "A police officer who killed ex footballer Dalian Atkinson had previously been found guilty of gross misconduct, a court has heard.\nLast week, Benjamin Monk, 43, was convicted of manslaughter over the death in Telford in 2016.\nThe trial heard Monk had tasered Mr Atkinson six times longer than standard procedure and kicked him in the head.\nDue to be sentenced on Monday, Judge Melbourne Inman QC said he needed more time to consider evidence.\nBirmingham Crown Court heard Monk was given a final written warning for 18 months in 2011 after being found guilty of gross misconduct during a West Mercia Police disciplinary hearing.\nIt was found that he had failed to disclose a caution for theft in 1997 - while employed at Woolworths - and another after he was found drunk in 1999.\nThe misconduct panel found Monk had breached the required standards for honesty and integrity by not disclosing the offences, but allowed him to keep his job.\nMonk joined West Mercia Police in 2002 at the age of 22, and spent his first seven years serving in Ludlow, Shropshire.\nBy 2010, he had joined its force operations support team and was trained to use a Taser.\nDuring the trial at Birmingham Crown Court, jurors heard Monk's Taser had failed to fire twice, but the third attempt saw him deploy it for 33 seconds against Mr Atkinson.\nWhen he fell to the ground, Monk kicked him twice in the head with enough force to leave the imprints of his bootlaces.\nThe striker, who played for Aston Villa, Ipswich Town and Sheffield Wednesday, died in hospital just over an hour after the confrontation on Meadow Close in the early hours of 15 August 2016.\nVictim impact statements from Mr Atkinson's family were read to the court during Monday's hearing in which they remembered him as \"the confident, charismatic member of the family who would light up a room\".\n\"He was unwell and vulnerable and needed kindness, not to be subjected to such violence,\" they said.\nThe court also heard from Monk's defence barrister, Patrick Gibbs QC, who said the officer \"had no intention to kill or injure\" Mr Atkinson and that he \"thought about it every day\".\nHe said Monk had attended the incident \"for the best of reasons\" before 59 seconds during which his conduct had been found to be unlawful. \n\"The 59 seconds stand not just at odds with the previous five minutes, not just at odds with the previous five years, but at odds with the whole of his police career. In fact, at odds with the whole of his adult life,\" Mr Gibbs said.\nJudge Melbourne Inman QC adjourned the hearing until 14:00 BST on Tuesday, saying he wanted time to consider the evidence before passing sentence. \nMonk, who had previously been bailed, was remanded in custody ahead of the hearing.\nDuring the trial, he was cleared of an alternative charge of murder on 23 June.\nThe jury was unable to reach a verdict for his co-accused, 31-year-old PC Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith, who was charged with assaulting Mr Atkinson with her baton while he lay incapacitated.  \nProsecutors are yet to announce whether they will seek a retrial for her.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Iran,US Armed Forces,Iraq,United States,Syria,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The US says it has carried out air strikes against Iran-backed militias near the Iraq-Syria border in response to drone attacks on its forces in Iraq.\nA Pentagon spokesman said the strikes targeted \"operational and weapons storage facilities\" at three locations.\nPresident Biden had been clear he would act to protect US personnel, he added. \nA powerful Iraqi militia alliance, the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), said four members of one faction were killed and threatened to retaliate.\nAbout 2,500 US troops are in Iraq as part of a global coalition supporting local security forces in their fight against the jihadist group, Islamic State (IS).\nThere have been at least five drone attacks against facilities used by US and coalition personnel since April, US officials say. Rockets have also been fired at them and supply convoys have been targeted by improvised explosive devices.\nThe PMF - a coalition of mostly Iranian-backed Shia militias that was formed in 2014 to fight IS, and was incorporated into the Iraqi Security Forces three years ago - said the strikes killed four fighters carrying out an officially-sanctioned mission to prevent IS militants infiltrating Iraq.\nIt added that the fighters had \"not [been] involved in any activity against the foreign presence in Iraq\", and that the targeted locations did \"not include any [weapon] stores or similar, in contrast to the claims made by the US\".\n\"As such, we denounce and condemn in the strongest terms this sinful attack on our forces... and we affirm that we maintain the legal right to respond to these attacks and hold accountable their perpetrators on Iraqi territory.\"\nIraqi military spokesman Maj-Gen Yehia Rasool also condemned the strikes, writing on Twitter that they represented \"a blatant and unacceptable violation of Iraqi sovereignty and Iraqi national security\".\nHe also reiterated Iraq's \"rejection of becoming a field for settling scores\" and called for \"calm and the avoidance of escalation in all forms\".\nIranian foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said the US was \"destroying security\" in the Middle East and should \"refrain from taking emotional steps, creating crises and tensions, and multiplying problems for people in the region\".\nSyrian state media reported that a child was killed in a strike near the Syrian border town of Albu Kamal early on Monday, and accused the US of seeking to undermine efforts to improve stability in the area. \nThe Syrian government has relied heavily on support from Iran's Revolutionary Guards and Shia militias during the country's civil war, and they have a significant presence in the border region.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said seven militia fighters were killed in strikes near Albu Kamal.\nPentagon spokesman John Kirby said the \"defensive precision air strikes\" that took place early on Monday were intended to \"disrupt and deter\" drone attacks on US personnel in Iraq.\nThey targeted facilities at two locations in Syria and one inside Iraq that were used by several Iran-backed groups, including Kataib Hezbollah and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, he added.\nUS media reported that the strikes - the second round targeting Iran-backed militias ordered by President Biden since he took office in January - were carried out by US Air Force F-15s and F-16s using satellite-guided munitions.\n\"We took necessary, appropriate, deliberate action that is designed to limit the risk of escalation, but also to send a clear and unambiguous deterrent message,\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Rome.\nThe US has designated Kataib Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organisation since 2009 and has accused it of carrying out many attacks against US forces in Iraq in recent years. \nIts leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, was killed alongside top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad last year that then-President Donald Trump ordered following a series of attacks in Iraq that were blamed on Iran-backed groups.\nThis February, US aircraft bombed a border-control point in Syria used by Kataib Hezbollah and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada in response to a rocket attack on a US-led coalition airbase in Irbil that killed one Filipino civilian contractor and wounded six other people. The attack was claimed by a group widely seen as a front for Kataib Hezbollah and other militias.\nMonday's strikes come as Iran and world powers attempt to revive the 2015 nuclear deal.\nThe agreement has been close to collapse since 2018, when Mr Trump abandoned it and reinstated sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy. Iran retaliated by gradually breaching agreed limits on its nuclear activities.  \nMr Biden wants to rejoin the deal, but he says Iran must return to compliance before the sanctions are lifted. Iran insists that he must lift the sanctions first."

Colleagues who were in a senior meeting with him last week, including the Secretary of State, are self-isolating in line with government guidelines.\"\nThe government did not offer an explanation as to why Mr Wallace is self-isolating rather than taking daily Covid-19 tests - as Michael Gove did earlier this month, when he was named as a contact of someone who contracted Covid.\nIt was explained at the time that the Cabinet Office minister was taking part in a pilot scheme designed to measure the effectiveness of daily testing, with the hopes that it might spare tens of thousands of Covid contacts the inconvenience of having to stay at home.\nUnder the trial, up to 40,000 Covid contacts in England will take daily lateral flow tests. Once they get a negative result each morning, they can go about their lives as normal."

      "text": "A further 3,285 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in Scotland, setting another new record for the number of positive tests.\nA total of 12.6% of those tested for the virus were positive. No deaths were recorded, although registration offices are generally closed over the weekend.\nThe previous highest number was the 2,999 cases reported last Thursday.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the \"steep rise\" in cases showed that people should be \"really careful\".\nBut she said there was \"positive news\" from the vaccine programme, which she said was preventing a similar rise in the number of people in hospital or losing their lives.\nMs Sturgeon will host a briefing on Tuesday with Dr Gregor Smith, the chief medical officer, to discuss the rising Covid case numbers.\nShe is likely to repeat her warnings to the public to take care with three weeks to go until a further easing of restrictions.\nThe government aims to move the whole of Scotland to the lowest level of the five-tier system of restrictions on 19 July, before lifting most measures entirely in August.\nHowever, the announcement of these plans has coincided with a sharp rise in new cases of the virus, with infections surpassing the highest levels of the \"second wave\" in January.\nMinisters hope the vaccine programme can break the link between rising case numbers and serious illness, leading to hospital admissions, and deaths.\nA total of 202 people were in hospital on Sunday with a recently-confirmed case of Covid-19, with 20 in intensive care.\nMeanwhile, 3.7 million people have now had a first dose of a vaccine, while just under 2.7 million have had two doses.\nMs Sturgeon said: \"We're seeing quite a steep rise in Covid cases right now.\n\"The positive news is that vaccination is providing a lot of protection so we are not seeing a commensurate rise in the number of people going into hospital or intensive care, or dying from the virus.\"\nHowever, she stressed that people should not be complacent.\nScotland may no longer be competing in the Euros, but we are top of one league - with the highest case rate of all the UK nations. \nThe biggest group testing positive is young men and there are suggestions the football is to blame. This could account for some cases, but public health officials report outbreaks at weddings, workplaces, schools, and a whole variety of settings. \nIt doesn't feel like we are winning the race against the virus. The weekly average is now higher than it was in the January peak. Back then, lockdown measures were in place to bring those numbers down. But now, with people free to mix, the risk is that the only way for the numbers to go is up. \nIn the long term we may need to get used to having high case numbers. The key is having trust that the vaccines will do their job, limiting the numbers of people that get seriously ill and need hospital treatment. \nBut there are still plenty of people to get their first jag. It's a delicate time and again, we're being asked not to drop our guard. \n\"There are still a number of people who are not yet fully vaccinated, although we are vaccinating as quickly as supplies will allow,\" she said.\n\"And while this vaccine programme is highly effective, vaccines are not 100% effective. \n\"So if we don't want to see the virus run ahead of the vaccines, it's really important everybody is really careful.\"\nThe first minister would not be drawn on whether the increase in cases would have an impact on the planned easing of restrictions, saying a formal review would be carried out closer to the time."

      "tags": "ITV,Television,Reality TV,Love Island,Majorca",
      "text": "Love Island returns to screens on Monday after an 18-month break enforced by the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt will be the first new series of the ITV2 dating show since Paige Turley and Finley Tapp were crowned the winners of the first winter series last year.\nEleven new islanders are set to enter the villa in Majorca, with Laura Whitmore and Iain Stirling returning to hosting and narrating duties.\nITV has also announced an updated range of welfare measures for contestants.\nHere's everything you need to know ahead of the launch.\nThe seventh series of Love Island kicks off on ITV2 at 21:00 BST on Monday.\n\"Love Island was sorely missed last summer, and I wouldn't be surprised if ratings are higher than ever for this series,\" says Bonnie McLaren, senior entertainment writer at Grazia.\n\"It continues to be so popular for its ability to create nationwide conversation, whether that's over fiery arguments, hilarious moments - like Curtis saying he 'also wants to be one who wakes up in the morning and makes everyone a coffee' while breaking up with Amy - or more serious topics, like gaslighting.\"\nThe show has previously attracted praise for sparking debates about acceptable behaviour in relationships and shining a light on issues such as manipulation and girl code. \n\"And the contestants are always characters,\" McLaren adds. \"The list of islanders who have remained famous after their time on the show is incredibly long. The people in the villa - while you might not like all of them - are all incredibly entertaining to watch, and they're handpicked for being excellent TV.\"\nWhich brings us to this year's crop of contestants hoping to couple up.\nWe already know who the first 11 islanders will be, but expect several more to join the series over the next few weeks.\nPE teacher Hugo Hammond will become the show's first disabled contestant, although some viewers have described his casting as \"a step rather than a leap\" in the show's efforts to be more inclusive.\nHe'll be joined by water engineer Jake Cornish, model-turned-influencer Shannon Singh, fashion blogger Kaz Kamwi and labourer Brad McClelland.\nFormer civil servant Sharon Gaffka has possibly the most interesting back story. She worked on Brexit policy, did a stint in the Department of Health during the initial coronavirus response, and worked for six months in the Department for Transport.\nThen there's lettings manager Faye Winter and former waitress Liberty Poole, whose previous job in Nando's should give Stirling enough material for plenty of \"extra hot\" jokes.\nFinancial services marketing executive Chloe Burrows, luxury events host Aaron Francis and semi-professional footballer Toby Aromolaran complete the starting line-up.\nOf course, these are just names and job titles - we won't really get a sense of what the new islanders are like until they're actually in the villa. Ultimately, their personalities, screen presence and chemistry with the other islanders will determine their success.\nYou'll have noticed that 11 is an odd number, and therefore one of the new islanders will be single from the beginning while the other 10 couple up. The show often starts this way, and it's a good way of creating some drama early on.\nOur new batch of Islanders have reportedly been in quarantine in Spain for the last two weeks ahead of the series launch, and there will be strict Covid protocols on site.\nIt's thought there will also only be a skeleton crew based in Spain - with many of the show's editing and gallery staff working from London.\n\"There's lots of changes, and lots of protocols in place, but actually on screen no, there shouldn't be any changes,\" ITV commissioning editor Amanda Stavri recently told the Radio Times.\nWhitmore will return to hosting duties, dropping into the villa every so often for recouplings and evictions, and will present the weekly Aftersun specials. Her real-life partner Stirling, meanwhile, will provide the voiceovers.\nIn short, cash - provided they can successfully capitalise on their new-found fame. \nArguably the biggest break-out star of Love Island in recent years is Molly-Mae Hague, who is thought to be the highest-earning former contestant, and certainly has the biggest social media following.\nIt's worth reading this excellent Vice article about how she did it. \"Molly-Mae is everywhere. In a way that no other Love Island alumna has quite managed,\" wrote Lauren O'Neill, commenting that Hague had \"set a gold standard for influencers\".\nNot every contestant can expect that type of career. Many vanish without a trace, while others find the fame slipping after the initial flurry around them has subsided.\nFormer contestant Montana Brown told Cosmopolitan: \"The first year after Love Island, I behaved like a bit of a brat - people give you everything for free, and do everything for you.\n\"But you can't forget that you're quite disposable in this industry. Future contestants need to know what they're getting into, and also understand that fame and money don't last forever.\"\nITV has announced a newly improved set of after-care measures following concerns about the mental health of previous contestants.\nThe suicides of two former islanders in recent years prompted a debate about whether the show was doing enough to prepare them for the pressure that comes with the subsequent fame.\nContestants on the new series will be taught how to handle the \"potential negativity\" of social media as part of the show's duty of care protocols.\nThe training forms part of a revised set of welfare measures, which will also see participants get \"comprehensive\" psychological support.\nWhile fans eagerly anticipate the show's return, there will also be plenty of people who spend the coming weeks shouting about the fact that they don't watch or care about Love Island.\nSure, it's trashy, disposable, junk-food TV, but the fact that so many subsequent dating shows haven't quite managed to drum up the same excitement as Love Island during its absence is perhaps proof of its hard-to-define magic.\nShows like The Cabins, Too Hot To Handle and Love Is Blind have kept us going in the last year or so, but none have quite compared with a summer of Stirling helping us navigate those texts, tantrums and triumphs under the Spanish sun.\n\"Personally, I couldn't be more excited for the series to return,\" says McLaren. \"And I think a lot of the people are the same. \n\"After 18 months off screen, and how - quite frankly - dull Winter Love Island was, I think the series is going to be more popular than ever, even though people now have the option to socialise instead of being stuck at home.\""

      "text": "A mix-and-match approach to Covid vaccines - using different brands for first and second doses - appears to give good protection against the pandemic virus, a UK study has found.\nThe Com-Cov trial looked at the efficacy of either two doses of Pfizer, two of AstraZeneca, or one of them followed by the other. \nAll combinations worked well, priming the immune system.\nThis knowledge could offer flexibility for vaccine rollout, say experts. \nThe trial results also hint that people who have already received two doses of AstraZeneca vaccine could have a stronger immune response if they were given a different jab as a booster if recommended in the autumn. \nThe UK's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there was no reason to change the current successful same dose vaccine schedules in the UK, however, given vaccines were in good supply and saving lives.\nBut he says it might be something to look at in the future: \"Mixing doses could provide us with even greater flexibility for a booster programme, while also supporting countries who have further to go with their vaccine rollouts, and who may be experiencing supply difficulties.\"\nSome countries are already using mixed doses. Spain and Germany are offering the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines as a second dose to younger people who have already received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following concerns about rare but serious blood clots, rather than about efficacy.\nTwo doses are important to give the fullest protection and teach the body to make antibodies and T cells to block and kill Covid. \nThe Com-Cov study, which looked at giving the doses four weeks apart in 850 volunteers aged 50 and above, found:\nLead investigator Prof Matthew Snape, from the University of Oxford, said the findings did not undermine the UK policy of giving people the same jab twice: \"We already know that both standard schedules are very effective against severe disease and hospitalisations, including against the Delta variant when given at eight to 12 weeks apart.\"\nHe said the new results showed mixed dose schedules were also effective, even though the interval of four weeks studied was shorter than the eight to 12-week schedule most commonly used in the UK.\n\"This longer interval is known to result in a better immune response,\" he added. \nMixed dose trial results for a 12-week jab interval will be available next month.\nMeanwhile, another pre-print study, which also came out on Monday, suggests a third dose of AZ vaccine, given more than six months after the second, boosts the immune system.\nBut experts say it is too early to know if people will need a booster dose this year ahead of winter. It is unclear yet how much immunity might wane over time. \nProf Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia said: \"The big question at present is whether or not we will be being offered booster vaccines in the autumn. With the evidence available from this and other sources, I suspect that will be likely for those most at risk from the virus, either due to age or being clinically vulnerable.\"\nHe suggested people who have had a first course of AstraZeneca might be offered the Pfizer vaccine in as a booster rather than a repeat AstraZeneca, while people who had a Pfizer first course may not need an autumn booster, based on the evidence from the Com-Cov trial. \nThe initial results of this mix and match vaccine trial are highly encouraging and throw up some interesting options for booster doses.   \nMixing first and second doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines yielded strong immune responses.  Indeed, every combination of dosing - Pfizer/Pfizer, AZ/Pfizer or Pfizer/AZ produced higher antibody and cellular responses than AZ/AZ.  \nDoes this mean that two doses of AstraZeneca is somehow inferior? Not necessarily.  \nIt is worth remembering that two doses of AZ are already proven to reduce the chances of being hospitalised with Covid by more than 90%.  \nSo we know from real world evidence that the AZ vaccine is highly effective. The AZ vaccine is a 'slow burner', and immunity levels build over time, especially when the dosing period is stretched.  Currently the gap between first and second doses is between eight and 12 weeks which should give a better immune response.  \nWhat this trial suggests is that for the third, booster doses, it may be preferable to give a different brand of vaccine than the one used for the first two shots.  \nBut it's also worth noting that mixing vaccines does produce more short-term side effects such as chills, headaches and muscle pain.

      "tags": "Greater Manchester Police,Manchester",
      "text": "\"I wouldn't feel confident reporting a crime to my own police force.\"\nThese are the words of a serving Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officer who has chosen to speak to BBC Newsnight to allege serious failings within England's second largest force.\nA number of officers, past and present, have also come forward to voice similar concerns. \nIn December, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) found GMP failed to record about 80,000 crimes in a 12-month period and closed cases without proper investigation.\nFormer chief constable Ian Hopkins resigned after the force was placed in special measures, and successor Stephen Watson told a recent press conference vital improvements would be made rapidly. \n\"That is not to say GMP is a failing force,\" he said. \"It is a force comprised of many thousands [of] genuinely hard-working, committed, brave, talented, professional people.\"\nFormer GMP officer Scott Winters said he could not wait to leave the force in 2017 after 28 years of service. \nIn 2015, he took the force to an employment tribunal, later reaching an out-of-court settlement. \nHe claimed the force he loved working for had become one that put its reputation ahead of tackling problems. \nMr Winters described the police watchdog's findings as \"dire\", \"unforgivable\" and \"abysmal\".\nAnd it is the public who suffer as a result, he said, with victims being let down.\n\"They are a victim of crime and they've not either had the crime recorded [or] a chance of the perpetrators being brought to justice and punished,\" Mr Winters said. \nSome serving police officers say the situation within GMP has not improved, either.\nOne, who asked to remain anonymous, told Newsnight that criminals \"are luckier now\" as they are \"literally walking the streets [and] not being arrested\".\nAlmost two years ago, Patricia (not her real name) walked into Rochdale police station with her daughter who had finally found the courage to report allegations that a man had groomed and raped her.\nHer daughter had been so desperate that she had twice tried to take her own life.\n\"We went in and the detective we spoke to already had a pile of papers on his desk and a photograph,\" said Patricia.\n\"He asked us 'is this the man in question?' and we said 'yes' and he said 'yeah, we know a lot of stuff about this man'. \n\"So I just thought: 'Brilliant, they already know who he is so it will be dealt with really, really well'.\n\"My daughter gave a really lucid account, and at one point I had to leave the room because I couldn't hear what had happened, what he had done. I just couldn't bear it.\"\nBut her daughter would then have to go on to retell the distressing account again. Since making the report, four different officers have been in charge of the case.\nThe phone her daughter handed in as evidence also temporarily went missing. \n\"To me they are absolutely incompetent, there's no other word to sum them up,\" Patricia said.\n\"What this man did has ruined probably the best years of her life,\" said Patricia. \n\"It's given her such bad anxiety that she's on antidepressants. Maximum dose. She can't sleep. She's just not the girl she used to be. \n\"He's caused all that and he's still out there. He's not even been arrested.\"\nThe family are being supported by the Maggie Oliver Foundation for victims of sexual violence after not receiving the response they expected from the police. \nMany have pointed to GMP's new computer system, which went live two years ago, as the catalyst of some of the failings. \nCalled the Integrated Operational Policing System (iOPS), it has been dubbed iFLOPS by many insiders.\nUntil last year, Paul Bailey was a GMP detective working on major incidents. He remembers the frustrations of using iOPS.\n\"It felt like it had been designed by someone who had never been a police officer and never worked on the streets,\" he said. \n\"A simple example is if there was intelligence regarding firearms at an address or premises and officers were sent to that address and didn't know that, then maybe the outcome could be a poor one for everyone involved.\"\nThe radio panic buttons linked to the system have also been a cause for concern, as Mr Bailey discovered when a colleague pressed it by accident during a shift.\nThe system should have located their car but it failed, he said.\n\"We could have been dying in a ditch and no-one would have known about it,\" he said.\nWith mounting concerns about public protection, the HMICFRS reviewed iOPS and published its findings in March 2020. \nA catalogue of serious issues was identified.\nBut, 15 months on, some serving police officers say the system is still not fit for purpose.\n\"You could be dealing with gangster number one in Salford - major organised crime gang players - and there's a black hole where the recent intelligence should be,\" one told the BBC.\nGail Hadfield Grainger, whose partner Anthony Grainger was killed in a botched GMP firearms operation, said \"it just seems like one failure after another\".\nMr Grainger, from Bolton, was shot through the windscreen of a stolen Audi in a car park in Warrington in 2012. He was unarmed at the time. \nA public inquiry found a \"catastrophic series of failings and errors\" including inaccurate information given to firearms officers. \n\"Anthony lost his life. The intelligence system was flawed [and] GMP were ordered by the judge to ensure that this doesn't happen again,\" Ms Hadfield Grainger said.\n\"I think these are serious, systemic changes that need to be changed from the root of the problem. I don't think this is a quick fix.\"\nIn a statement, Chief Constable Watson acknowledged that part of the iOPS system had \"presented significant challenges\" to GMP but it was under review and upgrades and improvements had been made. \nHe said the force \"remains absolutely committed to protecting children, young people and all vulnerable people in our community. \n\"Some of the historic investigations, by their very nature are distressing, time-consuming and present multiple and complex difficulties for all involved and affected by the case.  \n\"We are nonetheless determined to conclude our investigations thoroughly and to the evidential standards required to bring offenders to justice,\" he said. \nYou can hear more on Gail Hadfield Grainger's story in the documentary One Night in March on BBC Sounds and watch the Newsnight episode on iPlayer.

      "text": "NHS prescriptions for gardening and dancing are \"vitally needed\" to help tackle rising levels of loneliness after lockdown, people suffering from isolation have said.\nSocial prescribing has been included in the Welsh government's list of priorities for the next five years.\nA Mind Cymru pilot project is looking into its impact on mental health.\nOne woman who felt isolated in lockdown said loneliness was now a bigger health risk than smoking or obesity. \nAlice Gray, a 29-year-old science communicator and producer from Cardiff who struggled with loneliness during lockdown, said social prescribing was \"vitally needed\".\nShe added that loneliness could often be stereotyped as affecting older people, but she spent long periods in isolation during the pandemic, even spending the last birthday of her 20s alone because of social distancing rules.\n\"Loneliness is a widespread problem, even prior to pandemic,\" she said. \n\"It's not only incredibly isolating, but it's very stigmatised and often associated with the older generation - despite more young people struggling with loneliness. Three times as many young people deal with loneliness compared to older people.\"\nAfter spending many months entirely on her own, Ms Gray said she would personally benefit from something that would \"enable me to get on a path out of loneliness\".\n\"But also, as a neuroscientist, I think people underestimate the impact loneliness has on our brain and health - with lonely people being more than twice as likely to have mental health issues and loneliness is considered a bigger health risk now than smoking or obesity. \n\"I think having access to a service like that [social prescribing] could have impacts on the mental and physical health of people on a personal level, as well as on a broader level.\"\nSocial prescribing creates a formal way for primary care services such as GPs to refer patients to a variety of non-clinical services.   \nIt is sometimes referred to as a community referral and often involves a link worker called a social prescriber, who helps design a package of services or activities.\nThese can include gardening clubs, dance sessions or even just group chats. \nPre-pandemic, the Royal College of General Practitioners Wales called for all practices to have their own social prescriber in a bid to tackle GPs' workload, and \"free up their time for those patients most in need of medical care\".\nIn its loneliness action plan it said: \"Loneliness and social isolation can be as bad for patients as chronic long-term conditions. \n\"Loneliness puts people at a 50% increased risk of an early death.\n\"It can be hard for people who are lonely to know where to turn for support. That's why we want to see a dedicated professional for every GP surgery, a 'social prescriber' so that people who are lonely or are at risk are supported to make the right connections.\"\nNick from Ystradgynlais, Powys, said social prescribing helped him after a mental health crisis.\n\"Social prescribing is a way of helping people deal with the things in their lives that can make them feel unhappy or anxious.\n\"Addressing these things takes a little extra time and support, so social prescribing helps you find lots of different activities and support in your local community that can help you turn things around. I was referred to a number of different activities that have helped me.\"\nHe added the experience helped him make new friends and \"allowed me to come out of my shell\".\nLoneliness spiralled during the pandemic, particularly as a result of lockdown, with people forced to stay away from family, friends and unable to meet new people.\nAccording to Mind Cymru, social prescribing has been adapted to help those with mental health problems over the phone or online, providing support and strategies to help.\nThe easing of restrictions to include outdoor meetings for organised groups has also allowed many activities to restart.\nIt seems social prescribing is being taken seriously at government level as well as in the third sector, with First Minister Mark Drakeford including it in his 17-page plan for what he wants to achieve in the next five years.\nHe plans to introduce an all-Wales framework to roll out social prescribing to tackle isolation.\n\"Social prescribing solutions to mental health are quickly becoming more and more viable, as well as being assigned by increasing numbers of GPs and charitable organisations gaining more funding the possibilities for recovery and healing through social prescribing are near endless,\" he said in the document."

      "tags": "Matthew Hancock",
      "text": "Before resigning his role, Matt Hancock had achieved an unusually high profile for a health secretary, with the coronavirus pandemic making him a household name. \nBut it was his personal life, after pictures emerged of the married father-of-three embracing close colleague Gina Coladangelo, which led him to quit his job.\nMr Hancock has admitted breaking social distancing rules and accepted he \"let people down\".\nOn Saturday he resigned, saying \"we owe it to people who have sacrificed so much in this pandemic to be honest when we have let them down\".\nPropelled into the limelight as Covid-19 gripped the country in spring 2020, Mr Hancock regularly spoke for the government in the media and at the daily Downing Street press conferences.\nHe famously set a target to conduct 100,000 Covid tests a day by the end of April, a target which he said he met - with his method for calculating the target later coming in for criticism.\nBut his performance at the onset of the pandemic has recently come under renewed scrutiny, following a series of explosive allegations by Boris Johnson's ex-adviser Dominic Cummings.\nMr Hancock has repeatedly denied Mr Cummings' claims of lying to the prime minister about care home testing and procurement of personal protective equipment during the first Covid wave. \nA bitter war of words between Mr Hancock and the PM's ex-aide has since ensued - with Mr Cummings publishing WhatsApp messages, apparently from Mr Johnson in March last year, in which the PM called the health secretary \"totally [expletive] hopeless\".\nMr Hancock also has faced criticism for his decision to hire his friend, the ex-TalkTalk boss and Tory peer Dido Harding, to run England's much-criticised test and trace system.\nAnd his later decision to give her a role as interim head of the UK's new health protection agency sparked controversy, with Labour saying the appointment lacked transparency.\nBut Mr Hancock has been steadfast in his defence of her, rejecting criticism of early delays to the NHS Test and Trace app and even describing it as the \"cherry on Dido's cake\".\nLike other ministers, he has repeatedly stressed the importance of people keeping their distance and following government guidance.\nYet he had already apologised once before for breaching the advice - saying sorry for a \"human mistake\" in June last year after he was caught on camera slapping a colleague on the back in the House of Commons. \nIn addition, Mr Hancock has also faced questions over how his department awarded Covid contracts at the height of the first wave of the pandemic. \nHe has denied involvement in the awarding of a controversial \u00a330m contract to a firm run by the former landlord near his old constituency home.\nIn late May, the PM's standards adviser said he was guilty of a \"minor technical breach\" of the ministerial code after initially failing to declare his stake in an NHS supplier run by his sister and brother-in-law.\nThe prime minister decided this breach did not \"impugn\" the health secretary's \"good character\".\nBut that has not stopped Labour and other opposition parties from heaping pressure on Mr Hancock over his record in office - calling for him to be sacked before his resignation. \nMatt Hancock was born in Cheshire in 1978, and privately educated at the King's School in Chester, before later studying computing at a further education college.\nLike many in Westminster, he went on to study politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford university - before then briefly working for a Conservative backbencher and at the Bank of England. \nIt was during his time at Oxford that Ms Coladangelo says she first met Mr Hancock, after they worked together at a student radio station.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4 for a documentary broadcast in April last year, she said: \"I read the news and Matt read the sport.\n\"I've always joked with him that he did the sport because he wasn't good enough to do the news.\"\nShe told a story from Mr Hancock's time as a student journalist, saying he once overslept and missed his train to Twickenham Stadium, where he was supposed to be reporting from a rugby match.\nInstead, she added, he \"told a white lie\" and pretended he'd gone to the game, when in fact he was filing his match report from a pub in Reading.\nMr Hancock entered the political world as an adviser to then-shadow chancellor George Osborne, before rising up the ranks to become his chief of staff.\nElected Conservative MP for West Suffolk at the 2010 election, he held various ministerial posts under David Cameron and Theresa May. \nHis big break came in early 2018, when, aged 39, he became the youngest member of Mrs May's cabinet after she appointed him culture, media and sport secretary. \nIt was a role that Mr Hancock, an avid cricketer who once trained to become a jockey for a charity horse race, embraced enthusiastically. \nHe also professed a passion for technology - garnering much attention, and a certain amount of mockery, when he launched his own Matt Hancock smartphone app.\nHe was made health secretary in July 2018, after long-serving incumbent Jeremy Hunt was appointed foreign secretary to replace Boris Johnson, who had quit the cabinet in protest at Mrs May's Brexit strategy. \nAfter Mrs May stepped down as PM in 2019, Mr Hancock was among more than a dozen Tory MPs who initially entered the contest to replace her as leader, before quitting the race after coming sixth in the first ballot of the party's MPs.\nHe did not originally back a rival candidate, before deciding to back Mr Johnson's successful run for the leadership three days later. He was among a handful of ministers to keep their roles when Mr Johnson entered No 10."

      "tags": "Florida,Miami building collapse,Miami",
      "text": "Rescue workers say they are searching \"every bit of hope\" as the hunt for survivors under the rubble of a collapsed Florida apartment block continues into a fifth day.\nMore than 150 people are still missing, with ten people confirmed to have died in Thursday's early morning disaster.\nJust four of the victims have been identified so far.\nThe cause of the collapse in Surfside, north of Miami, remains unclear.\nAn engineer's report from 2018, which was made public on Saturday, highlighted \"a major error\" in the original design of the 12-storey seafront Champlain Towers. It said the fault prevented water draining away from the base of the building.\nOn Sunday, officials were keen to stress they were still hoping to find survivors. Teams have been working solidly since the building collapsed, and have now been joined by rescue workers from Israel and Mexico.\nHowever, the initial efforts were slowed by a fire in the debris, which is thought to have been brought under control. Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett previously described how the building had \"pancaked\", with spaces that were 10ft or more reduced to \"just feet\".\nA 125ft (38m) trench, which is 40ft deep, has now been dug to assist in the search for any pockets where people may have survived.\nMiami-Dade Fire Chief Alan Cominsky acknowledged they were still facing an \"extremely difficult situation\" but were not prepared to give up.\n\"Our rescue teams are non-stop, doing all that we can, searching every area, every bit of hope to see if we can find a live victim,\" he told reporters.\nEight of the ten victims have been named by officials so far: Gladys Lozano, 79, and her husband Antonio, 83; Stacie Fang, 54; Manuel LaFont, also 54; Leon Oliwkowiicz, 80;  Christina Beatriz Elvira, 74; Luis Andres Bermudez, 26, and his mother Anna Ortiz, 46.\nMs Fang's son, 15, was pulled alive from the rubble.\nThe remains of the other five people pulled from the debris are undergoing DNA tests to establish their identities.\nThe building contained 136 apartments and 55 of them collapsed early on Thursday, leaving piles of debris.\nResident Barry Cohen was in bed in a section of the building that survived when the collapse happened. \"It sounded like thunder, and my wife and I, we went out on the balcony; it looked like a bomb had exploded,\" he told the BBC.\n\"When we opened the door, there was no building there, it was just a pile of rubble,\" he said.\nEyewitnesses described hearing what sounded like thunder before seeing a huge cloud of dust in the aftermath of the collapse. \nA full investigation into the collapse is set to begin after the rescue mission.\nAs the building has stood since 1980, it was due its standard 40-year review.  It was undergoing its \"recertification\" process and required repairs, officials said.\nThe 2018 engineer's report into the building flagged \"major structural damage\" to the concrete platform beneath the swimming pool deck. It also referred to \"abundant cracking\u2026 of columns, beams and walls\" in the garage.\nThe report didn't suggest the 40-year-old building was at any imminent risk of collapse but its author, engineer Frank Morabito, urged that the concrete repairs be carried out in \"a timely fashion\".\nMeanwhile, a study from researchers at Florida International University published last year found that the building had been sinking at a rate of two millimetres per year in the 1990s, which may have affected the building structurally.\nBut the author has cautioned that the study was just a snapshot in time. The building was constructed on reclaimed wetland, which experts say is always of concern as the land underneath can compact over time, leading to shifts.\nOn the sinking, the author of the study, Prof Shimon Wdowinski, told the Miami Herald newspaper: \"We've seen much higher than that, but it stood out because most of the area was stable and showed no subsidence.\"\nProf Wdowinski said the research was not meant to suggest certainty about the latest incident."

No deaths were recorded, although registration offices are generally closed over the weekend.\nThe previous highest number was the 2,999 cases reported last Thursday.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the \"steep rise\" in cases showed that people should be \"really careful\".\nBut she said there was \"positive news\" from the vaccine programme, which she said was preventing a similar rise in the number of people in hospital or losing their lives.\nMs Sturgeon will host a briefing on Tuesday with Dr Gregor Smith, the chief medical officer, to discuss the rising Covid case numbers.\nShe is likely to repeat her warnings to the public to take care with three weeks to go until a further easing of restrictions.\nThe government aims to move the whole of Scotland to the lowest level of the five-tier system of restrictions on 19 July, before lifting most measures entirely in August.\nHowever, the announcement of these plans has coincided with a sharp rise in new cases of the virus, with infections surpassing the highest levels of the \"second wave\" in January.\nMinisters hope the vaccine programme can break the link between rising case numbers and serious illness, leading to hospital admissions, and deaths.\nA total of 202 people were in hospital on Sunday with a recently-confirmed case of Covid-19, with 20 in intensive care.\nMeanwhile, 3.7 million people have now had a first dose of a vaccine, while just under 2.7 million have had two doses.\nMs Sturgeon said: \"We're seeing quite a steep rise in Covid cases right now.\n\"The positive news is that vaccination is providing a lot of protection so we are not seeing a commensurate rise in the number of people going into hospital or intensive care, or dying from the virus.\"\nHowever, she stressed that people should not be complacent.\nScotland may no longer be competing in the Euros, but we are top of one league - with the highest case rate of all the UK nations. \nThe biggest group testing positive is young men and there are suggestions the football is to blame. This could account for some cases, but public health officials report outbreaks at weddings, workplaces, schools, and a whole variety of settings. \nIt doesn't feel like we are winning the race against the virus. The weekly average is now higher than it was in the January peak. Back then, lockdown measures were in place to bring those numbers down. But now, with people free to mix, the risk is that the only way for the numbers to go is up. \nIn the long term we may need to get used to having high case numbers. The key is having trust that the vaccines will do their job, limiting the numbers of people that get seriously ill and need hospital treatment. \nBut there are still plenty of people to get their first jag. It's a delicate time and again, we're being asked not to drop our guard. \n\"There are still a number of people who are not yet fully vaccinated, although we are vaccinating as quickly as supplies will allow,\" she said.\n\"And while this vaccine programme is highly effective, vaccines are not 100% effective. \n\"So if we don't want to see the virus run ahead of the vaccines, it's really important everybody is really careful.\"\nThe first minister would not be drawn on whether the increase in cases would have an impact on the planned easing of restrictions, saying a formal review would be carried out closer to the time."

      "text": "The taoiseach (Irish PM) has insisted he is listening to unionist concerns over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nMiche\u00e1l Martin was responding to an accusation by DUP leader-designate Sir Jeffrey Donaldson that the Irish government was \"cheerleading\" for the protocol. \nIt is the part of the Brexit deal which creates a border in the Irish Sea.\nSir Jeffrey was speaking after being endorsed as party leader by MLAs and MPs. \nHe said the protocol was \"dragging our politics backwards\".\nThe Lagan Valley MP said the Irish government had ignored unionist concerns over the imposition of Irish Sea trade barriers.\nBut on Sunday, Mr Martin told Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 that he wants to engage with unionists on the issue. \n\"We do listen to unionists and I think Jeffrey knows that I certainly do,\" he said.\nHe said he wanted unionists' concerns over the protocol to be resolved in the context of the EU-UK negotiations. \nEarlier on Sunday, Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis said work has to be done to fix the \"big disruption\" to businesses and consumers in Northern Ireland.\nMr Lewis said people in Northern Ireland should \"have the same experience that they would anywhere else in the UK\".\nMaro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the vice president of the European Commission, is due to appear before Stormont's Committee for the Executive Office on Monday.\nLast week, Mr Martin urged the European Union to grant an extension to grace periods around chilled meat, in order to de-escalate tensions around the protocol.\nAsked by RT\u00c9 if he thought the British government should show more flexibility on the issue, Mr Martin said: \"I think the British government does need to respond. Reciprocity is important. \n\"I've spoken to the European leaders and they want this issue resolved. They don't want to be imposing restrictions that don't make sense, but they want to see that similar sense of a resolve from the UK government and I've made this point to the British prime minister.\""

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Jeremy Miles,Welsh government,Wales education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales' education minister says he wants to minimise the number of children having to self-isolate from schools.\nJeremy Miles told a press conference he wanted to make sure a \"disproportionate\" number of pupils were not having to self-isolate.\nCouncils in north-east Wales have told BBC Wales thousands of children are staying away from classes.\nBut a head teachers' union said it was \"utterly confused\" by Mr Miles' comments.\nMr Miles also said it would be up to individual schools, colleges and universities to decide their own Covid-safety rules in future - such as on social distancing, face masks and testing.\nIt does not mean the safety measures - which are currently subject to national guidance - will be totally scrapped.\nBut the minister said he wanted them to \"gradually ease\", with schools running as normal as possible in the autumn.\nThe latest three-day rolling number of cases across schools in north Wales is at an average of 26 new cases a day - higher than at the peak of the second Covid wave in December.\nIt compares with just eight cases a day in the Swansea Bay health board area, and less than one case a day on average across Powys. \nGroups of children, called bubbles, have been told to isolate when cases have been identified in their schools. That can involve entire year groups having to stay home.\nMr Miles said the Welsh government would be looking at \"best practice across Wales to ensure that there we do not have a disproportionate number of learners self-isolating\".\n\"While class or year bubbles have played an important role over the last year, we need to ensure that settings distinguish between bubbles on the one hand, and personal contact with cases on the other,\" he said.\nMr Miles said he wanted to make sure schools were not treating the individual contacts of a positive Covid-19 case and entire school bubbles the same way, \"because they are importantly very separate\".\nHe said schools would be helped to minimise the numbers having to self-isolate, using contact tracing.\nMr Miles acknowledged that in parts of north Wales cases were \"increasing\" - but he said it was not \"inevitable\" that more coronavirus cases would have an impact on schools there in the final three weeks of term. \n\"While we will not simply be back to normal by September, we will look to gradually ease the extraordinary measures we've had to put in place,\" Mr Miles told the press conference.\n\"Our guiding principle has to be a move towards education being enabled to operate as normally as possible in the autumn.\n\"Currently, all education settings follow national guidance. However, as we move through the pandemic there will be a need to move to a more localised approach, rather than a blanket approach,\" he added.\nEithne Hughes, director of Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: \"It appears from the education minister's statement that he suspects some schools in Wales are guilty of sending home large numbers of young people to self-isolate unnecessarily.\n\"The very last thing any school leader wants to do is to now have learners lose any more time in the classroom following the significant disruption to education they have experienced over the course of the last 16 months.\"\nLaura Doel of the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru Laura Doel said: \"Whilst we all went to see an end to restrictions on social distancing in schools as soon as possible, the plan to do away with 'class bubbles' but retain a requirement for schools to identify close contacts of pupils is impractical,\" she said. \nShe added: \"The proposals, with all the unintended consequences, have the potential to be hugely disruptive. \n\"We are utterly confused by the minister's statement, which we think could actually increase the number of close contacts rather than reduce them.\"\nWelsh Conservative education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said: \"We can't afford for whole communities to be left behind thanks to a postcode lottery in education provision, and Labour ministers need to show leadership on this issue, and not pass the buck and responsibility for decision-making on to staff and schools that are already under enormous pressure.\"\nPlaid Cymru's Sian Gwenllian it was \"crucial that the government is absolutely transparent with the public and provides a full picture on how quickly the virus is spreading in our classrooms and what measures they are putting in place - such as increased ventilation and vaccinations for young people - to curb the spread.\"\nKeith Maher, head teacher of Pen y Dre High School, Merthyr Tydfil, said while he was looking forward to seeing an easing of restrictions he did not want to do anything that would \"take us back a step\".\nSpeaking before Mr Miles' press conference, he said schools had adapted well to the \"unique experience\" and he was \"quietly satisfied\" with the way it had gone.\nLooking towards the autumn term, he said he wanted to see \"opening up slowly, surely, gradually in a measured way to make sure our children don't miss out on the fun of being young\".\n\"What we are looking for is clarity of information, a shared understanding of what the new term will look like but hopefully moving towards further easing back on risk assessments.\"\nSam, 15, is in Year 10 at Pen y Dre High School and said he did not mind Covid measures if it meant in-person teaching could take place.\n\"We are grateful because online learning wasn't quite one-to-one, but now teachers are making it better to get back to normality so any measure we need to take is fine with me.\"\nHe thought being able to go to school without face masks next term could boost morale but was happy for other measures to stay in place.\nGracie, 12, went up to Year 7 while restrictions were in place which were not required in primary schools.\nShe said she had got used to it - but some measures had made it harder to make friends and children missed out on more practical lessons such as drama.\n\"I really enjoy school at the moment but if it went down to 1m instead of 2m distance I could make more friends and be more comfortable,\" she said."

At this time this remains a matter for the relevant government department.\"\nFormer cabinet ministers Alan Johnson and Rory Stewart both said there had never been cameras in their offices during their time in government.\nSpeaking to Sky News's Trevor Phillips On Sunday, former Labour cabinet minister Mr Johnson said: \"I could never understand why there was a camera in the secretary of state's office.\n\"There was never a camera in my office when I was health secretary or in any of the other five cabinet positions.\"\nMr Stewart, who was the Tories' International Development Secretary from May to July 2019, said in a tweet: \"I definitely did not know that there were cameras in any of my ministerial offices (in fact I was told - when I asked if there were any cameras - that there were not cameras in my office in DfiD).\"\nHe added: \"If it were a departmental camera - perhaps focused on the door for security reasons - then it would be seen by the security officers.\n\"Someone else installing it would have some challenges - security passes, doors, access to ministerial office etc.\""

      "text": "Boris Johnson has defended his actions following Matt Hancock's resignation as health secretary over breaking social distancing guidelines with a colleague.\nAsked why he hadn't sacked Mr Hancock, the PM replied: \"I read the story on Friday and by Saturday we had a new health secretary.\"\nThe prime minister says the resignation happened at the \"right pace\".\nHowever on Friday, No 10 said the PM had accepted an apology from Mr Hancock and considered the case \"closed\".\nMr Hancock quit on Saturday after he and his aide Gina Coladangelo were caught on camera kissing in his Whitehall office, breaching Covid guidelines.\nIt is understood that the father of three has left his wife of 15 years, Martha, while his relationship with Ms Coladangelo is described as \"serious\".\nDowning Street has denied that Mr Johnson put pressure on Mr Hancock to resign during a meeting at Chequers - the prime minister's country residence - on Saturday. \nAsked why the prime minister declared the matter \"closed\" on Friday but then thought Mr Hancock was right to resign on Saturday, the spokesman explained: \"They had further discussions on Saturday. The prime minister thought it was the right decision.\"\nHowever Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner accused Mr Johnson of \"trying to rewrite history because he didn't have the guts to sack Matt Hancock\". \n\"A fish rots from the head down, and by failing to sack the former health secretary, Johnson proved he doesn't have the leadership qualities or judgement required to be prime minister.\" \nAnalysis by political correspondent Greg Dawson\nBoris Johnson was in no mood to elaborate on why he didn't choose to sack Matt Hancock instead of allowing him to resign.\nAs far as Downing Street is concerned, the prime minister believed the former health secretary's decision to stand down was \"the right thing to do\" and that is the end of the matter. \nHowever, if the PM thought the swift appointment of Sajid Javid as the new health secretary for England would bring an end to the matter he might be disappointed.  \nFirstly, questions remain about Mr Johnson's judgement in backing Mr Hancock when the story first emerged last week and whether there is a growing problem regarding standards in his government. \nSecondly, the questions over whether Mr Hancock broke the rules by using his personal email account to conduct government business are likely to linger.  \nThese concerns are not just about the security of information but also the transparency of government business. \nThe government is also facing questions after The Sunday Times reported that Mr Hancock had potentially breached guidelines by using his personal email account for government business.\nOfficial guidelines state that where government business is conducted using private email addresses, steps should be taken \"to ensure the relevant information is accessible\".\nThey say a copy should be sent to a departmental email address for record-keeping purposes, but also so it can be requested under the Freedom of Information Act.\nLabour has demanded a \"full-scale investigation\" into whether private emails were used to discuss government contracts, and if their use might have potentially broken the law.\nAsked about Mr Hancock's use of a private email address, the prime minister's spokesman said: \"My understanding is it's related to things like diary acceptances.\n\"The rules for the use of private email are set out clearly.\"\nMeanwhile, the Department of Health and Social Care has made clear \"the former health secretary only ever conducted government business through their departmental email addresses\".\nElizabeth Denham, the UK Information Commissioner said: \"The issue of ministers and senior officials using private email accounts to conduct sensitive official business is a concerning one for the public.\n\"I am looking carefully at the information that has come to light over the past few days and considering what further steps may be necessary to address the concerns raised with me.\"\nThe prime minister refused to comment when he was asked by reporter if he ever used a personal email address for government business.\nThe circumstances of Mr Hancock's departure has raised other concerns including how Ms Coladangelo, a long-term friend of Mr Hancock, was appointed as a non-executive director in the health department and how images of the couple's kiss were leaked to the media.\nAsked about cameras in government offices, Mr Johnson replied: \"I'm sure all that kind of thing is going to be looked in to.\"\nCabinet Office Minister, Julia Lopez later told MPs that the images appear to have come from CCTV footage, rather than a covertly-placed camera.\nOn Ms Coladangelo's \u00a315,000 a year job in government, a government spokesman has said the appointment was \"made in the usual way\" and \"followed correct procedure\".\nLabour has also questioned why Mr Hancock was entitled to three month's salary on leaving office.\nMr Hancock turned down the \u00a316,000 payment, but Labour says the money should not have been on offer in the first place."

      "text": "Six people were injured and several buildings evacuated after a fire caused a huge plume of smoke to billow into the sky above south London.\nAbout 100 firefighters battled the blaze at some railway arches near Elephant and Castle station.\nFire crews were called shortly before 13:45 BST and local residents reported hearing a number of explosions.\nLondon Fire Brigade (LFB) said three commercial units were alight along with six cars and a telephone box.\nLondon Ambulance Service said it had treated six people at the scene, with one of those taken to hospital.\nA police officer was among those who needed treatment for the effects of smoke inhalation, according to the mayor of London.\nPeople living in the area were warned to keep doors and windows closed and trains are not expected to run through Elephant and Castle for the rest of the day.\nFifteen fire engines were called to the scene, with the fire thought to have started in some garages close to the railway station.\nFive people had escaped before fire crews arrived, LFB said.\nAnthony King told the BBC he was about to catch his train home when he saw smoke coming out of a car mechanics and \"after about five to six minutes, canisters went up\".\nThe 51-year-old said the fire then spread to the adjoining arches and \"there was acrid smoke going up as high as the new towers\".\nSara Scarpa, 25, who lives in nearby apartment building Hurlock Heights, said: \"We opened the window for a sec as you could hear people shouting, and we smelt something very, very strong.\n\"The smoke (was) dying down a little... we heard an explosion and now it started again,\" she said. \nAlex Lecki, who works in a restaurant in Elephant and Castle, said his entire building had been evacuated.\n\"We saw smoke billowing out... the smoke pillar started enveloping the apartment blocks as well and we kept hearing intermittent bangs,\" the 30-year-old said.\nHe added that police had \"indicated it could be some time\" before they would be allowed to return.\nAnother restaurant worker, 21-year-old Abdullah Safi, said the flames were \"burning so high\" and were reaching about 50ft in height.\n\"I've never seen something that big - I was scared. And it exploded twice,\" he said.\nThe blaze was under control shortly after 15:30 but LFB said firefighters would remain at the scene for a few hours to dampen down the scene.\nThe cause of the fire is unknown.\nThe Met said that \"significant road closures\" were put in place and people were advised to avoid the area.\nLondon mayor Sadiq Khan praised the emergency services, who he said had acted quickly to ensure both local residents and passengers at Elephant and Castle station were safely evacuated.\nNetwork Rail warned that it appeared signalling equipment had been damaged in the blaze, although engineers were unsure of the extent.\nAs a result, Thameslink said trains were not expected to run for the rest of the day with services between St Albans and Sutton and between London Blackfriars and Sevenoaks affected.\nTravellers have been advised to use buses, London Underground services, trams or some trains run by Southeastern, Southern and South Western Railway.\nThameslink warned that services could still be affected on Tuesday and people should check before travelling.\nNorthern Line Tube services through Elephant and Castle were also not stopping at the station \"as a precaution\" but have since returned to normal, Transport for London said."

Several other districts saw at least 70mm of rain. \nThe storm delayed a flight carrying Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and her delegation to Beijing for the Chinese Communist Party's 100th anniversary celebrations by around an hour, according to the South China Morning Post.\nSchools and Covid-19 vaccination services were also suspended due to safety concerns."

      "tags": "Australia",
      "text": "Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has met national leaders for emergency talks on how to tackle a spike in Covid-19 infections. \nAn outbreak in Sydney linked to the highly contagious Delta variant has grown to 128 cases.\nCases have also been recorded in the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia.\nOfficials say it is a \"critical time\". Australia has kept case numbers low with border closures and lockdowns.\nReports say the emergency meeting considered measures such as mandatory vaccinations for care home workers and new quarantine rules.\nThis is the first time in months that cases have emerged in multiple parts of the country at the same time.\n\"I think we're entering a new phase of this pandemic, with the more contagious Delta strain,\" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told ABC News ahead of the meeting of the Covid-19 response committee.\nThe escalation in Covid infections has prompted lockdowns in the cities of Sydney and Darwin, as well as restrictions across four states.\nThe situation remains most concerning in Sydney, where some five million residents are subject to a stay-at-home order.\nThe New South Wales (NSW) state government on Sunday expanded a lockdown to cover all of Greater Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Central Coast and Wollongong.\nMany businesses and venues have been ordered shut.\nOn Monday NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian reported 18 new cases, down from the 30 reported the previous day. Nearly 59,000 people had been tested in the previous 24 hours.\n\"We have to be prepared for the numbers to bounce around and we have to be prepared for the numbers to go up considerably because with this strain, we are seeing almost 100% of transmission within households,\" she said.\nFrances Mao, BBC News Sydney\nJust a week ago Sydney was still in near Covid-free bliss - with people packed into restaurants and dancing in clubs.\nBut the swift spread of Delta has upended the \"new normal\". The strain is now linked to three of four clusters affecting Australia.\nExperts say the nation's defences have been beaten, multiple times, by the powerful variant. It's breached hotel quarantine several times, raising concerns about air transmission.\nIt's also managed to break through relaxed distancing rules in society, latching onto unprotected workers. Mask-wearing is now back in almost every state in Australia.\nIn Sydney, officials say the virus is infecting 100% of household contacts when it's brought into a home. It's too early to tell if this lockdown will contain it, according to experts.\nLow vaccination rates have also left Australians vulnerable.\nOne expert told me it's a \"perfect storm\" for \"what is now easily the most dominant variant in the world\".\nNSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard has described the Delta variant which was first detected in India as a \"very formidable foe\".\n\"No matter what defensive steps we're taking at the moment, the virus seems to understand how to counter-attack.\"\nWhile the two cases in Western Australia have been traced to the Sydney outbreak, the positive cases in Queensland and the Northern Territory have been linked to people who became infected despite completing hotel quarantine.\nThe remote Northern Territory has recorded seven cases, prompting authorities to extend a lockdown of the local capital, Darwin, until Friday. \nThe Delta outbreak there had spread from a mining camp and now posed significant risk to the community, officials said.\n\"For the first time, we do have public exposure sites in the Northern Territory,\" said Chief Minister Michael Gunner.\nAuthorities are also on alert after a member of cabin crew staff for Virgin Australia worked on five domestic flights while infected with the Delta variant. The airline has contacted all affected passengers and crew.\nThe outbreaks have prompted some inter-state and international border closures.\nNew Zealand paused its quarantine-free travel bubble with all of Australia until at least Tuesday because of the latest outbreak.\nThe travel corridor between the two neighbours was opened in April. Travel between New Zealand and specific Australian regions has been closed for short periods as outbreaks emerged, but this is the first time the bubble has been shut with all of Australia.\nAustralia has maintained very low rates of Covid transmission throughout the pandemic due to a closed-border policy, stringent quarantine and swift testing and tracing systems.\nIt has recorded no deaths this year, but 910 deaths and 30,450 cases overall.\nThe newer, more infectious Covid variants however, have strained the nation's defences - with several small outbreaks this year.\nSydney's outbreak first emerged two weeks ago in Bondi, the famous beach suburb, before spreading rapidly across the city.\nIts origin has been linked to an unvaccinated driver who transported international arrivals from the airport.\nThe NSW government has urged people to get their vaccine - noting that in one of the Sydney clusters, 24 of 30 people at a party became infected and those who didn't had been vaccinated.\n\"If you're vaccinated, you are much more likely to not be infected with Covid-19,\" Mr Hazzard told reporters on Monday.\nThe recent outbreaks have renewed criticism of the nation's slow vaccination rollout - which falls under the federal government's purview.\nSo far, just under 5% of Australia's adult population have been fully vaccinated under a phased rollout, and roughly 30% have received a first dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine. \nHowever, significant levels of hesitancy have been recorded around the AstraZeneca vaccine due to its link to a rare blood clotting syndrome. Meanwhile, Pfizer supplies have been limited to certain age groups.\nGovernment critics have argued that cities would not need to endure lockdowns if a majority of the population was vaccinated."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nNewly-appointed Health Secretary Sajid Javid will face MPs about when the remaining coronavirus restrictions will be lifted in England. Having only been appointed late on Saturday - after Matt Hancock stood down when footage emerged of him breaching social distancing rules by kissing a colleague - Mr Javid spent much of Sunday getting up to speed at the Department of Health and Social Care. He'll be making his debut as health secretary in the House of Commons later to give an update on the data to see if restrictions can be lifted before 19 July, when measures are due to ease. Elsewhere in the UK, the lifting of coronavirus restrictions has been\u00a0paused in Wales with a review on 15 July, while\u00a0in Scotland, it is hoped that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August, and some rules in\u00a0Northern Ireland\u00a0will be reviewed on 1 July.\nThe delay in lifting lockdown in England is not reflected in how companies are being helped, says the Federation of Small Businesses. It says moving the date from 21 June to 19 July due to a rise in coronavirus infections means small firms need more help to bridge an 18-day gap as financial support packages wind down. From the start of July changes include business rate exemptions for retailers and hospitality firms ending. The FSB national chairman Mike Cherry told the BBC some of the UK's most fragile businesses had \"clung on\" through the pandemic, but now have no cash reserves remaining. Bu the government said \"substantial\" support would remain including the furlough scheme.\nAs the fallout from former Health Secretary Matt Hancock's breach of Covid guidance continues, Labour is calling for an investigation into ministers' use of private email addresses for government business. Mr Hancock stood down after video footage emerged of him kissing colleague Gina Coladangelo. Since his breach was exposed another claim has come to light - that Mr Hancock also potentially breached guidelines by using his personal email account. The Sunday Times reported the story which prompted Labour's call for an investigation. Deputy leader Angela Rayner said it could \"conceal vital information\" as it could mean that the government does not hold complete records of the former health secretary's decision-making during the pandemic. The Department of Health and Social Care said ministers conducted business through departmental emails.\nCan the Covid vaccine change your period? If so, why? Dr Viki Male, reproductive immunologist at Imperial College London, has answered some of the questions you've been asking - the main thing is heavier or delayed periods are nothing to worry about, experts say. Watch the video to find out more.\nIt's back. For all the Love Island fans out there the 18-month wait is finally over.

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Matthew Hancock,Sajid Javid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "One out and one in. The prime minister had backed Matt Hancock to hang on. \nThe now former health secretary had tried to cling on. But even on Friday senior Tories were directly warning both of them that his position was just not tenable. \nNot because of his personal exploits with a taxpayer-supported colleague, but because he broke the rules that he helped to set. \nOne senior Tory told me it \"beggared belief\" that the man who had essentially banned casual relationships for a year was caught out having disobeyed the guidance himself, but still tried to maintain his position. Another insider said \"everyone hates hypocrisy\". \nFor every moment that he tried to stay both his and Boris Johnson's judgement remained in doubt.\nMr Hancock's record in charge at the Department of Health had also been under attack, with claims that Boris Johnson himself had said that he had been \"hopeless\" at the start of the pandemic. But the stresses and strains of managing the pandemic were not the catalyst for him to go.\nDowning Street has tried to follow a dramatic exit with a less controversial arrival. \nThe new health secretary, Sajid Javid, has already done several of the most senior jobs in government. \nHe may have clashed with Boris Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings, but has years of experience in senior roles and was known to be keen to return in a frontbench role. \nBy bringing Mr Javid back Downing Street has also avoided a major shake-up of ministers. \nJust as Mr Johnson wanted to avoid Mr Hancock having to leave at all, the prime minister was reluctant to recast his senior team."

      "tags": "Amber Rudd resignation,HM Treasury,UK immigration,Home Office,Windrush scandal,Sajid Javid",
      "text": "Sajid Javid has been appointed health secretary following the resignation of Matt Hancock who stepped down for breaking social distancing guidelines. \nMr Javid previously served as home secretary under former Prime Minister Theresa May, and in 2019 was promoted to chancellor by Boris Johnson. \nHowever he only lasted in that role for six months, resigning in February 2020 following tensions with the prime minister's then-advisor Dominic Cummings.\nMr Javid was told he would have to sack his own advisors, but he rejected the order saying it was something \"no self-respecting minister\" could accept.\nFollowing his resignation as chancellor, Mr Javid returned to life as a backbench MP, but also took up a job with JP Morgan.\nSince becoming health secretary, Mr Javid has given up his role at the US bank.\nThe MP for Bromsgrove since 2010 was born in Rochdale in 1969, one of five sons of parents who had moved to the UK from Pakistan.\nMr Javid, a 50-year-old father of four, told the Evening Standard in 2012: \"My dad was from a tiny village in Pakistan and came here when he was 17 to look for work.\n\"He settled in Rochdale and became a cotton-mill worker for Courtaulds. But he was quite ambitious, and saw that bus drivers were better paid. His nickname was Mr Night and Day because he used to work every hour God sent his way.\"\nMr Javid's father's job was the same as the father of another high-profile politician, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and he congratulated the Labour politician \"from one son of a Pakistani bus driver to another\" after his City Hall victory in 2016.\nMr Javid spent his school years in Bristol after his parents took over a ladieswear shop there, with the family living in a two-bed flat above it.\nHe told the Daily Mail in 2014 that the school, a local comprehensive, was tough and \"I was naughty, more interested in watching Grange Hill than homework.\"\nBut, he said, things changed when his dad read the riot act. \"He said 'this is what I went through, don't let me down'. I felt really bad. My academic work rocketed.\" \nHe said that his school did not want to pay for him to do maths O-Level - his dad ended paying for it instead. \nHe had also developed an interest in financial markets, sparked by the Thatcher government's privatisations. At the age of 14 he went to see his father's bank manager and arranged to borrow \u00a3500 to invest in shares, becoming a regular reader of the Financial Times.\nHis goal became to work in the City so he passed that maths O-Level and, rejecting his school's suggestion he become a TV repair man, headed off to sixth form college and then to Exeter University to study economics and politics - giving a clear hint of his future career direction. \nHe also met his future wife, Laura, while doing a summer job at Commercial Union. They sat opposite each other and shared a stapler, he told the Daily Mail.\nTheir four children are privately educated: \"We do what's best for them,\" Mr Javid, who has described himself as a non-practising Muslim, told the newspaper. \nAfter university, he set his sights on a job in the City. As he told the Standard: \"Some people, in a friendly way, tried to lower my expectations.\n\"They often tell you that unless you wear an old school tie or have the family contacts, you just won't get a chance to work in the City. But they were wrong.\"\nHis career move worked out well, although he had to move across the Atlantic to succeed. And by the age of 25, he had become a vice-president at Chase Manhattan Bank, later moving to Singapore for a period with Deutsche Bank. He rose to become a managing director before leaving in the summer of 2009 to concentrate on a political career.\nA Conservative Party supporter from the early 1980s, he had attended his first conference towards the end of the Thatcher years, with Conservative friends from university such as fellow Tory MP Robert Halfon.\nThey got into a bit of trouble at the 1990 conference, handing out leaflets against the then prime minister's decision to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, opposing the policy despite being diehard fans of Mrs Thatcher's.\nAccording to a ConservativeHome profile, Mr Javid, Mr Halfon, another future Tory MP David Burrowes and Tim Montgomerie - founder of ConservativeHome - got up at 07:00 so they could get front-row seats for what turned out to be Mrs Thatcher's final party conference speech.\nTwo decades on and, in 2010, he was elected for the first time, and made swift progress.\nHe began his ministerial career with roles in the Treasury, before becoming the first cabinet minister of Asian descent when he was appointed culture, media and sport secretary in 2014. \nHe did that for a year before moving to business secretary for a year and then moving on to be communities and local government secretary.\nLong thought of as a Eurosceptic, it was a surprise to many when Mr Javid came out for Remain during the UK's 2016 referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union. \nThat meant, of course, that like then-Home Secretary Theresa May and his one-time mentor, then Chancellor George Osborne, he was on the losing side. \nThere was an ill-fated and very short-lived bid to succeed David Cameron as Conservative leader after the referendum, on a \"joint ticket\" with Stephen Crabb. (He would have been chancellor to Mr Crabb's prime minister.)\nHe also ran in the 2019 leadership election but was eliminated in the fourth round before Mr Johnson went on to become prime minister.\nMr Javid was appointed home secretary in April 2018, following the resignation of Amber Rudd during the fallout from the Windrush scandal.\nAt the time, Mr Javid told the Sunday Telegraph the scandal \"immediately impacted him\". \nMr Javid told the newspaper: \"When I heard about the Windrush issue, I thought that could be my mum, it could be my dad, it could be my uncle, it could be me.\"\nIn 2019 he took a hardline stance towards Shamima Begum, who left London to join the Islamic State group aged 15, revoking her British citizenship when she asked to return. \nThe move boosted his popularity amongst some Tories but provoked criticism from others - particularly after her newborn son died in a Syrian refugee camp. \nIn his previous cabinet roles he avoided major calamity, although he faced questions as business secretary over Tata steel, and as communities secretary over the government response to the Grenfell disaster. \nHowever, he had not been afraid to ruffle feathers, with uncompromising messages to some in the business community and local government.

      "text": "Plans to ease Covid restrictions in England on 19 July are \"looking good\", the prime minister has said.\nBoris Johnson said that was based on the efficacy of vaccines against identified variants.\nBut he warned there could be a \"rough winter for all sorts of reasons\", including a resurgence of flu.\nIt comes as the health secretary said he hoped to exempt fully vaccinated people from the requirement to isolate for 10 days when contact-traced.\nAsked during on a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire whether he could rule out further lockdowns this winter, Mr Johnson said: \"You can never exclude that there will be some new disease, some new horror that we simply haven't budgeted for, or accounted for.\n\"But looking at where we are, looking at the efficacy of the vaccines against all variants that we can currently see - so Alpha, Delta, the lot of them, Kappa - I think it's looking good for 19 July to be that terminus point.\"\nHis comments came after Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the government's advisory committee on vaccination, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that flu \"could be potentially a bigger problem this winter than Covid.\"\nFlu immunity is likely to have dropped in the population as a result of low prevalence because of lockdowns, and it could come \"back to bite us\", he said.\nMr Johnson said the risk of a \"rough winter\" was \"all the more reason to reduce the number of Covid cases now, give the NHS the breathing space it needs to get on with dealing with all those other pressures, and we are certainly going to be putting in the investment to make sure that they can\".\nMeanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that he hoped to bring in a new approach to self-isolation to reflect the changing situation as the country opens up more and more.\nFor the past two months, a pilot study has been under way in which 40,000 people who have been named as contacts of someone who has tested positive for Covid have been allowed to take daily Covid tests and continue with their lives, rather than having to self-isolate. \n\"We're piloting that now to check that will be effective and it is something that we're working on,\" the health secretary said.\n\"We're not ready to be able to take that step yet. But it's something that I want to see and we will introduce, subject to clinical advice, as soon as it's reasonable to do so.\"\nThe trial is not expected to be completed until later in the summer. \nCurrently, anybody who has been told by NHS Test and Trace that they are a contact of somebody who has tested positive for the virus must self-isolate for 10 days.\nThis means not leaving home at all - even to buy food or medicines, or for exercise.  \nThe rule applies to people regardless of whether they have received a coronavirus jab. \nSo far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two doses of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose.\nMore than one million jabs were booked on Friday and Saturday in England, after vaccinations opened to all over-18s. \nThere have been a further five deaths within 28 days of testing positive in the UK, according to the government's daily figures - and 10,633 new cases.\nThe prime minister said the government was also looking at using daily tests for travellers.\nAsked whether ministers were considering allowing double-vaccinated travellers to be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UK if they took daily tests, Mr Johnson told reporters: \"When it comes to travel, we'll certainly be looking at that. \n\"But I want to stress this is going to be, whatever happens, a difficult year for travel - there will be hassle, there will be delays, I'm afraid, because the priority has got to be to keep the country safe and to stop the virus coming back in.\"\nCurrently, people arriving in the UK from a country on the government's amber list must quarantine for 10 days - regardless of whether they have had a coronavirus jab.\nHowever, in England an individual may be able to end their quarantine period early if they pay for an additional test under the test-to-release scheme. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was \"cautiously hopeful\" about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme. \nHe said the government had always committed to regularly review their international travel plan, with the next \"checkpoint\" taking place on 28 June.  \nHe said that the checkpoints would look at whether the \"science would support\" relaxations including people who have received two vaccine doses no longer have to quarantine after returning from certain countries. \nThe original date the government had planned to remove all legal limits on social contact in England was 21 June - but this has been delayed to allow more people to be vaccinated. \nHowever, some restrictions have still been eased. \nThe number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue.\nAnd in Wales, rules are also being lifted slightly, including capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size.\nIn Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictions has been pushed back to at least 5 July, and current rules in Scotland are expected to be extended until mid-July.

      "tags": "NHS,Matthew Hancock,Sajid Javid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Sajid Javid has taken over from Matt Hancock as Health Secretary for England at an extraordinary time - what does the change at the top mean for the NHS?\nMr Javid is a political heavyweight, having held two of the great offices of state, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary, as well as three other Cabinet posts.  \nWhat's more he was at one stage the minister in charge of social care in England.  \nSajid Javid: Who is the new health secretary?\nLaura Kuenssberg: Hancock's dramatic exit\nSimon Stevens: How heavy hitter changed the NHS\nSo the new health secretary has a good understanding already of some of the key issues.  \nAnd he knows all about the inner workings of the Treasury and how the public spending levers work.\nBut even so, he has a daunting workload ahead with some of the most difficult public policy challenges of any Whitehall department. And that's not including the continuing effort to keep on top of Covid. \nMr Javid has set the bar very high for himself with his comment that he wants to see an end to the pandemic and a return to normal \"as soon and as quickly as possible\".  And therein could lie his biggest problem.\nHealth leaders have already warned that bringing waiting times for non-urgent surgery down to reasonable levels could take two years at least.  \nIf that turns out to be the case, patients may feel Mr Javid's optimistic pledge has not been met.  \nA waiting list of 5.1 million patients in England is the highest since modern records began and is likely to keep on rising as long as more patients are referred for surgery and the backlog has not been significantly reduced.   \nThrowing money at the problem is one answer and the new health secretary will know what arguments to use to persuade Treasury ministers and mandarins.  \nGrants to hospitals to build new operating theatres have been made. But more capacity will need more staff hours and the NHS workforce is already at full stretch.  \nWorkforce fatigue and morale, Mr Javid will already know, is one of the biggest problems right now for the health service. Once again there are no quick fixes with multi-year training required for new doctors and nurses.\nThere is also a very tricky decision to make on pay soon following an outcry after an earlier 1% pay offer to many health workers.\nThe coming winter could be as challenging as the last though in different ways.  \nFlu was effectively suppressed last winter thanks to social distancing. That means less residual population immunity and medical experts have warned that the coming winter could see a nasty resurgence of flu. \nThe last bad flu season was in 2018 and then - even before Covid existed - there were widespread suspensions of routine operations and procedures.\nAt least Mr Javid is well acquainted with the arguments about social care reform.  But that does not mean solutions will be any easier to find.  \nHe will have to immerse himself in the detail and, working with the Prime Minister and Chancellor, try to come up with answers about financing which will be hard to sell to the electorate.\nThe new health secretary will have to wrestle with all these issues without one key lieutenant.  \nSir Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, is set to leave at the end of next month. He will be a very hard act to follow and leadership of health and social care in England will be in the hands of two newcomers, which may itself be unsettling for the NHS.\nAnd then there is the pandemic. Sajid Javid will have to focus almost daily on the raft of complex data and advice from its scientific advisory group SAGE, and make finely balanced judgements about what is right for the nation's health as well as the economy.  \nThe vaccination programme is well advanced but the rollout of booster jabs in the autumn and linking that to the flu campaign could be even more complex than what's been run up until now. \nLong Covid will continue to cast a shadow with fears that patient numbers will increase.\nAbove all his new job will require huge amounts of energy. Matt Hancock was criticised over some aspects of his handling of the pandemic but many would praise his drive and determination to push for delivery of vaccines and other essential services.  \nMr Hancock's successor will have to continue fronting up on the relentless timetable of interviews, Commons statements and press conferences.\nChancellor and home secretary are big jobs. Mr Javid will now have to show he can deliver at the heart of the government's response to the biggest peacetime crisis of modern times.  \nHe will be under intense scrutiny and continuing pressure to meet his aim of getting the country out of the pandemic."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Jeremy Miles,Welsh government,Wales education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales' education minister says he wants to minimise the number of children having to self-isolate from schools.\nJeremy Miles told a press conference he wanted to make sure a \"disproportionate\" number of pupils were not having to self-isolate.\nCouncils in north-east Wales have told BBC Wales thousands of children are staying away from classes.\nBut a head teachers' union said it was \"utterly confused\" by Mr Miles' comments.\nMr Miles also said it would be up to individual schools, colleges and universities to decide their own Covid-safety rules in future - such as on social distancing, face masks and testing.\nIt does not mean the safety measures - which are currently subject to national guidance - will be totally scrapped.\nBut the minister said he wanted them to \"gradually ease\", with schools running as normal as possible in the autumn.\nThe latest three-day rolling number of cases across schools in north Wales is at an average of 26 new cases a day - higher than at the peak of the second Covid wave in December.\nIt compares with just eight cases a day in the Swansea Bay health board area, and less than one case a day on average across Powys. \nGroups of children, called bubbles, have been told to isolate when cases have been identified in their schools. That can involve entire year groups having to stay home.\nMr Miles said the Welsh government would be looking at \"best practice across Wales to ensure that there we do not have a disproportionate number of learners self-isolating\".\n\"While class or year bubbles have played an important role over the last year, we need to ensure that settings distinguish between bubbles on the one hand, and personal contact with cases on the other,\" he said.\nMr Miles said he wanted to make sure schools were not treating the individual contacts of a positive Covid-19 case and entire school bubbles the same way, \"because they are importantly very separate\".\nHe said schools would be helped to minimise the numbers having to self-isolate, using contact tracing.\nMr Miles acknowledged that in parts of north Wales cases were \"increasing\" - but he said it was not \"inevitable\" that more coronavirus cases would have an impact on schools there in the final three weeks of term. \n\"While we will not simply be back to normal by September, we will look to gradually ease the extraordinary measures we've had to put in place,\" Mr Miles told the press conference.\n\"Our guiding principle has to be a move towards education being enabled to operate as normally as possible in the autumn.\n\"Currently, all education settings follow national guidance. However, as we move through the pandemic there will be a need to move to a more localised approach, rather than a blanket approach,\" he added.\nEithne Hughes, director of Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: \"It appears from the education minister's statement that he suspects some schools in Wales are guilty of sending home large numbers of young people to self-isolate unnecessarily.\n\"The very last thing any school leader wants to do is to now have learners lose any more time in the classroom following the significant disruption to education they have experienced over the course of the last 16 months.\"\nLaura Doel of the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru Laura Doel said: \"Whilst we all went to see an end to restrictions on social distancing in schools as soon as possible, the plan to do away with 'class bubbles' but retain a requirement for schools to identify close contacts of pupils is impractical,\" she said. \nShe added: \"The proposals, with all the unintended consequences, have the potential to be hugely disruptive. \n\"We are utterly confused by the minister's statement, which we think could actually increase the number of close contacts rather than reduce them.\"\nWelsh Conservative education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said: \"We can't afford for whole communities to be left behind thanks to a postcode lottery in education provision, and Labour ministers need to show leadership on this issue, and not pass the buck and responsibility for decision-making on to staff and schools that are already under enormous pressure.\"\nPlaid Cymru's Sian Gwenllian it was \"crucial that the government is absolutely transparent with the public and provides a full picture on how quickly the virus is spreading in our classrooms and what measures they are putting in place - such as increased ventilation and vaccinations for young people - to curb the spread.\"\nKeith Maher, head teacher of Pen y Dre High School, Merthyr Tydfil, said while he was looking forward to seeing an easing of restrictions he did not want to do anything that would \"take us back a step\".\nSpeaking before Mr Miles' press conference, he said schools had adapted well to the \"unique experience\" and he was \"quietly satisfied\" with the way it had gone.\nLooking towards the autumn term, he said he wanted to see \"opening up slowly, surely, gradually in a measured way to make sure our children don't miss out on the fun of being young\".\n\"What we are looking for is clarity of information, a shared understanding of what the new term will look like but hopefully moving towards further easing back on risk assessments.\"\nSam, 15, is in Year 10 at Pen y Dre High School and said he did not mind Covid measures if it meant in-person teaching could take place.\n\"We are grateful because online learning wasn't quite one-to-one, but now teachers are making it better to get back to normality so any measure we need to take is fine with me.\"\nHe thought being able to go to school without face masks next term could boost morale but was happy for other measures to stay in place.\nGracie, 12, went up to Year 7 while restrictions were in place which were not required in primary schools.\nShe said she had got used to it - but some measures had made it harder to make friends and children missed out on more practical lessons such as drama.\n\"I really enjoy school at the moment but if it went down to 1m instead of 2m distance I could make more friends and be more comfortable,\" she said."

      "text": "Probation services in England and Wales will return to public control, seven years after Chris Grayling's changes that were later labelled as \"flawed\".\nThe former justice secretary's 2014 reforms saw the management of low-risk and medium-risk offenders contracted out to private companies.\nIt led to what was assessed as \"poor quality supervision\" of many offenders.\nLabour has previously welcomed the \"U-turn\", calling the involvement of private firms a \"mistake\".\nMinisters say they want to see more offenders doing community punishments like scrubbing off graffiti, while wearing high-visibility tabards emblazoned with phrases like \"community payback\".\nThey also want to introduce more electronic monitoring, including tags linked to the GPS system for better tracking of some offenders, as well as sobriety tags that test offenders' sweat to ensure they are not drinking alcohol.\nMr Grayling's reforms saw the 35 probation trusts in England and Wales previously running the sector being dismantled.\nUnder the system of 21 contracts, private companies, voluntary groups or charities had to bid to win million-pound contracts to run the Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs).\nOpponents warned at the time of the reforms that the public could be put at risk, and many probation staff resigned over fears the new system would become too fragmented.\nThe House of Commons justice committee also expressed \"considerable concern\" that companies supervising low and medium risk offenders would not be required to have professionally qualified staff - although Mr Grayling promised employees would have the right skills to manage offenders.\nDame Glenys Stacey, chief inspector of probation in 2019, said at the time that the system was \"fundamentally flawed\".\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today: \"Much more needs to be done to protect the public... much more is needed to be done by these private companies. But even if that is done it will not be enough, the system is not able to deliver as well as it could.\"\nHer successor, Justin Russell, echoed her sentiments and has welcomed the rollback of reforms.  \nHe said that the recent injection of hundreds of millions of pounds into the probation service would need to continue, adding the quality of supervision will not improve by just \"shifting large volumes of cases from the private sector into the public sector\"."

      "text": "Covid restrictions for weddings have eased in Scotland, with live entertainment allowed and suppliers no longer part of the limit on guests.\nA person walking the bride or groom down the aisle will also no longer need to wear face a covering.\nFuneral guidance has also been revised to allow people from more than one household to carry a coffin.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said these were \"minor, but important changes\" towards returning to normal.\nIt had previously been hoped that Scotland could move to the lowest level of Covid restrictions, level zero, on 28 June.\nBut last week Ms Sturgeon said current levels would remain in force until 19 July.\nLockdown easing was paused for three weeks to allow more time for people to be vaccinated.\nShe said the easing of wedding and funeral rules are expected to have a \"relatively minor impact on transmission\".\nMs Sturgeon added: \"I hope they will make some difference to those organising and attending weddings and funerals, ahead of the more substantial changes at level zero.\"\nThe current maximum number for attending weddings is 200 guests in level zero, 100 in level one and 50 in level two areas.\nLive entertainment at receptions will now be allowed, however guests will still need to be seated at tables.\nIsland communities such as Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero, with all mainland areas in level one or level two of the country's five-tier system of restrictions.\nDuncan McConchie, of the Scottish Wedding Alliance, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the changes had been \"well received\" and were having an \"immediate impact\".\nBut Mr McConchie, who runs a venue in Dumfries and Galloway, said that with table seating rules still in place they would continue to lobby for further easing.\nHe added: \"We will keep conversations going, we can't sit back - the industry has lost far too much already.\n\"We are looking for dancing and we are also looking for funding that will support us, because we know that over 40% of our industry now will not trade profitably until 2022.\"\nScotland is aiming to remove all of its major Covid restrictions on 9 August.\nThe first minister said this would allow life in Scotland to return to \"almost complete normality\".\nScotland recorded 2,639 new Covid cases and one further death on Sunday. The country was said to have had the highest virus rate in Europe last week.\nA new online portal has also launched to allow all adults in Scotland who have not received a Covid vaccine to self-register for their first dose."
