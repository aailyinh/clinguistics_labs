      "text": "A huge fire has broken out across an area of moorland in Dartmoor, Devon.\nRob Steemson, Dartmoor National Park emergency officer, estimated the blaze to be about 5km (3.1 miles) wide and continuing to spread.\nHe said the fire, which could be seen about 20 miles away in Plymouth, was being stoked by fierce south-westerly winds.\nThe blaze is on remote moorland near Tavistock and no residents or animals are thought to have been injured.\nMr Steemson said a \"watching brief\" was ongoing overnight \"because although it is affecting the moorland, it's not affecting any property or walkers or people out there\".\nHe said he believed firefighters were not directly trying to put out the blaze because of the strength of the winds.\n\"All being well it will peter out when it goes out of the wind and into the river valleys,\" the emergency officer said.\nTen fire service vehicles are dealing with the fire at Tavy Cleave, a Devon and Somerset Fire spokesman said, adding that members of the public should avoid the area.\nThe area on fire was \"general moorland\", Mr Steemson said, made up of heather, gorse and bracken.\nHe said many Dartmoor residents were trained in dealing with fires of this nature, but had not yet been asked to go out.\nColin Sargent saw the blaze from his house at Brentor on the western edge of Dartmoor.\n\"It was a long line of flames and the sky was just getting redder and redder,\" he said.\n\"It was just a red glow in the sky like a sunset or sunrise.\"\nThis fire is the latest in a spate of winter blazes, including at a nature reserve in Cornwall and a number of them in Scotland's Western Isles, all on Wednesday.\nArea commander Bruce Farquharson, from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said winter fires were not uncommon due to extreme cold \"curing\" or drying out vegetation, and happened in Antarctica, Norway and. Scandinavia.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: \"It is counter intuitive for almost everybody but the risk is there, the vegetation is tinder dry and it just takes the slightest spark to ignite the fire and it will burn very quickly and spread very quickly.\"\nBBC weatherman David Braine said the air temperature at Okehampton on the northern edge of Dartmoor was 0C at 22:30, with wind chill making it feel like -8C.\nAre you in the area?

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has warned that China will \u201ceat our lunch\u201d if America doesn\u2019t \u201cstep up\u201d its infrastructure spending. \nMr Biden was speaking on Thursday with a group of senators about the need to upgrade infrastructure in the US. \nHis warning comes the day after his first phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nOn the call, Mr Xi took a hard line on human rights saying a confrontation would be a disaster for both countries. \nMr Biden made the comments after meeting with members of the Environment and Public Works committee.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get moving, they are going to eat our lunch,\u201d President Biden told senators. \n\u201cThey\u2019re investing billions of dollars dealing with a whole range of issues that relate to transportation, the environment and a whole range of other things. We just have to step up.\u201d\nDuring the campaign, Mr Biden proposed spending $2tn (\u00a31.45tn) over four years to create jobs and invest in clean energy infrastructure.\nA widely cited American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) \u201creport card\u201d from 2017 gave the country\u2019s infrastructure a grade of \u201cD+\u201d.  \nThe ASCE estimated that the total \u201cinfrastructure gap\u201d needed $2tn by 2025 to fix, but would cost the economy twice as much if it went unaddressed.  \nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s 2019 Global Competitiveness Report ranked the US 13th in a broad measure of infrastructure quality, down from fifth place in 2002.\nChina has been investing heavily in its infrastructure, pouring money into high-speed rail, metro systems, apartment buildings, electricity grids and mobile networks.  \n\u201cThey have a major, major new initiative on rail and they already have rail that goes 225 miles an hour with ease,\u201d Mr Biden noted.\nPresident Biden also discussed several other points of friction with the Chinese President during his call. \nThe White House said he voiced \u201cfundamental\u201d concerns about Beijing\u2019s \u201ccoercive and unfair\u201d trade practices, as well as concerns over China\u2019s crackdown in Hong Kong and treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang. \nHe also raised China\u2019s increasingly assertive posture toward Taiwan and the country\u2019s lack of transparency over Covid-19, said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki.  \nMr Xi maintained a hard line on Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan, calling them matters of \u201csovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d.\nHe told Mr Biden confrontation would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d and the two sides should re-establish the means to avoid misjudgements, China\u2019s foreign ministry said."

      "tags": "Companies,Online dating",
      "text": "No bumbling here: Dating app Bumble, which made its name by putting women in charge of making contact with potential mates, has soared to a market value of more than $13bn after listing shares.\nIts Wall Street success made 31-year-old boss Whitney Wolfe Herd a rare self-made female billionaire.\nBumble, which also owns Badoo, is one of less than two dozen US firms to list publicly while led by a female founder.\nShares in the firm debuted at $43 apiece, valuing it at over $8bn. \nBut in opening trade on Thursday they shot up to more than $76 each, making the firm worth more than $13bn (\u00a39.4bn).\nMs Wolfe Herd launched Bumble in Texas in 2014, with backing from Russian billionaire Andreey Andreev, the founder of European online dating site Badoo. \nShe has said she was inspired to create a platform where women \"make the first move\" by her frustration with archaic gender norms controlling dating.\nUnlike most dating apps, only female users can make the first contact with matched male users, while in same-sex matches either person can send a message first.\n\"I have experienced firsthand how unequal relationships negatively impact all areas of life,\" she wrote in a letter to investors ahead of the share listing. \"I wanted to change this.\"\nMs Wolfe Herd, the youngest woman to take a company public in the US, also co-founded dating app Tinder, but left the firm alleging sexual harassment. \nTinder's parent company Match Group Inc, which denied the claims and later tried unsuccessfully to acquire Bumble, paid about $1m to settle the dispute.\nMs Wolfe Herd has led Bumble and Badoo since 2019 when Mr Andreev sold his stakes in both businesses to investment giant Blackstone. The two apps combined have 40 million active users, including more than 2.4 million paying customers.\nBumble, whose apps are available in more than 150 countries, has said it is poised for growth, pointing to the rising number of single people globally, increased adoption of online dating and signs that users have become more willing to pay.  \nThe firm is also expanding into new areas, like business networking.\nBut despite an uptick in use, the pandemic has hurt the business, which makes money primarily from subscriptions and in-app purchases.\nIn 2019, revenue jumped more than 35% and it turned a profit of $68.6m.\nIn the first nine months of 2020, however, its growth rate sank to roughly 15% year-on-year, and it posted a loss of $116m.\nIn recent months, investors have displayed strong appetite for shares of new listings, sending companies such as Airbnb and Doordash to sky-high valuations in their market debuts."

      "text": "Schools in Wrexham will delay opening classes to children aged three to seven due to concerns over coronavirus rates.\nFoundation phase pupils are due to start a phased return to school from the Monday after half term. \nWrexham still has the highest rate of Covid infections in Wales, and will not be sending children back until Friday, 26 February.\nAnglesey, Denbighshire and Gwynedd are also delaying the immediate return of younger pupils.\nThe Welsh Government announced last week that primary schools would begin the process of reopening for the first time since Christmas on 22 February.\nWrexham council said: \"Although coronavirus levels are falling in Wrexham, the figures are still very high, so the council and headteachers are carefully considering plans, while continually monitoring the local situation.\n\"In light of this cautious approach, children will not be returning to schools in Wrexham until Friday, 26 February at the very earliest - depending on local coronavirus levels after half-term.\"\nWrexham and Flintshire still have six of the 10 highest localised rates in Wales, when they are broken down by community - or what are known as middle layer super output areas (MSOAs).\nAlthough these case rates too have dropped back in recent weeks.\nThe highest in Wrexham - Wrexham West - has seen 35 actual positive tests over the last week.\nThere are local hotspots too in Holywell and Bagillt and part of Connah's Quay in Flintshire\nFlintshire council, which currently has the second highest case rate in Wales, said it would review a decision to reopen schools on 22 February \"should the public health situation become a cause for concern\".\nSchools on Anglesey, which has the third highest rate of coronavirus infections in Wales, said it would also be delaying pupils returning, phased from Thursday, 25 February.\n\"Our aim is that all foundation phase pupils are back in their classrooms by Wednesday, 3 March at the latest,\" Anglesey officials said.\nMeanwhile Denbighshire said its primary schools would reopen to foundation phase pupils from Wednesday, 24 February, as long as \"all necessary safety measures\" are in place. \nIn Gwynedd, the council has confirmed the Monday and Tuesday of that week will see schools remain closed for staff to prepare for pupils' return.\n\"Gwynedd's Education Authority has met with head teachers this week to ensure they are fully aware of the latest development and our officers continue to offer help and advice regarding the planned phased opening for foundation phase pupils during the week beginning 22 February,\" a spokesman said.\nFree school meals and school transport will be available for all eligible pupils when those schools reopen, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nChildren classed as vulnerable and those of critical workers have been able to remain in school during lockdown. No timetable has yet been given for the return of other children.\nIn an open letter to headteachers, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the Welsh Government had \"always said\" schools should be \"last to close and first to open\" when safe to do so.\nShe said \"much lower\" rates of transmission of Covid-19 and advice from its Technical Advisory Group had allowed the \"partial and phased return to face-to-face learning in schools\".\nMs Williams explained\u00a0there would be some flexibility to the arrangement over the first week, but with all foundation pupils in school by the end of the week.\nAny further phased return for other year groups will be considered as part of the next 21 day review on 19 February.\nThe Welsh Government has also issued detailed guidance on the return to classes, with teachers told they will be expected to face masks in some circumstances."

      "tags": "GDP,Rishi Sunak,Economic growth,UK economy,Budget 2021,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "The UK economy shrank by a record 9.9% last year as coronavirus restrictions hit output, official figures show.\nThe contraction in 2020 \"was more than twice as much as the previous largest annual fall on record\", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nHowever, the economy looks set to avoid a double-dip recession after growth picked up at the end of the year.\nIn December, the economy grew by 1.2%, after shrinking by 2.3% in November, as some restrictions eased.\nHospitality, car sales and hairdressers recovered some lost ground, the ONS said.\nThe growth meant that in the October-to-December quarter the economy expanded by 1%. As a result, the UK is expected to avoid what could have been its first double-dip recession since the 1970s.\nA double-dip is when the economy briefly recovers from recession, only to quickly sink back. A recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters where the economy contracts.\nONS deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow said: \"An increase in Covid-19 testing and tracing also boosted output. The economy continued to grow in the fourth quarter as a whole, despite the additional [lockdown] restrictions in November.\"\nGDP was first measured in the aftermath of the Second World War, and the measure has never previously dropped by more than 4.1% in a year. However, the Bank of England models GDP going back centuries, and the 2020 contraction could be the worse since 1709.\nSuren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Despite avoiding a double-dip recession, with output still well below pre-pandemic levels amid confirmation that 2020 was a historically bleak year for the UK economy, there is little to cheer in the latest data.\"\nAll four economic sectors tracked by the ONS saw a drop in output, with the highest fall coming in the construction sector, which contracted by 12.5%.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: \"Today's figures show that last year our economy experienced a significant shock, and also some signs of resilience over winter.\n\"You know what's clear is right now, many families and businesses are experiencing hardship. That's why we've put in place a comprehensive plan for jobs to support people through this crisis, and we will set out the next stage of our economic response at our Budget in early March.\"\nBut shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: \"These figures confirm that not only has the UK had the worst death toll in Europe, we're experiencing the worst economic crisis of any major economy.\n\"Businesses can't wait any longer. The chancellor needs to come forward now with a plan to secure the economy in the months ahead, with support going hand-in-hand with health restrictions.\"\nHowever, Mr Sunak said international economic comparisons were not necessarily a useful yardstick. \n\"We calculate GDP in a different way to pretty much everybody else. And if you either correct for that difference or look at it in a way that's more comfortable with nominal GDP, what you find, as the Bank of England and the ONS have pointed out, is that our performance is very much in line and comparable to other countries.\"\nEconomists said that with Covid-19 restrictions expected to remain until early spring, the hit to the economy will continue over the next few months.\n\"We anticipate a sharp decline in activity during the first quarter of the year,\" said Kemar Whyte, senior economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. \"Nevertheless, growth will pick up from the second quarter onwards as restrictions ease on the back of a successful vaccination programme.\" \nAs expected the economy stabilised in the last quarter of 2020. But the latest set of statistics confirm the scale of the hit over the whole of last year. \nA technical return to recession has been avoided, with the economy returning to growth at the end of last year. But the economy is certainly falling again so far in the first three months of 2021, due to the tough national lockdowns, as well as some impact from increased trade barriers with the European Union.\nThe chancellor and Bank of England will be paying much more attention to what is going on right now. The renewed lockdown has hit growth considerably again, but not as hard as last April. \nBusinesses and households remain in holding pattern ready to unleash pent up growth when the economy is reopened. \nWhile the vaccine will eventually unlock that growth, the precise timing is still uncertain, and the government remains under pressure to maintain significant sums in economic support.\nLast year's contraction is steeper than almost any other big economy, although Spain suffered an 11% decline.\nBritain has reported Europe's highest death toll from coronavirus and is among the world's highest in terms of deaths per head of population.\nMuch of the damage to the UK economy is attributed by economists to a high dependence on the service sector, which suffered particularly badly during the year because of lockdown.\nHowever, Britain has vaccinated many more people than other European countries so far, raising the prospect of a bounce-back for its economy later this year.\nThat potential fast rebound prompted the Bank of England's chief economist to describe the economy as like a \"coiled spring\" ready to release large amounts of \"pent-up financial energy\".\nAndy Haldane said on Thursday that consumer confidence would surge back thanks to the vaccine programme, with the economy firing \"on all cylinders\" by spring.\nMr Sunak told the BBC: \"There are reasons for cautious optimism, because the vaccine roll-out is going really well. \n\"The prime minister will set out a roadmap for exiting restrictions in the next few weeks and months. It will be the week of February, 22nd, and it's related that we base our roadmap on the best possible evidence of data.\""

      "tags": "Britney Spears,Music",
      "text": "A judge has denied a request by Britney Spears' father to exert greater control over her finances. \nJamie Spears has controlled his daughter's financial affairs since 2008, but the singer has recently indicated she wants him removed.\nOn Thursday, a judge upheld a previous ruling that made a financial company a co-conservator for the singer.\nThe judge rejected Mr Spears' request to keep his previous level of power over his daughter's investments.\nThe ruling means Mr Spears and the private trust company, Bessemer Trust, will now have equal power to manage her finances.\nAs a result, he is now expected to work with the company to create a budget and investment proposal for the singer's estate. \nThe conservatorship is a legal arrangement that was put in place because of concerns about her mental health.\nLos Angeles Judge Brenda Penny appointed Bessemer Trust as co-conservators in November, but rejected the star's effort to remove her father entirely.\nJamie Spears had objected to Bessemer's involvement, arguing that it reduced the power he has held for years. Judge Perry threw out his objection on Thursday. Another hearing is scheduled for 17 March.\nBritney Spears' lawyer Samuel D Ingham III has previously said the singer is \"afraid\" of her father and does not want him to control her finances and career.\nOn Thursday, Mr Ingham reiterated the pop star's wish, adding that it was \"no secret\" she didn't want her father to be a co-conservator, but acknowledged that removing him altogether would be a \"separate issue\".\nInterest in the case has been renewed after the recent release of a documentary that focuses on the conflict over the singer's guardianship. \nFraming Britney Spears, which was produced by The New York Times, examined the conservatorship in depth, as well as how the singer has been treated by the media throughout her career.\nIt also explored the #FreeBritney movement, a campaign by some of the star's fans who believe her life and career are being controlled against her will. Campaigners from the group were outside the hearing on Thursday.\nBabs Gray, host of the BritneyGram podcast, told the BBC outside the court: \"It hasn't changed anything much today... I don't think a lot of forward movement will happen until Britney's lawyer actually files to get her out of the conservatorship.\"\nShe said interest in the #FreeBritney issue had \"exploded\" in the past week as a result of the documentary.\n\"It's been really encouraging to see how supportive everyone is about the movement, how they are reckoning with how Britney was treated in the past,\" she said. \"I hope its not just a flash in the pan. I hope people keep paying attention and keep putting the pressure on.\"\nBritney Spears hasn't performed live for more than two years, and insists she has no intention of doing so again until her father is forced to relinquish control over her career. \nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "One of Britain's biggest and oldest stone circles has been found in Wales - and could be the original building blocks of Stonehenge.\nArchaeologists uncovered the remains of the Waun Mawn site in Pembrokeshire's Preseli Hills.\nThey believe the stones could have been dismantled and rebuilt 150 miles (240 km) away on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire.\nThe discovery was made during filming for BBC Two's Stonehenge: The Lost Circle Revealed.\nThe Welsh circle, believed to be the third biggest in Britain, has a diameter of 360ft (110m), the same as the ditch that encloses Stonehenge, and both are aligned on the midsummer solstice sunrise.\nSeveral of the monoliths at the World Heritage Site are of the same rock type as those that still remain at the Welsh site.\nAnd one of the bluestones at Stonehenge has an unusual cross-section which matches one of the holes left at Waun Mawn, suggesting the monolith began its life as part of the stone circle in the Preseli Hills before being moved.\nIt is already known that the smaller bluestones that were first used to build Stonehenge were transported from 150 miles (240 km) away in modern-day Pembrokeshire.\nBut the new discovery suggests the bluestones from Waun Mawn could have been moved as the ancient people of the Preseli region migrated, even taking their monuments with them, as a sign of their ancestral identity.\nThey would then have been re-erected at Stonehenge.\nArchaeologists said this could explain why the bluestones, thought to be the first monoliths erected at Stonehenge, were brought from so far away, while most circles are constructed within a short distance of their quarries.\nThe archaeological investigations as part of the Stones of Stonehenge research project, led by Professor Mike Parker Pearson of University College London, previously excavated two bluestone quarries in the Preseli Hills.\nTheir discovery that the bluestones had been extracted before the first stage of Stonehenge was built in 3000 BC prompted the team to re-investigate the nearby Waun Mawn stones to see if it was the site of a stone circle supplied by the quarry and later moved.\nOnly four monoliths remain at the site, but an archaeological dig in 2018 revealed holes where stones would have stood, showing the remaining stones were part of a wider circle of 30-50 stones.\nAnd the scientific dating of charcoal and sediment from the holes reveal it was put up around 3400 BC.\nFindings of the discovery, published in the journal Antiquity, show significant links between Stonehenge and Waun Mawn. \nIt also confirms that the region was an important and densely settled area in Neolithic times until 3000 BC when activity seems to have ceased.\nProf Parker Pearson said: \"It's as if they just vanished. Maybe most of the people migrated, taking their stones - their ancestral identities - with them.\"\nAnalysis of the remains of people buried at Stonehenge at the time the bluestones were erected there would seem to back up the theory, as it shows some of them were from western Britain, possibly Wales.\nWith only a few of the Stonehenge stones directly linked to Waun Mawn, the archaeologists also believe monoliths from other stone circles could have been taken from Wales to form part of the new monument.\nProf Parker Pearson said: \"With an estimated 80 bluestones put up on Salisbury Plain at Stonehenge and nearby Bluestonehenge, my guess is that Waun Mawn was not the only stone circle that contributed to Stonehenge.\n\"Maybe there are more in Preseli waiting to be found. Who knows? Someone will be lucky enough to find them.\"\nStonehenge: The Lost Circle Revealed will be broadcast on BBC Two at 21:00 GMT on Friday 12 February. "

      "text": "They are the most extraordinary of fish, resembling \"hedge trimmers with fins\".\nThe sawfish, which is a kind of ray, is also among the most endangered of the fish living in the oceans.\nOnce found along the coastlines of 90 countries, the animals are now presumed extinct in more than half of these, according to a new study. \nThey are vanishing due to habitat loss and entanglement in fishing nets, experts have said.\nTheir \"saws\", which evolved to sense and attack prey, have now become a liability, making them prone to being caught up in fishing gear.\n\"Through the plight of sawfish, we are documenting the first cases of a wide-ranging marine fish being driven to local extinction by overfishing,\" said Prof Nick Dulvy of Simon Fraser University (SFU) in British Columbia, Canada.\nOf the five species of sawfish, three are critically endangered, while two are listed as endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.\nPreviously widespread, the sawfish are now presumed extinct in 55 nations, the study said.\nThere are 18 countries where at least one species of sawfish is missing, and 28 more where two species have disappeared.\nThe list of countries where sawfish are extinct now includes China, Iraq, Haiti, Japan, Timor-Leste, El Salvador, Taiwan, Djibouti and Brunei. \nThe US and Australia appear to be the last strongholds for the species, regarded as \"lifeboat nations,\" where sawfish are better protected.\nThe study, published in Science Advances, also identified eight nations where urgent action could make a big contribution to saving the species through conservation efforts.\nThese are Cuba, Tanzania, Colombia, Madagascar, Panama, Brazil, Mexico and Sri Lanka.\n\"While the situation is dire, we hope to offset the bad news by highlighting our informed identification of these priority nations with hope for saving sawfish in their waters,\" said Helen Yan of SFU. \nShe said it is still possible to restore sawfish to more than 70% of their historical range, \"if we act now\".\nInternational trade in sawfish is prohibited under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna, but targeted and accidental killings still occur.\nSawfish fins and teeth are sold as trophies, food or medicine, and as spurs for cockfighting.\nSonja Fordham, a researcher of the study and president of Shark Advocates International, said there were opportunities to \"bring these extraordinary animals back from the brink\". \nBut she warned that in too many places, \"we're running out of time to save them\".\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

      "text": "A large blaze which broke out on Dartmoor has been extinguished, fire crews said.\nThe fire engulfed a 5km (3.1 miles) strip of remote moorland near Tavistock, Devon on Thursday night.\nDevon and Somerset Fire Service said the fire was out at about 10:00 GMT and the cause is being investigated.\nIt described the blaze as \"extremely dangerous\" due to windy conditions and low visibility. No injuries have been reported.\nThe fire service said \"natural fire breaks\" in the area had helped contain the blaze, which burned out on its own overnight.\nA spokesperson said the cause of the fire is now under investigation.\nFire service incident commander Mike Porter said natural fire breaks on the moor - including granite, roads and the River Tavy - all helped contain the fire. \n\"There was a planned strategy to fight the fire defensively with close monitoring overnight,\" he explained. \nDartmoor National Park said any damage from the fire would primarily be to the surface of the moor because of the \"very wet\" ground underneath the surface and \"regrowth will not be a problem\" for the affected area.\nPeople could see the flames light up the night sky about 20 miles (32km) away in Plymouth on Thursday evening.\nTen vehicles were used to monitor the blaze overnight, with firefighters also using drones and other spotters to observe the spread.\nThere have been several wildfires in the South West in recent days, with another three-mile wide blaze near Bodmin, Cornwall  on Thursday and a blaze suspected to be caused by arson  on a Cornish nature reserve on Tuesday.\nWildfire scientist Dr Thomas Smith from the London School of Economics said these incidents were \"not unusual\" in cold weather, as air temperature is \"not particularly important\" in flames igniting or spreading.\nHe said: \"The driving or spreading of fire is all about moisture in the air and plants.\"\nHe explained current dry winds blowing across England from Europe \"favour the conditions for a fire to ignite and spread\", as they dry out plant material acting as fuel.\n\"Then all you need really is a source of ignition with the wind on the moors for a fire to spread,\" he said.\n\"There are all of the ingredients right now in the South West for wildfires.\" \nThe fire service was forced to operate in \"defensive mode\", preventing the spread of the flames until conditions improved.\nIt said some people were seen trying to watch and photograph the fire.\nThey tweeted: \"This is extremely dangerous and certainly not an essential journey! Please stay away from the area for your own safety.\"\nDevon and Cornwall Police confirmed officers had attended the scene following reports of \"members of the public gathering\". \nNo fines for coronavirus lockdown breaches were issued, the force said. \nThe RSPB said it was \"highly unlikely\" local birds were directly affected by the flames, as it is months before the nesting season begins and birds are very mobile.\nA spokesperson added it \"remains to be seen\" what the longer term implications of the fire are for local habitats.\nFollow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "tags": "Travel,Hotels,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "England's hotel quarantine system could be less stringent than Australia's scheme, a BBC analysis has found.\nA copy of the government's official requirements for hotel operators, ahead of the launch on Monday, showed rules were looser in several key areas. \nIn England, the rules allow guests time outside with security staff, seen in Australia as putting workers at risk.\nThe UK government said its hotel quarantine measures were \"in line with those in other countries\".\nUpdated guidance for hotels will be released \"imminently\", the Department of Health and Social Care said.\nMeanwhile, Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said she understood Border Force still had not been given operational guidance on how the hotel quarantine system would work from Monday. \nHome Office minister Victoria Atkins told the BBC those arriving from \"red list\" countries - deemed high-risk due to new virus variants - would face strict measures even before they departed for the UK.\nThe requirement to quarantine in a hotel applies to British and Irish citizens, and UK residents arriving in England from such countries, including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa, and will cost \u00a31,750 for an individual. \nIn Scotland, all those arriving internationally by air will have to isolate in hotels. \nInternational travel is currently banned, other than for a small number of permitted reasons, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed.\nIt comes as Home Secretary Priti Patel urged people to \"persevere\" with England's booking website, where travellers secure rooms and new mandatory tests, after it was hit by technical issues. \nThe site was taken offline minutes after it launched on Thursday but appeared to be working again by 15:00 GMT on Friday following maintenance work. \nHowever, the government's advice page on hotel quarantine did not include a link directing passengers where to book and instead asked people to check back later to make a booking. \nMs Cooper said it \"isn't good enough\" that Border Force staff still do not know how the system will work at airports, including whether they will be asked to check for high-risk arrivals and if those passengers will be taken straight to hotels or will have to queue with other travellers. \n\"Chaotic long queues with no social distancing in place have the potential to be superspreading events that will undermine the very measures being introduced,\" the Labour MP said. \nBBC science editor David Shukman found the rules in England would be looser than Australia's system, which is seen as among the best in the world.\nA copy of the guidance for hotels in England's system suggested:\nThe UK government said staff would be able to access regular testing and appropriate personal protective equipment.\nIn England travellers will only be allowed out of their rooms for a limited set of exemptions, including exercise. \nThere had been conflicting messages about the policy, with No 10 and the Department of Health forced to issue several clarifications.\nSmoking, which at one stage had been described as a legitimate reason for going outside, will not qualify.\nAsked about differences between England and Australia's systems, Ms Atkins said standards in England \"are amongst the strongest in the world\". \nScotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said hotels there would \"allow people to behave like human beings\" by going outside for fresh air.\nBut one Australian epidemiologist described allowing travellers quarantining in hotels to leave their rooms for fresh air as \"very risky\".\nProf Michael Toole said there was evidence of transmission when guests opened doors, and \"with the positive pressure this kind of fog of virus went out into the corridor, travelled down and infected hotel staff\".\nProf Nancy Baxter, of the University of Melbourne, said governments had a duty to provide people working in the hotels with \"the highest possible protection from infection\". \nIt comes as the Australian state of Victoria enters a five-day \"circuit breaker\" lockdown in a bid to suppress an outbreak linked to its hotel quarantine system.\nThe UK has secured an initial 4,600 rooms across 16 hotels for its quarantine system. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that, at present, around 1,300 people per week arrive in the UK from red list countries, with this number expected to fall.\nThe new system also introduces tougher penalties, with avoiding quarantine in a designated hotel attracting a fine of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000.\nAnyone found to have falsified their travel history on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in on arrival risks up to 10 years in prison.\nAll international arrivals must book and pay in advance for two additional tests during their quarantine period, or face fines up to \u00a32,000.\nIn a further development, government sources confirmed reports that countries could be added to the red list with just a few hours' notice.\nRather than previous weekly reviews of travel corridor arrangements, there will now be a \"fast track\" system allowing ministers to quickly curb travel from virus hotspots.\nIt comes as 15,144 new cases were recorded in the UK, as well as 758 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nMeanwhile, more than 14 million people have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest government figures. \nWill you be travelling to the UK from a \"red list\" country?

      "tags": "Children",
      "text": "The founder and former trustees of the collapsed charity Kids Company have won a High Court battle against being disqualified from other organisations. \nThe Official Receiver argued they were \"unfit\" to hold directorships because of their handling of the charity.\nBut the ruling cleared former chief executive Camila Batmanghelidjh and the seven others of personal wrongdoing.\nThe judge added the charity may have survived had it not been for unfounded allegations of criminal activity.\nA plan to restructure the organisation's finances had been agreed with David Cameron's government.\nBut the charity closed its doors in 2015 after the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into sexual assault allegations, following the broadcast of a BBC Newsnight report.\nThe police investigation concluded in 2016 after finding no evidence of criminality.\nIn her ruling, Mrs Justice Falk said the charity, which worked with hundreds of vulnerable children in London and Bristol, may have survived financially to continue its work had it not closed.\nDuring the lengthy court battle, the Official Receiver - a body that looks into potential wrongdoing by company directors - had alleged that the charity's former leaders should be disqualified as directors because the organisation had been so badly run.\nIn the run-up to its collapse, the charity was spending around \u00a320m a year, up to a quarter of which came from the government.\nThe Official Receiver alleged that Kids Company's business model had become unsustainable from around September 2013 and its failure was inevitable.\nIt also alleged that the defendants knew or ought to have known that and should have planned to avoid financial collapse.\nThe charity's chairman at the time of its collapse, who was also cleared by the ruling, was the former BBC executive Alan Yentob.\nMrs Justice Falk said the case was not proven.\n\"There was no allegation of dishonesty, bad faith or personal gain,\" said the judge.\n\"There was no allegation of inappropriate expenditure in relation to any of the children assisted by Kids Company.\n\"The allegation is not made out against any of the directors and they are not unfit. The case against them fails.\n\"While aspects of the charity's work were high-risk, the business model was not unsustainable.\"\nMrs Justice Falk said the charity had grown rapidly from its south London base as demand for its specialist support services for vulnerable children grew.\nDespite having a substantial and stable government grant, it also needed to raise additional funds from private donors - and by 2015 it was in talks with Whitehall over how to do that amid concerns about its cash flow and staff costs.\n\"That restructuring plan was agreed and a further government grant was awarded,\" said the judge.\n\"However the charity was forced to close after sexual assault allegations [the same week]. The charity was exonerated following a police investigation - but by that time it was too late.\n\"Had it not been for those unfounded allegations, it is more likely than not that the restructuring would have succeeded and the charity would have survived.\"\nThe judge described the people running the charity as a \"group of highly impressive and dedicated individuals who selflessly gave enormous amounts of their time to what was clearly a highly challenging trusteeship\". \nIn a statement after the ruling, Ms Batmanghelidjh, who founded Kids Company in 1996, said: \"I hope this judgement will be the first step in refuting the many lies that have been told and banishing the false myths.\n\"My regret is that many thousands of children whom we supported were left unassisted and vulnerable once our service was withdrawn and that there were many others who never got a chance to receive help.\"\nSpeaking on the BBC News Channel, Ms Batmanghelidjh said the ruling was \"justice\" for the \"thousands of staff, volunteers and donors who created Kids Company over nearly 20 years\".\nBut she said Kids Company would not have had to \"carry that burden of child protection if the child protection system in this country was fit for purpose\".\nA statement issued on behalf of former trustees said: \"Kids Company was forced to close in August 2015 following what the judge records as 'unfounded allegations' of child abuse, which made fundraising from private and government sources impossible.\n\"We are pleased that finally the facts have been gathered and assessed in a court of law.\""

My work has been really careful in making sure that we've all been safe and I've always followed the rules from day one,\" he says.\n\"It just shows you how transmissible this virus is.\"\nOlder people are more at risk of developing severe disease or dying from coronavirus. But Heather Riddoch, the senior charge nurse here, says they have seen a different profile among some patients in the second wave.\n\"We're certainly seeing younger patients that are coming in and requiring ventilatory support,\" she says. \n\"All ages contract Covid, but we are seeing more people ending up in intensive care in their 30s and 40s in this second wave.\"\n\"I think it's more shocking to see younger people coming in. We've got patients in who are close to our age and younger. \n\"A lot of young nurses here are seeing patients who are the same age as their parents, and more families in the ward all at the one time as well. \n\"There's a definite shift there and it's shocking and it's more real because it could be you.\"\nThis means the increased protection of vaccination for the over-70s won't immediately relieve all the pressure on the NHS.\nNumbers in hospital and ICU are gradually falling across the country, and are now back below the peak seen in April.\nBut that's not the case everywhere, and here in Forth Valley Royal, clinicians are worried they're starting to see the worst of this wave.\nHeather says that earlier in the week things had started to get quieter. \n\"We really felt things had taken a good turn. However, in the last 48 hours we have doubled the number of patients admitted with Covid and it's been quite shocking at how quickly that rapid turnover has happened. \n\"We have actually had to open up another ward and it's a massive change from the beginning of the week.\"\nDr Fiona McIlveney, who is the clinical lead for intensive care, says the hospital may be feeling the impact of recent outbreaks in Falkirk and Clackmannanshire, which have put local infection rates among the highest in Scotland.\n\"I think we are probably a bit different from the rest of the country in that we are still seeing a rise in our Covid numbers in the hospital and in intensive care, she says.\n\"I think there is always going to be regional variation. It's not entirely clear why, but for us we are just starting to see this peak of activity now and this will be our focus for the next few weeks.\n\"Staff have done a phenomenal job for almost a year now. They've had to run their own lives outside of here, they've had the same challenges about home schooling, and worries about illness and family concerns, but every day they've squared their shoulders and come in here, and they have given their absolute all. \n\"I'm so proud of the way they have delivered excellent compassion and care to patients and their families.\"\nUnlike some other health boards, at Forth Valley Royal they have managed to continue with much of their scheduled non-coronavirus care.\nJust next door to the 10-bed Covid ICU, there's another unit where staff are caring for patients with heart problems, kidney failure, and the aftermath of drug overdoses. \nThey also look after patients who were previously in the Covid ward, but have now tested negative. \nThe Scottish government recognises that many patients are spending longer periods of time in intensive care. The most recent figures showed 28 coronavirus patients had been in ICU for longer than 28 days.\nDr McIlveney says the effects of long stays don't stop when patients leave the doors of the unit. \n\"I think our surviving patients can spend up to 60 or 70 days in here before they leave intensive care, and then that leads them still to a long period of rehabilitation,\" she says.\n\"The effects of that persist for some time and some people will never be the same again.\"\nRichard warns that some people still need to realise how serious the disease can be for younger adults.\n\"I mean this hand on heart, on my wee boy's life, you really need to wake up and take this seriously,\" he says. \"This is no joke, I wouldn't be wearing this mask for publicity.

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nThe Bank of England's chief economist has predicted that the British economy will surge back from the latest coronavirus lockdown, thanks to the vaccine programme and large amounts of \"pent-up financial energy\". Writing in the Daily Mail, Andy Haldane said the economy was like a \"coiled spring\" and that due to the number of vulnerable people who would have been vaccinated, restrictions could be eased so that people were socialising and spending by the summer. Figures released on Friday morning show the UK economy shrank by a record 9.9% in 2020.\nDocuments seen by the BBC suggest the quarantine rules\u00a0for\u00a0passengers arriving in England from coronavirus \"red list\" countries - which comes into force on Monday - will be less strict than those enforced by Australia. While Australian rules do not allow guests to mix with security staff, the England will allow people to be escorted outside for \"a smoke or fresh air\". There are other differences around meal deliveries and what kind of protective equipment security and hotel staff should wear - with the government only saying surgical masks should be used, compared with the more protective N95 ones used in Australia.\u00a0\nYoung people's job prospects have been hit hard by the pandemic, with workers under the age of 24 accounting for nearly half of the total fall in employment. Among them is Jamie Gillam. The 22-year-old graduate of King's College London has applied for 200 jobs without success. Young people have also been disproportionately affected by redundancies, says the Institute for Employment Studies, because they tend to work in the hardest-hit sectors such as hospitality and tourism. \nIt's hard to escape the fact that for babies, toddlers and pre-schoolers, the coronavirus lockdowns have made up a significant part of their young lives. Does this mean we should be concerned they are missing out on socialising, learning, having routines and getting outside? We've tried to answer some of these concerns here, and also look at where to get more help if you're locked down with little ones - and how to look after your own mental health.\nWhen Northern Irish singer JC Stewart recorded a parody video of the theme tune from the TV sitcom Friends during lockdown, it went viral, and was even shared by cast member Jennifer Aniston.  While the video - and its subtle change of lyrics to reflect the pandemic - brought worldwide attention, he has actually been releasing music since 2014. The singer-songwriter has four million monthly listeners on Spotify, thanks to melancholy, soul-baring ballads like I Need You To Hate Me and Lying That You Love Me.

The crowd chants: \"Fight for Trump.\" \nMinutes later, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi commences the certification process. \nMr Trump ends his speech with the words: \"We fight. We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\nShortly afterwards a Capitol police officer calls for backup. \n\"They're throwing metal poles at us,\" he says. \"Multiple law-enforcement injuries,\" he adds in a panicked voice. \nCapitol police send an evacuation warning. \nProtesters surge past Capitol police protecting the west steps, the side facing the White House. \nMinutes later, an officer declares there is a riot at the Capitol.  \"We're going to give riot warnings,\" he says. \"We're going to try to get compliance but this is now effectively a riot.\"\nMeanwhile Vice President Mike Pence is continuing to preside over the session. \nSecret Service quickly and suddenly evacuate Mr Pence from the Senate floor. \nThe protesters break through the windows. They push inside, hopping through the broken glass. They then kick open the doors to let others in. Some wear hoods and helmets, some hold cameras or Confederate flags.\nAn immediate recess of the Senate is called. \nA minute later, Officer Eugene Goodman runs to respond to the initial breach. He warns Senator Mitt Romney that the mob is approaching. Mr Romney turns and runs through a capitol hallway to safety. \nThe mob, a floor below them, has already begun to search for the Senate chamber. \nOfficer Goodman makes his way down to the first floor where he encounters the mob. \nHe lures the armed rioters away from the upper chamber. Many of these individuals have been calling for Mr Pence to be hanged.\nBy that point, the rioters are \"within 100ft\" (30m) of Mr Pence and a foot away from one of the doors to the chamber. Many senators are still inside. \nAt the same time, Ms Pelosi is rushed from the house floor. She is evacuated entirely from the Capitol complex to a secure off-site location. \nHer staff barricade themselves into a conference room, hiding under a table. \nStaff members of the House leader speak softly, frantically, to each other. Just outside, rioters are spreading out across the building, searching for Ms Pelosi herself.\nThe rioters chant: \"Where are you Nancy?\" In an audio clip, we hear one staff member whisper: \"They're pounding on doors trying to find her.\"\nOne man breaks open the outer door to the office where the staff are hiding, but not the inner door. Another tries as well, but eventually moves on.\nPresident Trump tweets about Mr Pence. \nAt the same time, Mr Pence is evacuated to a secure location. \nRioters start to spread through the buildings. Others break in from outside through various doors around the building. \nThey open the east side door of the rotunda to let more people in, flooding through the doors and overwhelming the officers. \nThe House floor debate is suspended to update members. House members are told to reach for tear gas masks and be prepared to use them. \nThe House is called back into session in the hope of continuing the count. \nBut minutes later the House is abruptly recessed. Members are told to get down under their chairs if necessary. \n\"Folks have entered the rotunda and are coming this way,\" lawmakers are told. \nDemocratic Congressman Eric Swalwell sends a text to his wife: \"I love you and the babies. Please hug them for me\". \nThe mob outside the chamber grows larger and they get within feet of the house door. \nPresident Trump called Senator Mike Lee, according to the Utah Republican who has provided the trial lawyers with a copy of a log from his mobile phone.\nAccording to his office, he received a call from the White House switchboard number - and the call lasted four minutes. Mr Lee has said that apparently the call was meant for Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville, and that he handed his phone to his colleague.\nMr Tuberville told reporters that he informed Mr Trump that Mr Pence had been evacuated from the Senate floor. \"I said: Mr President, they've taken the vice-president out. They want me to get off the phone, I gotta go.\"\nHouse impeachment managers say it is further evidence that the president knew how much danger his vice-president was in.\nAshli Babbit is seen turning the corner towards the House lobby doors as members are leaving.\nHouse Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern is spotted by the mob as he leaves the House floor. \nIn a hallway outside the House chamber, a group attempts to force its way through a set of locked doors. The glass window panes on the doors are shattered. A rioter uses a baton to smash through as the crowd around him chants \"break it down, break it down\".\nFootage shows the hands of an officer on the other side, holding a gun and pointing it toward the mob. We hear a shot and see Babbitt fall to the ground. \nPeople still inside the gallery of the chamber are trapped. They tell each other to take off their congressional pins. \nIn the meantime, a number of rioters reach the inside of the Senate gallery. \n\"Is this the Senate?\" one demands to know. \"Where are they?\" another asks, apparently referring to the evacuated senators.\nVideo footage shows some rioters rifling through papers and materials left behind by lawmakers. \"There's got to be something we can use against these scumbags,\" one says.\nTrump tweets asking for people to \"remain peaceful\". \nMeanwhile the mob are still at the Capitol. \nFootage shows a sprawling mob, a sea of people on the Capitol grounds. A Confederate flag waves in the foreground.\nTrump releases a video in which he tells the mob to go home. \nFifteen minutes after police confirm Ashli Babbitt has died, Trump tweets again. \nHe refers to those at the Capitol as \"great patriots\".

      "text": "Home Secretary Priti Patel has promised to look at tougher measures to stem the \"absolutely shocking\" recent rise in pet thefts.\nDemand for dogs has increased during the pandemic, pushing up the cost of some puppies from \u00a3500 to \u00a32,000.\nAnd it is estimated thefts have risen by 250%, with criminal gangs involved.\nMs Patel told LBC Radio she was in talks about upgrading pet theft to a more serious offence, meaning stronger penalties could apply.\nThe maximum sentence is currently seven years in prison.\nIn 2018, the government rejected calls to change the law, saying the Theft Act provided \"sufficient sanctions\".\nBut former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is calling for stricter penalties to deal with so-called \"dognapping\".\nSupporters of the change argue that the emotional impact of losing an animal is greater than when an ordinary, non-living belonging is stolen.\nMs Patel told LBC's Nick Ferrari pet theft appeared to be particularly prevalent in London.\n\"This is absolutely shocking,\" she said. \"I'm working with [Sir Iain] on this. I'm looking at this, at what we can do.\"\nMs Patel said she was \"building up\" the case for making pet theft into a serious offence, but added that setting sentence lengths was not her job.\n\"We are definitely looking into what kind of measures can be put in place in terms of the criminality,\" she added.\nIn October, MPs debated the idea of making pet theft a specific offence, after 300,000 people signed a petition calling for this.\nThe Kennel Club says less than 5% of cases result in a criminal conviction and that 52% of dog thefts take place in gardens.\nAnd the RSPCA recommends that owners do not leave animals unattended there, outside shops or in cars."

      "tags": "France,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "France's health authority is recommending that anyone previously infected with Covid-19 should only receive one vaccine jab, instead of the normal two doses.\nPeople who recover from Covid have some immunity and should be inoculated three-six months afterwards, it said.\nFrance is the first country to issue this advice.\nIt has delivered nearly 2.8 million vaccinations so far, the health ministry said.\n\"The single vaccine dose will thus play the role of a booster\" for someone previously infected with coronavirus, the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 (HAS) said.\nThe recommendation comes as governments around the world are rushing to vaccinate their populations and try to return life to normal. \nAt least 3.4 million people in France have had confirmed Covid-19 infections but the true figure is thought to be higher. Around 81,000 people have died -  the seventh-highest figure in the world.\nFrance's inoculation programme began in December but is lagging behind that of other countries like Israel, the United Arab Emirates and the UK.\nThe three main vaccines used globally are administered in two doses, delivered several weeks apart.\nBut HAS said that four studies suggest that a single dose in someone who has recovered from coronavirus produces a sufficient immune response to protect against further infection. \n\"People who have already been infected retain an immune memory,\" HAS said in a press release. \"The single dose of vaccine will thus act as a booster.\"\nThe agency has not said how this recommendation could be acted on or how France would identify who has already contracted Covid-19 and when.\nPeople with suppressed immune systems should still receive two doses, the agency added.\nVaccines work by mimicking the infection that they are designed to protect against. They teach the body how to recognise and fight the real disease. But it can take time for the immune system to learn this lesson and, often, a booster shot is needed to create a lasting immune memory. \nIt's reasonable to assume people who have already caught and recovered from coronavirus will have some of this immune memory. Scientists think that memory could, perhaps, be sufficiently reawakened with a single shot of vaccine. \nA couple of studies have already looked at this - giving a single dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccine to people known to have had coronavirus in the past. In both of these studies, the vaccine appeared to work well, prompting their immune systems to quickly make lots of antibodies against the virus. \nThe large quantities seen suggest their body was already \"primed\" by the natural infection to respond. \nMore studies are needed to confirm this, but it might be one way to free up extra vaccine doses to share around the world. Confirming which people have definitely had coronavirus takes time and tests, however. Pragmatically, it may still be simpler and faster to give everyone two doses, as already recommended.\nOn Friday French Health Minister Olivier Veran visited the region of Moselle in eastern France where highly-contagious new variants of Covid-19 are spreading.\nStrains first detected in Brazil and South Africa account for 4% to 5% of all new cases registered in France and can still be contained, he said on Thursday. A mutation first identified in the UK accounts for 25% of new infections.\nOn Friday the chief scientist for the World Health Organization Soumya Swaminathan said there were reports of people being re-infected with new strains.\nPharmaceutical companies have said that tweaks to existing vaccines should make the jabs work against mutations of the virus and that booster jabs will probably be necessary in the future."

      "text": "Almost a quarter of adults in Northern Ireland have received their first vaccination dose since Belfast Health Trust nurse Joanna Sloan became the first recipient on 8 December. \nBBC News NI has been speaking to some of the volunteers helping to ensure as many people as possible are immunised.\nPatients are being offered vaccines in order of priority, based on their age and clinical vulnerability.\nOn 12 January, the Department of Health published a detailed timetable for delivering vaccinations to those prioritised groups.\nThe vaccination rate in Northern Ireland remains above that in the Republic of Ireland - if slightly lower than in other UK nations.\nThe Covid-19 vaccine rollout in Northern Ireland is an unprecedented public health operation.\nAs well as current frontline healthcare staff, retired doctors, nurses and members of the public have been pitching in.\nA year-and-a-half after retiring from his practice in Rathfriland, County Down, Dr Donal O'Shaughnessy has returned to help out twice a week administering vaccines.\nHe felt duty-bound to help \"to get the vaccines out as quickly as possible among the people I've lived with and worked with for so many years\".\nA former doctor for the Ireland, Ulster and Barbarians rugby teams, he said it was great to be involved in the clinics, as well as to see former patients.\n\"I'm just so glad that I'm able to give something back to all of these good people at this stage when I thought I was home and dry and out of it completely,\" said Dr O'Shaughnessy.\nThe uptake for the vaccine in the Rathfriland area had been very high, he said, and he was hopeful that would continue as the rollout continues through younger age groups.\n\"We might need to give them an injection every year from now on,\" he said. \"I would still be available to do that.\"\n\"There is a great sense of hope. That is the most positive thing. It's a very rewarding experience.\"\nAlan Law has been registered with the organisation Volunteer Now for five years and has helped out at events such as the Irish Open golf tournament and the Giro D'Italia cycle race.\nNow he is spending his free time at the Craigavon and Ballymena vaccination hubs, welcoming those coming for their jabs and helping them through the process.\nHe said the reaction from the public had been fantastic and there was a real sense of relief and happiness.\n\"There's a lot of people coming who have been shielding or isolating for months now and they feel like this is a lifeline,\" he said.\n\"They are now going to be get their life back. Be able to go out more, and do things that they have been pausing for such a long time.\"\nGarrett Martin was an emergency department nurse for many years before moving into senior management roles in the health service and then to the Royal College of Nursing.\nWhen the first cases of coronavirus emerged in Northern Ireland, he began looking for a way to get back into frontline care and, before Christmas, was offered the role of operations manager at the Western Health Trust's vaccination centres.\nHis team at the Foyle Arena in Londonderry is dealing with up to 750 people every day. His staff include:\n\"It's been full-on, it's been incredibly hard work but it's been incredibly rewarding as well,\" he said.\n\"What we're going through is monumental, it's historic and will be talked about for some time.\n\"So to play a some part, however small, in the recovery is something we're very proud and privileged to be to be part of.\"\nVictoria Simpson has gone from administering routine childhood immunisations to vaccinating the elderly against Covid-19 in care homes.\nShe has been redeployed from her job as a health visitor in Lisburn to the vaccination centre at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald.\nAbout 1,200 people a day are being vaccinated at the site, and she said that between filling in paperwork and giving patients the information they need, the actual giving of the vaccine is the quickest part of the whole process.\nShe said: \"It's just sometimes overwhelming just to think about the enormity of this programme and just how well it's all working.\n\"I'm feeling really privileged to be in this position and this is definitely going to be one for the history books to chat to the grandchildren about.\"\nJust a few months ago, no Covid-19 vaccine had been approved for use in the UK.\nToday there are three: Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - which are currently being administered - and Moderna, which the UK has ordered 17 million doses of but is not due to start arriving until spring.\nBut use of two different types of vaccine in Northern Ireland has also led to some confusion.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech jab has to be stored and handled in a specific way which makes it harder to use in the community, so it has been mainly reserved for use in the health service vaccination hubs where frontline healthcare workers have received their vaccines.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is easier to store and administer, and has therefore been distributed to GP practices across Northern Ireland.\nAt the end of January, a decision was taken to open the vaccination hubs to members of the public aged from 65 to 69, while people aged over 70 would continue to be vaccinated by their GP."

      "tags": "Travel,Hotels,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "England's hotel quarantine system could be less stringent than Australia's scheme, a BBC analysis has found.\nA copy of the government's official requirements for hotel operators, ahead of the launch on Monday, showed rules were looser in several key areas. \nIn England, the rules allow guests time outside with security staff, seen in Australia as putting workers at risk.\nThe UK government said its hotel quarantine measures were \"in line with those in other countries\".\nUpdated guidance for hotels will be released \"imminently\", the Department of Health and Social Care said.\nMeanwhile, Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said she understood Border Force still had not been given operational guidance on how the hotel quarantine system would work from Monday. \nHome Office minister Victoria Atkins told the BBC those arriving from \"red list\" countries - deemed high-risk due to new virus variants - would face strict measures even before they departed for the UK.\nThe requirement to quarantine in a hotel applies to British and Irish citizens, and UK residents arriving in England from such countries, including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa, and will cost \u00a31,750 for an individual. \nIn Scotland, all those arriving internationally by air will have to isolate in hotels. \nInternational travel is currently banned, other than for a small number of permitted reasons, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed.\nIt comes as Home Secretary Priti Patel urged people to \"persevere\" with England's booking website, where travellers secure rooms and new mandatory tests, after it was hit by technical issues. \nThe site was taken offline minutes after it launched on Thursday but appeared to be working again by 15:00 GMT on Friday following maintenance work. \nHowever, the government's advice page on hotel quarantine did not include a link directing passengers where to book and instead asked people to check back later to make a booking. \nMs Cooper said it \"isn't good enough\" that Border Force staff still do not know how the system will work at airports, including whether they will be asked to check for high-risk arrivals and if those passengers will be taken straight to hotels or will have to queue with other travellers. \n\"Chaotic long queues with no social distancing in place have the potential to be superspreading events that will undermine the very measures being introduced,\" the Labour MP said. \nBBC science editor David Shukman found the rules in England would be looser than Australia's system, which is seen as among the best in the world.\nA copy of the guidance for hotels in England's system suggested:\nThe UK government said staff would be able to access regular testing and appropriate personal protective equipment.\nIn England travellers will only be allowed out of their rooms for a limited set of exemptions, including exercise. \nThere had been conflicting messages about the policy, with No 10 and the Department of Health forced to issue several clarifications.\nSmoking, which at one stage had been described as a legitimate reason for going outside, will not qualify.\nAsked about differences between England and Australia's systems, Ms Atkins said standards in England \"are amongst the strongest in the world\". \nScotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said hotels there would \"allow people to behave like human beings\" by going outside for fresh air.\nBut one Australian epidemiologist described allowing travellers quarantining in hotels to leave their rooms for fresh air as \"very risky\".\nProf Michael Toole said there was evidence of transmission when guests opened doors, and \"with the positive pressure this kind of fog of virus went out into the corridor, travelled down and infected hotel staff\".\nProf Nancy Baxter, of the University of Melbourne, said governments had a duty to provide people working in the hotels with \"the highest possible protection from infection\". \nIt comes as the Australian state of Victoria enters a five-day \"circuit breaker\" lockdown in a bid to suppress an outbreak linked to its hotel quarantine system.\nThe UK has secured an initial 4,600 rooms across 16 hotels for its quarantine system. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that, at present, around 1,300 people per week arrive in the UK from red list countries, with this number expected to fall.\nThe new system also introduces tougher penalties, with avoiding quarantine in a designated hotel attracting a fine of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000.\nAnyone found to have falsified their travel history on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in on arrival risks up to 10 years in prison.\nAll international arrivals must book and pay in advance for two additional tests during their quarantine period, or face fines up to \u00a32,000.\nIn a further development, government sources confirmed reports that countries could be added to the red list with just a few hours' notice.\nRather than previous weekly reviews of travel corridor arrangements, there will now be a \"fast track\" system allowing ministers to quickly curb travel from virus hotspots.\nIt comes as 15,144 new cases were recorded in the UK, as well as 758 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nMeanwhile, more than 14 million people have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest government figures. \nWill you be travelling to the UK from a \"red list\" country?

      "text": "The NHS is \"firmly on track\" to offer everyone in the top four priority groups in England a Covid vaccine by Monday, says the head of NHS England. \nSir Simon Stevens said it had been \"the fastest and largest vaccination campaign in history\".\nThe UK government's aim is to reach 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February - and 14 million have been vaccinated so far.\nWales said on Friday it was the first UK nation to meet its target.\nSpeaking at the Coventry hospital where the first person in the UK to be vaccinated - 91-year-old Maggie Keenan - received her first dose, Sir Simon said it had been an \"incredible achievement\" by staff and volunteers.\n\"The uptake has been fantastic - we thought three-quarters would say yes to the vaccine but more than nine out of 10 have done so,\" he said.\nAnyone aged over 70 in England who hasn't been vaccinated can go online or call 119 to book an appointment.\nFrom next week, details of who will be vaccinated in the next phase of the programme involving the over 50s and people with underlying health conditions will be set out. They are due to be vaccinated by May.\nSome regions of the UK have already begun inviting the over-60s, who are part of the next phase.\nIn the meantime, Sir Simon said it was important that people come forward for their second dose when invited because it \"gives extra protection and immunity\".\nIn the 10 weeks since vaccinations against coronavirus began in the UK, a first dose has been given to:\nIncluded in the first four priority groups, which covers 88% of those most at risk of dying from Covid-19, are people aged 70 and over, frontline health and social care workers, care homes residents and those at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus.\nAcross the UK, a quarter of adults have already received one dose of a Covid vaccine.\nIn Wales, the percentage of over-16s vaccinated is higher - at 28% - than in the other UK nations.\nNine out of 10 people aged 70 and over have taken up the offer to be vaccinated in England, the NHS says.\nLatest figures for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland suggest their uptake numbers for the over-70s are lower, but these are not directly comparable with England.\nThe latest data on other age groups in England, up to Sunday 7 February, suggests:\nBy Wednesday, in England, more than two million people had been vaccinated in the Midlands, 1.8 million in the South East, 1.7 million in the North East and more than a million in all other regions.\nThe smallest number of doses, nearly 1.3 million, had been given to people living in London.\nThe UK's vaccination programme began on 8 December 2020 with people receiving the vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech.\nFrom 4 January people began receiving the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine.\nBoth vaccines, which require two doses for full protection, were approved by the UK's medicines regulator.\nA decision was taken by health officials to offer a first dose to as many vulnerable people as possible by extending the gap between doses to from three to four weeks to closer to 12 weeks."

      "text": "A new booking system for England's hotel quarantine scheme was taken offline minutes after it launched.\nThe portal, set up as part of efforts to control new Covid variants entering the country, is \"undergoing work to correct a minor technical issue\".\nThe Department of Health said the portal would be open \"well before\" the scheme comes into effect on Monday. \nOfficials are expecting to have the website back up and running by 10:00 GMT on Friday, the BBC has been told. \nThe requirement to quarantine in a hotel applies to British and Irish citizens, and UK residents arriving in England from 33 countries from Monday and will cost \u00a31,750 for an individual booking.\nThe so-called \"red list\" countries - including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa - are deemed high risk due to emerging new virus variants.\nIn Scotland, residents arriving from any country by air will have to isolate in hotels.\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants the UK to follow Scotland and extend the rules to cover all international travellers, saying the borders will be \"too leaky\" otherwise.\nThe website had been accessible for some users intermittently since it was launched just after 13:00 GMT. The most recent holding message promised the site would be \"back soon\" and apologised for the inconvenience as it carried out \"maintenance\".\nLabour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said ministers \"must act to fix this urgently\".\n\"It is extremely worrying that even the limited hotel quarantine booking system is showing signs of failing from the outset,\" he said.\nA Department of Health spokesman said: \"Rooms are available from Monday 15 February and the portal will be open well before the go live date.\"\nAround 1,300 people a week are arriving into the UK from those countries at the moment, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said.\nThe Department of Health has arranged for about 4,700 rooms across 16 hotels to be available for the new quarantine system. Travellers have to book a place in quarantine - which lasts 10 days - before arriving in the UK.\nInternational travel is currently banned, other than for a small number of permitted reasons, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed.\nThe cost of the hotel quarantine packages is \u00a31,750 per adult for 11 nights, which includes transport and testing. \nFor extra adults or a child over 12 the cost is \u00a3650, and for a child aged five to 12 it is \u00a3325.\nIn Scotland, the cost is the same for one adult - \u00a31,750 - but the government is still working through the costs for extra travellers. The Scottish government is also launching a fund for people who cannot afford the charge.\nAirlines and travel companies will be legally required to make sure travellers have signed up for the new measures before they depart, with fines for companies and passengers if they fail to comply, he said.\nFailing to quarantine in a designated hotel when required will carry a fine of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000.\nGiving false travel history information on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in by travellers when they arrive in the UK will attract a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\nAll arrivals from countries not on the \"red list\" must see out a 10-day quarantine at home, but will be required to pay \u00a3210 for two additional private virus tests, booked prior to arrival.\nIt came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was \"too early\" to know whether summer holidays can go ahead this year.\nMr Hancock said there was still \"a lot of uncertainty\" but ministers were doing everything possible to make sure people could have a holiday this year.\nHe told the BBC he had booked his own summer break in Cornwall \"months ago\".\nSir Keir urged the government to \"get rid of the mixed messages\" about whether people should book holidays for later in the year.\nDowning Street said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would unveil a roadmap for easing restrictions - potentially including travel - in the week beginning 22 February."

      "tags": "Media,BBC,China",
      "text": "China has banned BBC World News from broadcasting in the country, its television and radio regulator announced on Thursday.\nChina has criticised the BBC for its reporting on coronavirus and the persecution of ethnic minority Uighurs. \nThe BBC said it was \"disappointed\" by the decision.\nIt follows British media regulator Ofcom revoking state broadcaster China Global Television Network's (CGTN) licence to broadcast in the UK.\nSeparately, the broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) said it would stop relaying BBC World Service programming in the region, prompting condemnation from the BBC.\nChina's National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) said that BBC World News reports about China were found to \"seriously violate\" broadcast guidelines, including \"the requirement that news should be truthful and fair\" and not \"harm China's national interests\".\nIt said that the BBC's application to air for another year would not be accepted.\nThe BBC said in a statement: \"We are disappointed that the Chinese authorities have decided to take this course of action.  The BBC is the world's most trusted international news broadcaster and reports on stories from around the world fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.\"\nThe commercially funded BBC World News TV channel broadcasts globally in English. In China it is largely restricted and appears only in international hotels and some diplomatic compounds, meaning most Chinese people cannot view it.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the move an \"unacceptable curtailing of media freedom\".  \nThe US State Department condemned the decision, calling it part of a wider campaign to suppress free media in China.\nIn Hong Kong, the publicly-funded broadcaster RTHK said it was suspending the relaying of BBC World Service radio. It had previously aired it daily from 23:00 to 07:00. It also removed a weekly Cantonese programme from the BBC's Chinese Service from its schedule. \nBBC World News TV channel broadcasts, however, are still available in Hong Kong. \nHong Kong, a former British colony, is expected to retain certain rights and freedoms, including freedom of press, until 2047, as part of a handover agreement between China and Britain. \nHong Kong Journalists Association chairman Chris Yeung Kin-hing told the South China Morning Post that RTHK's decision was \"disturbing and worrying\", amid questions about whether RTHK was instructed to act by the authorities.\nThe RTHK union also called the decision \"extremely regrettable\", adding: \"Under the policy of One Country Two Systems, we've never seen Hong Kong being required to follow decisions of China's State Film, TV and Radio Administration before\".\nHong Kong's Office of the Communications Authority said it \"did not set boundaries\" and that decisions were up to individual operators.\nA BBC spokeswoman said: \"We condemn this decision by the Chinese authorities. Access to accurate and impartial news is a fundamental human right and should not be denied to the people of Hong Kong and mainland China, millions of whom rely on BBC News every week.\"\nThe corporation rejected accusations of bias and said it would make every effort to bring the news to its audiences, who would \"still find ways to access the BBC\".\nThe actions in China and Hong Kong follow Ofcom's revoking of the CGTN licence after it found it was wrongfully held by Star China Media Ltd.\nCGTN was also found in breach of British broadcasting regulations last year, for airing the allegedly forced confession of UK citizen Peter Humphrey.\nCGTN can now also no longer be broadcast in Germany following Ofcom's decision, Deutsche Welle reports, as the licence in Germany had been approved by Ofcom as part of a sharing initiative.\nRelations between China and the UK have seen a serious deterioration in recent months over Hong Kong, where Beijing introduced a controversial new security law after a large pro-democracy movement swept the ex-colony.\nIn January the UK introduced a new visa that gives 5.4 million Hong Kong residents the right to live in the UK and eventually become citizens because it believes China is undermining the territory's rights and freedoms.\nAnd in the past two years China has been systematically blocking or banning foreign media, including in effect expelling journalists from three US newspapers in 2020. The BBC website and its app are already banned in mainland China.\nIn February the BBC published a report featuring interviews with Uighur women who said they had been systematically raped, sexually abused and tortured in China's \"re-education\" camps in Xinjiang. China's foreign ministry accused the BBC of making a \"false report\".\nLast month the US said China had committed genocide in its repression of the Uighurs and other mainly Muslim groups.\nAccording to estimates, more than a million Uighurs and other minorities have been detained in camps in China.\nChina denies that Uighurs are persecuted. Last year China's UK ambassador Liu Xiaoming told the BBC's Andrew Marr that reports of concentration camps were \"fake\" and the Uighurs received the same treatment under the law as other ethnic groups in his country."

      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex's father, Thomas Markle, will testify if asked to in the court case against Meghan, the duchess' half sister has said.\nSamantha Markle - Mr Markle's daughter from his first marriage - told the BBC: \"If he is called, he will come.\"\nNew court documents in the case between Meghan and the Mail on Sunday show the paper will use evidence from Mr Markle. \nNo date has been set for a hearing in the case, which centres on a private letter Meghan wrote to him.\nMeghan accuses the paper of misusing her private information, breaching copyright and selective editing.\nThe Mail on Sunday rejects the claims and says there was \"huge and legitimate\" public interest in publishing the note.\nDocuments submitted to the High Court by the paper laying out its defence show much of the evidence it could rely upon comes from Mr Markle.\nHe was at the centre of controversy in the lead up to Meghan's marriage to Prince Harry in May 2018.\nThe documents include text messages sent from Mr Markle to his daughter before the wedding.\n\"The fact that so much of the evidence appears to come directly from him and that he appears to be co-operating with the paper presents at least the possibility of him being called to testify in court against his own daughter,\" BBC reporter John Donnison said.\nThe Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday's sister paper, reported on Wednesday that Mr Markle was \"expected to be called as a key witness\" in the case.\nThe newspaper has given what BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond describes as a \"very robust\" response to Meghan's claims.\nThe paper argues in legal documents that members of the Royal Family, including the duchess, \"rely on publicity about themselves and their lives in order to maintain the privileged positions they hold and promote themselves\".\nIt said the duchess \"did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy that the contents of the letter were private and would remain so\".\n\"There is a huge and legitimate public interest in the Royal Family and the activities, conduct and standards of behaviour of its members,\" it said.\n\"This extends not merely to their public conduct, but to their personal and family relationships because those are integral to the proper functioning of the monarchy.\"\nAs evidence that it did not infringe her privacy, the paper says the letter was \"immaculately copied\" in Meghan's \"elaborate handwriting\", arguing that this care in its presentation meant she anticipated it would be seen and read by a wider audience.\nThe 44-page legal filing by the Mail on Sunday aims to tackle the duchess' claims one by one:\nIn October, law firm Schillings, acting for the duchess, filed a High Court claim against the Mail on Sunday and its parent company Associated Newspapers over the alleged misuse of private information, infringement of copyright and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018.\nAt the time, Harry said he and his wife were forced to take action against \"relentless propaganda\".\nReferring to his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, he said: \"I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\"\nThe legal proceedings are being funded privately by the couple and any proceeds will be donated to an anti-bullying charity.\nMr Markle was invited to the royal couple's 2018 wedding but had to pull out because he needed heart surgery. \nIn the run up to the big day, he became embroiled in a controversy over reports he had staged paparazzi photos of himself in wedding-related activities, such as being measured for a new suit. \nIn December that year, he told ITV he had not spoken to his daughter since she married Harry. \nThe documents submitted by the Mail on Sunday say a text message days before the wedding signed \"Love M and H\" admonished Mr Markle for talking to the press. And that he replied: \"...I'm sorry my heart attack [is an] inconvenience for you.\"\nMeghan returned to Canada to be with her son Archie last week.\nThe duchess visited a women's centre in Vancouver on Tuesday, in her first public appearance since she and Prince Harry said they would \"step back\" as full-time royals.\nThe Downtown Eastside Women's Centre posted a photograph of the duchess with staff and visitors on Facebook, with the caption \"Look who we had tea with today\". Her visit was \"to discuss issues affecting women in the community\", the group added.\nThe visit provides a sense of what the family's future may be like in Canada, following their decision to split their time between the Commonwealth country and the UK.\nPrince Harry is expected to join Meghan and Archie in Canada at a later date - he is due to attend an official event at Buckingham Palace on Thursday.\nHe has been posting on the couple's Instagram page - announcing that venue for the 2022 Invictus Games - the sporting event he founded for injured service personnel and veterans, which will be held in Dusseldorf, Germany.\nMeanwhile, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have made their first joint engagement since Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to \"step back\".\nWilliam and Kate were greeted by cheers from several hundred well-wishers on Centenary Square, Bradford, on a visit to the 19th-century City Hall.\nDetails of the Mail on Sunday's defence come as the Royal Family seeks to redefine the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's role after the pair issued their surprise statement a week ago.\nThe Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge, and Prince Harry met at Sandringham on Monday to discuss the couple's future.\nIn a statement released later, the Queen said discussions had been \"very constructive\" and that final decisions will \"be reached in the coming days\".\nYes - it is not the first time the royals have taken legal action against the press. \nIn 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were awarded \u00a392,000 (100,000 euros) in damages after French magazine Closer printed topless pictures of the duchess in 2012."

      "tags": "Companies,China,HSBC,Huawei",
      "text": "The Chinese telecoms giant Huawei is taking the bank HSBC to court in the UK as part of its attempt to prevent the extradition of its chief financial officer from Canada to the US.\nMeng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada on a US request over claims she misled HSBC in a 2013 meeting.\nHuawei now hopes to gain access to HSBC documents that could help it undermine the US case for her extradition.\nThe bank told the BBC the application for disclosure was \"without merit\". \nThe move comes amid political pressure on HSBC, which is UK based but was founded in Hong Kong where it makes much of its profits.\nThe court hearing in London on Friday draws the bank deeper into a legal battle which has raised tensions between Canada and China. \nMeng Wanzhou, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested at Vancouver airport on 1 December 2018 because the US wants her to stand trial on charges including fraud. These are linked to the alleged violation of US sanctions against Iran, allegations she denies. \nA meeting between Ms Meng and HSBC on 22 August 2013 is central to the claims. \nReuters news reports in the preceding months had raised questions about whether there had been a breach of trade sanctions on Iran by Hong Kong-based firm Skycom. \nAt issue was whether Skycom, a telecoms equipment seller, was simply a business partner of Huawei's - or a front for it to conceal its activities in Iran. \nThe US alleges that in the meeting Ms Meng misled HSBC over the true nature of Huawei's relationship with Skycom and this, in turn, put the bank at risk of violating sanctions against Iran.  But it was more than five years after the meeting that she was detained.\nHer Canadian lawyers have followed a multi-pronged strategy to try to prevent the extradition. \nOne part has involved claiming the US omitted key information on two slides which showed HSBC was not, in fact, being kept in the dark about the true nature of the Skycom/Huawei relationship and she was clear about it.\nNow, her lawyers have made an application to the UK high court under the Bankers Book Evidence Act to access relevant information kept in HSBC's books. Under this Act, they are seeking a court order to gain access to HSBC documentation. \nThey are understood to be seeking evidence about what HSBC did or did not know about Huawei and Skycom's relationship in Iran and how high up the bank knowledge of the meeting went. \nIn response, a spokesperson for HSBC said: \"This application for disclosure in the UK is without merit. HSBC is not a party to the underlying criminal case in the US or the extradition proceeding in Canada. It would be inappropriate to comment further on an ongoing legal matter.\"\nThe case has placed HSBC in a difficult position. In China there has been criticism for it having handed over information to US authorities which led to Ms Meng's arrest. The bank has always maintained it simply handed over what it was required to under law. \nIt has also come under fire in the UK from those who believe it has been too friendly with Beijing, pointing to the freezing of the bank accounts of a Hong Kong activist which led to the questioning of company executives by a parliamentary committee recently.\nMs Meng is expected to appear in court in Canada on 1 March for the latest stage of her extradition hearings, which are scheduled to finish in May, although appeals are likely to extend the process.

He has previously said he would fire \"on the spot\" any staff speaking disrespectfully to colleagues.\nThe suspension of Mr Ducklo, the White House deputy press secretary, came after Vanity Fair magazine reported on his alleged threats to Ms Palmeri.\nThe Politico reporter had been investigating Mr Ducklo's relationship with Alexi McCammond, a journalist with Axios who had covered Mr Biden's election campaign. \nHe allegedly rang her and said: \"I will destroy you\". He also made other derogatory and misogynistic comments, Vanity Fair reports. \nPresident Biden's spokeswoman tweeted on Friday that TJ Ducklo was \"the first to acknowledge this is not the standard of behavior set out by the President\".\nShe said that as well as being suspended without pay for a week, Mr Ducklo would no longer work with Politico reporters when he returned to the White House.\nPresident Biden told his staff on his first day in office that he would not tolerate bullying behaviour.\n\"I'm not joking when I say this: If you ever work with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I will fire you on the spot. No ifs, ands or buts,\" he said.\nSome commentators, such as CNN anchor Jake Tapper, are now asking whether the same punishment should not apply to the way his staff treat journalists doing their job."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "tags": "Leeds,Glasgow",
      "text": "The case of a nurse who was was jailed for life for murdering four patients and attempting to kill a fifth has been referred to the Court of Appeal.\nColin Norris, 45, was convicted in 2008 of injecting the patients with insulin in hospitals in Leeds.\nThe Criminal Cases Review Commission said new evidence created a \"real possibility\" his conviction was unsafe.\nBBC Scotland and Panorama investigations had previously cast doubt on the verdicts.\nNorris, who was originally from Glasgow, was convicted of murdering Doris Ludlam, 80, Bridget Bourke, 88, Irene Crookes, 79, and 86-year-old Ethel Hall.\nHe was alleged to have injected them with lethal doses of insulin at Leeds General Infirmary and the city's St James's Hospital in 2002.\nHe was also found guilty of attempting to murder 90-year-old Vera Wilby.\nAll five women were elderly inpatients on orthopaedic wards where Norris worked as a nurse. \nThe CCRC said its decision followed a detailed review of what it described as a \"complex and difficult case\".\nIt noted the case against Norris, who was jailed for a minimum of 30 years, was \"wholly circumstantial\" and \"heavily reliant on expert opinion evidence\".\nAs a result of new expert evidence, the CCRC said: \"There is a real possibility that the Court of Appeal will decide that that Mr Norris's conviction for the murder/attempted murder of one or more of the four patients is unsafe.\"\nIn the case of Mrs Hall, it said the conviction depended upon support from the other four cases that \"no-one other than Mr Norris could have been responsible\".\nIt concludes: \"In light of the new expert evidence, the CCRC is satisfied that this assertion is now less secure and that, as a result, there is a real possibility that the Court of Appeal will quash this conviction too.\"\nBBC Scotland Investigations correspondent Mark Daly first reported his concerns about the conviction in 2011.\nDuring a later Panorama investigation, he was told by two experts that there could be a natural explanation for the blood test results - a rare condition called insulin auto immune syndrome.\nIn 2015, the foreman of the jury that convicted Norris told the BBC he now believed he was innocent and that if the case was presented with the new evidence, he doubted it would get to court.\nNorris' case has also been championed for more than a decade by Inside Justice UK.\nThe campaign group said it was \"thrilled\" by the news, which was announced on Norris' birthday.\nThe appeal was led by Michael Mansfield QC.\nDubbed the \"Angel of Death\", Colin Norris was the young nurse who went rogue and became a serial killer. \nHe was the common denominator in a cluster of unexplained deaths from hypoglycaemia, or extreme low blood sugar, in elderly patients who were not diabetic. \nThere was no physical evidence against him; no fingerprints or DNA. But a circumstantial case was built and he was prosecuted, convicted and given a 30-year jail term. \nMy involvement in the case started in 2011, and alongside Louise Shorter from Inside Justice, we painstakingly investigated the case.  We became more convinced there could be a problem with the evidence and that an innocent man may have been wrongly imprisoned as a serial killer.\nWe produced two documentaries, including a BBC Panorama programme in 2014, each raising fresh concerns about the conviction.  New applications were made to the CCRC to consider the case afresh. But the years came and went, and still the CCRC hadn't reached a decision. \nBehind the scenes, Norris's lawyers, led by eminent QC Michael Mansfield, pressed on, searching for still fresher developments in the scientific knowledge around hypoglycaemia. \nAnd now, nearly 10 years since the CCRC first looked at the case, it has decided Colin Norris's convictions may no longer be safe and should be tested again at the Court of Appeal.\nNorris received the news at his high security prison at HMP Frankland in Durham on his 45th birthday. He now has a glimmer of hope his name could be cleared."

      "text": "Tributes have been paid to jazz \"genius\" Chick Corea, who has died at the age of 79.\nThe Grammy Award-winning musician died on Tuesday from a rare form of cancer that was only recently diagnosed.\nThe influential American is the fourth most nominated artist in Grammys history with 65 nods and 23 wins.\nThe Recording Academy, which hosts the Grammys, paid tribute to \"undisputedly one of the most incredible jazz innovators of all time\".\nIn a message written before his death and left for his fans, Corea said: \"My mission has always been to bring the joy of creating anywhere I could, and to have done so with all the artists that I admire so dearly - this has been the richness of my life.\"\nHis career spanned more than five decades and he played with Miles Davis in the late 1960s - including on his acclaimed jazz-rock double album Bitches Brew. His own group, Return to Forever, were at the forefront of the jazz fusion movement.\nThe late star was also known around the world for his work as a composer with hits like Spain and 500 Miles High. \n\"Through his body of work and the decades spent touring the world, he touched and inspired the lives of millions,\" a statement on his website said.\n\"An extraordinary composer and keyboardist, Chick rewrote the rulebook for jazz in his more than 5-decade long career, receiving mass critical acclaim along the way for his musical excellence.\"\nHis influence stretched far and wide, informing many different genres of music. Yusuf aka Cat Stevens described Corea as a \"genius\" and \"one of the most innovative and inspired musicians I ever had the privilege to work with\".\n\"Rest well maestro,\" added US R&B singer-songwriter Anita Baker.\nParliament-Funkadelic bassist Bootsy Collins called Corea \"a musical visionary\".\nAnd English electronic duo Disclosure posted a picture of Corea alongside a quote detailing his passion for learning.\nIn an interview with the BBC last November, Corea said he had spent lockdown taking on new projects and was looking forward to playing in front of a live audience again. His last album was released in 2020.\nCorea grew up in Massachusetts, and his father was a jazz trumpeter who led a Dixieland band in Boston in the 1930s and 1940s. He introduced his son to the piano and to the bebop of the likes of Dizzy Gillespie from a young age.\nSpeaking to the National Jazz Archive in 1978, Corea explained that it was his intention at the start of that decade to make \"more melodic music\".\n\"I find that every kind of really good jazz that I've ever been interested in - like the music of Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington, John Coltrane or Miles Davis - it's always very lyrical music, you know,\" he said.\n\"And it's one of the most attractive elements in the music for me - the melodic line. So it's something that I desire to have in my music as well.\"\nScientology became a growing influence on his musical direction and personal beliefs during that period too.\nCorea is survived by his wife, vocalist and pianist Gayle Moran, his children and his grandchildren.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Stormont ministers will take a \"collective approach\" when reviewing NI's lockdown restrictions next week, Conor Murphy has said.\nNI re-entered lockdown on 26 December, with the measures due to last until 5 March.\nBut ministers will meet on Thursday to review what should happen beyond that point.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said there needed to be one more \"push\" to reduce infection rates as much as possible.\nNext Thursday's executive meeting would be a \"key decision point\" about how Northern Ireland emerges from lockdown, she said.\nA pathway to recovery document is due to be published by the executive in the coming weeks, with many businesses asking for clarity around indicative reopening dates.\nIt comes as Stormont's health minister warned there are concerns that Northern Ireland's Covid-19 transmission rate has stagnated.\nThe R - or reproduction - number was estimated between 1.5 to 1.9 at the start of January, but has fallen to below one.\nSpeaking at the executive's press briefing on Thursday, Mrs Foster said she recognised that people wanted to see an end to restrictions, but warned: \"We need to see numbers as low as possible so we can plan for gradually emerging from lockdown.\"\nShe said Northern Ireland's R number is currently sitting at 0.75 to 0.85 and that it was right to remain hopeful for \"better days ahead\".\n\"We must approach with care so we don't lose the gains we have made, the clear message has been about saving lives and easing pressure.\"\nNine more coronavirus-related deaths were reported on Thursday, along with 253 new cases.\nAccording to Department of Health figures, 1,966 people have now died in Northern Ireland after testing positive for Covid-19.\nThere are 518 people being treated in hospital for the virus in Northern Ireland.\nSome 58 are in intensive care units (ICU), 57 of which are ventilated - a drop of four from the previous day.\nIn the Republic of Ireland a further 52 deaths have been recorded, bringing its total to 3,846.\nA further 866 confirmed cases of the virus have also been reported.\nAt the executive meeting on Thursday, the first minister also said it had considered the issue of international travel.\n\"I do regret it's not a four and five-nation approach,\" she said.\nShe added that the executive would consider the use of quarantine hotels for passengers from so-called red list countries, if and when international flights begin in NI again.\nMr Murphy said his party had been arguing for an all-island approach throughout the pandemic, and said there were \"international lessons\" about how to manage travel.\n\"I want to see as much of a joined-up approach as we can possibly manage.\"\nMeanwhile, the Department of Health has said 353,757 people have received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in Northern Ireland.\nBy Leslie-Anne McKeown, BBC News NI health producer\nVerbal abuse is being levelled at vaccine call centre staff, the Department of Health has warned.\nPatricia Donnelly, who heads up the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland, said there have also been issues with double-booking and no-shows at vaccine centres.\nShe said: \"Unfortunately, there have been some instances of people who are not eligible for the jab phoning up to try to get an appointment. \n\"Some become abusive when they are informed that they cannot book. This is unacceptable behaviour and it must stop.\"\nMs Donnelly said there were concerns that abuse of the booking system was making it more difficult for people who are eligible to get through.\nShe added: \"We are also seeing cases of some people double booking - by telephone and online. This is taking appointments from others.\n\"Please turn up when you have made an appointment. Please don't phone up if you are not eligible - you won't get a booking. And please be courteous to staff on the telephone lines.\n\"I fully understand people are anxious to get the protection that the vaccines offer. Let me assure everyone that we are rolling out the vaccination programme as quickly as we can. While it is not a race, I believe our progress to date would be the envy of many other countries.\n\"Our rate of progress is limited by the availability of supplies. Further vaccine supplies will come and you will get your jab. Please be patient.\"\nMeanwhile, the department has appealed for people aged between 65 and 69-years-old to get their vaccine after demand has slowed since after an initial surge in demand when slots were made available for that age group late last month.\nOn Thursday, Mr Swann told Stormont's health committee that the drop in the R number had \"undoubtedly saved lives\".\n\"We always need a period of time when R is as low as possible - to more quickly break those chains of infection which are resulting in people becoming sick and hospitalised and losing their lives,\" he said.\n\"Our health and social care needs time to deliver other care and that has been delayed or disrupted by the epidemic,\" he added.\nHe also discussed the issue of new variants of the virus and said the Kent variant now accounts for 40-60% of new cases in Northern Ireland.\nHe was also asked about what changes are being made to the Covid-19 strategy to avoid more cycles of lockdown and lifting of restrictions.\nHe said a lot had been learned from the first wave of the pandemic, and they have \"massively up-scaled\" the test, trace and protect (TTP) programme.\nHe said the average contact time is now six-and-a-half hours after a positive case.\nAt the peak of this wave in January, 12,000 cases were referred to TTP and contact success was 93.5%, he said.\nSince January, there has been an increase in the average number of contacts from one to two-and-a-half people despite the current restrictions in place, he added.\nMr Swann also said testing is being rolled out elsewhere - in workplaces, special schools, meat factories, Translink - and waste water was also being tested."

      "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have told the UK's tabloid press they are ending all co-operation with them.\u00a0 \nIn a letter to editors of all the Sun, Mirror, Mail and Express titles and websites, a representative said the pair had taken the step due to \"distorted, false or invasive\" stories.\nHarry and Meghan said they refused to \"offer themselves up as currency for an economy of click bait and distortion\".\nThe couple have relocated to California after stepping back as senior royals.\nIn the letter, the couple's public relations representative wrote it was \"gravely concerning that an influential slice of the media\" has printed \"distorted, false or invasive\" articles.\n\"There is a real human cost to this way of doing business and it affects every corner of society,\" the letter said.\n\"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they know - as well as complete strangers - have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue.\"\nThe BBC was told that the letter had been sent to the editors of the Sun, the Daily Mail, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Express newspapers.\nThe new policy will apply to the four newspapers, their Sunday editions and associated websites, the Guardian's media editor Jim Waterson reported.\nThe Daily Star, which was not specifically mentioned, is published by the same group that publishes the Mirror and Express titles.\nThe ban on engagement with the papers will mean that the couple's PR team will no longer even answer calls from the papers asking them to confirm whether claims made about the couple are true or not.\nOutlining the new policy of \"no corroboration and zero engagement\" with all the publications that received it, the letter said the measure would also protect the couple's communications team \"from the side of the industry that readers never see\".\n\"This policy is not about avoiding criticism,\" the letter continued. \n\"It's not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting. Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can't be based on a lie.\"\nThe letter said the couple will continue to work with other media and \"young, up-and-coming journalists\" to raise awareness of the issues and causes they care about.\nIn recent days, photographs of the Sussexes delivering food to vulnerable people in Los Angeles have been published by two of the newspapers to receive the letter.\nAnd it comes ahead of a court hearing this week in a legal case Meghan has brought against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday over the publication of a letter written to the duchess by her estranged father.\nThe couple officially stepped back as senior working members of the Royal Family at the end of March as part of a transition following an announcement of their intention to become financially independent in January..\nAs The Duke and Duchess of Sussex now settle into the next chapter of their lives and no longer receive any publicly funded support, we are writing to set a new media relations policy, specifically as it pertains to your organisation.\nLike you, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex believe that a free press is a cornerstone to any democracy\u2014 particularly in moments of crisis. At its best, this free press shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold, standing up for what's right, challenging power, and holding those who abuse the system to account.\nIt has been said that journalism's first obligation is to the truth. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex agree wholeheartedly. \nIt is gravely concerning that an influential slice of the media, over many years, has sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or print\u2014even when they know it to be distorted, false, or invasive beyond reason. When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in this much-needed industry is degraded.\nThere is a real human cost to this way of doing business and it affects every corner of society.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they know\u2014as well as complete strangers\u2014have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue.\nWith that said, please note that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be engaging with your outlet. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement. This is also a policy being instated for their communications team, in order to protect that team from the side of the industry that readers never see.\nThis policy is not about avoiding criticism. It's not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting. Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can't be based on a lie. \nThey also want to be very clear: this is not in any way a blanket policy for all media.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to working with journalists and media organisations all over the world, engaging with grassroots media, regional and local media, and young, up-and-coming journalists, to spotlight issues and causes that so desperately need acknowledging. And they look forward to doing whatever they can to help further opportunities for more diverse and underrepresented voices, who are needed now more than ever.\nWhat they won't do is offer themselves up as currency for an economy of click bait and distortion. \nWe are encouraged that this new approach will be heard and respected."

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon's appearance at the committee investigating her government's handling of complaints against Alex Salmond has been postponed. \nThe first minister had been due to give evidence to MSPs next week.\nBut the session was postponed after committee members, who met in private on Friday, said they wanted to examine the impact of a High Court ruling.\nA spokesperson for Ms Sturgeon said the delay was \"hugely frustrating\".\nSome committee members have said they believe the ruling could pave the way for both Mr Salmond - who refused to appear before the inquiry earlier this week - and Ms Sturgeon to give evidence in the future. \nA Scottish Parliament spokesperson said: \"Given the impact of the recent court judgement is not yet known, the committee has agreed that it must have the time to reflect on the impact on its work once the full written judgment is published early next week.\n\"As a result, the committee has agreed that the first minster's evidence should be postponed until the full impact of that judgment is considered.\n \"It is important for the committee to hear from Mr Salmond and the committee has always been clear that the first minister should be the last witness to appear before the inquiry.\"\nMr Salmond has been locked in a dispute with the committee over what material can be published, and refused to appear before the inquiry on Tuesday of this week.\nA spokeswoman for the committee said earlier this week that Mr Salmond had set conditions they \"simply could never meet\" because of court orders, and that the inquiry would move on without him appearing before them.\nBut the Spectator magazine went to the High Court on Thursday morning asking for the court order to be amended in order to give \"comfort and clarity\" to the inquiry about what can and cannot be published. \nThe publication's lawyers proposed one amendment, but judge Lady Dorrian then suggested another - which was accepted by all sides, including the Crown.\nThe judge's written reasons for the change will be published by the beginning of next week, with the advocate representing the Spectator saying this \"may be more important than the change\" itself.\nMr Salmond's legal team said on Thursday that they wanted to study the ruling, but hoped it could allow the former first minister to appear before the inquiry.\nHowever, a spokesperson for Ms Sturgeon said: \"This further delay is hugely frustrating.  \n\"The first minister was ready to give evidence on Tuesday and fully expected to be questioned about Mr Salmond's evidence, whether or not it had been published by the committee.\n\"She hopes the committee can resolve its issues with Mr Salmond quickly so that she can finally answer the questions that are being put to her, and get on with the job of supporting the country through the pandemic.\"\nCommittee member Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour's interim leader, said the committee would meet on Tuesday to discuss Lady Dorrian's judgement.\n\"I hope that we will then be in a position to publish the evidence provided by Mr Salmond,\" she said.\nScottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser, who also sits on the committee, said: \"From the outset, this committee have been clear that we could not do our job properly without being able to question Alex Salmond in person. \n\"I'm pleased members today have agreed a decision that will hopefully now allow that to happen.\n\"Once we have had time to digest the full details of the revised court order, the former first minister must now appear at the earliest opportunity. His evidence is absolutely vital to this inquiry.\"\nNicola Sturgeon was to be the final star witness on Tuesday - now there will be no witnesses giving evidence next week.\nThis is at least the third time a proposed date for the first minister's evidence session has been put off. That's why she is frustrated. \nThen again her own suggestion - that the committee use its powers to compel Alex Salmond to turn up - would probably have delayed her appearance anyway. \nInstead of compulsion, the committee has bought a bit of time to see if a slight change to a court order relating to Mr Salmond's trial will allow them to publish more of his written evidence.\nIf they can - and that's still a big if - he is more likely to want to appear in person, voluntarily.\nIf he does, that would now happen the week after next, with Nicola Sturgeon put back to 2 March, leaving the committee just a few weeks to report before Holyrood breaks for the election.\nThe committee was set up to investigate the Scottish government's botched handling of two internal harassment complaints against Mr Salmond, dating back to when he was first minister.\nBut after he raised a legal challenge in the Court of Session the government conceded its investigation had been \"unlawful\" due to a procedural error, and was ordered to pay him more than \u00a3500,000 in expenses.\nMr Salmond was subsequently cleared of all 13 charges of sexual assault against him after a trial at the High Court in March of last year. \nMr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon were intended to be the final witnesses to appear before the committee, which is due to publish its report next month. \nBut Mr Salmond had said he would only appear if the committee published in full a submission he made alleging that Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code.\nHis lawyers also asked for a range of other assurances, including \"very specific direction\" on every matter which he would have been barred from speaking about due to court orders.\nAt a meeting on Tuesday, committee MSPs voted by five to four not to publish the submission, with the four SNP members being joined by independent Andy Wightman to defeat the Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem representatives.\nA separate inquiry, headed by Ireland's former director of public prosecutions James Hamilton, is specifically examining whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave - by interfering with the civil service investigation into the allegations, or by lying to parliament."

      "text": "Immigration officials have not received guidance on how England's hotel quarantine system will work, less than three days before it is due to launch, a union says. \nThe Immigration Services Union said officials still did not know what levels of checks they should be conducting on travellers. \nFrom Monday arrivals from 33 countries will have to quarantine in hotels. \nThe government said staff were supported on how to apply new guidance.\nA spokeswoman added that Border Force operational guidance was \"constantly updated to reflect the ever changing environment\". \nThe requirement to quarantine in a hotel applies to British and Irish citizens and UK residents arriving in England from so-called \"red-list\" countries -  including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa - which are deemed high risk due to emerging new virus variants. It will cost \u00a31,750 for an individual.\nFrom these high-risk countries the government says travellers can arrive in England at five airports - Heathrow, Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough.\nIn Scotland, residents arriving from any country by air will have to isolate in hotels.\nLucy Moreton, general secretary of the Immigration Services Union, said officers still had questions about what to do with arrivals from \"red-list\" countries and whether they should chase someone if they ran away while being checked. \n\"They have had no operational instructions so far at all and we do not know for certain when they will receive them,\" she said.\n\"We know that passengers will be required to state in their passenger locator form whether they have been in a red-listed country, but the officers have been given no indication about how far they should inquire about the content of the form.\"\nShe also raised concerns about the safety of security halls.\n\"Officers are currently spending 15 to 20 minutes interacting with each passenger. They only have a Perspex screen, no masks or gloves to protect them,\" she said. \n\"That's not enough and if that interaction has to be longer there is a concern of an increased risk.\"\nLabour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said it was not good enough that Border Force staff still did not know how the system would work at airports, including whether high-risk arrivals would be taken straight to hotels or would have to queue with other travellers. \n\"Chaotic long queues with no social distancing in place have the potential to be super-spreading events that will undermine the very measures being introduced,\" she said. \nInternational travel is currently banned, other than for a small number of permitted reasons, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed.\nA Home Office spokeswoman said: \"We are taking decisive action at the borders and every essential check - from pre-departure testing to the Passenger Locator Form - will help prevent the importing of new coronavirus variants into the UK.\"\nMeanwhile, the website where travellers can book quarantine hotel rooms and new mandatory tests has reopened, after it was hit by technical issues. \nThe site was taken offline minutes after it launched on Thursday but appeared to be working again by Friday afternoon. \nIt comes as BBC analysis found England's quarantine system might turn out to be less stringent than Australia's scheme, which is seen as among the best in the world.\nA copy of the guidance for hotels in England's system suggests:\nThe UK government said its hotel quarantine measures were in line with those in other countries and staff would be able to access regular testing as well as appropriate personal protective equipment.\nThe new system also introduces tougher penalties, with avoiding quarantine in a designated hotel attracting a fine of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000.\nAnyone found to have falsified their travel history on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in on arrival risks up to 10 years in prison.\nAll international arrivals must book and pay in advance for two additional tests during their quarantine period, or face fines up to \u00a32,000.\nIn a further development, government sources have confirmed reports that countries can be added to the red list with just a few hours' notice.\nIt comes as 15,144 new cases were recorded in the UK, as well as 758 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nMeanwhile, more than 14 million people have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest government figures. \nWill you be travelling to the UK from a \"red list\" country?

There will be some people who chose not to have a vaccine when they were first offered it, who may have changed their minds.\"\nMr Drakeford said the NHS was \"checking and rechecking\" whether anyone had been left out and final appointments were being arranged for the weekend.\n\"Anybody who knows of somebody who may have missed out, it is not too late at all,\" he said.\n\"We will make sure that those people have an appointment as fast as possible.\"\nHealth minister Vaughan Gething said \"a leave no-one behind approach\" was being taken. \n\"The next group, those people 65 and over, all health boards are already sending out invites for those people to come forward as well,\" he said. \n\"We're not looking to miss a step, we're carrying on with the vaccine we have available.\"\nThe top four priority groups include:\nFigures show 88.4% of those aged 80 or older have had a first dose, compared to 86.3% for 75 to 79 year olds and 79.8% of 70 to 74 year olds.\nPublic Health Wales said a total of 80.3% of care home residents have had a first dose, and 83.5% of care home workers.\nBritish Medical Association chairman Dr David Bailey said Wales was \"hopefully on the home straight\".\nHe told BBC Radio Wales: \"People are really making an effort to make the thing go smoothly as possible, and it is a credit to the Welsh public, as well as everyone who has actually been delivering the vaccine, because it has gone smoothly and everyone has been trying to do their part.\"\nMr Drakeford said: \"To have achieved this first milestone and offered vaccination to everyone in the first four priority groups - those who are most vulnerable to coronavirus - is a truly phenomenal effort. \n\"Of course, the hard work has only just begun - there are many, many more people to vaccinate yet and a lot of second doses still to give.\"\nWelsh Conservative's Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies called the milestone a \"true British and Welsh success story\".\nHe said it showed the UK Government had \"ensured Wales has had the vaccines available to protect the most vulnerable in our society and meet this target\" and hoped Wales could soon reopen its economy.\nHowever he added there was a still a \"long way to go\" with 80% of the population yet to be offered the vaccine.\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesperson Rhun ap Iorwerth, said it was thanks to NHS staff and volunteers \"that Wales has been able to accelerate the vaccination effort to its current levels\".\nMr ap Iorwerth added his party would continue to call for \"those in all care settings, not just the elderly, to be vaccinated as a matter of priority, and for key workers in schools, the emergency services and public transport to be brought in to the priority system sooner.\""

Lawmakers from the House have been presenting their case to senators at his trial this week.\nMr Trump's lawyers have argued he was using his right to freedom of speech when declaring last November's presidential election fraudulent.\nA two-thirds majority is required to convict Mr Trump in the evenly split 100-seat Senate, but an acquittal looks likely as the vast majority of Republican senators have remained loyal to him so far.\nIf Mr Trump is convicted, however, the Senate could also vote to bar him from holding elected office again. \nThe violent riot at the Capitol, which saw five people lose their lives, was an attempt by Trump supporters to stop the election result being certified.\nOn Wednesday the trial was shown new footage of the violence Mr Trump is accused of inciting. Democrats sought to detail how Mr Trump sparked the attack on the Capitol and presented evidence that took senators step-by-step through the events of the day of the riot.\nOn Thursday, they embarked on the final point of their prosecution: the harm they say Mr Trump caused to property, people and democracy.\n\"Because impeachment, conviction and disqualification [from office] is not just about the past. It's about the future,\" Congressman Ted Lieu told the trial, after arguing Mr Trump had shown no remorse for his actions.\n\"It's making sure that no future official, no future president does the same exact thing.\"\nHouse prosecutor Joe Neguse made the case that Mr Trump was \"not just some guy\" making a controversial speech - he was a president addressing supporters who were \"poised for violence [and] he struck a match\".\nDemocrats showed clips of rioters saying they had come to Washington DC because they believed that was what then-President Trump wanted.\nFellow House manager David Cicilline used video and court documents to illustrate the harm done to \"Congress and the Democratic process\".\nHe added that some rioters admitted they planned to murder Vice-President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, while others spoke of \"sealing\" lawmakers in the basement where they hid and \"turning on the gas\".\n\"Never did any of us imagine that we would face mortal peril by a mob riled up by the president of the United States,\" Mr Cicilline said.\nHe also shared accounts from frightened staff who were in the Capitol during the riot.\nDemocrats also argued Mr Trump's conduct caused \"long-term harm\" to both domestic security and the nation's international standing.\nImpeachment manager Diana DeGette argued threats from domestic extremist groups \"were and are made worse by President Trump's refusal to take accountability and his refusal to forcibly denounce what his own FBI identified as some of the most dangerous elements of our country\".\nCongressman Joaquin Castro said international allies were shocked by the attack while adversaries mocked the US. \"The world is watching and wondering whether we are who we say we are.\"\nLead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin concluded by outlining questions for Donald Trump's defence team, as Mr Trump himself has refused to testify:\nMr Trump's Attorneys Bruce Castor and David Schoen will have up to 16 hours over the next two days to set out their defence.\nEarlier on Thursday, Mr Schoen accused the Democrats of making \"movies\" and presenting the case as an \"entertainment package\" with the video and audio footage they showed the Senate.\nA number of Republican senators have said they will vote for Mr Trump as they do not believe the constitution allows for the impeachment of a former president, despite the Senate rejecting that argument in a vote on Tuesday.\nDonald Trump's defence team will now get its turn. His lawyers will have up to 16 hours over two days to offer a rebuttal, although they are already saying they plan to wrap up by Friday evening.\nThey feel like they are winning on numbers and, if listening to Republican senators is any indication, they are probably right. Senators will then have up to four hours to present written questions to the legal teams.\nThat will be followed by a debate and vote over whether to allow witnesses - if either side wants them. If they do not, or if the vote fails, both sides will make brief closing arguments followed by the final vote on Mr Trump's fate.\nAll told, this could wrap up as early as Saturday night or by Monday at the latest - less than a week from start to finish. That stands in stark contrast to Mr Trump's last trial, which took three weeks, or President Andrew Johnson's proceedings in 1868, which had witnesses and took more than two months.\nMost of the Senate seems ready to move on as soon as possible - and it looks like they will get their wish.\nRead more from Anthony"

      "text": "\"Cautious\" talks about Wales' tourist industry reopening in time for Easter have started, the first minister said.\nBut Mark Drakeford said the sector - which supports 10% of the Welsh workforce or 120,000 jobs - would not be opened \"in one go\".\nAlthough he did not rule it out, Mr Drakeford also suggested it was unlikely pubs and restaurants would be open at the start of April.\nHe said a revised plan out of lockdown would be published \"within days\". \nThe Welsh Conservatives have called on the Welsh Government to \"develop a plan for a best-case scenario\".\nMr Drakeford said ministers were talking to the Welsh tourist industry, worth \u00a36.3bn to the Welsh economy, \"about what might be possible around the Easter period\".\nWales' lockdown is set to be reviewed on 19 February and the first minister said it was all \"very much caveated\" and dependant on Covid infection rates and variants of the virus.\nMr Drakeford said if progress against Covid continued, the authorities could \"slowly and cautiously\" lift restrictions in the run-up to spring and Easter \"in all aspects of our lives\".\nCurrently, all indoor and outdoor events are cancelled and visitor attractions, non-essential shops, hospitality businesses and holiday accommodation are shut.\nThree to seven-year-old children will be able to return to school in Wales from 22 February, along with some older children on vocational courses.\nThe potential phased reopening of schools for the remainder of primary age children and college students will be the priority at the next three-week Covid lockdown review - and Mr Drakeford said there would only be room for some other \"modest\" changes at most.\nAsked whether the return of more pupils to face-to-face teaching would be his government's priority for the following review on 12 March, the first minister said \"schools will remain our top priority\" if there was \"further headroom available to us\".\n\"But, of course, there are other things we know that matter a great deal to people and if we were in a position safely to do anything else to lift the restrictions that is what we would do,\" Mr Drakeford added.\nThe first minister said he \"absolutely\" understood the need to give the tourism industry \"some forward notice\" if a partial reopening was allowed for the Easter break.\nBut he said: \"Nobody should think that what we're talking about here is the wholesale reopening of the tourist industry in one go.\"\nAsked if that meant it was unlikely pubs and restaurants would also be open at Easter, Mr Drakeford said: \"I don't want to rule things out quite in that way. \n\"The way we'll have to do it will be step by step, using what headroom we have, never doing too many things that put us back in danger.\n\"It will not be safe to lift restrictions over too many things all at once. That means prioritising things.\"\nThe first minister said the Welsh Government's \"cautious approach\" would likely focus on the reopening of self-contained holiday accommodation in the first instance.\nMr Drakeford said\u00a0anyone\u00a0booking a holiday should do so \"knowing the\u00a0uncertain world that we are living in and that there are no guarantees\".\nThe chair of the Wales Tourism Alliance called on the UK and Welsh governments to work together as \"80% of our tourism market is across the border in England\".\nAndrew Campbell said there was an \"awful lot of planning\" needed before reopening as \"you don't just turn a switch on\".\n\"There's always been cautious optimism that we could get going again in April, but Easter would be simply wonderful,\" he told BBC Radio Wales\n\"If we go and open and England are still in lockdown that will cause problems - we need to have those discussions,\" Mr Campbell added.\nLynette Esposito, owner of the Elm Tree hotel in Llandudno, said she felt \"optimistic\" after the first minister's comments.\nBut she said coming out of lockdown for Welsh businesses should be \"aligned with England\" as that accounted for \"the bulk of their business\".\n\"I think in terms of a timeline it is critical we are being given sufficient time, for us to be able to get the place cleaned up and start trade,\" she said.\nShe added she thought it would be useful for hospitality staff to get \"some advantage as to getting a vaccine\" as they would be \"frontline people reopening the economy\".\nMs Esposito said they had been seeing a \"substantial number of new inquiries\" from people who had never visited Wales before.\n\"There is no doubt there is demand out there, but people are still cautious,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, the Three Cliffs Holiday Park in the Gower has seen a surge in bookings after the first minister's \"positive outlook for this summer\".\n\"It's lovely to have so much enthusiasm,\" said owner Tom Beynon.\nWell, a number of figures need to continue fall - namely average case rates, test positivity rates and Covid hospital patient numbers.\nWales currently has the lowest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK, with a seven-day average of 102 cases per 100,000 - a dramatic fall from before Christmas, where it had the highest in the UK with 603.\nThe number of hospital patients in Wales was at record levels at the start of January - now it is at its lowest daily average since 20 December.\nCovid positivity rate in Wales now stands at 8.7% - its lowest point since 8 October.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the proportion of positive tests should be no more than 5% before areas come out of restrictions.\nThe Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (Tac) has issued a warning of the need for continued vigilance.\nIn its latest report it said if restrictions were lifted \"too early or too quickly\", there was a \"high likelihood of returning to current levels of infections and hospitalisations in those scenarios\".\nIt said the reproduction (R) number continues to be within the range of between 0.7 and 0.9 - it has been within this range for a few weeks and is down from the period just after Christmas when it was between 0.8 and 1.1.\nIt means for every 10 people with the virus in Wales about seven people would become infected.\nAndrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, called on the Welsh Government to \"develop a plan for a best-case scenario\".\nHe said: \"As we hit these important vaccination milestones and with the latest review due at the end of next week, it's important ministers now devise a roadmap out of lockdown, providing timescales where possible and appropriate for schools, families, workers and businesses.\"\nWales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said any easing would not happen quickly, adding: \"What we don't want to do is have a rapid opening up and a rapid resurgence of the virus.\"\nOn Thursday, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was \"too early\" to know whether summer holidays could go ahead, prompting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to urge the UK Government to \"get rid of the mixed messages\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce a \"gradual and phased\" plan out of lockdown for England on 22 February.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said restrictions will remain for \"at least\" the rest of the month\"."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "Dexamethasone,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A drug normally used to treat arthritis can be a life-saver for some of the sickest hospital patients with Covid, new research shows.\nFor every 25 patients treated with tocilizumab, along with a cheap steroid already routinely given, an additional life would be saved, the experts say.\nSome hospitals are now doing this. \nAs well as improving survival and recovery time, it can avoid patients needing to be moved to intensive care, say the NHS doctors.\nWendy Coleman, 62, received the treatment last year when she was admitted to Chesterfield Royal Hospital with severe Covid-19.\n\"I was struggling to breathe quite badly and on the verge of being placed in an intensive care unit. \n\"After I was given tocilizumab, my condition stabilised and I didn't get any worse. Up until then, it was quite scary as I didn't know if I was going to make it or not,\" she said. \nResearchers say around half of people admitted to hospital with Covid could benefit from the treatment. \nThey have carried out a clinical trial with more than 4,000 volunteers, like Wendy, and say the results are \"tremendous\". \nHalf of these Covid patients were given tocilizumab, via a drip, alongside usual care with a life-saving cheap steroid drug called dexamethasone. \nIn that group, compared to another group that did not receive the new drug: \nCombined, tocilizumab and dexamethasone should cut death risk by about a third for patients on oxygen and halve it for those on a ventilator, the researchers say. \nProf Martin Landray, joint chief investigator of the RECOVERY trial and a medical expert at Oxford University, said: \"Used in combination, the impact is substantial. This is good news for patients and good news for the health services that care for them in the UK and around the world.\" \nDr Charlotte Summers, an intensive care medic at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, said: \"These findings are a tremendous step forwards. This therapy looks like it keeps people out of the intensive care unit so they never need to see people like me which can only be a good thing.\"\nThe treatment isn't cheap, costing around \u00a3500 per patient on top of the \u00a35 course of dexamethasone. But the advantage of using it is clear - and less than the cost per day of an intensive care bed of around \u00a32,000.\nThe drugs dampen down inflammation, which can go into overdrive in Covid patients and cause damage to the lungs and other organs.\nThe preliminary trial results will soon be submitted to a peer-reviewed medical journal. \nHealth and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"We are working quickly and closely with colleagues across the health system and sector to ensure every NHS patient who needs this treatment should be able to access it - reducing further pressures on the NHS and potentially saving thousands of lives.\"\nNHS national medical director Prof Stephen Powis said it was another breakthrough in the fight against coronavirus.

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nWe've had some good news this afternoon - levels of coronavirus are going down in all four nations of the UK. It's evidence that lockdown is having the desired effect, even with the more infectious variant. But experts warn that infection levels remain high. Meanwhile the R number - the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus onto - is at its lowest level since July. Estimates put it at between 0.7 and 0.9, meaning the epidemic is shrinking.\nWales will be the first UK nation to have offered the top four priority groups a Covid jab, the Welsh government has said. Officials say that within hours, all over-70s including care home residents will have been offered a first dose. The UK government set a target of Monday to offer jabs to the top four groups - about 15 million people - and currently, more than 14 million have been vaccinated. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford also prompted hope for an easing of lockdown rules in the country, saying \"cautious\" talks about the tourism sector being able to reopen in time for Easter have begun. Read the latest here.\nPolice in Middlesbrough say they were left \"outnumbered\" when hundreds of people gathered to sledge in the snow. Covid regulations allow police to issue fines for organised gatherings - but the rules do not apply for crowds made up of individual households. Insp Tony Cross from Cleveland Police said: \"It's taking up a lot of resources\" and if people didn't engage \"we're going to have to start taking names and addresses and issuing fines\". Read more here.\nThe deadline to buy a home under the current Help to Buy scheme in England has been extended. The scheme applies to new-build homes but Covid has caused long delays to construction and, if the properties are not built in time, buyers face losing thousands of pounds. The government has now extended the scheme until the end of May, but some buyers are worried that the two-month extended deadline will still come too soon.\nYou might have seen the viral video of a lawyer whose face turned into a cat at a virtual court hearing because of a filter mishap on Zoom. \"I'm here live, I'm not a cat,\" the lawyer told the judge. Well, now there's been another amusing blunder, this time in a different part of the US.

I can call my friends but it doesn't feel the same as having the social interaction. It's been quite difficult.\"\nShe said she was often in the house alone as her mother and step-father were both keyworkers.\nShe added: \"I had a week after Christmas when I felt very low, I kept thinking, 'How are we going to get out of this?'. I know there are vaccines now but sometimes I just keep thinking, 'when is it going to end?'.\"\nThe report said children as young as three described missing friends, relatives and experiences and 40% of 17-year-olds reported they felt lonely 'most of the time'.\nIt also found children and young people of black, Asian and other ethnic minority ethnicities and disabled youngsters were more likely to feel lonely and less likely to say they feel safe.\nHowever, the report also found many children and young people said they were enjoying spending time at home and were receiving good support from schools and youth workers.\nLuca Zenati-Parsons, 15, said his schoolwork had been improving during lockdown.\n\"I get to do it in my own time and on my own - there's no-one being loud in class,\" said Luca, from Caerphilly, who usually goes to school in Pontypridd. \n\"I prefer to be in my own little zone.\"\nProf Holland said she hoped the results of the report would give a \"clear road-map\" for the Welsh Government on what needed to be prioritised for children and young people over the next weeks and months.\nThe report's findings have already been shared with the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (TAC) and she said it would also be sent to SAGE, the UK's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.\nShe added the first priority for students returning to schools and colleges may need to be \"providing time to talk about their experiences, opportunities to be with friends and to play and also the chance to reflect on and be proud of what they have achieved during the pandemic\".\nA Welsh Government spokesperson said the results of the survey from May had been used \"extensively\" to decision on policy ranging from education to recent alert levels.\nThey added: \"The new set of findings will now also be considered as a key source of evidence when future decisions are made.\""

      "text": "The UK chairman of KPMG has resigned following a row over comments he made at a meeting on Monday.\nBill Michael had told consultants to \"stop moaning\" about the impact of the pandemic and lockdown on people's lives, and to stop \"playing the victim card\".\nAnnouncing his resignation, Mr Michael said his position was \"untenable\".\nHe added that he was \"truly sorry that my words have caused hurt amongst my colleagues\".\nMr Michael had temporarily stepped aside after KPMG launched an independent investigation into the comments.\nHe said on Friday: \"I love the firm and I am truly sorry that my words have caused hurt amongst my colleagues and for the impact the events of this week have had on them.\n\"In light of that, I regard my position as untenable and so I have decided to leave the firm.\"\nThe row blew up this week after Mr Michael made the comments in an online meeting with 500 staff members.\nStaff had raised concerns over potential pay, pension and bonus cuts.\nIn a video of the meeting widely circulated online, Mr Michael said: \"I have spoken to a lot of partners, and people at all sorts of levels, where it almost feels like this [pandemic] is being done to them. Well, you can't play the role of victim unless you're sick. And I hope you're not sick, and you're not ill, and if you're not, take control of your life, don't sit there and moan about it.\"\nIn another part of the video, Mr Michael also questioned whether unconscious bias training, which tries to get people to challenge any stereotypes they hold without realising, was effective.\n\"There is no such thing as unconscious bias.\" he said. \"I don't buy it, because after every single unconscious bias training that's ever been done nothing has ever improved. So unless you care, you actually won't change.\"\nHe later apologised for the comments, saying his words did not reflect his beliefs.\nWhile at KPMG Mr Michael \"championed the debate about bank culture and standards and the need for change in the industry,\" according to a KPMG biography.\nHe was also special adviser to the UK's Treasury Select Committee into Banking Standards.\nWhen Mr Michael stepped aside pending the investigation into his comments KPMG appointed its first female leaders in 150 years.\nBina Mehta stepped in as acting chairman and Mary O'Connor took over Mr Michael's day-to-day executive responsibilities as acting senior partner.\nMs Mehta said on Friday: \"Bill has made a huge contribution to our firm over the last 30 years, especially over the last three years as chairman, and we wish him all the best for the future.\"\nMr Michael will leave the business at the end of the month after a handover period."

      "text": "GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. \nIt's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy.\nGDP allows businesses to judge when to expand and hire more people, and for government to work out how much to tax and spend.\nIn the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are the most widely watched. \nIn a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly bigger than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer.\nMost economists, politicians and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily. \nRising GDP means more jobs are likely to be created, and workers are more likely to get better pay rises.\nIf GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking - bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can mean pay freezes and lost jobs. \nThe Covid pandemic caused the most severe recession seen in over 300 years, hurting business and employment, and forcing government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy.\nIf GDP is growing, the government will use it as evidence to say that it is doing a good job of managing the economy. \nLikewise, if it falls, opposition politicians will say the government is running it badly.\nGDP helps government decide how much it can spend on public services and how much it needs to raise in taxes. \nIf GDP is going up steadily, people will pay more tax simply because they're earning and spending more. \nThis means more money for the government to spend on public services, such as schools, police and hospitals.\nGDP can also help governments work out if they are borrowing too much. For the 2020-21 financial year, the government borrowed nearly \u00a3300bn to pay for the costs of the coronavirus pandemic.\nComparing that figure to GDP tells you the government is borrowing about 14% of GDP in one year. \nThat's the biggest borrowing figure since World War Two.\nGDP can be measured in three ways:\nIn the UK, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes one single measure of GDP, which is calculated using all three measurements. But early estimates mainly use the output measure. \nThe ONS collects data from thousands of UK companies to use in its calculations. \nThe UK produces one of the quickest estimates of GDP of the major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question.\nAt that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised as more information comes in.\nThe ONS publishes more information on how this is done on its website.\nGDP growth doesn't tell the whole story. \nThere are lots of things the statistics might not take into account:\nJust because GDP is increasing, it doesn't mean that an individual person's standard of living is improving. \nIf a country's population increases, that will push GDP up, because with more people, money will be spent.\nHowever, the individuals within that country might not be getting richer. They may be getting poorer on average, even while GDP goes up.\nSo the ONS publishes a figure for GDP per head (of population), which can often tell a different story to the main GDP number. \nCritics have argued that GDP doesn't take into account whether the economic growth it measures is sustainable, or the damage it might do to the natural world.\nAlternative measures have been developed. \nIn 2010, the ONS started measuring well-being alongside economic growth. This measures health, relationships, education and skills, as well as personal finances and the environment. \nIn 2019, New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, released the country's first \"well-being budget\", prioritising health and life-satisfaction rather than economic growth. \nDespite its limitations, GDP is still the most widely-used measure for most government decisions and international comparisons."

      "text": "The Australian state of Victoria will enter lockdown for a third time in a bid to suppress an outbreak of the UK strain of coronavirus.\nOfficials this week found 13 cases stemming from a quarantine worker who became infected at a Melbourne hotel.\nThe lockdown will begin on Friday midnight and end on Wednesday.\nHowever, the government has said the Australian Open tennis tournament would continue in the state's capital, Melbourne.\nSpectators will be banned from attending the event from Saturday, which had previously allowed up to 30,000 visitors a day. Tickets will be refunded, tournament director Craig Tiley said.\nVictorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the current outbreak was not linked to the quarantine hotels used by the tennis players.\nHe stressed that a \"circuit breaker\" was needed to combat the \"hyper-infectious\" strain which he said had likely already seeded other infections in the community.\n\"This is the fastest-moving, most infectious strain of coronavirus that we have seen,\" he said, adding that almost 1,000 close contacts had already been reached.\nPrior to this outbreak, Victoria had not seen a local infection for 28 days and the state had largely eliminated the virus.\nMany Melbourne residents have expressed dismay but also resignation over the retreat into lockdown again.\nLast year, in Australia's winter, the city endured one of the world's longest and strictest lockdowns to overcome a second wave which led to more than 90% of Australia's 29,000 cases and 909 deaths.\n\"We've built something precious, and we have to make difficult decisions, and do difficult things, in order to defend what we've built,\" Mr Andrews said.\n\"I am confident that this short, sharp circuit breaker will be effective. We will be able to smother this.\"\nThe state will be under the following restrictions for five days:\nMeanwhile, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia have announced travel bans on people from Melbourne. Further border closures are expected. International flights to Melbourne will also be cancelled, authorities said.\nThe tough ride continues for the Australian Open as Covid and controversy strike again. \nWhen I was there reporting on the event's opening weekend, the tennis fans I spoke to said how happy they were for sport to have come back to Melbourne.\n\"We're just grateful,\" one fan, Angela, told me as she walked around the park. \"We know how much this is worth. We know how much we've struggled to achieve that.\"\nThe city went through a traumatic, lengthy lockdown last July after a quarantine breach led to more than 18,000 cases.\nNow the city is going back into lockdown again and for many it's a dispiriting d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nConfined to their homes, they're also asking why the tennis is still going ahead.\nWhy will players and their teams get to move around and play matches while the people of Melbourne will have to stay home?\nMelbourne becomes the fourth Australian city - joining Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide - to enter a snap lockdown since November.\nIn each situation, the cases have occurred due to a quarantine hotel breach - with all but one of these found to be the more infectious UK variant. \nVictorian health authorities have been scrambling to find out how the virus leaked out, with particular focus being paid to airborne transmission.\nOfficials say the UK variant is \"hyper-infectious\". But experts in the past week have questioned why stronger aerosol protections weren't in place when the threat of airborne transmission was previously known."

      "text": "Up to 80,000 NI people who received a shielding letter as they are clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) to Covid-19 can now book a vaccination appointment.\nAppointments can be made online for vaccinations at seven centres.\nOnline appointments are available for this weekend, with telephone booking available from next week.\nThe news comes as the Department of Health reported another nine coronavirus-related deaths on Friday, bringing its death total to 1,975.\nThere were 407 new cases recorded.\nThere are 488 people being treated in hospital for the virus in Northern Ireland.\nIt comes as the number of Covid-19-related deaths registered fell for a second week, according to Northern Ireland's statistics agency.\nThe virus was listed on the death certificates of 126 people in the week to 5 February.  \nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the vaccination appointment announcement would be \"very welcome to all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable and have been looking forward to getting vaccinated\".\n\"A start has already been made on the CEV category and offering booked appointments will help to accelerate this,\" he added.\n\"I would again appeal to everyone to be patient - whether that's waiting on the line to book your vaccination appointment by telephone or waiting your turn in the vaccination programme.\"\nThe system will be open to all those who received a shielding letter.  \nThey will have to bring that letter with them to the vaccination centre to prove their eligibility and will receive the Pfizer vaccine.\nPatricia Donnelly, who heads up NI's vaccine programme, said people should not panic if they cannot find their shielding letter.\n\"This is going to be open for a while, there's plenty of appointments.\n\"For some individuals, they will be called by their GPs, so they may in fact find that their GP is calling them forward - but we're going to issue further advice on this next week.\" \nEarlier, referring to vaccinations, NI's chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, told BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show he was \"confident that we will have completed over-70s and clinically extremely vulnerable through February and perhaps into early March\".\nAbout 401,966 vaccines have been administered to date, with 373,414 of them being first doses and the remaining 28,552 being second doses, according to the Department of Health.\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland's Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) has recorded a fall of 11 Covid-19-related deaths on the previous week's toll of 137.\nIt is also the second time the number has fallen since the record high of 182 reported on 22 January. \nIt brings the agency's total of coronavirus-related registered deaths to 2,574.  \nThe Department of Health's total for the same date, based on a positive test result being recorded, was 1,923.  \nNisra's figures are higher than that recorded by the department because it records all mentions of the virus on death certificates, even though it may or may not have been confirmed by way of a test.\nOn the agency's measure, there have been 1,676 Covid-19-related deaths in hospital, including the deaths of 224 care home residents.  \nTaking that figure, and the 737 who died in care homes, it means care home residents now account for fewer than two-fifths (36.8%) of all virus-related deaths.  \nVirus-related deaths were also recorded in hospices (0.5%) and other residential locations (7.2%).  \nDeaths in care homes and hospitals involved 174 separate establishments.  \nPeople aged 75 and over account for more than three-quarters of all Covid-19-related registered deaths (77.2%) between 19 March 2020 and 5 February 2021.  \nThe Antrim and Newtownabbey (9.9%), and Mid-Ulster (7.7%) local government districts have now recorded higher proportions of all coronavirus-related deaths, compared with their share of all deaths in Northern Ireland (8.3% and 6.4% respectively).   \nThe provisional number of deaths from all causes for the week ending 5 February was 462.  \nThat is 25 more than the previous week, and 125 more than the five-year average for the time of year, which is 337. \nOn Friday, the Republic of Ireland recorded a further 21 deaths linked to Covid-19, bringing its total to 3,865.\nThere have been 207,720 cases of the virus after the Irish department of health was notified of an additional 921 cases.\nThere are 959 Covid-19 inpatients in the Republic, with 173 in intensive care."

      "tags": "GDP,Rishi Sunak,Economic growth,UK economy,Budget 2021,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "The UK economy shrank by a record 9.9% last year as coronavirus restrictions hit output, official figures show.\nThe contraction in 2020 \"was more than twice as much as the previous largest annual fall on record\", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nHowever, the economy looks set to avoid a double-dip recession after growth picked up at the end of the year.\nIn December, the economy grew by 1.2%, after shrinking by 2.3% in November, as some restrictions eased.\nHospitality, car sales and hairdressers recovered some lost ground, the ONS said.\nThe growth meant that in the October-to-December quarter the economy expanded by 1%. As a result, the UK is expected to avoid what could have been its first double-dip recession since the 1970s.\nA double-dip is when the economy briefly recovers from recession, only to quickly sink back. A recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters where the economy contracts.\nONS deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow said: \"An increase in Covid-19 testing and tracing also boosted output. The economy continued to grow in the fourth quarter as a whole, despite the additional [lockdown] restrictions in November.\"\nGDP was first measured in the aftermath of the Second World War, and the measure has never previously dropped by more than 4.1% in a year. However, the Bank of England models GDP going back centuries, and the 2020 contraction could be the worse since 1709.\nSuren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Despite avoiding a double-dip recession, with output still well below pre-pandemic levels amid confirmation that 2020 was a historically bleak year for the UK economy, there is little to cheer in the latest data.\"\nAll four economic sectors tracked by the ONS saw a drop in output, with the highest fall coming in the construction sector, which contracted by 12.5%.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: \"Today's figures show that last year our economy experienced a significant shock, and also some signs of resilience over winter.\n\"You know what's clear is right now, many families and businesses are experiencing hardship. That's why we've put in place a comprehensive plan for jobs to support people through this crisis, and we will set out the next stage of our economic response at our Budget in early March.\"\nBut shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: \"These figures confirm that not only has the UK had the worst death toll in Europe, we're experiencing the worst economic crisis of any major economy.\n\"Businesses can't wait any longer. The chancellor needs to come forward now with a plan to secure the economy in the months ahead, with support going hand-in-hand with health restrictions.\"\nHowever, Mr Sunak said international economic comparisons were not necessarily a useful yardstick. \n\"We calculate GDP in a different way to pretty much everybody else. And if you either correct for that difference or look at it in a way that's more comfortable with nominal GDP, what you find, as the Bank of England and the ONS have pointed out, is that our performance is very much in line and comparable to other countries.\"\nEconomists said that with Covid-19 restrictions expected to remain until early spring, the hit to the economy will continue over the next few months.\n\"We anticipate a sharp decline in activity during the first quarter of the year,\" said Kemar Whyte, senior economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. \"Nevertheless, growth will pick up from the second quarter onwards as restrictions ease on the back of a successful vaccination programme.\" \nAs expected the economy stabilised in the last quarter of 2020. But the latest set of statistics confirm the scale of the hit over the whole of last year. \nA technical return to recession has been avoided, with the economy returning to growth at the end of last year. But the economy is certainly falling again so far in the first three months of 2021, due to the tough national lockdowns, as well as some impact from increased trade barriers with the European Union.\nThe chancellor and Bank of England will be paying much more attention to what is going on right now. The renewed lockdown has hit growth considerably again, but not as hard as last April. \nBusinesses and households remain in holding pattern ready to unleash pent up growth when the economy is reopened. \nWhile the vaccine will eventually unlock that growth, the precise timing is still uncertain, and the government remains under pressure to maintain significant sums in economic support.\nLast year's contraction is steeper than almost any other big economy, although Spain suffered an 11% decline.\nBritain has reported Europe's highest death toll from coronavirus and is among the world's highest in terms of deaths per head of population.\nMuch of the damage to the UK economy is attributed by economists to a high dependence on the service sector, which suffered particularly badly during the year because of lockdown.\nHowever, Britain has vaccinated many more people than other European countries so far, raising the prospect of a bounce-back for its economy later this year.\nThat potential fast rebound prompted the Bank of England's chief economist to describe the economy as like a \"coiled spring\" ready to release large amounts of \"pent-up financial energy\".\nAndy Haldane said on Thursday that consumer confidence would surge back thanks to the vaccine programme, with the economy firing \"on all cylinders\" by spring.\nMr Sunak told the BBC: \"There are reasons for cautious optimism, because the vaccine roll-out is going really well. \n\"The prime minister will set out a roadmap for exiting restrictions in the next few weeks and months. It will be the week of February, 22nd, and it's related that we base our roadmap on the best possible evidence of data.\""

      "text": "Justin Timberlake has apologised to Britney Spears after a new documentary led to criticism of how he treated her during and after their relationship.\nFraming Britney Spears featured archive clips of Timberlake discussing his sexual relationship with the singer.\nIn a statement on Instagram on Friday, Timberlake said he was \"deeply sorry\" and wanted to \"take accountability\".\nHe also apologised to Janet Jackson, after failing to support her over their controversial Super Bowl performance.\nTimberlake and Spears dated between 1999 and 2002, while he was a member of boy band N*Sync.\nAfter their split, he indirectly accused her of cheating on him when he hired a lookalike actress to appear in the video for his single Cry Me A River.\n\"I've seen the messages, tags, comments, and concerns and I want to respond. I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem, where I spoke out of turn, or did not speak up for what was right. I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism.\n\"I specifically want to apologise to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson both individually, because I care for and respect these women and I know I failed. I also feel compelled to respond, in part, because everyone involved deserves better and most importantly, because this is a larger conversation that I wholeheartedly want to be part of and grow from.\n\"The industry is flawed. It sets men, especially white men, up for success. It's designed this way. As a man in a privileged position I have to be vocal about this. Because of my ignorance, I didn't recognise it for all that it was while it was happening in my own life but I do not want to ever benefit from others being pulled down again. \n\"I have not been perfect in navigating all of this throughout my career. I know this apology is a first step and doesn't absolve the past. I want to take accountability for my own missteps in all of this as well as be part of a world that uplifts and supports. I care deeply about the wellbeing of the people I love and have loved. I can do better and I will do better.\"\nAfter finding fame at the end of the 1990s, Spears said she was waiting until she was married to lose her virginity.\nBut during a radio interview, a clip of which features in the documentary, Timberlake publicly revealed that they had slept together.\nTwo years later, at the 2004 Super Bowl, Timberlake performed with Janet Jackson, accidentally exposing her breast. The \"wardrobe malfunction\", as it became known, led to outcry and complaints from viewers.\nAlthough both apologised, Jackson absorbed the bulk of the negative publicity. She was fined and blacklisted by US radio and MTV, and Timberlake's failure to publicly support her was heavily criticised in later years.\nInterest in Spears has been renewed by the release of the New York Times documentary, which examines how Spears has been treated throughout her career.\nIt has led to criticism of Timberlake and other figures including journalist Diane Sawyer, who told Spears during a 2003 interview she had \"disappointed a lot of mothers\", and gossip blogger Perez Hilton, who was involved in the coverage of her 2007 breakdown.\nThe film also goes into detail about the singer's conservatorship, a legal arrangement that has given her father Jamie Spears control over her career and financial affairs since 2008.\nHowever on Thursday, a judge upheld a previous ruling that made a financial company a co-conservator for the singer, and rejected Mr Spears' request to keep his previous level of power over his daughter's investments.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Media,UK Royal Family,Thomas Markle,Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,The Royal Family and the media",
      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex has welcomed her High Court privacy victory over the Mail on Sunday, saying the damage the publisher has done \"runs deep\". \nMeghan brought the claim against Associated Newspapers (ANL) over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father. \nThe judge said Meghan had a \"reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private\".\nANL said it was surprised and disappointed by the judgment. \nMr Justice Warby granted Meghan \"summary judgment\" in her claim for misuse of private information against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, meaning that part of the case is resolved without a trial.\nHe said there would be a further hearing in March to decide \"the next steps\" in the legal action.\nMeghan, 39, sent the handwritten letter to her father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018, following her marriage to Prince Harry in May that year, which Mr Markle did not attend. The couple are now living in the US with their son Archie, after having stepped back from their roles in the Royal Family.\nIn a judgment on Thursday, Mr Justice Warby ruled that the publication of the letter - which he described as \"a long-form telling-off\" - was \"manifestly excessive and hence unlawful\".\n\"It was, in short, a personal and private letter,\" he said.\n\"The majority of what was published was about the claimant's own behaviour, her feelings of anguish about her father's behaviour - as she saw it - and the resulting rift between them.\n\"These are inherently private and personal matters.\"\nHe added: \"There is no prospect that a different judgment would be reached after a trial.\"\nExtracts from the letter appeared in a double-page spread in the Mail on Sunday, alongside the headline: \"Revealed: the letter showing true tragedy of Meghan's rift with a father she says has 'broken her heart into a million pieces'\". \nIn a statement, the Duchess of Sussex said she was grateful to the courts for holding Associated Newspapers to account \"for their illegal and dehumanising practices\". \n\"For these outlets, it's a game. For me and so many others, it's real life, real relationships, and very real sadness,\" she said. \n\"The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep.\"\nMeghan said her \"comprehensive win\" means \"we have all won\", adding: \"We now know, and hope it creates legal precedent, that you cannot take somebody's privacy and exploit it in a privacy case, as the defendant has blatantly done over the past two years.\"\nA spokesman for ANL said: \"We are very surprised by today's summary judgment and disappointed at being denied the chance to have all the evidence heard and tested in open court at a full trial.\n\"We are carefully considering the judgment's contents and will decide in due course whether to lodge an appeal.\" \nLawyers for ANL had claimed Meghan wrote the letter \"with a view to it being disclosed publicly at some future point\" in order to \"defend her against charges of being an uncaring or unloving daughter\".\nDuring a remote hearing in January, Mr Markle said in a witness statement he had wanted the letter published to \"set the record straight\" about his relationship with his daughter - a claim one of Meghan's lawyers described as \"ridiculous\".\nThis is a thumping victory for Meghan. \nThe court dismissed Associated Newspapers' defence on privacy and copyright; the only ongoing dispute is about whose copyright has been breached, as there is some argument over whether it was just the duchess that wrote the letter or whether she had some assistance. \nSo is Meghan and Harry's long struggle with sections of the British media now finished? Harry has settled his case against the Mail on Sunday; Meghan has won hers. \nIt seems unlikely. The couple have instructed their UK spokespeople not to talk to the country's most popular newspapers. They clearly think they simply can't get a fair hearing. \nAnd the coverage they receive is pretty critical; baiting the couple over their new lives in California is now something of a routine.\nTo the couple it may well be immaterial. Their lives are elsewhere now.  \nBut their relationship with the British public is still, largely, mediated by newspapers they will not deal with and which take delight in doing them down. \nThe couple have won - but they have also lost.\nMedia lawyer Mark Stephens said he envisages the newspaper publisher will seek to go to the Court of Appeal \"to have a more definitive ruling on what the law is going forward\".\n\"If you can't effectively report on leaked letters then in those circumstances the media holding people to account is going to be hampered,\" he said. \n\"Essentially this judgement in its widest context puts manacles on the media.\"\nMeghan is seeking damages for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act over five articles published in February 2019, which included extracts from the letter.\nThe judge made two rulings on the case for copyright infringement. \nHe found the publication of the letter infringed the duchess's copyright. But he said the issue of whether Meghan was \"the sole author\" of the letter or Jason Knauf, former communications secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, was a \"co-author\" should be determined at a trial.\nThe data protection claim was not considered at the hearing in January and is still outstanding.\nHowever, Mr Stephens said that by winning her privacy claim Meghan could say she had been \"vindicated\" and he expected she would drop the other parts of the case \"as soon as she can\". \nThe full trial of the duchess's claim had been due to be heard at the High Court in January, but last year the case was adjourned until autumn 2021 for a \"confidential\" reason. \nWhen his wife first began her legal action against the Mail on Sunday, the Duke of Sussex spoke about the \"painful\" impact of the \"ruthless\" press campaign against her. \n\"I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces,\" he said in a statement at the time. \nReferring to his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, Prince Harry said his \"deepest fear is history repeating itself\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": " The rate at which coronavirus infection is falling in the UK - as measured by the R number - has continued to level off. \nThe latest R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sage, is between 0.7 and 0.9, up slightly from the week before.\nIt means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine other people.\nThe R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. \nR is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average.\nMeasles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity. \nThat means, on average, one person will spread measles to 15 others. \nCoronavirus - known officially as Sars-CoV-2 - would have a reproduction number of about three if no action was taken to stop it spreading.\nYou can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards.  \nData - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading. \nIf the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases keeps increasing.\nBut if the R number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, because not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.\nGovernments everywhere want to force the R number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one.\nThe R number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes or as immunity develops. \nMathematical modellers at Imperial College London attempted to track how the number changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced in spring of 2020. \nBefore any measures came in, the R number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one. \nAlthough the R number across the UK is now between 0.7 and 0.9, there are regional differences.\nScotland's estimated R number is between 0.8 and 1.0, up slightly on the previous week.\nIn Wales the number is between 0.6 and 0.9 - while in Northern Ireland it remains between 0.75 and 0.95.\nIn England, the number is risen slightly to between 0.8 and 1.0.\nThe R number is one of the big three.\nAnother is severity - some people have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems. But coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly. \nThe last is the number of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases.\nA vaccination programme, like the one currently under way in the UK, is another way to bring down the reproduction number.\nA coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one."

      "text": "England's rules on quarantine hotels for travellers arriving from Covid \"red list\" countries are less stringent than those enforced in Australia. \nThe BBC has seen a copy of the government's official requirements for hotel operators ahead of the policy starting on Monday.\nIt spells out the rules for handling travellers for 11 nights of quarantine.\nThe UK government said its hotel quarantine measures were \"in line with those in other countries\".\nAnd it promised to update guidance for hotels \"imminently\".\nAustralia's system, introduced early last year, is seen as among the best internationally.\nBut as a result of repeated outbreaks among staff and guests, and the arrival of new variants, the rules in Australia have been tightened and are under review again.  \nIt comes as the Australian state of Victoria enters a five-day \"circuit breaker\" lockdown in a bid to suppress an outbreak linked to its hotel quarantine system.\nUK Home Office minister Victoria Atkins said the system being introduced was \"very strong\" and its \"standards are amongst the strongest in the world\". \n\"We keep these measures under review,\" she added.\nIn Australia, people staying in quarantine hotels are not allowed to leave their rooms. \nThis follows incidents in the early months of the pandemic when security guards and hotel guests were seen to mingle, and were blamed for spreading the virus. \nOne of these outbreaks led to a surge in cases that forced Melbourne into a five-month lockdown.  \nHowever the authorities in England have issued a conflicting array of messages about policy on this, with No 10 and the Department of Health and Social Care forced to issue several clarifications.\nThe upshot is that travellers will be allowed out of their rooms for a limited set of exemptions, including exercise.\nSmoking, which at one stage had been described as a legitimate reason for going outside, will not qualify.\nIn New Zealand, smoking breaks are allowed, under escort, but with strict guidance not to get close to anyone else.\nPolicy on this changed in Australia after the risks of meal service became apparent.\nA woman from Singapore who tested negative during most of her stay became infected with the same variant of coronavirus found in a family of five from Nigeria in the room opposite.\nThere's no definitive explanation for how she caught the virus but one suggestion is that the doors of both rooms were opened at the same time to collect meals. \nOfficials say the viral load in the air in the family's room - with all five of them being infected - could have meant that the virus was carried through the air across the corridor.\nIt's one reason why hotel staff now deliver meals at staggered times to avoid everyone opening their doors at the same time. \nThe UK guidance states that room service will be \"undertaken in full compliance of Covid-19 prevention best practice\". \nThe government said meals would be served three times per day, but did not comment on specific timings.\nThere is growing evidence of the risks of the virus being transmitted through the air either between rooms or between rooms and public areas such as corridors.\nA security guard who spent the day on duty in a corridor caught the virus despite having no contact with anyone. \nA widely-held assumption is that infectious aerosols had accumulated in the air in this poorly-ventilated space and had led to his infection.\nIn the state of Victoria, hotel staff now have to be equipped with a type of mask known as an N95, roughly equivalent to what is called an FFP2 in the UK. \nBy contrast, the document issued to UK hotels spells out that standard surgical masks must be worn - these are thinner and are thought to be less effective at blocking aerosols.\nIt also says that if emergency maintenance is needed before a room has been disinfected and left vacant for 72 hours, staff should wear PPE that is \"consistent with droplet precautions\".\nDroplets are produced by coughs and heavy exhalations and are generally judged to be a risk over a distance of up to two metres.\nThere is no specific guidance on the protection needed to guard against aerosols that can linger in the air. \nProf Nancy Baxter, of the University of Melbourne, is among scientists pushing for hotel staff to be better equipped.\n\"I truly believe that if you're putting workers in harm's way, which essentially you are, by putting them in a quarantine hotel, and exposing them to people potentially with Covid-19, that there's a duty of care that those people have the highest possible protection from infection.\"\nFollowing infections among hotel staff in Australia, and amid fears of the new variants, all employees are tested for coronavirus every day.\nThat includes days off, with a requirement that staff are paid for those days. \nHowever, the UK document does not suggest any provision for regular testing.\nEngland's Department of Health said plans for a \"bespoke service\" for staff testing were being developed but it could not confirm whether it would be ready for the start of the policy on Monday. \nThe government added that all staff working in England's quarantine hotels would be provided with regular testing and appropriate personal protective equipment.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We have taken decisive action at the border and every essential check from pre-departure testing, to the passenger locator form and the suspension of travel routes strengthens our borders and prevents the spread coronavirus into the UK.\"\nMinisters have said they have \"shared expertise\" with the Australian government about quarantine, but questions will be raised about whether the lessons learned are being followed.

      "tags": "Michael Gove,Arlene Foster,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "The UK and the EU have had a \"frank but constructive discussion\" on problems implementing post-Brexit trade rules in Northern Ireland.\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove met the vice-president of the European Commission, Maros Sefcovic, in London on Thursday evening. \nBoth sides reiterated their \"full commitment\" to the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol.\nBut they pledged to meet again to \"address all outstanding issues\".\nMr Gove had previously called for an urgent \"reset\" on the arrangements, which see checks taking place between Northern Ireland and Great Britain - calling for a two-year \"grace period\" on the rules.\nBut the Irish Taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin, said any pause in enforcement could only be a matter of months, telling the BBC: \"It can't be a year.\" \nWriting to Mr Gove ahead of the meeting, Mr Sefcovic said the existing protocol was \"the only way\" to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \nHowever, Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster - who wants the protocol scrapped - said \"more rigorous implementation\" was \"not going to work\".\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol was designed to ensure an open border remained on the island of Ireland after Brexit.\nBut to make it work, the two sides agreed that Northern Ireland would remain in the single market for goods, unlike the rest of the UK. \nThis meant checks had to be introduced on some goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nSince the new rules came into force, there has been tensions at ports in Northern Ireland, with disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries.\nChecks at some ports were temporarily suspended at the beginning of February over \"sinister\" threats made to some border staff who were carrying out checks on goods.\nUnionists want the protocol to be scrapped because they say it damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK union.\nDUP leader Mrs Foster accused Mr Sefcovic of having his \"head in the sand\" over the issues, and called for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to \"step up\" to sort out the issues.\nBut the EU has stood by this part of the post-Brexit trade agreement, finalised in December and coming into force on New Year's Day.\nIn a joint statement after their meeting, Mr Gove and Mr Sefcovic reiterated their \"full commitment\" to the Good Friday Agreement and to the \"proper implementation\" of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThey said this was necessary to ensure stability, prevent a hard border and \"impact as little as possible on the everyday life\" of people living on the island of Ireland.\nThe statement also said they had \"taken in to account\" the views expressed by both the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland.\nIt is understood Mr Gove and Mr Sefcovic will hold a virtual meeting with Northern Ireland business leaders next week, before further discussions on 24 February. \nIrish Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, described the meeting as \"a good day's work\". \nIn a tweet, he said the \"focus now\" was on \"cooperation to implement what's been agreed in the protocol... and to work on solutions to outstanding issues\".\nSinn Fein's deputy first minister Michelle O'Neill said she welcomed the two sides' commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and implementation of the protocol \"protecting the gains of peace, and avoiding a hard border in Ireland\".\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood told the BBC that the language of the statement was \"more constructive\", but Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said the protocol was \"breaking\" Northern Ireland's links with Great Britain, which \"shouldn't be allowed to happen\"."

      "text": "All Piers says he wants to do is go to school every day. He does not even want a holiday -  just school, school and more school.\nBut Piers, who lives with a form of autism, has not been able to finish the final year of his maths GCSE full-time in the classroom with his friends and teachers because of lockdown.\n\"I really love school,\" said the 18-year-old. \"It's my favourite thing.\"\nBut Piers, like some of his friends, has only been in class one day a week.\nThe head teacher at his south Wales school, for children with special educational needs, says that while missing large parts of their education has the \"biggest impact\" on children with additional needs, school is a \"safety net\" for both pupils and their families.\nAnd how Piers, who also has learning difficulties and sensory issues, has missed being in the classroom and around familiar faces.\n\"I don't want a holiday at all this year,\" he said.\n\"I just wanted to go to school every day. I only get to do one day a week as it is my final year.\"\nHe has struggled with home-schooling because of his \"sleeping issues\" - and the strict lockdowns in Wales have not just affected Piers' education but his mood too.\n\"I'm not able to go out and my mental health is deteriorating,\" said Piers, who lives in Monmouth.\n\"I've been very upset and sobbing every day. I've a sweet tooth and wanting to eat lots of chocolate.\n\"I love going to school because it is learning - you are made to do work - because when I'm at home I want to sleep all of the time. I'd rather be kept on my toes and be busy.\"\nPiers' story is one of how a student with additional educational needs is dealing with the uncertain challenges of a global health emergency.\n\"School for some of our children is the safety net, not only for the children but for the families,\" said Bethan Moore, acting head of Crownbridge Special School in Cwmbran.\n\"Sometimes it's just a bit of respite for the children to come to school.\"\nAbout 20 of Crownbridge's 116 pupils have been going into school during lockdown while the rest remain at home and have been offered remote learning.\n\"It was kind of annoying at first, with the mask and because of Covid you can't do things,\" added Piers' school friend Amy, 19, who is also studying for a GCSE in maths.\n\"But I haven't found it that bad as we've done some fun things.\"\nAmy's mum Caroline, from Monmouth, said her daughter, who has autism, \"thrived\" in school as it \"brings out the best in her\".\n\"Since lockdown it has been particularly difficult,\" she said.\n\"But the school has made great efforts to engage with Amy at home and in school which is really important because Amy needs that routine, the teachers have made it fun.\n\"The online learning experience is new but it has taught her some new skills so the blended-learning approach has been positive.\"\nCrownbridge, like all schools across the UK, has had to rapidly adapt to challenge of continuing education and mitigating the risks of Covid-19.\n\"Our teacher will send learning packs home each week with targets,\" said teaching assistant Megan Israel.\n\"The parents then send the work back and we put it in the children's folders to ensure the children are not missing out.\"\nThe \"blended learning approach\" is also applied to physio and exercise targets for pupils with more acute and physical needs.\nBut Ms Israel said it was important some pupils could attend school to use the specialist equipment \"to meet their needs\".\nTeachers have worked closely with physiotherapists and speech and language therapists to ensure support is provided to families at home.\n\"We are concerned about the dip in their progress,\" added Ms Moore.\n\"But as far as Crownbridge concerned, we've been really good at working as a tight team, providing support for pupils and families who are blended learning at home.\"\nWelsh Government guidance on Covid measures allows for \"a practical and flexible approach\" for children with special educational needs.\nThe school has established small contact groups and intensified cleaning on site and some facilities are shut, like their hydro pool or the hall where pupils would undergo physiotherapy.\nSocial distancing, masks and other coronavirus prevention measures can be more difficult to implement in schools like Crownbridge where many children have difficulty communicating and need physical interaction.\nStaff wear face coverings around the school but Ms Moore says it becomes more difficult when they interact with the children \"who rely on the mouth and the speech and language to communicate\". \nThe Welsh Government has pledged to vaccinate special school staff who provide intimate personal care for children - and Crownbridge's staff are waiting for their Covid jabs.\nWhile there are limited numbers of children coming into school, they also provide opportunities for their pupils to learn from home, whatever their needs.\nTeacher Bethan Stokes has teenagers Elliot and Shay in class doing some sensory maths by singing a song about numbers and asking them to use a fly swat to splat piles of cream with different amounts of cherries on the top.\nAfter the excitement of making a mess in the classroom, they go to the sensory room to let off some steam.\n\"We try to keep it as normal as possible,\" said Ms Stokes.\n\"It's really difficult because obviously the children know things aren't normal because of the circumstances. I'm so proud of how they're coping.\""

      "tags": "Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Levels of Covid are going down in all nations of the UK, figures from the Office for National Statistics show. \nThe data is more evidence lockdown is controlling the virus, even with the more infectious variants circulating - although the health secretary said there is \"still a long way to go\".\nThe latest R number, estimated to be between 0.7 and 0.9, also suggests infection numbers are shrinking. \nThis is the first time since July that R has been this low.\nIt means, on average, every 10 people infected pass it on to between seven and nine other people.\nExperts warn that infection levels remain high, however. \nIt comes as 15,144 new cases were recorded in the UK, as well as 758 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government figures. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the ONS figures were \"clearly good news\", but pointed out there were still more than 24,000 people in hospital with Covid.\nHe said: \"Everyone can have confidence that the plan is working, that what we're collectively doing is having a positive impact but there's still a long way to go.\"\nIt is not clear yet when lockdown will begin to be lifted. Scientists advising government say the lower the cases can get, the better. Unlocking too soon risks another surge of the virus, even though more people are being vaccinated against the disease every day. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will outline plans for easing any restrictions in the week of 22 February. \nGetting schools back will be the immediate priority, the government says.\nThe PM's official spokesman did not rule out the possibility of social distancing being maintained until the autumn, saying: \"The latest data and evidence clearly shows that we remain in a difficult situation with the pressure on the NHS still very significant.\n\"We will set out a gradual and phased approach towards easing the restrictions in a sustainable way.\"\nThe ONS figures, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, suggest:\nLondon continues to have the highest proportion of people likely to test positive for coronavirus in any region of England, with around one in 60 estimated to have had Covid-19 in the week up to 6 February.\nThe ONS's data is slightly out of date - covering the week up to 6 February - so may not reflect the situation right now.\nSenior Statistician Sarah Crofts said:  \"Rates of infection remain high but have continued to decrease in England and across the UK.\n\"The percentage of positive cases compatible with the new UK variant also continues to decrease in all regions of England except for Yorkshire and The Humber, the East Midlands and the South West where trends remain uncertain.\"\nThe evidence is clear - lockdown is having the desired effect of controlling the virus, bringing the number of new infections down. \nIt is very welcome news, but does it mean we can now safely start to lift some restrictions? Not quite yet, say experts.\nAs one explained, it's a bit like when a relative has been very ill in hospital and you hear that they are getting better - it's wonderful, but it doesn't mean that the \"treatment\" can stop or that things can't take a turn for the worse.\nThere is still plenty of the virus circulating that people could catch. \nAnd although the vaccine rollout is going really well, there are lots of people in the UK who are not yet protected and who could fall serious ill with Covid-19 if they become infected. \nMeanwhile, more than 14 million people in the UK have had at least their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. \nThe government's pledge is to offer a vaccine to around 15 million people in the top four priority groups - which includes people over 70, health and social care workers and people who are extremely clinically vulnerable and shielding - by Monday 15 February. \nIn a video message, the prime minister said the government appeared to be \"on target\" to meet the pledge - adding the latest figures on vaccinations highlighted an \"incredible national effort\" by NHS staff, Army personnel and volunteers.\nWales says it has already achieved this. England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to announce the same soon. \nThe 14 million figure includes some people outside of these initial groups. \nSome regions of the UK have begun inviting groups planned to be reached later in the month, such as the over-60s and people aged 16-64 with underlying health conditions."

      "text": "The UK economy is like a \"coiled spring\" ready to release large amounts of \"pent-up financial energy\", the Bank of England's chief economist has said. \nAndy Haldane said consumer confidence would surge back thanks to the vaccine programme, with the economy firing \"on all cylinders\" by spring. \nHe is the latest economist to forecast a sharp rebound in growth after an expected easing of restrictions.\nThe economy is currently set to shrink 4.2% in the first three months of 2021.\nWriting in the Daily Mail, Mr Haldane said: \"With 13 million of the most vulnerable people already vaccinated, the risk of death or hospitalisation in the UK has already probably halved.\n\"By the end of March, based on the current pace of vaccine rollout and government data on vulnerable groups, this risk may have been reduced by as much as three-quarters and by the end of the second quarter it will be even smaller.\"\nAs a result, he said health concerns would fall and restrictions lift, allowing people to return to spending and socialising.\nThe turn in sentiment was likely to be rapid, he added - \"a light-switch being flicked rather than a dimmer-switch being turned\".\n\"Having been bottled in for a year, most people are desperate to get their lives, including their social lives, back.\n\"When given the opportunity to do so safely, they will seize it,\" he said. \nHe said shared social experiences - from pubs to sports to cinema - would benefit, as glimpsed last summer during the Eat Out to Help Out scheme.\nAnd unlike past recessions, he added, many UK households had strengthened their finances during lockdown and would have more money to spend. \n\"That might mean two pub, cinema or restaurant visits a week rather than one,\" he said.\n\"It might mean a higher-spec TV or car or house.\"\nOn top of this he said a significant number of companies had amassed cash during the crisis, which would likely be invested as restrictions started to ease.\n\"That would be good news for jobs, helping to recover some of the million lost so far in this crisis,\" Mr Haldane wrote.\n\"And it would be good news for business investment too, helping companies boost their performance and productivity - and, ultimately, the pay of their workers.\"\nWith continued government support added to the mix, he said a strong bounce-back was assured.\n\"The economy is poised like a coiled spring. As its energies are released, the recovery should be one to remember after a year to forget.\""

There will be some people who chose not to have a vaccine when they were first offered it, who may have changed their minds.\"\nMr Drakeford said the NHS was \"checking and rechecking\" whether anyone had been left out and final appointments were being arranged for the weekend.\n\"Anybody who knows of somebody who may have missed out, it is not too late at all,\" he said.\n\"We will make sure that those people have an appointment as fast as possible.\"\nHealth minister Vaughan Gething said \"a leave no-one behind approach\" was being taken. \n\"The next group, those people 65 and over, all health boards are already sending out invites for those people to come forward as well,\" he said. \n\"We're not looking to miss a step, we're carrying on with the vaccine we have available.\"\nThe top four priority groups include:\nFigures show 88.4% of those aged 80 or older have had a first dose, compared to 86.3% for 75 to 79 year olds and 79.8% of 70 to 74 year olds.\nPublic Health Wales said a total of 80.3% of care home residents have had a first dose, and 83.5% of care home workers.\nBritish Medical Association chairman Dr David Bailey said Wales was \"hopefully on the home straight\".\nHe told BBC Radio Wales: \"People are really making an effort to make the thing go smoothly as possible, and it is a credit to the Welsh public, as well as everyone who has actually been delivering the vaccine, because it has gone smoothly and everyone has been trying to do their part.\"\nMr Drakeford said: \"To have achieved this first milestone and offered vaccination to everyone in the first four priority groups - those who are most vulnerable to coronavirus - is a truly phenomenal effort. \n\"Of course, the hard work has only just begun - there are many, many more people to vaccinate yet and a lot of second doses still to give.\"\nWelsh Conservative's Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies called the milestone a \"true British and Welsh success story\".\nHe said it showed the UK Government had \"ensured Wales has had the vaccines available to protect the most vulnerable in our society and meet this target\" and hoped Wales could soon reopen its economy.\nHowever he added there was a still a \"long way to go\" with 80% of the population yet to be offered the vaccine.\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesperson Rhun ap Iorwerth, said it was thanks to NHS staff and volunteers \"that Wales has been able to accelerate the vaccination effort to its current levels\".\nMr ap Iorwerth added his party would continue to call for \"those in all care settings, not just the elderly, to be vaccinated as a matter of priority, and for key workers in schools, the emergency services and public transport to be brought in to the priority system sooner.\""

      "tags": "Television,Jacqueline Wilson",
      "text": "Tracy Beaker has returned to screens as an adult, reigniting her feud with her nemesis Justine Littlewood.\nMy Mum Tracy Beaker sees Dani Harmer return, 19 years after she first played the fiery role created by children's author Dame Jacqueline Wilson.\nIn the new three-part CBBC series, which began on Friday, Tracy has a 10-year-old daughter called Jess and comes up against her childhood enemy Justine.\nHarmer said fans would be pleased with the \"great\" mother Beaker has become.\n\"They're very different - Jess is quiet, she's really good at school, she loves reading, whereas Tracy obviously wasn't any one of those things,\" said the actress, now 32.\nThe original book, The Story of Tracy Beaker, published in 1991, sold more than a million copies and launched a string of stories that followed Tracy's life in foster care and made Dame Jacqueline a household name.\nTold through a series of diary entries by the title character as she forever waited for her mum to visit, they introduced young audiences to the tensions of life as a child in a foster home (or, as Beaker called it, the \"dumping ground\").\nThe books inspired the popular CBBC show, beginning with the original adaptation in 2002. Harmer last played Beaker in three series of Tracy Beaker Returns, which ran from 2010 to 2012.\nMy Mum Tracy Beaker, adapted from Dame Jacqueline's 2018 sequel, now finds the title character in her thirties, with Jess, played by Emma Maggie Davies.\nTheir lives are drastically changed following the arrival of Tracy's new boyfriend Sean Godfrey, played by Jordan Duvigneau.\nThe series also features a host of familiar characters, including Montanna Thompson returning as Justine to revive her foster care rivalry with Beaker.\nLisa Coleman is again cast as her step mother Camilla 'Cam' Lawson, alongside Bridgerton star Ruth Gemmell as Tracy's birth mother Carly Beaker.\nA 30-second teaser posted on social media by Harmer on Tuesday - showing Tracy coming face-to-face with her old foe - went viral.\nAnd the first episode was hotly anticipated among fans of the original series, many of whom are now much older than the target audience for CBBC.\nIt was warmly received, with the Evening Standard saying the reboot was cleverly \"calibrated to win over kids and nostalgic adults alike\".\n\"The original CBBC show dealt with weighty issues with a light touch, and never swamped its young viewers... just like Wilson's books,\" wrote the paper's critic Kate Rosseinsky in her four-star review.\n\"Writer Emma Reeves, who has worked on episodes of every Beaker series, has taken a similar approach with this adaptation. The result is a deeply compassionate drama that's uplifting, funny and never saccharine. It handles its heartbreaking moments as confidently as its heartwarming ones.\"\nIn the Radio Times, Lauren Morris wrote that Tracy and Justine had given viewers another taste of their \"entertaining rivalry and memorable tiffs\".\nShe wrote: \"My Mum Tracy Beaker takes their bitter feud to all new satisfying heights...\n\"While no-one would have thought Tracy Beaker and Justine Littlewood's reunion would be a cultural event we'd get out of this year, it's arguably the TV moment we needed during the pandemic.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "A serial sex offender has been found guilty of raping and murdering a student before dumping her body in a river.\nPawel Relowicz, 26, prowled the streets of Hull before attacking \"vulnerable\" 21-year-old Libby Squire.\nJurors heard Relowicz had committed a string of offences against women prior to the killing.\nSpeaking outside Sheffield Crown Court, Libby's mother paid tribute to her \"beautiful, caring, wonderful girl\".\nDuring the trial, prosecutor Richard Wright QC said Relowicz had spent the night of 31 January 2019 driving around looking for a woman to attack.\nJurors heard University of Hull philosophy student Ms Squire, who had been turned away from a nightclub, was drunk and \"extremely vulnerable\" when Relowicz \"intercepted\" her .\nHe drove her to Oak Road playing fields, where he attacked her before putting her in the River Hull.\nProsecutors said the married father-of-two had repeatedly lied to police, his wife and in court documents about what happened on the night of Ms Squire's disappearance.\nHe maintained he had consensual sex with the student and said he had lied because he did not want his wife to find out he had cheated on her.\nAfter a massive search effort, Ms Squire's remains were found in the Humber Estuary almost two months later.\nHer parents, Lisa and Russ, held hands and cried as they sat in the public gallery overlooking the courtroom to await the verdicts.\nSpeaking outside court, Mrs Squire thanked supporters but said Relowicz's conviction \"changes nothing for us, there is no closure\".\n\"We don't get to have Libby back and our lives don't revert back to normal,\" she said.\n\"Libby will always be with us and we are all so proud of our beautiful, caring, wonderful girl.\n\"And, although she has been physically taken from us, the memories we have and the love we share will never be.\"\nPolish national Relowicz, a butcher, showed no emotion as the jury foreman read out the verdicts. He will be sentenced on Friday.\nJurors found him guilty of rape unanimously and guilty of murder by a majority verdict of 11 to one.\nPathologists were unable to establish how she died, or whether she was still alive when she went into the water. \nWitnesses reported hearing screams from the playing fields on the night she disappeared.\nGerry Wareham, from the Crown Prosecution Service said CCTV footage of Relowicz and Ms Squire's last known movements was \"crucial evidence\" in bringing the case to court.\nDuring the 14-day trial, the jury of seven women and five men heard Relowicz had previous convictions for voyeurism, performing sex acts in public and stealing sex toys and underwear from women's homes.\nOne of his previous voyeurism victims told the BBC she hoped the police would learn from the case.\nShe said his earlier offences were \"sufficiently minor\" by themselves \"to not actually require the level of investigation that would result in him being caught\". \nIn a statement, Humberside Police said it was \"satisfied\" with its investigation and that officers \"acted quickly\" to identify, locate and apprehend the defendant within days of Ms Squire's disappearance.\nDet Supt Martin Smalley said: \"I can understand that people are interested to know whether Libby's tragic death could have been prevented.  \n\"It is important to remember that whilst, taken as a whole, and with the benefit of hindsight, we may be able to point to a history of offending by Pawel Relowicz, officers investigating these offences at the time were doing so with far less information than we have now and that my investigation into Libby's disappearance had.\"\nThe University of Hull said it would continue to offer support to the student community.\nVice-Chancellor Prof Susan Lea said in a statement: \"What took place in February 2019 deeply affected everyone at the university and those within the local community. \n\"Libby made a huge impact during her time at Hull, and will be remembered fondly by all who met her.\"\nShe said the \"kindness and care shown by everyone was overwhelming\" both at the university and in the wider community.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

      "title": "Help to Buy deadline extended amid Covid delays",
      "tags": "Personal finance,Housing market,Mortgages",
      "text": "A deadline to buy a home under the current Help to Buy scheme in England has been extended to the end of May.\nCovid-related delays meant more than 16,000 sales were at risk, with buyers facing large bills were purchases to fall through at the last minute.\nConstruction of newly-built homes, which qualify for the scheme, have been put back by as much as eight months.\nSome buyers are worried that the new, two-month extended deadline will still come too soon.\nIn seven years, the Help to Buy equity loan scheme has allowed 278,000 households to receive an advance from the government to help pay the deposit to buy a newly-built home.\nThe scheme, in its current form, is coming to an end in England. However, data from Homes England obtained through a BBC Freedom of Information request showed that, as of the end of January, there were 16,691 sales still to be completed under the current scheme. \nIn many cases, construction workers have needed to self-isolate, supply lines have slowed, overseas labour may have needed to quarantine, and some traders have been furloughed.\nBuyers face losing thousands of pounds if their properties are not built in time.\nThe government's extension to the deadline - the latest of three - gives homebuilders an extra two months to complete developments. It means that purchases can be completed by the end of May.\n\"This measure provides certainty to developers to build out homes delayed and further protects customers whose purchases have been delayed by Covid-19,\" a spokesman for Homes England said.\nHe added the move was aimed to ensure \"those buying a home through the scheme are not disadvantaged by circumstances beyond their control\". \nGreg Saunders, 31, who is buying with his boyfriend David Leith, 36, told the BBC in January that their purchase was in doubt owing to the delays.\nMr Saunders said no blame was attached to the builders who had done their best in the circumstances caused by the pandemic - but missing the deadline would have ruined their hopes of a new dream home and cost them about \u00a32,000 in solicitor fees.\nNow, following the government's latest announcement, he said: \"It's a huge relief. It has helped me and my partner and so many other people. \n\"This is great news and it is good that the government is listening but this still won't help everyone. I don't think the extension until the end of May quite reflects the true scale of the delays facing developers at the moment.\"\nAndrew Montlake, managing director at Coreco mortgage brokers, said: \"While Homes England have told developers there will be no more extensions, this should give builders some much needed breathing space to fully complete the property and ensure that their buyers do not miss out.\n\"It will be interesting to see whether or not this extension sets the scene for something similar to happen with the stamp duty holiday.\"\nThe Help to Buy scheme, in its current form, is coming to an end in England and is being replaced by a less generous version restricted to first-time buyers which starts for new applicants at the beginning in April.\nStefanie Weingarth, 29, and Carl Young, 32, had agreed in October to buy a house near Didcot in Oxfordshire, with the help of a \u00a3112,000 Help to Buy loan. The house was supposed to be completed in late February - but Covid-related delays mean the build is at least six to eight weeks behind.\nMs Weingarth said: \"It's great news that the government have extended the deadline. Our developers are pretty certain they'll have our home ready in time now. We're hoping to move in mid April. It's our first family home and we wouldn't be able to afford it without the current Help to Buy scheme.\"\nShe already owns a property, so the couple would be ineligible for the new scheme which is restricted to first-time buyers.\nThe only sticking point now is that the couple will not be able to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday, one of the reasons they decided to buy together in the first place. The tax break deadline is the end of March. As their property will not be ready until April, they now face the prospect of trying to find an extra \u00a315,000 for stamp duty.\n\"It seems unfair for the government to acknowledge that there are construction days, so extend Help to Buy, but not extend stamp duty for us,\" said Ms Weingarth."

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Portmeirion,Welsh government,Wales economy,Llandudno,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "\"Cautious\" talks about Wales' tourist industry reopening in time for Easter have started, the first minister said.\nBut Mark Drakeford said the sector - which supports 10% of the Welsh workforce or 120,000 jobs - would not be opened \"in one go\".\nAlthough he did not rule it out, Mr Drakeford also suggested it was unlikely pubs and restaurants would be open at the start of April.\nHe said a revised plan out of lockdown would be published \"within days\". \nThe Welsh Conservatives have called on the Welsh Government to \"develop a plan for a best-case scenario\".\nMr Drakeford said ministers were talking to the Welsh tourist industry, worth \u00a36.3bn to the Welsh economy, \"about what might be possible around the Easter period\".\nWales' lockdown is set to be reviewed on 19 February and the first minister said it was all \"very much caveated\" and dependant on Covid infection rates and variants of the virus.\nMr Drakeford said if progress against Covid continued, the authorities could \"slowly and cautiously\" lift restrictions in the run-up to spring and Easter \"in all aspects of our lives\".\nCurrently, all indoor and outdoor events are cancelled and visitor attractions, non-essential shops, hospitality businesses and holiday accommodation are shut.\nThree to seven-year-old children will be able to return to school in Wales from 22 February, along with some older children on vocational courses.\nThe potential phased reopening of schools for the remainder of primary age children and college students will be the priority at the next three-week Covid lockdown review - and Mr Drakeford said there would only be room for some other \"modest\" changes at most.\nAsked whether the return of more pupils to face-to-face teaching would be his government's priority for the following review on 12 March, the first minister said \"schools will remain our top priority\" if there was \"further headroom available to us\".\n\"But, of course, there are other things we know that matter a great deal to people and if we were in a position safely to do anything else to lift the restrictions that is what we would do,\" Mr Drakeford added.\nThe first minister said he \"absolutely\" understood the need to give the tourism industry \"some forward notice\" if a partial reopening was allowed for the Easter break.\nBut he said: \"Nobody should think that what we're talking about here is the wholesale reopening of the tourist industry in one go.\"\nAsked if that meant it was unlikely pubs and restaurants would also be open at Easter, Mr Drakeford said: \"I don't want to rule things out quite in that way. \n\"The way we'll have to do it will be step by step, using what headroom we have, never doing too many things that put us back in danger.\n\"It will not be safe to lift restrictions over too many things all at once. That means prioritising things.\"\nThe first minister said the Welsh Government's \"cautious approach\" would likely focus on the reopening of self-contained holiday accommodation in the first instance.\nMr Drakeford said\u00a0anyone\u00a0booking a holiday should do so \"knowing the\u00a0uncertain world that we are living in and that there are no guarantees\".\nThe chair of the Wales Tourism Alliance called on the UK and Welsh governments to work together as \"80% of our tourism market is across the border in England\".\nAndrew Campbell said there was an \"awful lot of planning\" needed before reopening as \"you don't just turn a switch on\".\n\"There's always been cautious optimism that we could get going again in April, but Easter would be simply wonderful,\" he told BBC Radio Wales\n\"If we go and open and England are still in lockdown that will cause problems - we need to have those discussions,\" Mr Campbell added.\nLynette Esposito, owner of the Elm Tree hotel in Llandudno, said she felt \"optimistic\" after the first minister's comments.\nBut she said coming out of lockdown for Welsh businesses should be \"aligned with England\" as that accounted for \"the bulk of their business\".\n\"I think in terms of a timeline it is critical we are being given sufficient time, for us to be able to get the place cleaned up and start trade,\" she said.\nShe added she thought it would be useful for hospitality staff to get \"some advantage as to getting a vaccine\" as they would be \"frontline people reopening the economy\".\nMs Esposito said they had been seeing a \"substantial number of new inquiries\" from people who had never visited Wales before.\n\"There is no doubt there is demand out there, but people are still cautious,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, the Three Cliffs Holiday Park in the Gower has seen a surge in bookings after the first minister's \"positive outlook for this summer\".\n\"It's lovely to have so much enthusiasm,\" said owner Tom Beynon.\nWell, a number of figures need to continue fall - namely average case rates, test positivity rates and Covid hospital patient numbers.\nWales currently has the lowest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK, with a seven-day average of 102 cases per 100,000 - a dramatic fall from before Christmas, where it had the highest in the UK with 603.\nThe number of hospital patients in Wales was at record levels at the start of January - now it is at its lowest daily average since 20 December.\nCovid positivity rate in Wales now stands at 8.7% - its lowest point since 8 October.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the proportion of positive tests should be no more than 5% before areas come out of restrictions.\nThe Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (Tac) has issued a warning of the need for continued vigilance.\nIn its latest report it said if restrictions were lifted \"too early or too quickly\", there was a \"high likelihood of returning to current levels of infections and hospitalisations in those scenarios\".\nIt said the reproduction (R) number continues to be within the range of between 0.7 and 0.9 - it has been within this range for a few weeks and is down from the period just after Christmas when it was between 0.8 and 1.1.\nIt means for every 10 people with the virus in Wales about seven people would become infected.\nAndrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, called on the Welsh Government to \"develop a plan for a best-case scenario\".\nHe said: \"As we hit these important vaccination milestones and with the latest review due at the end of next week, it's important ministers now devise a roadmap out of lockdown, providing timescales where possible and appropriate for schools, families, workers and businesses.\"\nWales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said any easing would not happen quickly, adding: \"What we don't want to do is have a rapid opening up and a rapid resurgence of the virus.\"\nOn Thursday, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was \"too early\" to know whether summer holidays could go ahead, prompting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to urge the UK Government to \"get rid of the mixed messages\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce a \"gradual and phased\" plan out of lockdown for England on 22 February.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said restrictions will remain for \"at least\" the rest of the month\"."

      "tags": "Michael Gove,Arlene Foster,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "The UK and the EU have had a \"frank but constructive discussion\" on problems implementing post-Brexit trade rules in Northern Ireland.\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove met the vice-president of the European Commission, Maros Sefcovic, in London on Thursday evening. \nBoth sides reiterated their \"full commitment\" to the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol.\nBut they pledged to meet again to \"address all outstanding issues\".\nMr Gove had previously called for an urgent \"reset\" on the arrangements, which see checks taking place between Northern Ireland and Great Britain - calling for a two-year \"grace period\" on the rules.\nBut the Irish Taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin, said any pause in enforcement could only be a matter of months, telling the BBC: \"It can't be a year.\" \nWriting to Mr Gove ahead of the meeting, Mr Sefcovic said the existing protocol was \"the only way\" to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \nHowever, Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster - who wants the protocol scrapped - said \"more rigorous implementation\" was \"not going to work\".\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol was designed to ensure an open border remained on the island of Ireland after Brexit.\nBut to make it work, the two sides agreed that Northern Ireland would remain in the single market for goods, unlike the rest of the UK. \nThis meant checks had to be introduced on some goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nSince the new rules came into force, there has been tensions at ports in Northern Ireland, with disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries.\nChecks at some ports were temporarily suspended at the beginning of February over \"sinister\" threats made to some border staff who were carrying out checks on goods.\nUnionists want the protocol to be scrapped because they say it damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK union.\nDUP leader Mrs Foster accused Mr Sefcovic of having his \"head in the sand\" over the issues, and called for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to \"step up\" to sort out the issues.\nBut the EU has stood by this part of the post-Brexit trade agreement, finalised in December and coming into force on New Year's Day.\nIn a joint statement after their meeting, Mr Gove and Mr Sefcovic reiterated their \"full commitment\" to the Good Friday Agreement and to the \"proper implementation\" of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThey said this was necessary to ensure stability, prevent a hard border and \"impact as little as possible on the everyday life\" of people living on the island of Ireland.\nThe statement also said they had \"taken in to account\" the views expressed by both the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland.\nIt is understood Mr Gove and Mr Sefcovic will hold a virtual meeting with Northern Ireland business leaders next week, before further discussions on 24 February. \nIrish Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, described the meeting as \"a good day's work\". \nIn a tweet, he said the \"focus now\" was on \"cooperation to implement what's been agreed in the protocol... and to work on solutions to outstanding issues\".\nSinn Fein's deputy first minister Michelle O'Neill said she welcomed the two sides' commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and implementation of the protocol \"protecting the gains of peace, and avoiding a hard border in Ireland\".\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood told the BBC that the language of the statement was \"more constructive\", but Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said the protocol was \"breaking\" Northern Ireland's links with Great Britain, which \"shouldn't be allowed to happen\"."

      "tags": "Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Levels of Covid are going down in all nations of the UK, figures from the Office for National Statistics show. \nThe data is more evidence lockdown is controlling the virus, even with the more infectious variants circulating - although the health secretary said there is \"still a long way to go\".\nThe latest R number, estimated to be between 0.7 and 0.9, also suggests infection numbers are shrinking. \nThis is the first time since July that R has been this low.\nIt means, on average, every 10 people infected pass it on to between seven and nine other people.\nExperts warn that infection levels remain high, however. \nIt comes as 15,144 new cases were recorded in the UK, as well as 758 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government figures. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the ONS figures were \"clearly good news\", but pointed out there were still more than 24,000 people in hospital with Covid.\nHe said: \"Everyone can have confidence that the plan is working, that what we're collectively doing is having a positive impact but there's still a long way to go.\"\nIt is not clear yet when lockdown will begin to be lifted. Scientists advising government say the lower the cases can get, the better. Unlocking too soon risks another surge of the virus, even though more people are being vaccinated against the disease every day. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will outline plans for easing any restrictions in the week of 22 February. \nGetting schools back will be the immediate priority, the government says.\nThe PM's official spokesman did not rule out the possibility of social distancing being maintained until the autumn, saying: \"The latest data and evidence clearly shows that we remain in a difficult situation with the pressure on the NHS still very significant.\n\"We will set out a gradual and phased approach towards easing the restrictions in a sustainable way.\"\nThe ONS figures, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, suggest:\nLondon continues to have the highest proportion of people likely to test positive for coronavirus in any region of England, with around one in 60 estimated to have had Covid-19 in the week up to 6 February.\nThe ONS's data is slightly out of date - covering the week up to 6 February - so may not reflect the situation right now.\nSenior Statistician Sarah Crofts said:  \"Rates of infection remain high but have continued to decrease in England and across the UK.\n\"The percentage of positive cases compatible with the new UK variant also continues to decrease in all regions of England except for Yorkshire and The Humber, the East Midlands and the South West where trends remain uncertain.\"\nThe evidence is clear - lockdown is having the desired effect of controlling the virus, bringing the number of new infections down. \nIt is very welcome news, but does it mean we can now safely start to lift some restrictions? Not quite yet, say experts.\nAs one explained, it's a bit like when a relative has been very ill in hospital and you hear that they are getting better - it's wonderful, but it doesn't mean that the \"treatment\" can stop or that things can't take a turn for the worse.\nThere is still plenty of the virus circulating that people could catch. \nAnd although the vaccine rollout is going really well, there are lots of people in the UK who are not yet protected and who could fall serious ill with Covid-19 if they become infected. \nMeanwhile, more than 14 million people in the UK have had at least their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. \nThe government's pledge is to offer a vaccine to around 15 million people in the top four priority groups - which includes people over 70, health and social care workers and people who are extremely clinically vulnerable and shielding - by Monday 15 February. \nIn a video message, the prime minister said the government appeared to be \"on target\" to meet the pledge - adding the latest figures on vaccinations highlighted an \"incredible national effort\" by NHS staff, Army personnel and volunteers.\nWales says it has already achieved this. England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to announce the same soon. \nThe 14 million figure includes some people outside of these initial groups. \nSome regions of the UK have begun inviting groups planned to be reached later in the month, such as the over-60s and people aged 16-64 with underlying health conditions."

      "tags": "Impeachment of Donald Trump,US Capitol stormed,Donald Trump",
      "text": "For almost a month, the House impeachment managers had been preparing for this day, when they brought their case against Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection at the US Capitol to a close.\nTheir presentation was as much about setting the evidence for the American public and the history books as it was convincing 67 out of 100 senators to convict. To do this, they laid out a three-part roadmap of their prosecution. \nYesterday, they tried to show how Trump provoked the attack on the Capitol, then went - step by step, in meticulous detail - through the events of that day. Today, they discussed the \"harm\" that the president has done with his words and actions - harm that, they said, went well beyond the violence of 6 January.\nHere are some key takeaways.\nOn Wednesday, the House impeachment managers tried to use Donald Trump's own words - in speeches and tweets - against him. On Thursday, the Democrats started the day citing the words of his supporters.\nThe goal was to illustrate that the group of supporters who turned from a rally crowd to a band of insurrectionists intent on storming the Capitol did so because they believed they were doing the president's bidding. Citing social media posts, recorded video and court documents, Congresswoman Diana DeGette of Colorado laid out the evidence.\n\"We were invited by the President of the United States,\" one rioter is heard shouting. Others testified that they were doing the president's bidding; that he had ordered them to the Capitol.\nThe Democratic impeachment managers had spent hours drawing a line from Trump to the riot of 6 January. Now they were drawing a line from Trump's base to that fateful day. Their next, greatest challenge will be connecting the two.\nWas the April 2020 protest at the Michigan state capitol a \"dress rehearsal\" for the January US Capitol attack, asked House impeachment manager Jamie Raskin?\nThe images certainly look strikingly familiar. An angry crowd waved Confederate flags, wore Trump-themed clothing and confronted law enforcement blocking entry into the building's legislative chambers.\nMichigan has been a hotbed of right-wing fringe movements for decades. The men behind the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, trained for a time with a Michigan-based extremist militia.\nSeveral of the individuals arrested by the FBI in October for plotting to kidnap and murder current Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer also had ties to the state's extremist movements.\n\"If we don't draw the line here, what's next?\" Raskin told the Senate when discussing the Michigan unrest last year. \"What makes you think the nightmare with Donald Trump and his law-breaking violent mobs is over?\"\nThe House impeachment managers  tried to show a pattern of escalating unrest that first took shape in Michigan, reached the heart of the US government in a matter of months and could continue to fester unless stopped.\n\"I'm not afraid [Trump] is going to run again in four years,\" Congressman Ted Lieu of California said on Thursday. \"I'm afraid he's going to run again and lose. Because he could do this again.\" \nThe House's impeachment prosecution hinges on proving that Donald Trump knowingly incited his crowd of supporters in front of the White House on 6 January to attack the Capitol and stop the joint meeting of Congress from certifying Joe Biden's election victory.\nTo prove this, they've documented the months the then-president spent convincing his followers that the November presidential election was fixed, that his victory was stolen away. They've argued that the president has a history of inciting violence, from targeting protestors at his rallies to expressing sympathy for \"both sides\" following the violent 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nIf that isn't enough to convince the Senate jurors - and the American public - Congressman Ted Lieu pointed to Trump's behaviour after the Capitol as an indication that he had no interest in forcefully condemning the violence.\nHe played clips of the two short videos the then-president released and noted that he never visited the Capitol to review the damage or pay honour to the police officer killed by the mob.\nHis silence and inaction, Liu said, spoke volumes.\n\"When you or I make a mistake and something very bad happens, we would show remorse,\" impeachment manager Ted Lieu said on Thursday. \"We would accept responsibility. President Trump didn't do any of that. Why not? Because he intended what happened on January 6.\"\nAmong the \"harms\" that the House impeachment managers said resulted from the riot at the US Capitol were not just physical and psychological, they were also damage to US security and prestige.\nCongressman Joaquin Castro detailed the documents and information that was ransacked by rioters when they stormed the Capitol. He noted that one woman allegedly tried to give a laptop from Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office to a friend to sell to Russian intelligence.\nThe damage, he said, goes beyond that, however. He quoted leaders in Russia, Iran and China celebrating what they saw as US humiliation. He also quoted allies, like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who lamented that the riot was \"shocking, deeply disturbing, and frankly saddening.\"\n\"When other countries have seen chaos, our constitution has helped keep order in America,\" Castro said. \"This is why we have a constitution. We stand up for the rule of law because the rule of law doesn't just stand up for itself.\"\nIt was a play to the Senate's sense of patriotism. Many of the senators in the room take a keen interest in foreign affairs. Twenty of them serve on the chamber's foreign relations committee. The entire Senate votes to confirm US ambassadors and ratify US treaties.\nFailure to convict Donald Trump, he concluded, would \"forfeit\" US power and diminish the nation on the world stage. Perhaps, Castro thought, the senators listening would find that concerning.\nThe central focus of Donald Trump's impeachment trial defence has been, and will continue to be, that the entire trial is invalid; that as an ex-president he is ineligible for punishments meant for presidents.\nIf that doesn't work, however, Trump's next line of defence is that he was exercising his constitutional right to free speech during his rally on the morning of the Capitol riots and in the days leading up to it.\nToward the end of the prosecution presentation, head impeachment manager Jamie Raskin - himself a constitutional law professor - attempted to respond to that defence in advance.\nHe asserted that Trump, with his speech, directed a mob to take away the free speech rights of members of Congress. He said that his conduct was an assault on the rule of law and, by extension, the entire Constitution, including the First Amendment, which protects free speech. And he repeated an analogy he made in his opening remarks on Tuesday.\nTrump's words were not like a private citizen yelling fire in a crowded theatre, he said. It was like a fire chief who directs a mob to burn down a theatre and then celebrates as the flames spread.\nHe took just a few minutes to outline his \"prebuttal\". Trump's defenders will have up to 16 hours in days ahead to make their case."

      "tags": "Rhondda,Coronavirus vaccines,Chris Bryant,Leanne Wood,Coronavirus pandemic,Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board",
      "text": "The number of vaccines supplied to Wales is expected to fall in the next few weeks, affecting some of the country's vaccination centres.\nCwm Taf Morgannwg Health Board says it is pausing vaccinations at four centres for a fortnight. Local politicians say it is because of a fall in the supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab.\nOther vaccinations centres are expected to reduce their hours.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the drop in supply had been planned for.\nThe Welsh Government said the reduction in supply would affect the whole of the UK.\nIt comes after Wales became the first UK nation on Wednesday to have given first doses to 20% of the population, after a slow start.\nThe government said it was on course to meet its mid-February target of offering a jab to the over 70s, health care workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable.\nBut officials are expecting fewer doses of the AstraZeneca jab - which has been mostly delivered in GP surgeries rather than vaccination centres - before deliveries return to recent levels from the beginning of March.\nHealth boards will determine how vaccines are delivered over the next two weeks, with mass vaccination centres changing their opening times to reflect the reduction in supply.\nHealth officials however, say they have sufficient stocks of Pfizer vaccine to significantly increase the number of second doses next week, as those who had a first dose in December are now due for their next injection.\nMr Drakeford told a Welsh Parliament committee: \"We know that we are going to get less vaccine over the next few weeks than we have over the past few weeks.\"\n\"That was planned for and known for and is accommodated in our plans which remain to complete the vaccination of those next five priority groups by the spring. \n\"So, without unforeseen barriers, we are confident that we will remain on track.\"\nHe said plans remain in place to complete vaccinations of the next five priority groups by the spring.\nMr Drakeford said the Welsh NHS \"will be focusing our Pfizer vaccine supply on the second vaccination of those people in the top four priority groups who have already had their first vaccine\".  \n\"We will be deploying the Astra Zeneca vaccine for first shots for people in the next five groups,\" he said.\n\"We will hear, I'm afraid, from people disappointed that the amount of supply they're getting is less than we've had over the last couple of weeks because we could use more. \n\"If there was more, we could use it, there's no doubt about that.\"\nThe vaccination programme will soon be targeting groups further down the priority list - with jabs due to be given to people over the age of 65 and people with underlying health conditions.\nHealth officials say the next two weeks' reduction in supply is planned for - allowing manufacturers to ramp up their production processes, which will lead to significant increases in vaccines from the start of March. \nWales is looking to deliver 103,000 more doses next week - 56,000 Astra-Zeneca vaccines will be mainly first doses and 46,000 Pfizer which will be to push on with second doses for those in the priority groups. \nAnother 108,000 doses would be given out the following week but then numbers would rise to 160,000 to 190,000 and accelerating.\nLast Sunday, Cwm Taf Morgannwg was the best performing of all health boards in giving doses to its 70 to 74-year-olds, according to Public Health Wales figures.\nThe health board's executive director Clare Williams, said the switch to the next phase of vaccination will allow a \"pause\" from 16 February \"for two weeks at our four community vaccination centres in Merthyr Tydfil, Abercynon, Rhondda and Bridgend\".\nVaccination of health and social care workers, and those aged 70-74, is now \"nearly complete,\" she said.\n\"It has always been our intention to bring vaccines as close to where people live as we possibly can.  Therefore, during this two-week pause, we will be looking at the locations of all four of our community vaccination centres (CVCs) to ensure they are in the best locations for residents.\"\nThe board hopes to expand to seven CVCs, with new centres at Aberfan Leisure Centre, Llantrisant Leisure Centre and Cynon Valley Indoor Bowls in Mountain Ash, and Maesteg Leisure Centre.\nPlaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"Transparency is key in maintaining public trust. Everyone involved in the vaccine rollout has done a fantastic job in vaccinating 20% of the Welsh population, but we need to see the flow of vaccines into the four UK nations, to have confidence that we are getting our fair share.\"\nWelsh Conservative MS Angela Burns said:  \"The Conservative UK Government - which is procuring the supplies - is confident that the steady stream of doses will continue, and this underlines the benefit of being in a strong United Kingdom that works for Wales.\"\nHuw Thomas, BBC Wales correspondent\nThe Welsh NHS has planned for reduced supplies over the coming weeks, as have health officials in other parts of the UK.\nAs a result, the news that some vaccine centres will close temporarily is no surprise to the people manning them. \nIt also comes as Wales appears to have reached its milestone of offering a vaccine to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February.\nNo appointments should be cancelled as a result of the lower doses reaching Wales, and it is not expected to impact the longer-term plan to offer a dose to the top nine priority groups by the spring.\nFrom next week the vaccine statistics will also reflect the increasing numbers of second doses being administered in Wales, as those who were among the first to be vaccinated in the weeks before Christmas are now due to begin receiving their second dose.\nStocks of the Pfizer vaccine will be prioritised for second doses in the coming weeks, ensuring nobody faces a delay in receiving their full immunisation.\nA Welsh Government spokesman said: \"We have factored this into our plans and it will not affect people's appointments or delay when people are due to get their second dose.\n\"The supply of vaccines is expected to ramp up significantly from the beginning of March. \n\"Every dose of vaccine we receive will continue to be delivered immediately to all those who need it. Our vaccination teams continue to do an incredible job to vaccinate everyone as quickly as possible.\"\nThe UK government spokesman said: \"We are confident that the steady, regular supply of doses will continue to support the vaccine rollout in the weeks ahead. \n\"If you get called for a vaccine, please continue go to your appointment.\""

      "tags": "Asia,Japan",
      "text": "The head of the Tokyo Olympics organising committee has resigned after he was criticised for making \"inappropriate\" remarks about women.\nYoshiro Mori, 83, was quoted as saying women talk too much and that meetings with many female board directors would \"take a lot of time\".\nThe remarks set off a firestorm of protest and Mr Mori apologised at the time but said he would not resign.\nBut on Friday he apologised for his \"inappropriate statement\".\n\"What is important is to hold the Olympics from July. It must not be the case that my presence becomes an obstacle to that,\" he said at a special committee meeting on Friday, where he also announced his resignation. \nIt is not immediately clear who will replace Mr Mori, a former Japanese prime minister. He had initially selected well-known sports administrator Saburo Kawabuchi, 84, to replace him but this also led to protests. \nThe resignation came as pressure mounted on him over the past week. Major sponsors came forward to criticise his comments, including Toyota, one of the biggest Olympic backers.\nToyota's president Akio Toyoda said the company was \"disappointed\".\nOn Tuesday, a group of female lawmakers wore white in a protest against his remarks, with some men doing the same in solidarity. \nAnd Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said she would not attend a meeting of high-level Olympic officials in protest. \nAccording to local media, almost 400 people have also withdrawn applications to volunteer at the Olympic games, which are scheduled for later this year. \nThe committee board currently has 24 members, five of whom are women. In 2019, the committee - which is responsible for selecting Japanese Olympians - set itself a goal of increasing the number of female board directors to 40%.\n\"If we increase the number of female board members, we have to make sure their speaking time is restricted somewhat, they have difficulty finishing, which is annoying,\" Mr Mori was quoted as saying. \n\"We have about seven women at the organising committee, but everyone understands their place.\"\nMr Mori is known in the country for a string of gaffes and undiplomatic statements made while in office from 2000 to 2001.\nHe told Japan's Mainichi newspaper that female family members had also lambasted him after his comments.\n\"Last night, my wife gave me a thorough scolding. She said: 'You've said something bad again, haven't you? I'm going to have to suffer again because you've antagonised women',\" he said.\n\"This morning, my daughter and granddaughter scolded me as well,\" the paper quoted him as saying."
